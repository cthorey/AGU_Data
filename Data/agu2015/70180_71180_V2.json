            "abstract": "Recent spacecraft measurements from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) radar, thermal infrared, and high-resolution imagery have been used to identify a region on the lunar far side that exhibits unusually high rock abundance and is covered by smooth deposits (Bandfield et al., 2011, 2015; Robinson et al., 2011, 2015). Further investigation of the region, centered at 42.5ºN, 167.5ºE, reveals three distinct regional morphologies. The first, flat deposits referred to as “ponds,” occur in depressions such as crater bottoms; the second, a veneer with apparent viscous flow-like features, is regionally widespread but thickest in the interior of craters on the slopes above ponds; the third, which is most apparent in the Diviner Rock Abundance dataset, is rubble or rocky material that tends to occur preferentially on the upper slopes of craters within a specific range of azimuths. Although the region is host to a variety of features that suggest the presence of previously fluid material (e.g., equipotential pond surfaces, lobate-like flows), there is no clear source for volcanic activity in the region. Previous studies have suggested these deposits are from relatively young impact melts, with Tycho crater (located at the antipode to the deposits of interest) being the most likely source (Robinson et al., 2015). Here, we use the Diviner Rock Abundance data paired with NAC DEMs to evaluate the local extent of the three rock morphologies observed in the region. We then use this data to create an impact-heating model, taking into account the efficiency of heating for a range of slopes, which describes the distribution of materials in a regional context. Our model results provide sufficient evidence that melting and subsequent fluid flow was possible over the timescales required for material to arrive from the Tycho impact. Furthermore, the model predicts flow to have occurred over discrete areas within the Tycho antipode region, which is confirmed by observations.",

            "abstract": "A giant planet-encircling storm occurred on Saturn on Dec. 5th, 2010 at planetographic latitude 37.7 N. It produced intense lightning, created enormous cloud disturbances and wrapped around the planet in 6 months. Six such storms, called Great White Spots, have erupted since 1876. They have alternated between mid-latitudes and the equator at intervals ranging from 20 to 30 years. The reason for the intermittent explosion is not clear and there are no similar storms on brother Jupiter. Here we describe the water-loading mechanism, which could suppress moist convection for decades due to the larger molecular weight of water in a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. We show that this mechanism requires the deep water vapor mixing ratio to be greater than 1.0%, which implies O/H at least 10 times the solar value. Observations imply that Saturn’s atmosphere is more enriched in water than Jupiter, which could explain why Saturn has such storms and Jupiter does not. We further use a two-dimensional axisymmetric dynamic model and a top-cooling convective adjustment scheme to connect our theory to observation. We show that for a deep water vapor mixing ratio of 1.1%, the ammonia vapor is depleted down to 6 bars, the tropospheric warming is ~6 K, and the interval between two consecutive storms at one latitude is ~70 years. These values are consistent with observations.",

            "abstract": "The conditions under which the governing equation for non-equilibrium one-dimensional bedload sediment transport in unsteady flows is scale-invariant and self-similar are examined by applying the one-parameter Lie group of point scaling transformations. Self-similarity conditions imposed due to initial and boundary conditions are also examined. Furthermore, one-parameter Lie group point scaling transformations required to physically scale the transport process without scaling the sediment material properties are investigated. Under Lie group scaling, the unsteady bedload sediment transport process, as an initial-boundary value problem in the prototype domain, can be self-similar with that of a variety of scaled spatial and temporal domains. By applying the Lie group scaling method to the Saint-Venant equations as well as the governing equation for one-dimensional non-equilibrium bedload sediment transport, a simplified approach to bedload sediment transport modeling is created. The proposed scaling approach carries the advantage of identifying the self-similarity conditions due to the initial and boundary conditions of the IBVP along with those due to the governing equations, expanding scaling of sediment transport to unsteady, non-equilibrium conditions.",

Goals of this student-run project include: 1) To monitor the rocky intertidal habitat and develop a baseline database of invertebrates and algal density and abundance; 2) To contribute to the conservation of the rocky intertidal habitat through education of students and visitors about intertidal species; 3) To increase stewardship in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary; and 4) To contribute abundance and population data on key algae and invertebrate species to the national database, LiMPETS (Long Term Monitoring Program & Experiential Training for Students). Each fall student volunteers complete an intensive training course on the natural history of intertidal invertebrates and algae, identification of key species, rocky intertidal monitoring techniques, and history of the sanctuary. Students identify and count key invertebrate and algae species along two permanent transects and, using randomly determined points, within two permanent 200 m2 areas, in fall, winter, and late spring. Using data from the previous years, we will compare population densities, seasonal abundance and long-term population trends of key algal and invertebrate species, including Tegula funebralis, Anthopluera elegantissima, Cladophora sp. and Fucus sp.. Future analyses and investigations will include intertidal abiotic factors (including water temperature, pH and human foot-traffic) to enhance insights into the Duxbury Reef ecosystem, in particular, the high and mid-intertidal zones experiencing the greatest amount of human impacts.",

            "abstract": "We present seismic velocity structure of the sediment section seaward of the Cascadia Subduction Zone deformation front (DF), derived from multichannel seismic data acquired during the 2012 Juan de Fuca Ridge to Trench experiment. Detailed velocity analyses are conducted on every 100th prestack-time-migrated common reflection point gather (625 m spacing) within 45 km seaward of the DF along two ridge-to-trench transects offshore Oregon at 44.6˚N and Washington at 47.4˚N respectively, and on every 200th common mid-point gather (1250 m spacing) along a ~400 km-long trench-parallel transect ~15 km from the DF. We observe a landward increase of sediment velocity starting from ~15-20 km from the DF on both Oregon and Washington transects, which may result from increased horizontal compressive tectonic stress within the accretionary wedge and thermally induced dehydration processes in the sediment column. Although the velocity of near-basement sediments at 30 km from the DF is similar (~3.1 km/s) on both transects, the velocity increases are larger on the Washington transect, to ~4.0 km/s beneath the DF (sediment thickness ~3.2 km), than on the Oregon transect, to ~3.6 km/s beneath the DF (sediment thickness ~3.5 km). The long-wavelength sediment velocity structure on the trench-parallel transect confirms this regional difference in deep sediment velocity and also highlights variations related to a group of WNW-trending strike-slip faults along the margin. Offshore Washington, where higher sediment velocity seaward of the DF is observed, the accretionary wedge is wide with a decollement located close to the basement and landward-verging thrust faults. By contrast, offshore Oregon, the lower sediment velocity seaward of the DF is associated with a narrow accretionary wedge, a shallow decollement ~1 km above the basement, and seaward-verging thrust faults. The regional differences in deep sediment velocity may be related to the along-strike variation in sediment composition, esp. clay mineral content, which may modulate the pore fluid pressure in the sediment through dehydration reactions, and affect the mechanical properties of the accretionary wedge further landward.",

            "abstract": "Some numerical and experimental simulations suggest that precession might supply enough power to influence planetary dynamos. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the Earth’s orbital motion and variations of the geomagnetic field intensity, would open interesting perspective for modelling the past and future geomagnetic field behaviour and its eventual relationships to past and future orbitally constrained, climatic changes. Although pristine geomagnetic signals can be extracted by filtering and stacking multiple normalized intensity records, the reconstruction of high resolution geomagnetic field variations still raises questions. Namely, significant variance at orbital frequencies in relative paleointensity (RPI) records are generally considered as clues of residual contamination by paleoclimatically induced variations of magnetic carriers size ranges or mineralogy. Such questions can be adressed using other indicators of the geomagnetic dipole moment variation, such as the cosmogenic production modulated by the magnetospheric shielding. During the MAGORB project (ANR-09-BLAN-053-001) cosmogenic nuclide geochemistry, d18O, and paleomagnetic records were constructed along thick clayey-carbonate sequences deposited in the equatorial pacific and indian oceans over the last million of years. Authigenic 10Be/9Be ratio and RPI variations generally exhibit similar ranges of oscillations. However significant offsets appear between some RPI lows and their corresponding 10Be/9Be peaks, suggesting delayed lock-in of the remanent magnetization. After transfer on time scales the new geomagnetic moment series can be compared with the PISO-1500 and SINT-2000 stacks, and with the 10Be ice core record of EPICA Dome C. These new authigenic 10Be/9Be ratio records provide new opportunities to: 1) assess the validity of high resolution RPI records, 2) evaluate address the question of the presence of orbital periods in the paleo-field geomagnetic spectrum, and 3) to precise dipole moment rates of changes before and after the dipole moment reductions linked with excursion and polarity reversals.",

            "abstract": "We present biogenic silica (BSi) data as a proxy for primary productivity in three cores from the Luiche Platform region of Lake Tanganyika. We also present complementary sedimentary records of the nitrogen and organic carbon isotopes. Preliminary analysis of the BSi data suggests that in two cores located at approximately 100 meters, productivity began to decline at approximately 1700 CE with an initial plateau at roughly 1800 CE. Since approximately 1800 CE, the sedimentary biogenic silica contents vary, but are generally lower than in the earlier portions of the record. These observations are consistent with prior work; however, our results suggest that the decline in primary production may have occurred earlier at these shallower sites than previously inferred for a deeper core (Tierney et al., 2010). This different response between the shallower sites and deeper off shore sites may be driven by differences in nutrient supply, spatial variability, or some other factor. Sedimentary nitrogen isotope data generally show an inverse relationship to the BSi data in the shallower cores. One possible interpretation of this inverse relationship is that there is a shift in the source of the primary nitrogen being utilized within the photic zone, with a larger contribution of nitrogen fixation occurring during times of lower productivity and a larger contribution of upwelled nitrogen occurring during times of higher productivity.\nTierney, J.E., M.M.

Following now-defunct SeaWiFS and aging MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS can potentially extend our time series, which is critical for our understanding of ocean biological processes and how they are changing. Using in situ data to correct biases in satellite observations and data assimilation to remove sampling bias, we are able to construct consistent time series of ocean color data from 1998 to 2012. From this record, we found that global chlorophyll concentrations exhibited no change, but regional declines, concentrated in the northern hemisphere oceans, were apparent. Further, these declines were due to decreasing trends in diatoms, as a function of decreasing mixed layer depth. Applying similar methodologies to VIIRS, we hope to utilize this new sensor’s capability to understand if the trends previously observed are changing.",

For this to be achieved, however, requires the observations to have sub-ppm systematic errors; the large data density of OCO-2 generally means that random errors will be of lesser importance in terms of regional scale fluxes. In this presentation we report on results from the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) algorithm as applied to the first year of OCO-2 observations, with a particular focus on filtering and bias-correction of the OCO-2 data “Nadir” and “Glint” mode data. In general, we find the random errors to be low (0.5-2.0 ppm), especially for ocean glint retrievals, consistent with the higher signal-to-noise ratio and reduced effects of aerosols over ocean. Systematic errors are explored via comparison to TCCON, low-variability southern hemisphere data, and data taken over small spatial regions. These are used to form a multi-linear bias correction, similar that that implemented for ACOS/GOSAT observations. Additionally we present comparisons of the first year of bias-corrected OCO-2 observations to inverse model output. This comparison will shed light on potential retrieval biases still lurking in the OCO-2 data, such as from surface albedo, aerosol effects, and other error sources.",

These connections motivate the need for understanding environmental influences beyond tropical rainforest land uptake. It is critically important to investigate connections between the current sensitivity of semi-arid ecosystems to climate as to discern future trends in the strength of the land sink for anthropogenic CO2. To better inform future projections of carbon balance in earth system models (ESMs), we used a set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) ESMs to investigate trends and partitioning of recent CO2 uptake (1980-2005) from tropical and subtropical regions. We quantified model-to-model differences in net biome productivity (NBP) over semi-arid and tropical regions as well as the sensitivity of NBP to temperature and drought stress for each landcover type. Our results revealed a large spread in NBP among models and between regions. We compared our findings to reanalysis and in situ observations to develop benchmarks for global models and to further probe model-driver relationships in order to constrain long-term projections.",

            "abstract": "Accretion is a complex process, the details of which cannot be resolved seismically. Well-exposed ancient examples offer a better opportunity. This study focuses on two areas with nearly 100% exposure: glaciated exposures of the Torlesse near Arthur’s Pass, New Zealand and stream-cut exposures of the Franciscan Eastern Belt in Grindstone and Thomes Creeks, California. Rocks are mainly turbidites of prehnite-pumpellyite to lower blueschist grade, described as “broken formation” with no melange or exotic blocks present.\nThe dominant structural features are steeply dipping beds cut by thrust faults oriented at a modest angle to bedding. Fault spacing ranges from ~100 to 600 meters with the angle between bedding and faults usually ranging from 0° to 35°. Between faults, bedding continuity, though locally disrupted, is generally well-preserved. Deformation associated with the faults is variable. In some cases, fault contacts are sharp and show little deformation of adjacent beds. In other cases, small folds, boudinage, and intense fracturing and veining define fault zones. Intensity of deformation varies along the fault plane and is commonly more intense on one side than the other. Of note are two additional faults present in the Thomes Creek area; they are out-of-sequence thrusts (OOST’s) that cross-cut the other faults at high angles and are associated with a greater degree of deformation. Aside from these OOST’s, deformation associated with the faults is roughly an order of magnitude less than that described in the literature for “megathrusts.”\nThe faults described above (excluding the OOST’s) represent primary surfaces along which “packets” of relatively intact rocks were accreted. This study and others show that these fault-bounded packets can be traced along strike for a few km to at least 10 km or more where not cut by OOST’s or younger faults. The faults appear to form after a period of diffuse, largely extensional shear in semi-consolidated sediments; as rigidity increases, shear becomes localized along fault surfaces. It is inferred that this process is driven by a plate boundary megathrust located some distance structurally below the accreted packets. Such megathrusts may be rarely preserved as they have not been observed in the areas studied.",

            "abstract": "As isotope ratio precisions have improved to as low as ±1 ppm, geochronologic precision has remained essentially unchanged. This largely reflects the nature of radioactivity whereby the parent decays into a different chemical species thus putting as much emphasis on the determining inter-element ratios as isotopic. Even the best current accuracy grows into errors of >0.6 m.y. during the Paleozoic – a span of time equal to ¼ of the Pleistocene. If we are to understand the nature of Paleozoic species variation and climate change at anything like the Cenozoic, we need a 10x improvement in accuracy. The good news is that there is no physical impediment to realizing this. There are enough Pb* atoms in the outer few μm’s of a Paleozoic zircon grown moments before eruption to permit ±0.01% accuracy in the U-Pb system. What we need are the resources to synthesize the spikes, enhance ionization yields, exploit microscale sampling, and improve knowledge of λ correspondingly. Despite advances in geochronology over the past 40 years (multicollection, multi-isotope spikes, in situ dating), our ability to translate a daughter atom into a detected ion has remained at the level of 1% or so. This means that a ~102 increase in signal can be achieved before we approach a physical limit. Perhaps the most promising approach is use of broad spectrum lasers that can ionize all neutrals. Radical new approaches to providing mass separation of such signals are emerging, including trapped ion cyclotron resonance and multi-turn, sputtered neutral TOF spectrometers capable of mass resolutions in excess of 105. These innovations hold great promise in geochronology but are largely being developed for cosmochemistry. This may make sense at first glance as cosmochemists are classically atom-limited (IDPs, stardust) but can be a misperception as the outer few μm’s of a zircon may represent no more mass than a stardust mote. To reach the fundamental limits of geochronologic signals we need to look past the seeming macroscopic nature of our samples to the truly microscopic domains that hold the key temporal information and pursue transcendental approaches to detecting every daughter atom. The central role that geochronology plays in all aspects of historical geology potentially makes the vast majority of Earth scientists our partners in this endeavor.",

            "abstract": "Population-based random stratified sampling of the city of Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico provided 500 city blocks for study. We collected soil from the public space (where present) in front of each house on a selected block; equal measured small volumes of these were combined to produce a composite sample for analysis. Such composite samples (1) decrease, by an order of magnitude, laboratory processing and analysis costs, and (2) smooth the data to represent blocks as averages of individual houses. Retention of the unanalyzed samples of the individual houses permits their later analysis should the composites suggest further study of individual houses on an anomalous block. Elemental analysis of 10 mg pressed powders was performed on a Panalytical Epsilon5 EDS-XRF, via 8 secondary targets and 12 USGS and NIST multi-element rock standards.\nThe mean and (range) of concentration for Pb was 43 (13-550) ppm; for Cr, 31 (1.8-76); for Cu, 22 (6-550); for Zn 84 (42-415) ppm; for Cd, 1.9 (0.1-6.2); and for Sb, 5.9 (2.7-29). The old urban core of Cd. Juarez was marked by high levels of Pb, Cr, Cu, and Zn, and, to a smaller degree, of Cd and Sb. This pattern mirrors that of contiguous El Paso, Texas, USA, directly across the narrow Rio Grande. Businesses, industrial facilities, transportation (both railroads and highways), traditional “downtown” shopping, and old residential districts cluster in this urban core. A Pb-Cu-Zn smelter, which operated for more than a century until 1999, is present in the US adjacent to the Rio Grande, about two km away from downtown Cd. Juarez. Thus the city has been subject to both traditional metal sources (e.g., leaded gasoline, highway debris) and smelter emissions.\n The poplation of Cd. Juarez has exploded in the last few decades to some 1.5 million inhabitants due both to natural growth and in-migration from rural districts for economic opportunity. Most of this growth has been accommodated by radial expansion of the city into the surrounding desert. Metals pollution in these newer areas is much lower than in the city core due to their distance from legacy, traditional, and ongoing sources. Thus there is a strong risk gradient for exposure to heavy metals from contaminated soil from the higher levels in the city core to the lower levels in newer residential neighborhoods.\nNIEHS Grant 1RO1-ES11367",

            "abstract": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, earth scientists came to understand the magnitude and power of geological and geophysical processes. In comparison, the activities of humans seemed paltry if not insignificant. With the development of radiometric dating in the 20th century, scientists realized that human history was but a miniscule part of Earth history. Metaphors to this effect abounded, and filled textbooks: If Earth history were a 24-hour day, human history would not occupy even the final second. If Earth history were a yardstick, the human portion would not even be visible to the naked eye. Generations of scientists were taught that one of the principal contributions of geology, qua science, was the demonstration of our insignificance. The Anthropocene concept disrupts this. To affirms its existence is to insist that human activities compete in scale and significance with other Earth processes, and may threaten to overwhelm them. It also inverts our relation to normative claims. For more than a century earth scientists and evolutionary biologists insisted that their theories were descriptive and not normative—that there was no moral conclusion to be drawn from either planetary or human evolution. Now, we confront the suggestion that there is a moral component to our new paradigm: we can scarcely claim that humans are disrupting the climate, destroying biodiversity, and acidifying the oceans without implying that there is something troubling about these developments. Thus, the Anthropocene concept suggests both a radical redefinition of the scope of Earth science, and a radical reconsideration of the place of normative judgments in scientific work.",

            "abstract": "Key questions with implications for seismic hazard and industry practice are how large injection-induced earthquakes can be, and whether their maximum size is smaller than for similarly located tectonic earthquakes. Deterministic limits on induced earthquake magnitudes have been proposed based on the size of the reservoir or the volume of fluid injected. McGarr (JGR 2014) showed that for earthquakes confined to the reservoir and triggered by pore-pressure increase, the maximum moment should be limited to the product of the shear modulus G and total injected volume ΔV. However, if induced earthquakes occur on tectonic faults oriented favorably with respect to the tectonic stress field, then they may be limited only by the regional tectonics and connectivity of the fault network, with an absolute maximum magnitude that is notoriously difficult to constrain.\nA common approach for tectonic earthquakes is to use the magnitude-frequency distribution of smaller earthquakes to forecast the largest earthquake expected in some time period. In this study, we show that the largest magnitudes observed at fluid injection sites are consistent with the sampling statistics of the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) distribution for tectonic earthquakes, with no assumption of an intrinsic upper bound. The GR law implies that the largest observed earthquake in a sample should scale with the log of the total number induced. We find that the maximum magnitudes at most sites are consistent with this scaling, and that maximum magnitude increases with log ΔV. We find little in the size distribution to distinguish induced from tectonic earthquakes. That being said, the probabilistic estimate exceeds the deterministic GΔV cap only for expected magnitudes larger than ~M6, making a definitive test of the models unlikely in the near future. In the meantime, however, it may be prudent to treat the hazard from induced earthquakes with the same probabilistic machinery used for tectonic earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "This work describes a methodology used for large scale modeling of wave propagation from underground chemical explosions conducted at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) fractured granitic rock. We show that the discrete natures of rock masses as well as the spatial variability of the fabric of rock properties are very important to understand ground motions induced by underground explosions. In order to build a credible conceptual model of the subsurface we integrated the geological, geomechanical and geophysical characterizations conducted during recent test at the NNSS as well as historical data from the characterization during the underground nuclear test conducted at the NNSS. Because detailed site characterization is limited, expensive and, in some instances, impossible we have numerically investigated the effects of the characterization gaps on the overall response of the system. We performed several computational studies to identify the key important geologic features specific to fractured media mainly the joints characterized at the NNSS. We have also explored common key features to both geological environments such as saturation and topography and assess which characteristics affect the most the ground motion in the near-field and in the far-field. Stochastic representation of these features based on the field characterizations has been implemented into LLNL’s Geodyn-L hydrocode. Simulations were used to guide site characterization efforts in order to provide the essential data to the modeling community. We validate our computational results by comparing the measured and computed ground motion at various ranges for the recently executed SPE4 prime experiment. We have also conducted a comparative study between SPE4 prime and previous experiments SPE1 and SPE3 to assess similarities and differences and draw conclusions on designing SPE5.",

            "abstract": "James Hansen has cautioned the scientific community against “reticence,” by which he means a reluctance to speak in public about the threat of climate change. This may contribute to social inaction, with the result that society fails to respond appropriately to threats that are well understood scientifically. Against this, others have warned against the dangers of “crying wolf,” suggesting that reticence protects scientific credibility.\nWe argue that both these positions are missing an important point: that reticence is not only a matter of style but also of substance. In previous work, Bysse et al. (2013) showed that scientific projections of key indicators of climate change have been skewed towards the low end of actual events, suggesting a bias in scientific work. More recently, we have shown that scientific efforts to be responsive to contrarian challenges have led scientists to adopt the terminology of a “pause” or “hiatus” in climate warming, despite the lack of evidence to support such a conclusion (Lewandowsky et al., 2015a. 2015b). In the former case, scientific conservatism has led to under-estimation of climate related changes. In the latter case, the use of misleading terminology has perpetuated scientific misunderstanding and hindered effective communication.\nScientific communication should embody two equally important goals: 1) accuracy in communicating scientific information and 2) efficacy in expressing what that information means. Scientists should strive to be neither conservative nor adventurous but to be accurate, and to communicate that accurate information effectively.",

            "abstract": "Ice sheets are primarily drained by outlet glaciers and ice streams that transport mass from the inland to the ocean. Determining mass loss from the ice sheets is particularly important for calculating future sea level rise. Currently, dynamic ice loss is not included in the prediction of future sea levels, due to the uncertain response of outlet glaciers to climatic perturbations. It is therefore crucial to understand how different types of glaciers respond to changes at their boundaries.\nOutlet glaciers can be categorized based on their geometry and the mechanisms that drive fast flow. Ice streams are wide with a small surface slope, flow fast despite low driving stress and have little basal drag. Isbrae on the other hand are narrow with a steep surface slope and large driving stress. Between these two end members fall a variety of mixed-type glaciers.\nWe investigate the response of different types of Antarctic outlet glaciers to perturbation scenarios with a flow line model. The effect of reduction in basal drag due to increased sliding, changes in surface accumulation, an increase in submarine melting around the grounding zone, a lower back force at the terminus, and a decrease in lateral drag on glacier stability are explored. \nPreliminary results indicate that a short-term increase in basal sliding (e.g. from lake discharge events), or increased surface accumulation rates have little impact on the ice flow and the glacier's stability, whereas ice shelf thinning or a reduction in back force result in an immediate response of the outlet glacier. In these cases, a new stable position with an increased but constant ice discharge is obtained soon.",

            "abstract": "Anammox is now recognized as a globally important process that may rival denitrification in its removal of inorganic N from aquatic systems. Owing to its fairly recent discovery, however, measurements of anammox in coastal environments are sparse. This study measured the N removal processes, denitrification and anammox, in a seagrass ecosystem in New South Wales, Australia, using a modified version of the isotope pairing technique. This previously published method has yet to be applied to seagrass environments and relies on the measurement of both N2O and N2 to calculate rates of anammox and denitrification. Intact sediment cores were incubated under in situ conditions and amended with 15N-NO3- as a tracer. The role of organic C quality in controlling N removal rates was evaluated through addition of seagrass or phytoplankton detritus. In control cores (i.e., no C addition), the total N removal rate was 0.48 ± 0.22 μmol N m-2 h-1. These are among the lowest rates measured in seagrasses and other coastal areas. N removal rates were stimulated when seagrass detritus was added (3.3 times higher than control) whereas the addition of phytoplankton detritus did not stimulate N removal. This is surprising, as phytoplankton detritus is generally a more labile C source than seagrass detritus. These results indicate that the microbial community responds more quickly to organic matter they are conditioned to process. Regardless of C treatment, anammox made up a greater proportion of N2 production (71 ± 16%) than denitrification (24 ± 13%), in contrast to most other studies. The high proportion of anammox-derived N2 production implies that previous N removal rates measured in other systems without anammox inclusion could be significantly underestimated.",

            "abstract": "The Los Alamos Seismic Network (LASN) has operated for 43 years, providing data to locate more than 2,500 earthquakes in north-central New Mexico. Roughly 1-2 earthquakes are detected and located per month within about 150 km of Los Alamos, a total of over 900 from 1973 to present. LASN’s primary purpose is to monitor seismicity close to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for seismic hazards; monitoring seismicity associated with the nearby Valles Caldera is secondary. Until 2010 the network was focused on monitoring seismic hazards and comprised only 7 stations, all near LANL or in the nearby Jemez Mountains. Just one station—PER, installed in 1998—was close enough to Valles Caldera to be able to detect microearthquakes located in or near the caldera. An initial study of the data from station PER between 1998 and 2002 identified and located 13 events with magnitudes less than 0.5 using the single-station hodogram technique. Those events were all located south of the caldera within a few kilometers of PER. Recently, two new digital broadband stations were installed inside the caldera, one on a northeastern ring-fracture dome, station CDAB, and the other on a northwestern dome, station SAMT. Also, station PER was upgraded with digital broadband instrumentation. Thus, LASN now can detect and record microearthquakes as small as magnitude –1.5 near the caldera, and they can be located using multiple arrival times. Several recent events located near station SAMT on the caldera’s ring fracture are the first that have been seen in that area. Additional events were recorded (by all three stations) and located in the area south of the caldera where the earlier hodogram-only events were located. These new multi-station event recordings allow a more quantitative assessment of the uncertainties in the initial single-station hodogram locations. Each event is located using multiple arrival times as well as the hodogram method at as many as three stations. Thus, improvements can be made to the microearthquake locations for the time period before the additional stations were available. Comparisons of the results obtained with these two approaches will be shown and possible implications for the caldera-related origin of these events will be discussed. Public release of LASN data can be granted on a case-by-case basis.",

            "abstract": "As arctic terrestrial ecosystems comprise about one-third of the global terrestrial ecosystem carbon total, understanding arctic carbon cycling and the feedback of terrestrial carbon pools to accelerated warming is an issue of global concern. For this research, we examined above- and belowground carbon stocks in a larch-dominated catchment underlain by yedoma and located within the Kolyma River watershed in northeastern Siberia. We quantified carbon stocks in vegetation, active layer, and permafrost, and we assessed the correlation between plant and active layer carbon pools and four environmental correlates — slope, solar insolation, canopy density, and leaf area index ­— at 20 sites. Carbon in the active layer was approximately four times greater than aboveground carbon pools (972 g C m-2), and belowground carbon to 1 m depth was approximately 18 times greater than aboveground carbon pools. Canopy density and slope had a robust positive association with aboveground carbon pools, and soil moisture was positively related to %C in organic, thawed mineral and permafrost soil. Thaw depth was negatively correlated with moss cover and larch biomass, highlighting the importance of vegetation and surface characteristics on permafrost carbon vulnerability. These data suggest that landscape and ecosystem characteristics affect carbon accumulation and storage, but they also play an important role in stabilizing permafrost carbon pools.",

The sources of this plasma can be determined from the charge state of the ions. Ionospheric-originating ions will have low charge states (i.e., O+ and O2+), whereas solar wind-originating ions will have high charge states (i.e., O6+). The distributions of these ions have previously been explored using observations from CAMMICE/MICS onboard Polar. In this study we characterize these prior observations via an empirical model of oxygen charge state distributions in the magnetosphere of Earth for variations in Kp, Vsw Bz, and AE in both L-shell and magnetic local time.

Improving model simulations of three dimensional aerosol fields in the remote Arctic region will therefore lead to improved projections of the climate change caused by aerosol emissions. In this study, we investigate how different physical parameterizations in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) influence the simulated vertical distribution of Arctic aerosols. We design experiments to test the sensitivity of the simulated aerosol fields to perturbations of selected aerosol process-related parameters in the Modal Aerosol Module with seven lognormal modes (MAM7), such as those govern aerosol aging, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging, aerosol hygroscopicity and so on. The simulations are compared with observed aerosol vertical distributions and total optical depth to assess model performance and quantify uncertainties associated with these model parameterizations. Observations applied here include Arctic aircraft measurements of black carbon and sulfate vertical profiles, along with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) optical depth measurements. We also assess the utility of using High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) measurements from the ARM Barrow site to infer vertical profiles of aerosol extinction. The sensitivity study explored here will provide guidance for optimizing global aerosol simulations. ",

            "abstract": "Most pores hosting hydrocarbon in mudrocks are at the nanometer to tens of nanometer scale. However, observational evidence shows that natural and induced fractures which govern the permeability of mudrocks appear to be spaced at centimeter scale or greater. The mismatch in scales raises the question of how the hydrocarbons in the nanopores can gain access to the induced hydraulic fracture systems. To answer the question, we experimentally induced fractures on core-scale samples, and characterized microstructure around the stimulated fracture networks and in the surrounding, unfractured rock matrix. Confined compressive strength tests were performed on preserved core plugs from the Eagle Ford shale and a siliceous, oil-bearing mudrock from the northern Rocky Mountains. Dried, ground specimens were collected from before-test (intact) and after-test (failed) samples. Their pore structure was analyzed by N2/CO2 gas adsorption, which together can measure pore diameters between 0.35 and 300 nm. Adsorption data shows a Type IV N2 isotherm and a Type I CO2 isotherm. The hysteresis loop in the N2 adsorption curve indicates the presence of slit-shaped pores. Failed siliceous samples exhibit higher overall N2 and CO2 adsorbed gas amount compared with the intact samples, indicating a wide range increase of nanoporosity. Eagle Ford samples, however, show no significant change in adsorbed gas amount. We determined pore size distributions (PSDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The N2 PSDs of the siliceous samples appear to be bimodal, with a peak around 1 nm pore size, while the N2 PSDs of the Eagle Ford samples is unimodal. Comparison of intact and failed samples reveals no significant change in pore volume for Eagle Ford samples. The siliceous samples, in contrast, increase their nanopore volume (1-100 nm pore diameter) after fracturing. The increased nanoporosity may result from microcracks that develop in the matrix surrounding the main fractures that connect nano-scale pores. These microcrack networks could shorten the flow pathway of hydrocarbons from nanopores into the main fractures, and enhance the hydrocarbon production efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Quasi-periodic whistler mode emissions (QP) are electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of a few hundred Hz to a few kHz observed in the inner magnetosphere that exhibit a periodic time modulation (tens of seconds to many minutes) of the wave intensity. These waves were first detected at high latitude ground based stations, but have also been detected by a number of spacecraft, including the twin Van Allen Probes. The Van Allen Probes include the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) Waves instrument. EMFISIS Waves simultaneously measures the vector wave magnetic field and the vector wave electric field in a continuous survey mode (typically with a 6 second cadence) along with a number of different burst modes to provide high time resolution waveforms (35,000 samples per second). These two modes allow a systematic survey of the occurrence of the QP waves and an investigation into any small scale structure of these emissions. By measuring all six wave components simultaneously, the wave propagation parameters, such as the wave normal angle and Poynting vector, of these plasma wave emissions are also obtained. A statistical survey of the occurrence and properties of the QP emissions detected by the Van Allen Probes has been performed. QP emissions have been detected at all Magnetic Local Times (MLT) and at all magnetic latitudes that Van Allen Probes sampled (-20o to +20o). The emissions are usually observed as either QP emissions which rise out of a band of hiss (QP hiss risers) or as QP emissions observed in a frequency band (QP bands), either separated from lower frequency hiss or detected when no hiss is present. The QP emissions have periods ranging from ~1 to 16 minutes, with most being around 2 to 4 minutes. Most QP events were detected for less than 1 hour, though some lasted for over 6 hours, and many were detected on successive orbits as the spacecraft returned to the same region of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, many events were detected by both spacecraft at the same time, even during large spacecraft separations, suggesting global events. These joint Van Allen Probes observations, along with simultaneous observations by other spacecraft such as Cluster and joint ground observations provide an opportunity to investigate the source and propagation properties of these waves.",

FIRST was initially developed for measuring the far-infrared portion of Earth’s longwave spectrum as a balloon borne instrument and later was reconfigured to operate as a ground-based instrument. In its current ground-based configuration FIRST was deployed at 17500 ft on Cerro Toco, a mountain in the Atacama Desert of Chile, from August to October, 2009. There the integrated precipitable water (IPW) was as low as 0.02 cm. FIRST measurements from days with IPW between 0.024 and 0.035 cm during the campaign are presented here between 200 cm-1 and 800 cm-1. Significant spectral development in the far-IR is observed over the entire 200 cm-1 to 800 cm-1 band. Water vapor and temperature profiles from radiosonde and GVRP measurements are used as inputs to the AER Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM) utilizing the AER v3.2 line parameter database. Uncertainties in both the measured and modeled radiances are accounted for in this study. The residual LBLRTM – FIRST is calculated to assess agreement between the measured and modeled spectra. Measured and model radiances generally agree to within the combined uncertainties for wavenumbers greater than 360 cm-1. At wavenumbers less than 360 cm-1 persistent troughs in the residual are present outside of the combined uncertainties. These features are present on different days and at different water vapor amounts. Possible solutions for these features are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The origin of forces for generating deep earthquakes (>300 km depth) remains elusive. Published models for generating down-dip compressional stresses within the down-going slabs have potential problems to explain first order characteristics of deep earthquakes. These include: 1) stress magnitudes are too low compared to seismically implied pre-earthquake stress levels, 2) those based on slab buoyancy structures counter-act the subduction-facilitating slab pull force, inconsistent with the fact that most deep earthquakes occur within fast-subducting slabs, 3) fail to explain the maximum seismicity rate at ~600 km depth, and 4) inconsistent with depth-discontinuity of earthquake distribution within warm slabs (e.g., S. America), and the occurrence of outboard (e.g., Tonga) and isolated (e.g., Spain) deep earthquakes. A potential reason for these problems is because all the published models consider only the present-day snapshot of slabs, while in reality the past history of subduction may affect the present slab stress state significantly.\nWe propose a new mechanical model that considers the slab stress evolution during the entire history of subduction. The key mechanism of our model is shear strain accumulation between the crust and mantle lithosphere caused by differential volume changes during phase transformations as a slab sinks. This generates increasing down-dip compression inside the slab with depth, consistent with the global distribution of deep earthquake focal mechanisms. Using experimentally calibrated slab rheology, we show that the estimated distribution of slab internal stress agrees well with the peak seismicity rate at ∼600km depth, corresponding to an induced stress maximum. The model also predicts the depth-continuous seismicity within cold slabs and isolated seismicity swarm at ~600 km in warm slabs. This mechanism of residual stress within a cold slab also provides a solution to deep earthquakes occurring beneath former subduction zones such as western Tonga and Spain. We further suggest that this model may reconcile existing geodynamic paradoxes concerning the absolute strength of slabs, discrepancies on mantle rock strength between laboratory and geophysical inversions, as well as the competition between earthquake-generating stresses and slab-pull forces.",

            "abstract": "Shocks ahead of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can accelerate solar wind plasma to high energies. Ions heavier than protons can be used as tracers for the associated heating and acceleration mechanisms in the solar wind plasma. Helium, as measured by the ACE and Wind satellites, is studied in a series of shocks associated with CMEs. The heating seen in helium after the shock passage is compared to the proton heating in the each shock. The orientation of the shock normal to the magnetic field is also examined, as the structure of the shock can be oriented differently from one spacecraft to the next possibly explaining the variations in heating. A discussion of the scale factor of the structure of the shock and its influence on heating is discussed.",

We will report on very preliminary work toward a JPSS project to evaluate the impact of the JPSS direct readout data (CrIS and ATMS) on short-range forecasts. This will be tested within hourly rapidly updating systems (Rapid Refresh - RAP and future rapid-refresh updated cycle for a global model) through the use of overlapping time window and application of GSD-hybrid-ensemble data assimilation. Initially, the hourly data coverage of JPSS direct readout data compared to that from RARS (Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services) will be examined in a real-time environment. Secondly, the channel selection and bias correction will be conducted to prepare for the efficient assimilation of the JPSS radiance data into rapidly updating systems. Progress will be reported toward incorporation into real-time testing of RAP and within a global rapid refresh application.",

            "abstract": "The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) has been developed to be an operational instrument on the GOES-R series of spacecraft. The GLM is a unique instrument, unlike other meteorological instruments, both in how it operates and in the information content that it provides. Instrumentally, it is an event detector, rather than an imager. While processing almost a billion pixels per second with 14 bits of resolution, the event detection process reduces the required telemetry bandwidth by almost 105, thus keeping the telemetry requirements modest and enabling efficient ground processing that leads to rapid data distribution to operational users.\nThe GLM was designed to detect about 90 percent of the total lightning flashes within its almost hemispherical field of view. Based on laboratory calibration, we expect the on-orbit detection efficiency to be closer to 85%, making it the highest performing, large area coverage total lightning detector. It has a number of unique design features that will enable it have near uniform special resolution over most of its field of view and to operate with minimal impact on performance during solar eclipses.\nThe GLM has no dedicated on-orbit calibration system, thus the ground-based calibration provides the bases for the predicted radiometric performance.\nA number of problems were encountered during the calibration of Flight Model 1. The issues arouse from GLM design features including its wide field of view, fast lens, the narrow-band interference filters located in both object and collimated space and the fact that the GLM is inherently a event detector yet the calibration procedures required both calibration of images and events. The GLM calibration techniques were based on those developed for the Lightning Imaging Sensor calibration, but there are enough differences between the sensors that the initial GLM calibration suggested that it is significantly more sensitive than its design parameters. The calibration discrepancies have been resolved and will be discussed. Absolute calibration will be verified on-orbit using vicarious cloud reflections.\nIn addition to details of the GLM calibration, the presentation will address the unique design of the GLM, its features, capabilities and performance.",

            "abstract": "Nearly 75% of the Earth’s surface is covered by marine sediment that is home to an estimated 2.9 x 1029 microbial cells. A substantial impediment to understanding the abundance and distribution of cells within marine sediment is the lack of a consistent and reliable method for their taxon-specific quantification. Catalyzed reporter fluorescent in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) provides taxon-specific enumeration, but this process requires passing a large enzyme through cell membranes, decreasing its precision relative to general cell counts using a small DNA stain.\nIn 2015, Yamaguchi et al. developed FISH hybridization chain reaction (FISH-HCR) as an in situ whole cell detection method for environmental microorganisms. FISH-HCR amplifies the fluorescent signal, as does CARD-FISH, but it allows for milder cell permeation methods that might prevent yield loss.\nTo compare FISH-HCR to CARD-FISH, we examined bacteria and archaea cell counts within two sediment cores, Lille Belt (~78 meters deep) and Landsort Deep (90 meters deep), which were retrieved from the Baltic Sea Basin during IODP Expedition 347. Preliminary analysis shows that CARD-FISH counts are below the quantification limit for most depths across both cores. By contrast, quantification of cells was possible with FISH-HCR in all examined depths. When quantification with CARD-FISH was above the limit of detection, counts with FISH-HCR were up to 11 fold higher for Bacteria and 3 fold higher for Archaea from the same sediment sample. Further, FISH-HCR counts follow the trends of on board counts nicely, indicating that FISH-HCR may better reflect the cellular abundance within marine sediment than other quantification methods, including qPCR. Using FISH-HCR, we found that archaeal cell counts were on average greater than bacterial cell counts, but within the same order of magnitude.",

By varying the PM water content and observing particle rebound as a function of RH (up to 98%), the hygroscopic response and phase state of the PM under investigation was determined.\nThe hygroscopic response curves were categorized according to the rebound fraction at high RH (80 – 98%) bounded by two extremes. 1) Time periods that resemble pure SOM generated under controlled chamber conditions, where no particle rebound is observed above 80% RH. 2) Time periods that a large fraction (10 – 40%) of particles rebound at RH values >95%, an indication of hydrophobic particles.

            "abstract": "Hurricane Sandy (2012) demonstrated the vulnerability of the US East Coast to extreme events, and motivated the exploration of resilient coastal defenses that incorporate both hard engineering and natural strategies such as the restoration, creation and enhancement of coastal wetlands and marshes. Past laboratory and numerical studies have indicated the potential of wetlands to attenuate storm surge, and have demonstrated the complexity of the surge hydrodynamic interactions with wetlands. Many factors control the propagation of surge in these natural systems including storm characteristics, storm-induced hydrodynamics, landscape complexity, vegetation biomechanical properties and the interactions of these different factors. While previous field studies have largely focused on the impact of vegetation characteristics on attenuation processes, few have been undertaken with holistic consideration of these factors and their interactions. To bridge this gap of in-situ field data and to support the calibration of storm surge and wave numerical models such that wetlands can be correctly parametrized on a regional scale, we are carrying out high resolution surveys of hydrodynamics (pressure, current intensity and direction), morphology (topo-bathymetry, micro-topography) and vegetation (e.g. stem density, height, vegetation frontal area) in 4 marshes along the Chesapeake Bay. These areas are representative of the ecosystems and morphodynamic functions present in this region, from the tidal Potomac marshes to the barrier-island back-bays of the Delmarva Peninsula. The field monitoring program supports the investigation of the influence of different types of vegetation on water level, swell and wind wave attenuation and morphological evolution during storm surges. This dataset is also used to calibrate and validate numerical simulations of hurricane storm surge propagation at regional and local scales and to support extreme weather coastal resilience planning in the region.\nFigure 1 shows an area prone to storm surge impact within one of the 4 study sites: the Dameron Marsh Natural Area Preserve, located on the shoreline of the Northern Peninsula of Virginia, along the Chesapeake Bay.",

            "abstract": "Movement of intermediate waters plays an important role in global heat and carbon transport in the ocean and changes in their distribution are closely tied to glacial-interglacial climate change. Ocean temperature is necessarily linked to circulation because density is a function of temperature and salinity. In the modern ocean, stratification is dominated by differences in temperature, but this may not have been the case in the past.\nCoupled radiocarbon and U/Th dates on deep-sea Desmophyllum dianthus corals allow for the reconstruction of past intermediate water circulation rates. The addition of temperature measurements further aids in understanding of the mechanisms driving the observed signals, since there are different boundary conditions for resetting these two properties at the surface. In the modern Southern Ocean, temperature and radiocarbon are broadly correlated. At the surface there are meridional gradients of these properties, with colder, more radiocarbon-depleted water closer to the Antarctic continent.\nWe present a high-resolution time series of clumped isotope temperature measurements on 30 corals spanning the Last Glacial Maximum through the end of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR). These samples have previously been U/Th and radiocarbon dated. Corals were collected south of Tasmania from depths of between ~1450 – 1900 m, with 70% between 1500 and 1700 m. Uranium and thorium measurements were made by MC-ICP-MS on a ThermoFinnigan Neptune, radiocarbon was measured by AMS at the KCCAMS Laboratory at UC Irvine, and clumped isotope temperatures were measured on a MAT 253 attached to an automated carbonate preparation line. Preliminary results show constant temperature between ~20 – 18 ka, a gradual rise of ~6 ºC through Heinrich Stadial 1 (~18 – 15 ka), an abrupt drop of ~7 ºC directly preceeding the start of the Bølling at 14.7 ka, and another slight rise of ~4 ºC through the ACR (14.7 – 12.8 ka). The addition of clumped isotope temperatures to this time series allows for a unique examination of Southern Ocean dynamics through the most recent glacial termination.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface fluid injection is often followed by observations of an enlarging cloud of microseismicity. The cloud’s diffusive growth is thought to be a direct response to the diffusion of elevated pore fluid pressure reaching pre-stressed faults, triggering small instabilities; the observed high rates of this growth are interpreted to reflect a relatively high permeability of a fractured subsurface [e.g., Shapiro, GJI 1997].\nWe investigate an alternative mechanism for growing a microseismic cloud: the elastic transfer of stress due to slow, aseismic slip on a subset of the pre-existing faults in this damaged subsurface. We show that the growth of the slipping region of the fault may be self-similar in a diffusive manner. While this slip is driven by fluid injection, we show that, for critically stressed faults, the apparent diffusion of this slow slip may quickly exceed the poroelastically driven diffusion of the elevated pore fluid pressure. Under these conditions, microseismicity can be first triggered by the off-fault stress perturbation due to the expanding region of slip on principal faults. This provides an alternative interpretation of diffusive growth rates in terms of the subsurface stress state rather than an enhanced hydraulic diffusivity. That such aseismic slip may occur, outpace fluid diffusion, and in turn trigger microseismic events, is also suggested by on- and near-fault observations in past and recently reported fluid injection experiments [e.g., Cornet et al., PAGEOPH 1997; Guglielmi et al., Science 2015].\nThe model of injection-induced slip assumes elastic off-fault behavior and a fault strength determined by the product of a constant friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. The sliding region is enlarged by the pore pressure increase resolved on the fault plane. Remarkably, the rate of self-similar expansion may be determined by a single parameter reflecting both the initial stress state and the magnitude of the pore pressure increase.",

The approach is to scale the dimensionless UV LER data to match the CERES Shortwave Cloud radiative forcing when they are concurrent (2000-2014). The derived scaling factors are then used to produces a CERES-proxy of SW cloud forcing back to 1980. The good agreement between trends and anomalies of the CERES-proxy and CERES Shortwave Cloud forcing records during the overlapping data period supports using this new data set for extended climate studies.\nDuring 1980-2000 period of globally warming surface temperatures, our record of shortwave cloud forcing shows a widespread global increase in forcing from reduced cloudiness. However, during the more recent pause in global warming 2000-2012, our record shows a reduction in SW cloud forcing from increased cloudiness.\nHistorical CMIP5 AMIP simulations from eight models do not capture the 1980-2000 reduction in cloudiness. Twenty-year segments of future RCP45 long-term runs with comparable surface temperature warming to that observed from 1980-2000, also do not simulate our observed reduction in cloud amount. This suggests that the climate sensitivity in the tested CMIP5 models is too low.\n ",

            "abstract": "Northern hemisphere background atmospheric concentrations of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) have been declining by up to 25% over the last ten years at some lower latitude sites. However, this decline has ranged from no decline to 9% over 10 years at Arctic long-term measurement sites. Measurements also show a highly dynamic nature of mercury (Hg) species in Arctic air and snow from early spring to the end of summer when biogeochemical transformations peak. Currently, models are unable to reproduce this variability accurately. Estimates of Hg accumulation in the Arctic and Arctic Ocean by models require a full mechanistic understanding of the multi-phase redox chemistry of Hg in air and snow as well as the role of meteorology in the physicochemical processes of Hg.\nWe will show how findings from ground-based atmospheric Hg measurements like those made in spring 2012 during the Bromine, Ozone and Mercury Experiment (BROMEX) near Barrow, Alaska can be used to reduce the discrepancy between measurements and model output in the Canadian GEM-MACH-Hg model. The model is able to reproduce and to explain some of the variability in Arctic Hg measurements but discrepancies still remain. One improvement involves incorporation of new physical mechanisms such as the one we were able to identify during BROMEX. This mechanism, by which atmospheric mercury depletion events are abruptly ended via sea ice leads opening and inducing shallow convective mixing that replenishes GEM (and ozone) in the near surface atmospheric layer, causing an immediate recovery from the depletion event, is currently lacking in models. Future implementation of this physical mechanism will have to incorporate current remote sensing sea ice products but also rely on the development of products that can identify sea ice leads quantitatively. In this way, we can advance the knowledge of the dynamic nature of GEM in the Arctic and the impact of climate change along with new regulations on the overall atmospheric cycling of Hg in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Biases of present day top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux for the 9.6 micron ozone band predicted by IPCC chemistry-climate models have never been evaluated with measurements. Ozone band TOA flux biases impact the estimates of ozone radiative forcing (RF) from pre-industrial to present day. Satellite measurements of TOA radiances and ozone profiles allow evaluation of the performance of chemistry-climate models for both TOA flux and Instantaneous Radiative Kernels (IRK), which give the sensitivity of TOA flux to changes in the vertical distribution of atmospheric state, e.g. tropospheric ozone, water or temperature.\nWe compute the ozone band flux and IRK from Aura-TES and MetOP-IASI spectral radiance measurements. The new version of IRKs from TES have been upgraded from the single-angle anisotropy approximation to the more accurate 5-angle Gaussian quadrature integration method and the IRKs are expanded for quantities other than ozone, such as water vapor, temperature, and cloud at this ozone band. These IRKs can be used to attribute changes in ozone band flux to vertical changes in ozone, water vapor and atmospheric temperature, which will help to assess the feedback from vertical changes in the hydrological cycle on the ozone RF. We present comparisons of satellite observed TOA ozone band fluxes and IRKs with RRTMG (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model-GCM applications) in the NCAR CAM-chem chemistry/climate model and with the GISS radiative transfer model. TES observations of ozone and its radiative effect will be used to evaluate the Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison (ACCMIP) and the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) ensembles in terms of their simulated tropospheric ozone distributions, their effect on TOA flux, and their predictions of future ozone forcing.",

            "abstract": "We use GPS measurements from 400 stations located throughout the Pacific Northwest to estimate steady-state vertical land motion for the purpose of constraining relative sea level rise projections. Vertical motions are typically only a few percent of horizontal rates and the same order of magnitude as current sea level rise rates, so may either ameliorate or exacerbate future climate impacts. We use data from receivers operating from 1994 through 2015, each with at least three years of continuous daily measurements. Furthermore, daily position time series resulting from the processing of two GPS centers, namely the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) and the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA), are considered throughout this study. The goal is two fold: the dissemination into the scientific community of the difference in processing between these two centers, and the level of agreement between the estimated crustal for future sea-level studies in the Pacific Northwest.\nWe model both target and reference frame receiver trajectories as a superposition of discrete processes comprising steady-state tectonic motion, annual and bi-annual sinusoids exhibiting stationary phase and amplitude that reflect both local hydrology as well as artifacts introduced through satellite clock and orbit corrections, and discrete offsets due to known earthquakes (with Mw > 6) and hardware changes.\nQualitatively, Vancouver Island shows long-term uplift of ~2 mm/year, consistent with both interseismic strain accumulation from the Juan de Fuca subduction along the coast and post-glacial rebound inland, and consistent with earlier reports based on few stations and shorter time series. Further south, coastal uplift rates transition to near-zero south of Pacific Beach, and remain low southward to Cape Blanco. Vertical motion is more heterogeneous throughout Puget Sound, but most regions show subsidence of ~0.5 – 1 mm/yr. The predominant subsidence throughout Puget Sound, where the major population centers lie, is likely to increase the apparent rate of sea level rise and exacerbate the long-term climatic impact to the cosmopolitan centers.",

            "abstract": "While exploration geophysicists are making tremendous efforts to image the deep subsurface for hydrocarbon resources, the complex near surface structures often impose significant challenges. Unlike the subsurface, the near surface structures vary from region to region. Thus, it is difficult to develop any benchmark model that represents common issues worldwide. During past 20 years, near surface imaging technologies have been advanced from refraction traveltime analysis and inversion to waveform inversion. Immediate benefit is to resolve any complex velocity structure associated with low velocity hidden layers if such waveform inversion is properly handled. However, inverting seismic waveform often suffers from cycle-skipping due to poor starting model or missing of low frequency data. Jointly inverting traveltime, waveform envelope and waveform data seems stabilizing the solutions. With more data utilized for the near surface imaging, we are also able to infer anisotropic parameters, attenuation factors, density, and both Vp and Vs. Since the cross-gradient approach was introduced in 2005, the simultaneous inversion of multiple types of geophysical data has also been applied in the near surface imaging. That includes joint seismic, gravity and EM inversion for mapping seismic velocity, density, and resistivity into a near surface structure with consistent geology. I demonstrate the changes of the near surface structural images due to the progress of the imaging technology development and the transition to much more data included with five real data examples.",

These data are used to prevent communication outages, mitigate the damage solar weather causes to satellites and power grids, and reduce astronaut radiation exposure. The space weather instruments aboard GOES-R will deliver an operational dataset of unprecedented breadth. However, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)—the organization that provides access to archived GOES-R data—has faced several challenges in delivering this information to customers in usable form. For instance, the GOES-R ground system was contracted to develop higher-level products for terrestrial data but not space weather data. Variations in GOES-R data file formats and archive locations have also threatened to create an inconsistent user experience. This presentation will examine the ways in which NCEI is making GOES-R space weather data more accessible and actionable for customers. These efforts include NCEI’s development of high-level data products to meet the requirements of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center—a role NCEI has not previously played. In addition, NCEI is creating a demonstration system to show how these products can be produced in real-time. The organization is also examining customer usage of the GOES-NOP data access system and using these access patterns to drive decisions about the GOES-R user interface.",

Well-developed subground conduit systems usually can be found in a well-developed karst aquifer, as a dual permeability system. Hydraulic characteristics of non-laminar flow in conduits could be significantly different from darcian flow in porous medium; therefore, hybrid model and different governing equations are necessary in numerical modeling of karst hydrogeology. On the other hand, seawater intrusion has been observed and studied for several decades, also become a worldwidely problem due to groundwater over-pumping and rising sea level. The density difference between freshwater and seawater is recognized as the major factor governing the movements of two fluids in coastal aquifer.\nSeveral models have been developed to simulate groundwater flow in karst aquifer, but hardly describe seawater intrusion through the conduits without coupling variable density flow and solute transport. In this study, a numerical SEAWAT model has been developed to simulate variable density flow and transport in heterogeneous karst aquifer. High-density seawater is verified to intrude further inland through high permeability conduit network rather than porous medium. The numerical model also predicts the effect of different cases on seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifer, such as rising sea level, tide stages and freshwater discharge effects. A series of local and global uncertainty analysis have been taken to evaluate the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity, porosity, groundwater pumping, sea level, salinity and dispersivity. Heterogeneous conduit and porous medium hydraulic characteristics play an important role in groundwater flow and solute transport simulation. Meanwhile, another hybrid model VDFST-CFP model is currently under development to couple turbulent conduit flow and variable density groundwater flow in porous media, which provides a new method and better description in seawater intrusion modeling.\nKeywords: Seawater intrusion, Karst conduit, Sea-level rise, Numerical modeling, Variable-density flow",

            "abstract": "The complex tectonic history of the eastern US over the past billion years includes episodes of subduction and rifting associated with two complete cycles of supercontinent assembly and breakup. Both the previous global tomography models (S40RTS, SAVANI, TX2011, GyPSuM, SMEAN) and the analysis of the shear-wave splitting from the broadband seismic stations find a distinct coast-to-inland differentiation pattern in the lithosphere and upper mantle. The Mid-Atlantic Geophysical Integrative Collaboration (MAGIC) includes a dense linear seismic array from the Atlantic coast of Virginia to the western boarder of Ohio, crossing several different tectonic zones. To derive the regional mantle flow pattern along with its surface expression such as dynamic topography and aid the interpretation of the seismic observations, we are building a new geodynamic model based on ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth CovecTion) that uses buoyancy derived from seismic tomography along with realistic lithosphere and sub-lithosphere structure. At present, we use S40RTS and SAVANI tomography models together with the temperature-dependent viscosity to compute the mantle flow and dynamic topography. Beneath the eastern US, the upper mantle flow in our model is primarily parallel to the trend of the Appalachian belt, which is broadly consistent with the direction of the local shear-wave splitting. The dynamic topography results exhibit a coast-to-inland magnitude differentiation along the MAGIC seismic deployment. The numerical tests also show that both the magnitude and pattern of the dynamic topography are quite sensitive to the density perturbation and rigidity of the lithosphere/sub-lithosphere. Our future work involves using other tomography and viscosity models to obtain the mantle flow pattern as well as the resulting dynamic topography and geoid.",

Promoting buy in through public literacy and preparing the future workforce to address these challenges is a key goal of the InTeGrate project. The InTeGrate project is an NSF STEP Center that endeavors to infuse teaching about the Earth into undergraduate courses across the curriculum. The project aims to connect this knowledge to societal issues that students can relate to and opens the door to interdisciplinary problem-solving that is needed to face the Grand Challenges facing society. The project features publicly-available interdisciplinary, faculty-contributed teaching materials that engage students in learning about the Earth by focusing on pressing topics. These topics include water, food resources, energy, and hazards. Further, web pages built around teaching methods such as service learning, working with data, and teaching in the field, help engage students in active learning and making meaningful connections to their coursework. In addition, teams of interdisciplinary faculty are creating project-developed courses and modules designed to engage and promote students’ literacy in sustainability and global change issues. These materials are designed for both science and non-science majors at the undergraduate level and have been rigorously reviewed and tested in the classroom. Topics include sustainable agriculture, soil and society, climate change, critical zone science, water resources, and more.\nWe invite you to partner with the InTeGrate project as you think about broader impacts related to your work. Examples include contributing to the community collections by creating a case study detailing your project and how faculty can use it in their classroom, designing example activities that utilize your datasets, and more.

            "abstract": "The success of the disposal of nuclear waste in a deep borehole (DBH) is determined by the integrity of the components of the borehole plug. Bentonite clay has been proposed as a key plugging material, and its effectiveness depends upon its penetration into near-borehole cracks associated with the drilling process. Here we present research aimed at understanding and maximizing the ability of clay materials to plug near-borehole cracks. A device was constructed such that the borehole is represented by a cylindrical chamber, and a near-borehole crack is represented by a slot adjacent to the center chamber. The experiments consist of placing bentonite clay pellets into the center chamber and filling the entire cavity with distilled water so that the pellets hydrate and swell, intruding into the slot because the cell prohibits swelling in the vertical direction along the borehole. Results indicate that the bentonite clay pellets do not fully plug the slot. We propose a model where the penetration is limited by (1) the free swelling potential intrinsic to the system comprised of the bentonite pellets and the hydrating fluid and (2) resisting shear force along the walls of the slot. Narrow slots have a smaller volume for the clay to fill than wider slots, but wider slots present less resistive force to clay intrusion. These two limiting factors work against each other, leading to a non-monotonic relationship between slot width and intrusion length. Further experimental results indicate that the free swelling potential of bentonite clay pellets depends on pellet diameter, “container” geometry, and solution salinity. Smaller diameter pellets possess more relative volumetric expansion than larger diameter pellets. The relative expansion of the clay also appears to decrease with the container size, which we understand to be due to the increased resistive force provided by the container walls. Increasing the salinity of the solution leads to a dramatic decrease in the clay expansion.",

            "abstract": "Seismic hazard analysis is the primary interface through which useful information about earthquake rupture and wave propagation is delivered to society. To account for the randomness (aleatory variability) and limited knowledge (epistemic uncertainty) of these natural processes, seismologists must formulate and test hazard models using the concepts of probability. In this presentation, we will address the scientific objections that have been raised over the years against probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). Owing to the paucity of observations, we must rely on expert opinion to quantify the epistemic uncertainties of PSHA models (e.g., in the weighting of individual models from logic-tree ensembles of plausible models). The main theoretical issue is a frequentist critique: subjectivity is immeasurable; ergo, PSHA models cannot be objectively tested against data; ergo, they are fundamentally unscientific. We have argued (PNAS, 111, 11973-11978) that the Bayesian subjectivity required for casting epistemic uncertainties can be bridged with the frequentist objectivity needed for pure significance testing through “experimental concepts.” An experimental concept specifies collections of data, observed and not yet observed, that are judged to be exchangeable (i.e., with a joint distribution independent of the data ordering) when conditioned on a set of explanatory variables. We illustrate, through concrete examples, experimental concepts useful in the testing of PSHA models for ontological errors in the presence of aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty. In particular, we describe experimental concepts that lead to exchangeable binary sequences that are statistically independent but not identically distributed, showing how the Bayesian concept of exchangeability generalizes the frequentist concept of experimental repeatability. We also address the issue of testing PSHA models using spatially correlated data.",

            "abstract": "Studying ENSO teleconnections as a time-invariant phenomenon is often a useful conceptual framework. However, the seasonal and interannual progression of teleconnections is important for providing useful forecasts. In this study we analyze how climate sensitive portions of major crop growing regions and seasons relate to multi-year ENSO life-cycles in North and South America. We find that temperature and precipitation teleconnections forced directly by sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during boreal winter lead to soil moisture anomalies that persist through the spring to affect major growing seasons in both North and South America.\nPeak SST anomalies in ENSO life-cycles force atmospheric wave trains that lead to strong teleconnections during boreal winter. These teleconnections are concurrent with, and therefore critical for, South American growing seasons but less so for those of North America. Lagged teleconnections are of primary importance in North America, where the growing season often coincides with near-neutral SST anomalies. Major wheat producing regions of North America coincide with areas of significant soil moisture memory, such as the southern Great Plains, in which peak wintertime teleconnections force soil moisture anomalies that can persist through to early spring. Lagged soil moisture teleconnections also play a role in the late winter / early spring growing seasons of South America, particularly in Argentina.",

            "abstract": "As seismic coverage of the earth's surface continues to improve, we are faced with signals from a wide variety of explosions from various sources ranging from oil train and ordnance explosions to military and terrorist attacks, as well as underground nuclear tests. We present on a method for determining the yield of underground and near surface explosions, which should be applicable for many of these. We first review the regional envelope method that was developed for underground explosions (Pasyanos et al., 2012) and more recently modified for near surface explosions (Pasyanos and Ford, 2015). The technique models the waveform envelope templates as a product of source, propagation (geometrical spreading and attenuation), and site terms, while near surface explosions include an additional surface effect. Yields and depths are determined by comparing the observed envelopes to the templates and minimizing the misfit. We then apply the method to nuclear and chemical explosions for a range of yields, depths, and distances. We will review some results from previous work, and show new examples from ordnance explosions in Scandinavia, nuclear explosions in Eurasia, and chemical explosions in Nevada associated with the Source Physics Experiments (SPE).",

            "abstract": "High ozone concentrations at low altitudes near the surface were detected from airborne Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) measurements on May 30, 2012. We investigate the causes of the elevated ozone concentrations using the airborne measurements and various models. GEOS-chem and WRF-STILT model simulations show that the contribution from local sources is small. From MERRA reanalysis, it is found that high potential vorticity (PV) is observed at low altitudes. This high PV appears to be only partially coming through the stratospheric intrusions because the air inside the high PV region is moist, which shows that mixing appears to be enhanced in the low altitudes. Considering that diabatic heating can also produce high PV in the lower troposphere, high ozone is partially coming through stratospheric intrusion, but this cannot explain the whole ozone concentration in the target areas of the western U.S.\nA back-trajectory model is utilized to see where the air masses originated. The air masses of the target areas came from the lower stratosphere (LS), upper (UT), mid- (MT), and lower troposphere (LT). The relative number of trajectories coming from LS and UT is low (7.7% and 7.6%, respectively) compared to that from LT (64.1%), but the relative ozone concentration coming from LS and UT is high (38.4% and 20.95%, respectively) compared to that from LT (17.7%). The air mass coming from LT appears to be mostly coming from Asia. Q diagnostics show that there is sufficient mixing along the trajectory to indicate that ozone from the different origins is mixed and transported to the western U.S.\nThis study shows that high ozone concentrations can be detected by airborne measurements, which can be analyzed by integrated platforms such as models, reanalysis, and satellite data.",

            "abstract": "Coupled inputs of carbon and nitrogen comprise an important energy and nutrient subsidy for aquatic ecosystems. Large storm events can mobilize substantial amounts of these elements, especially in particulate form. While the role of storms in mobilizing allochthonous particulate organic matter (POM) is well recognized, less is known about the changes in source, particle size, and composition of POM as it is routed through the fluvial network. Questions we addressed include– (a) How does source, size, and C and N content of suspended POM vary with storm magnitude and intensity? (b) How does POM size and C and N content evolve along the drainage network? (c) How accurate are high-frequency, in-situ sensors in characterizing POM?\nWe conducted this study in a 79 ha, forested catchment in the Piedmont region of Maryland. Event sampling for suspended POM was performed using automated stream water samplers and in-situ, high-frequency sensors (s::can specto::lyser and YSI EXO 2; 30 minute intervals) at 12 and 79 ha drainage locations. Composite storm-event sediment samples were also collected using passive samplers at five catchment drainage scales. Data is available for multiple storms since August 2014. Samples were partitioned into three discrete particle size classes (coarse: 1000-2000 µm, medium: 250-1000 µm, fine: < 250 µm) for organic C and N determination. Suspended sediments and seven soil end members were also analyzed for stable 13C and 15N isotopes ratios to characterize the evolution in sediment sources through the drainage network.\nContrary to our expectations, preliminary results suggest finer suspended sediments in the upstream portion of the catchment, and that these may contain more POM. Unsurprisingly, sensors’ ability to estimate the coarser particle classes via turbidity are weak compared to the finer class, but this is less pronounced in organic-rich sediments. Distinct patterns in in-situ absorbance spectra may suggest an ability to discern suspended particle size classes using these types of sensors.",

These reform efforts aim to lead students toward deeper understandings constructed through authentic scientific and engineering inquiry in classrooms, particularly via model building and testing, more closely mirroring the professional practice of scientists and engineers, whereas traditional instructional approaches have typically been lecture-driven. In this vein, we describe the approach taken in the first year of the Teach for America (TFA) RockCorps, a five-year, NSF-sponsored project designed to provide authentic research experiences for secondary teachers and foster the development of Geophysics-themed teaching materials through cooperative lesson plan development and purchase of scientific equipment.\nInitially, two teachers were selected from the local Dallas-Fort Worth Region of TFA to participate in original research studying the failure of rocks under impulsive loads using a Split-Hopkinson-Pressure Bar (SHPB). For the teachers, this work provides a context from which to derive Geophysics-themed lesson plans for their courses, Physics/Pre-AP and Principles of Engineering (POE), offered at two large public high schools in Dallas ISD. The Physics course will incorporate principles of seismic wave propagation to allow students to develop a model of wave behavior, including velocity, refraction, and resonance, and apply the model to predict propagation properties of a variety of waves through multiple media. For the PLTW POE course, tension and compression testing of a variety of rock samples will be incorporated into materials properties and testing units. Also, a project will give a group of seniors in the PLTW Engineering Design and Development course at this certified NAF Academy of Engineering the opportunity to collaborate with UT Arlington scientists to design and prototype a fixturing solution for material testing. These course adaptations address learning objectives specified by the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, using geoscience examples to make abstract concepts more concrete.",

Here we first present a brief review of C-Q relationships documented in the scientific literature. Major categories of observed relationships for nutrient and sediment include: (a) “dilution” patterns (i.e., negative C-Q relationships), particularly for point-source dominated rivers; and (b) “concentration” patterns (i.e., positive C-Q relationships), particularly for nonpoint-source dominated rivers. In the second part of our work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of riverine C-Q patterns for multiple water-quality constituents for the nine major non-tidal tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Specifically, we have analyzed concentration data sets of total nitrogen, nitrate plus nitrite, total phosphorus, dissolved orthophosphate, and suspended sediment for the period between the 1980s and 2015. Separation of the monitoring data into non-overlapping decadal periods revealed clear non-stationarity in C-Q relationships for many of the selected site-constituent combinations. These temporal changes in C-Q relationships generally reflected changes in dominant watershed sources of nutrients and sediment (e.g., reduction in point-source dominance for total nitrogen in the Patuxent River due to technology upgrade at wastewater treatment plants) and are consistent with trends observed in previous research. The findings also highlight the potential pitfalls of assuming stationary C-Q relationships when estimating riverine concentrations and fluxes or analyzing their trends.",

            "abstract": "Observations within the ocean surface mixed layer indicate a tendency for temperature gradients to form that are compensated for their effect on density by salinity gradients. These density compensated fronts tend to occur in the absence of strong surface forcing and thus weak vertical mixing. Observations show that density compensated fronts are quickly erased by surface cooling events. The presence of density compensated gradients in the surface mixed layer, however, are not well represented in regional and global ocean circulation model predictions. In these models, subgrid-scale processes are parameterized with minimal ability to represent double diffusion. Recent advances in parameterizations have been developed to model the re-stratification of the mixed layer by sub-mesoscale eddies. These ageostrophic dynamics can lead to long filaments that are governed by process on length scales from 100 m to 10 km and time scales near a day. The impact of these processes in model physics on density compensated fronts is unclear. To improve our understanding of compensated front evolution in the ocean, three different mixing schemes are tested to evaluate the creation of horizontally density compensated gradients in model simulations. One scheme extracts potential energy of ocean fronts for mixing dependent on horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, mixed layer depth, and inertial period. The other two schemes mix temperature and salinity horizontally dependent on the buoyancy gradient. All schemes provide a three dimensional approach to mixing that differentiates the horizontal eddy diffusion of temperature and salinity.",

Notwithstanding past and anticipated future changes in drought regime the interplay between hydrologic (amelioration of precipitation deficit) and functional (return to pre-drought levels of carbon metabolism) post-drought recovery is not well understood. Recovery time is however a prime determinant of whether ecosystems revert to their initial state or transition to a new equilibrium. Here we quantify post-drought recovery time of gross primary productivity (GPP) at grid cell (0.5° spatial resolution) to global scales using three reconstructions: MODIS, upscaled FLUXNET, and an ensemble of state-of-the-art standardized land surface model runs taken from MsTMIP (Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project). Drought is tracked using the multiscalar Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index drought metric where the integration period (the retrospective window used to calculate the metric) is varied from 1 to 24-months. We define recovery time as a function of both hydrologic and GPP recovery, i.e., both must attain pre-drought levels for recovery to occur. Despite the diverse provenance of the reconstructions, different reconstruction periods, and variable integration lengths several consistent patterns emerge across the c. 4 000 000 drought events and subsequent recovery times cataloged. Recovery time scales with drought severity and drought length. Biological productivity and biodiversity exhibit response surfaces with large amplitudes and clear thresholds whereas soil fertility is a weak constraint. In general, GPP-based descriptors of drought events serve as key boundary conditions for drought recovery. The longest recovery times occur on marginal lands--non-forested, mixed tree-grass, and boreal systems--with a slight uptick for tropical forests. Overall, recovery time is more controlled by GPP anomaly magnitude as opposed to the magnitude and duration of the hydrologic anomaly itself. At the extremes however prolonged hydrologic drought dominates post-drought recovery, indicating the presence of \"triggering thresholds\".",

            "abstract": "Although the traditional concept that plutons are the frozen corpses of huge, highly liquid magma chambers (“big red blobs”) is losing favor, the related notion that magma bodies can spend long periods of time (~106years) in a mushy, highly crystalline state is widely accepted. However, analysis of the thermal balance of magmatic systems indicates that it is difficult to maintain a significant portion in a simmering, mushy state, whether or not the system is eutectic-like.\nMagma bodies cool primarily by loss of heat to the Earth’s surface. The balance between cooling via energy loss to the surface and heating via magma accretion can be denoted as M = ρLa/q, where ρ is magma density, L is latent heat of crystallization, a is the vertical rate of magma accretion, and q is surface heat flux. If M>1, then magma accretion outpaces cooling and a magma chamber forms. For reasonable values of ρ, L, and q, the rate of accretion amust be > ~15 mm/yr to form a persistent volume above the solidus. This rate is extremely high, an order of magnitude faster than estimated pluton-filling rates, and would produce a body 10 km thick in 700 ka, an order of magnitude faster than geochronology indicates. Regardless of the rate of magma supply, the proportion of crystals in the system must vary dramatically with depth at any given time owing to transfer of heat. Mechanical stirring (e.g., by convection) could serve to homogenize crystal content in a magma body, but this is unachievable in crystal-rich, locked-up magma. Without convection the lower part of the magma body becomes much hotter than the top—a process familiar to anyone who has scorched a pot of oatmeal.\nThermal models that succeed in producing persistent, large bodies of magma rely on scenarios that are unrealistic (e.g., omitting heat loss to the planet’s surface), self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., setting unnaturally high temperatures as fixed boundary conditions), or physically unreasonable (e.g., magma is intruded faster than geodetic and geophysical observations allow). Magma addition and conductive heat loss rates that are consistent with observation invariably lead to the conclusion that large, long-lived magma bodies, mushy or not, are thermally unsustainable.",

            "abstract": "In many cases it is difficult to evaluate the synchronicity and thus potential connections between disparate geologic events, such as the links between processes in the mantle lithosphere and at the surface. Developing new geochronologic tools and strategies for integrating existing chronologic data with other information is essential for addressing these problems. Here we use (U-Th)/He dating of multiple kimberlitic minerals to date kimberlite eruption and cratonic erosion phases. This approach permits us to more directly assess the link between unroofing and thermomodification of the lithosphere by tying our results to information obtained from mantle-derived clasts in the same pipes. Kimberlites are rich sources of information about the composition of the cratonic lithosphere and its evolution over time. Their xenoliths and xenocrysts can preserve a snapshot of the entire lithosphere and its sedimentary cover at the time of eruption. Accurate geochronology of these eruptions is crucial for interpreting spatiotemporal trends, but kimberlites can be difficult to date using standard techniques.\nHere we show that the mid-temperature thermochonometers of the zircon and perovskite (U-Th)/He (ZHe, PHe) systems can be viable tools for dating kimberlite eruption. When combined with the low temperature sensitivity of (U-Th)/He in apatite (AHe), the (U-Th)/He system can be used to date both the emplacement and the erosional cooling history of kimberlites. The southern African shield is an ideal location to test the utility of this approach because the region was repeatedly intruded by kimberlites in the Cretaceous, with two major pulses at ~200-110 Ma and ~100-80 Ma. These kimberlites contain a well-studied suite of mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts that document lithospheric heating and metasomatism over this interval. Our ZHe and PHe dates overlap with published eruption ages and add new ages for undated pipes. Our AHe dates constrain the spatial patterns of Cretaceous erosion across the craton, with a phase of erosion that overlaps with when the lithosphere was thermochemically modified, especially in the more heavily altered off-craton regions. These results highlight the value of the (U-Th)/He system for dating a range of geologic events and evaluating elusive links between surface and deeper-earth processes.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate proxy-model comparisons for past warm periods provide insight into the driving mechanisms of persistent drought, especially pertinent information given the ongoing drought in the western US. A network of 110 hydrologically sensitive proxy records from lake sediments, speleothems, and packrat middens shows increased aridity in the western and northwestern U.S. and increased moisture in the southwest monsoon region during the mid-Holocene, a time of higher summer and lower winter insolation than present. We compare this proxy network to output from 12 climate models from the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) at the 6ka time slice to determine which models best reflect paleo-precipitation patterns, and therefore, the atmospheric drivers of precipitation change. We carry out a quantitative proxy-model comparison for precipitation (P) and effective moisture (EM = P – evapotranspiration) at 6ka relative to preindustrial simulations. Using a weighted Cohen’s Kappa test, we evaluate model agreement at different thresholds of change for annual and seasonal anomalies. Overall, simulated P anomalies show better agreement with the proxy network than EM anomalies. The FGOALS-g2 (FG) model shows the best agreement with the proxy network for annual P anomalies, with increased annual P in the monsoonal southwestern US and northern Mexico, and decreased annual P in northern California, the northern Great Basin, and the Pacific Northwest at 6 ka relative to modern. FG simulates decreased winter P across the entire western US, increased autumn P in the monsoon region and decreased autumn P in the non-monsoon region. While other models simulate increased P from July-September in the monsoon region and more arid conditions at non-monsoon sites, they often do not simulate increased aridity in non-monsoon regions during other seasons. These differences may be due to a less defined autumn Aleutian Low in FG compared with most other models.",

The ‘where to’ answer would be reliable and practical community-level tsunami evacuation maps. Following the Exercise Pacific Wave 2011, a questionnaire was sent to the 46 Member States of Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS). The results revealed over 42 percent of Member States lacked tsunami mass coastal evacuation plans. Additionally, a significant gap in mapping was exposed as over 55 percent of Member States lacked tsunami evacuation maps, routes, signs and assembly points. Thereby, a significant portion of countries in the Pacific lack appropriate tsunami planning and mapping for their at-risk coastal communities. While a variety of tools exist to establish tsunami inundation areas, these are inconsistent while a methodology has not been developed to assist countries develop tsunami evacuation maps, plans, and procedures. The International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC) and partners is leading a Pilot Project in Honduras demonstrating that globally standardized tools and methodologies can be applied by a country, with minimal tsunami warning and mitigation resources, towards the determination of tsunami inundation areas and subsequently community-owned tsunami evacuation maps and plans for at-risk communities. The Pilot involves a 1- to 2-year long process centered on a series of linked tsunami training workshops on: evacuation planning, evacuation map development, inundation modeling and map creation, tsunami warning & emergency response Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and conducting tsunami exercises (including evacuation). The Pilot’s completion is capped with a UNESCO/IOC document so that other countries can replicate the process in their tsunami-prone communities.",

            "abstract": "Strain localization is common within crustal orogenic belts, and shear displacements of kilometers can be accommodated within zones less than ten meters wide. Strain localization is accompanied by major changes in grain size, lattice preferred orientation, major and accessory phase chemistry, pore geometry, phase dispersion, dislocation density, and twin geometry, suggesting that transients in strength have also occurred. High-strain experiments where creep dominates often show hardening up to strains of 1.0, followed by strength drops of 30-50%. In contrast with such observations, creep is often described by steady-state flow laws relying on simple descriptions of defect generation and motion. Most often, it is assumed that the kinetics of a single mechanism control deformation rate, or that the relative partitioning of strain amongst several mechanisms remains constant. But, when two or more mechanisms operate concurrently, an accurate flow law must account for kinetic interactions and changes in strain partitioning caused by the evolution of structure or changes in thermodynamic conditions. Data now at hand, strongly suggest that the evolution of structure variables including dislocation patterning, twin-boundary geometry, grain size, and LPO are coupled. The relative strain partitioning between mechanisms and the accumulation of damage leading to localization or failure is probably affected by changes in temperature, strain rate, stress, and chemical fugacity. Thus, better descriptions of strength transients will require improved theoretical and experimental constraints on the kinetics of the individual mechanisms. Importantly, whether load drops, instabilities, or seismicity are produced also depends on many additional parameters, including changes in loading conditions, the state of pore fluids, geometry of deformation, and temperature.",

The echoes were collected by the four north, south, east, and west quarters of the array with nominally 150 m range resolution. Then self spectra and cross spectra for different integration times were calculated from the complex voltage samples. Range time intensity (RTI) plots allow us to identify periods and regions of strong mesospheric echoes.  At these locations, the coherence and phase of cross spectra were examined for pairs of the receiving channels. The slope of the interferometric phase angle allows the calculation of horizontal wind components. The recent experiment had a range resolution of 150 m which reveals details in the turbulent layers that could not be detected in a previous interferometry experiment with 1.5 km range resolution (Kudeki, JGR, 1988).

            "abstract": "The annual growth of many tree species is limited by water availability, with growth increasing as water becomes less scarce. In lowland bogs of northern Minnesota, however, black spruce (Picea mariana) is often exposed to excess water via high water table elevations. These trees grow in thick deposits of organic mucky peat and often have shallow rooting systems to avoid the complete submersion of roots in water. While it is generally believed that black spruce decrease growth rates with rising water table elevations, this hypothesis has not been tested in situ. We used a unique, 50-year record of daily bog water table elevations at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota to investigate the relationship between climate and black spruce productivity. Nine 1/20th ha circular plots were established in five different bogs and tree height, diameter-at-breast-height (DBH), and crown class were recorded. Additionally, two perpendicular cores were collected on all trees greater than 10 cm diameter-at-breast-height. Tree cores were sanded, mounted, cross-dated, and de-trended according to standard dendrochronological procedures. Ring width measurements were correlated with precipitation, temperature, and water table elevation using package BootRes in R to determine the climatic variables most associated with stand level productivity. Across the different plots, we found that early growing season water table elevation (May and June) was negatively correlated with both individual and stand-level black spruce growth (p < 0.01), while growth was positively correlated with March temperatures (p < 0.01). No significant relationships existed between black spruce growth and monthly precipitation. If summer water table elevations in these peatland ecosystems rise as is anticipated with more extreme precipitation events due to climate change, we could see an overall decrease in the stand level productivity of black spruce.",

            "abstract": "Sand-dominated fluvial stratigraphy is often interpreted as indicating times of relatively slow subsidence because of the assumption that fine sediment (silt and clay) is reworked or bypassed during periods of low accommodation. However, sand-dominated successions may instead represent proximal, coarse-grained reaches of paleo-river basins and/or fluvial systems with a sandy sediment supply. Differentiating between these cases is critical for accurately interpreting mass-extraction profiles, basin-subsidence rates, and paleo-river avulsion and migration behavior from ancient fluvial deposits. We explore the degree to which sand-rich accumulations reflect supply-driven progradation or accommodation-limited reworking, by re-evaluating the Castlegate Sandstone (Utah, USA) and the upper Williams Fork Formation (Colorado, USA) – two Upper Cretaceous sandy fluvial deposits previously interpreted as having formed during periods of relatively low accommodation. Both units comprise amalgamated channel and bar deposits with minor intra-channel and overbank mudstones. To constrain relative reworking, we quantify the preservation of bar deposits in each unit using detailed facies and channel-deposit mapping, and compare bar-deposit preservation to expected preservation statistics generated with object-based models spanning a range of boundary conditions. To estimate the grain-size distribution of paleo-sediment input, we leverage results of experimental work that shows both bed-material deposits and accumulations on the downstream side of bars (“interbar fines”) sample suspended and wash loads of active flows. We measure grain-size distributions of bar deposits and interbar fines to reconstruct the relative sandiness of paleo-sediment supplies for both systems. By using these novel approaches to test whether sand-rich fluvial deposits reflect river systems with accommodation-limited reworking and/or particularly sand-rich sediment loads, we can gain insight into large-scale downstream-fining and mass-extraction trends in basins with limited exposure.",

            "abstract": "A grand challenge in our understanding of the global carbon cycle is the vulnerability of large organic carbon pools at the land–water interface to changes in climate and to landscape disturbance. The expectation that terrestrial organic matter (OM) should be dominated by lignified (aromatic) plant-derived material or nitrogen-poor, complex soil OM with old radiocarbon ages has contributed to predictions of low bioavailability or chemical recalcitrance for terrigenous OM. Recent shifts in our understanding of the source of OM in soils and the mechanisms contributing to its persistence or loss have refocused attention on environmental parameters influencing the fate of OM and its role as a source of C to the atmosphere. On land, climate, soil mineralogy, topography, drainage, vegetation, disturbance (e.g., fire) and human land use influence the quantity and biochemical composition of organic matter accumulating in soils and available for lateral transfer to aquatic systems in dissolved or particulate form. Growing research indicates that local site conditions and disturbance history are important for predicting the response of soil OM to environmental change, often more so than OM chemical composition, contradicting traditional models that tie reactivity to structure. Soils are a large source of C entering waterways, yet how much landscape heterogeneity within the watershed matters for understanding the fate of C downstream is unknown: does all this heterogeneity come out in the wash? Here we follow up on recent discussions about environmental controls on the composition and age of OM in soil, what type and age of C is mobilized during landscape disturbance, and how its source on land can help predict its fate downstream. To further improve understanding of how landscape alterations affect transfers from land to water and fill some of the gaps in the global C cycle, we identify areas of research where collaborations between aquatic and terrestrial scientists would be especially fruitful.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable concern about the volume of water used for hydraulic fracturing to produce oil and gas from shale plays, particularly in semiarid regions with limited water supplies. Many analyses focus on water use per well because these data are readily available through the FracFocus database; however, a critical factor is the water use intensity (i.e., water use for hydraulic fracturing per unit of energy produced). In this study we quantified water use for hydraulic fracturing on a per well basis in the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, and Bakken shale plays and compared these data with the volumes of oil produced to assess the water use intensity. Water demand per well varies markedly among the three plays. Controls on water use include type of well, length of lateral, frac fluid type, number of frac stages, and geology. For example, preliminary results indicate that less water is used for hydraulic fracturing per unit of energy in the Bakken relative to that in the other plays that was attributed to geologic differences. Most production is from the Middle Bakken, which is a tight sand/silt formation rather than shales as in the Eagle Ford and Permian plays. Water use per unit of energy production decreases with time after well completion, assuming a well is not refractured, and water use intensity estimates are based on estimated ultimate recovery. Quantifying water use in the Bakken is complicated because of additional water required after well completion to flush high levels of salts. Water use for oil production from unconventional reservoirs is within the lower range of that used for oil production from conventional reservoirs. Therefore, high levels of water use for hydraulic fracturing reflect increased energy production from unconventional reservoirs rather than higher water intensity.",

            "abstract": "Thunderstorms commonly produce turbulent airflows, which can have important implications for cloud structure and evolution, the transport of chemical species, and the safety of aircraft. Recent studies have indicated that turbulence also may control lightning characteristics, such as flash rate and size. Moreover, there are indications that the onset of lightning may be related to rapid intensification of turbulence within a growing convective storm. This observation is consistent with the known good empirical correlation between eddy dissipation rate (EDR, a measure of the strength of turbulence) and updraft strength. An algorithm to estimate EDR for in-cloud turbulence from Doppler radar data has been incorporated into open source software developed at NASA. This software (called the Python Turbulence Detection Algorithm, or PyTDA), which can be applied to data from almost any Doppler radar, is in the process of being validated against in situ measurements , as well as compared with other turbulence algorithms. Early validation results will be reported in this presentation. Then, the application of the turbulence retrievals to specific thunderstorm case studies, which have available Doppler radar and lightning mapping array (LMA) data, will be reported. Specific inquiries that will be addressed will include relationships between lightning onset and turbulence, relationships between flash rate/size and turbulence, the ability of turbulence retrievals to serve as proxies for updraft strength/location, and the implications of all these relationships for satellite-based lightning observations.",

            "abstract": "The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is NASA’s first dedicated Earth remote sensing satellite to study atmospheric carbon dioxide from space, and was launched successfully on July 2, 2014. In the target mode of observation, the Observatory will lock its view onto a specific surface location, and will scan back and forth over that target while flying overhead. A target track pass can last for up to 9 minutes. Over that time period, the Observatory can acquire as many as 12,960 samples at local zenith angles that vary between 0° and 85°.\nHere, we analyze target track measurements over several of the OCO-2 validation sites where ground-based solar-looking Fourier Transform Spectrometers are located. Preliminary analysis of target mode retrievals using the operational algorithm show biases that appear to be due to not accounting for bidirectional surface reflection (BRDF) effects, i.e., the non-isotropic nature of surface reflection. To address this issue, we implement a realistic BRDF model. The column averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) results using this new model show much less variation with scattering angle (or airmass). Further, the retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) is in much better agreement with coincident AERONET values. We also use information content analysis to evaluate the degrees of freedom with respect to BRDF parameters, and investigate cross-correlations between the parameters.",

Likewise electric discharges in the laboratory, mimicing lightning on a small spatial and\nenergetic scale, emit X-rays whose energies are limited by the available potential difference between\nthe two electrodes. For a maximal available difference of 1 MV and a gap distance of 1 m between the two\nelectrodes, we will present the energy and spatial distribution of generated X-rays.\nFor that we have followed the motion of preaccelerated, monoenergetic and monodirectional electron\nbeams with energies between 100 keV and the maximal available energy of 1 MeV for different electric\nfield configurations using a particle Monte Carlo code. Omitting any field, we present the subsequent energy and spatial distribution of X-rays\nand analyse how the photon number depends on the initial electron energy. Fig. 1 shows the position and energy of photons generated by Bremsstrahlung after 0.3 ns by beams of 500 000 electrons with initial energies of 1 MeV moving in the z\ndirection in STP air. The electrons have generated electron avalanches and all have cooled\ndown and attached to oxygen after 0.3 ns. Every cross represents one photon projected onto the xz plane; the photon energies Eγ are color coded. We see that photons with energies of approx. 1 MeV can be produced and that the high-energy tail of X-rays is beamed\ntowards the direction of the initial electron beam whereas low-energy photons show a more isotropic\nbehaviour. Analysing the cross sections of photons interacting with air we conclude that photons travel\nseveral meters in air and can reach detectors several meters from the position of the discharge. By\nestimating the electric field ahead of the discharge corona and by simulating the motion of electron\nbeams in these fields, we exclude that electrons travel as far as photons and disturb the measured X-ray\nsignal.",

However, a comprehensive evaluation of the elevated CO2 impact on plant nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios and the underlying mechanism has not been conducted. We synthesized the results from 112 previously published studies using meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of elevated CO2 on the N:P ratio of terrestrial plants and to explore the underlying mechanism based on plant growth and soil P dynamics. Our results show that terrestrial plants grown under elevated CO2 had lower N:P ratios in both above- and below-ground biomass across different ecosystem types. The response ratio for plant N:P was negatively correlated with the response ratio for plant growth in croplands and grasslands, and showed a stronger relationship for P than for N. In addition, the CO2-induced down-regulation of plant N:P was accompanied by 19.3% and 4.2% increases in soil phosphatase activity and labile P, respectively, and a 10.1% decrease in total soil P. Our results show that down-regulation of plant N:P under elevated CO2 corresponds with accelerated soil P cycling. These findings should be useful for better understanding of terrestrial plant stoichiometry in response to elevated CO2 and of the underlying mechanisms affecting nutrient dynamics under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical reactions can play important role on the long-term geological storage of CO2 in sites where the target formations have reactive minerals. Although the use of batch models (experimental or theoretical) is expedient, it leaves questions about how to interpret the results from the context of field scale injection. The goal of this study is to investigate changes in fluid compositions using a detailed reactive transport model. Most published CO2 geochemical studies tend to consider only a small number of components because of expensive calculations and therefore simultaneous mobility of large number of heavy metals is not clearly known. In this study we present results of coupled multiphase, multicomponent reactive transport simulations of Cranfield site, Mississipi, USA at relatively fine scale, which are obtained using the parallel PFLOTRAN code. The geochemical system consists of 22 primary or basis species, in-situ CO2 and O2 gaseous components, and 5 minerals. The number of secondary elements is 37, representing very simple to complex mineralizations occurred simultaneously in saline formation (1.81 molality). The fluid chemical compositions were measured from production fluids and mineral composition of the formation was obtained from XRD analysis of core samples. The results show brine chemistry changes in the reservoir and shed insights on the need to monitor the mobility of heavy metals such as Mg, Ca, Al, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba, and Cd. The study provides simultaneous potential mobile inventory of these metals in the storage formations and warns possible risk through leakage into overlying zone. From storage point of view we also aim to observe the sensitivity of aforementioned constituents. Our results show pH drop from 6.91 to 3.5 and relatively small changes in HCO3- and Fe concentrations. However aqueous Ca and Al increase by orders of magnitude. The detailed geochemical effect shows trapping efficiency increased by few percent. The brine chemistry is affected within ~500 sq. meters of CO2 source during injection period.",

            "abstract": "The GFDL longwave radiation algorithm has been extensively modified during the last two years. The most significant changes have been the incorporation of the 10 μm CO2 band; the use of the mt_ckd 2.5 continuum for water vapor; and the adoption of the HITRAN 2012 catalogue for all line and absorption coefficients. Further changes include inclusion of the CO2 4.3 μm band and extension of the calculation range to 3000 cm-1. The effect of the CO2 10 μm band is a ~0.4 W/m2 change in the surface longwave forcing, which leads to a ~10% change in CO2 radiative forcing. The adoption of the HITRAN 2012 catalog generally leads to an increase in downward flux at the surface. The mt_ckd 2.5 continuum replaces the previously used CKD 2.1 continuum; the effects are a decrease in downward flux in the upper troposphere (due to the foreign-broadened continuum in the 16-29 μm region) and an increase in upward flux in the lower troposphere (in most atmospheres).\nThe GFDL line-by-line algorithm calculation has correspondingly been modified to employ the mt_ckd 2.5 continuum for all species; further, the self-broadening of lines and line shifting effects are now included.\nUsing CIRC profiles, a comparison of the current results with the previous parameterization, with the revised GFDL line-by-line algorithm and with LBLRTM indicate significant reduction of flux and heating rate errors in most cases.\nFuture changes include inclusion of a nonzero surface emissivity, especially in the 500-1200 cm-1 range. It is contemplated that further developments may include use of a band model, exponential sum-fit or correlated-k method (as in the RRTM-g algorithm) for computation of water vapor.",

            "abstract": "With a planned launch in 2018, there are a number of challenges for the Science Planning Team (SPT) of the Solar Probe Plus mission. The geometry of the celestial bodies and the spacecraft during some of the Solar Probe Plus mission orbits cause limited uplink and downlink opportunities. The payload teams must manage the volume of data that they write to the spacecraft solid-state recorders (SSR) for their individual instruments for downlink to the ground. The aim is to write the instrument data to the spacecraft SSR for downlink before a set of data downlink opportunities large enough to get the data to the ground and before the start of another data collection cycle. The SPT also intend to coordinate observations with other spacecraft and ground based systems.\nTo add further complexity, two of the spacecraft payloads have the capability to write a large volumes of data to their internal payload SSR while sending a smaller “survey” portion of the data to the spacecraft SSR for downlink. The instrument scientists would then view the survey data on the ground, determine the most interesting data from their payload SSR, send commands to transfer that data from their payload SSR to the spacecraft SSR for downlink. The timing required for downlink and analysis of the survey data, identifying uplink opportunities for commanding data transfers, and downlink opportunities big enough for the selected data within the data collection period is critical.\nTo solve these challenges, the Solar Probe Plus Science Working Group has designed a orbit-type optimized data file priority downlink scheme to downlink high priority survey data quickly. This file priority scheme would maximize the reaction time that the payload teams have to perform the survey and selected data method on orbits where the downlink and uplink availability will support using this method. An interactive display and analysis science planning tool is being designed for the SPT to use as an aid to planning. The tool will integrate the data file priority downlink scheme, payload data volume allocations, spacecraft ephemeris, attitude, downlink and uplink schedules, spacecraft and payload activities, and other spacecraft ephemeris. A prototype of the tool is in development using notional inputs obtained from the spacecraft engineering teams.",

Aircraft engine emissions can have a disproportionately large climatic impact since they are emitted high in the troposphere and in remote regions with otherwise low aerosol concentrations. This has motivated numerous past ground-based studies focused on quantifying the emissions indices of non-volatile and semi-volatile aerosol species, however, it is unclear the extent to which emissions on the ground translate to emissions at cruise conditions. In addition, the ability of engine-emitted aerosols to nucleate ice crystals and form linear contrails or contrail cirrus clouds remains poorly understood.\nTo better understand these effects, two chase plane experiments were carried out in 2013 and 2014. Three different fuel types are discussed: a low-sulfur JP-8 fuel, a 50:50 blend of JP-8 and a camelina-based HEFA fuel, and the JP-8 fuel doped with sulfur. Emissions were sampled using a large number of aerosol and gas instruments integrated on HU-25 and Falcon 20 jets that were positioned in the DC-8 exhaust plume at approximately 50-500 m distance behind the engines. It was found that the biojet fuel blend substantially decreases the aerosol number and mass emissions indices, while the gas phase emission indices were similar across fuels. The magnitude of the effects of these fuel-induced changes of aerosol emissions and implications for future aviation biofuel blending impacts will be discussed.",

The accuracy of both methods is also influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of background seismic noise and the degree of orthogonality of the tri-axial suspension in the STS-2 seismometer.\nThe Streckeisen STS-2 manual states that the signal coil sensitivity (Gs) is 1500 V/(m/s) (+/-1.5%) and it gives Gc to only one decimal place (ie, Gc = 2 g/A). Unfortunately the factory Gc value is not given with sufficient accuracy to be useful for determining the sensitivity of Gs to within 1.5%. Thus we need to determine Gc to enable accurate calibration of the STS-2 via remote excitation of the Gc with a known stimulus.\nThe Berkeley Digital Seismic Network (BDSN) has 12 STS-2 seismometers with co-sited reference sensors (strong motion accelerometers) and they are all recorded by Q330HR data loggers with factory cabling. The procedure is to first verify the sensitivity of the STS-2 signal coils (Gs) via comparison of the ground motions recorded by the STS-2 with the ground motions recorded by the co-sited strong motion accelerometer for an earthquake with has sufficiently high SNR in a passband common to both sensors. The second step in the procedure is to remotely (from Berkeley) excite to calibration coil with a 1 Hz sinusoid which is simultaneously recorded and, using the above measured Gs values, solve for Gc of the calibration coils. The resulting Gc values are typically 2.20-2.50 g/A (accurate to 3+ decimal places) and once the Gc values are found, the STS-2 absolute sensitivity can be determined remotely to an accuracy of better than 1%. The primary advantage of using strong motion accelerometers as the reference instrument is that their absolute calibration can be checked via tilt tests if the need arises.",

            "abstract": "Site conditions are essential parameters for assessing seismic hazards related to strong ground motion. Due to generally limited availability of measured Vs30 data, regional scale site condition classification is usually based on surface geology, terrain, or topographic slope. As a step to develop a seismic hazard map of China, we make a 1:1,000,000 scale site condition map, which is also the scale of the active fault database of China.\nBased on the geological database compiled by Li et al. (2006), we classify each geological unit by age and petrological description. Following Wills and others (2000, 2006), the geological units are assigned to NEHRP classes. A 1:250,000 scale Quaternary geological map, compiled by Zhang (1990) is also used to augment the classification of Quaternary sediments.\nAbout half of the currently available Vs30 data, which were surveyed at the Strong Motion Network stations mostly in Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, do not match our results. We attribute the mismatches to poor location control and the downward extrapolation of shallow boreholes.\nThe preliminary results show a pattern characterized by regional tectonics and climate settings. The subsiding basins of the Jianghan Plain in central China, Hetao Basin in north China, Ruoergai Basin and the Yangtze River Delta have large patches of class E soil. South China is mostly class B and C due to stable tectonics and removal of sediments by heavy rainfall. Tectonically active southwest China is also mostly class B and C because of strong erosion and little local sedimentation. North and northwest China are dominated by class D and B, with some class C due to Early Pleistocene rocks. Inside the Tibetan Plateau, low relief and active compression of young rocks produce stripes of class B, C and D, with small patches of class E for lacustrine sediments.  ",

These data products are derived from remote-sensing instruments on satellites, ground stations, and data assimilation models. Instructors and students can query the GIOVANNI data archive, then save the results as map images, time series plots, vertical profiles of the atmosphere, and data tables. Any part of the world can be selected for analysis. The project has also produced a tool for instructors to author and adapt standards-based lesson plans, student data investigation activities, and presentations around visualizations they make available to their students via DICCE-G. Supports are provided to students and teachers about how to interpret trends in data products of their choice at the regional level and a schema has been developed to help them understand how those data products fit into current scientific thinking about the certainties and uncertainties of climate change. The presentation will (1) describe the features of DICCE, (2) examples of curricula developed to make use of DICCE in classrooms, (3) how these curricula align to Next Generation Science Standards, and (4) how they align to science education research literature about how to make school science more engaging. Recently-analyzed teacher and student outcomes from DICCE use will also be reported.",

            "abstract": "Despite much recent research, high uncertainty persists concerning the extent to which global warming influences the rate of permafrost soil organic matter loss and how this affects the functioning of permafrost ecosystems and the net transfer of C to the atmosphere. This uncertainty continues, at least in part, because the processes that protect soil organic matter from decomposition and stabilize fresh plant-derived organic materials entering the soil are largely unknown. The objective of the VULCAN (VULnerability of soil organic CArboN to climate change in permafrost and dryland ecosystems) project is to gain a deeper insight into these processes, especially at the molecular level, and to explore potential implications in terms of permafrost ecosystem functioning and feedback to climate change. We will capitalize on a globally unique ecosystem warming experiment in Alaska, the C in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project, which is monitoring soil temperature and moisture, thaw depth, water table depth, plant productivity, phenology, and nutrient status, and soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Soil samples have been collected from the CiPEHR experiment from strategic depths, depending on thaw depth, and allow us to examine effects related to freeze/thaw, waterlogging, and organic matter relocation along the soil profile. We will use physical fractionation methods to separate soil organic matter pools characterized by different preservation mechanisms of aggregation and mineral interaction. We will determine organic C and total N content, transformation rates, turnovers, ages, and structural composition of soil organic matter fractions by elemental analysis, stable and radioactive isotope techniques, and nuclear magnetic resonance tools.\nAcknowledgements: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 654132.

            "abstract": "Bedrock was encountered in DFDP-2B at drilled depths (MD) of 238.50–893.18 m (vertical depths of 238.40–818.00 m). Continuous sampling of cuttings revealed the bedrock is composed predominantly of ductilely sheared mylonite-series lithologies exhumed from the roots of the Alpine Fault zone. The protolith is interpreted to be amphibolite facies metasediments classified as part of the Aspiring Subdivision of the Torlesse Supergroup. Onsite description of whole cuttings and thin sections made within a few hours of sample recovery allowed identification of progressive structural changes. Fabrics were schistose in the upper part of the hole, but at greater depths we observed increasing indications that the rocks had been subjected to simple shear deformation. These macro-and micro-structural features are consistent with those that typify the Alpine Fault mylonite sequence previously described, and were used as input to drilling decisions. The structural features found to be the most useful indicators of ductile simple shear strain accommodated by the recovered rocks were the occurrence of shear bands; changes in mean quartz grain size; changes in maximum mica grain size; and redistribution of or changes in microstructural setting of accessory phases (e.g. graphite). The quartz:mica ratio based on mass was also determined but the extent to which this reflects true lithologic variations is unclear, as washing and winnowing of the samples (both by circulating drill fluids and during the sample collection process) probably modified bulk mineralogy in different particle size domains. Nevertheless, the quartz:mica dataset suggests a dramatic change in mineralogy at 730 m MD (vertical depth of 695 m). This coincides with a pronounced step in the temperature gradient, possibly related to large changes in hydrogeology.",

            "abstract": "Observations from next generation of environmental sensors onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Parnership (S-NPP) and its successor, the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), provide us the critical information for numerical weather forecast (NWP). How to better represent these satellite observations and how to get value added information into NWP system still need more studies. Recently scientists from Cooperative Institute of Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a near realtime regional Satellite Data Assimilation system for Tropical storm forecasts (SDAT) (\nhttp://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/sdat\n). The system is built with the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation and advanced Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model. With GSI, SDAT can assimilate all operational available satellite data including GOES, AMSUA/AMSUB, HIRS, MHS, ATMS, AIRS and IASI radiances and some satellite derived products. In addition, some research products, such as hyperspectral IR retrieved temperature and moisture profiles, GOES imager atmospheric motion vector (AMV) and GOES sounder layer precipitable water (LPW), are also added into the system. Using SDAT as a research testbed, studies have been conducted to show how to improve high impact weather forecast by better handling cloud information in satellite data. Previously by collocating high spatial resolution MODIS data with hyperspectral resolution AIRS data, precise clear pixels of AIRS can be identified and some partially or thin cloud contamination from pixels can be removed by taking advantage of high spatial resolution and high accurate MODIS cloud information. The results have demonstrated that both of these strategies have greatly improved the hurricane track and intensity forecast. We recently have extended these methodologies into processing CrIS/VIIRS data. We also tested similar ideas in microwave sounders by the collocation of AMSU/MODIS and ATMS/VIIRS data. The experiments along with other SDAT progresses will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of crop evapotranspiration supports efficiency of irrigation water management, which in turn can mitigate nitrate leaching, groundwater depletion, and provide energy savings. Past research in California and elsewhere has revealed strong relationships between photosynthetically active vegetation fraction (Fc) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Additional research has shown the potential of monitoring Fc by satellite remote sensing. The U.C. Cooperative Extension developed and operates CropManage (CM) as on-line database irrigation (and nitrogen) scheduling tool. CM accounts for the rapid growth and typically brief cycle of cool-season vegetables, where Fc and fraction of reference ET can change daily during canopy development. The model automates crop water requirement calculations based on reference ET data collected by California Dept. Water Resources. Empirically-derived equations are used to estimate daily Fc time-series for a given crop type primarily as a function of planting date and expected harvest date. An application programming interface (API) is under development to provide a check on modeled Fc of current crops and facilitate CM expansion to new crops. The API will enable CM to extract field scale Fc observations from NASA’s Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS). SIMS is mainly Landsat based and currently monitors Fc over about 8 million irrigation acres statewide, with potential for adding data from ESA/Sentinel for improved temporal resolution. In the current study, a replicated irrigation trial was performed on romaine lettuce at the USDA Agricultural Research Station in Salinas, CA. CropManage recommendations were used to guide water treatments by drip irrigation at 50%, 75%, 100% ETc replacement levels, with an added treatment at 150% ET representing grower standard practice. Experimental results indicate that yields from the 100% and 150% treatments were not significantly different and were in-line with industry average, while yields from the 75% and 50% treatments were significantly lower. Additional results will be presented with respect to a subsequent cabbage trial harvested October 2015.",

            "abstract": "On October 7, 2014, a Mw 1.9 earthquake was detected and located using the IRIS Earthscope Transportable Array stations in Ohio. The earthquake was located at a depth of ~3 km near the interface of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks with the crystalline Precambrian basement. The location is within a few kilometers laterally of a 2013 earthquake sequence that was linked to hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations on three wells in Harrison county (Friberg et al, 2014). Using the Mw 1.9 event as a template in a multi-component cross correlation detector on station O53A, over 1000 matching detections were revealed between September 26 - October 17, 2014. These detections were all coincident in time with HF operations on 3 nearby (< 1km away) horizontally drilled wells (Tarbert 1H, 3H, and 5H) in the Utica formation (~2.4 km depth). The HF operations at two of the wells (1H and 5H) were coincident with the majority of the detected events. The final well (3H) stimulated in the series, produced only about 20 identified events. In addition to the coincident timing with nearby HF operations, the time clustered nature of the detections were similar to the 2013 sequence and two other Ohio HF induced sequences in 2014 (Skoumal et al, 2015). All of the other HF induced earthquake sequences in Ohio were related to operations in the Utica formation.\nInterestingly, this sequence of earthquakes did not follow a simple Gutenberg-Richter magnitude frequency relationship and was deficient in positive magnitude events; the magnitude 1.9 was preceded by a magnitude 1.7, and only a ½ dozen events slightly above magnitude 0.0. The majority of the events detected were below magnitude 0.0, with some as low as magnitude -2.0. While the majority of detections are too small to locate, high similarity in waveform character indicate they are spatially near to the magnitude 1.9 event. Furthermore, gradual shifts in P phase arrival relative to S phases indicate events are moving away from the station with progressive HF stages. Given the orientation of the wells relative to the station, the migration of events away from the station with progressive stages is also supportive of this being an induced sequence.",

Selecting the best development alternative for Greenfield projects watersheds is a difficult task, since it must balance demands for infrastructure, especially in the developing world where a large potential remains unexplored, with environmental conservation. Discussions usually diverge into antagonistic views, as in recent projects in the Amazon forest, for example.\nThis motivates the construction of a computational tool that will support a more qualified debate regarding development/conservation options. HERA provides the optimal head division partition of a river considering technical, economic and environmental aspects.\nHERA has three main components: (i) pre-processing GIS of topographic and hydrologic data; (ii) automatic engineering and equipment design and budget estimation for candidate projects; (iii) translation of division-partition problem into a mathematical programming model.\nBy integrating an automatic calculation with geoprocessing tools, cloud computation and optimization techniques, HERA makes it possible countless head partition division alternatives to be intrinsically compared - a great advantage with respect to traditional field surveys followed by engineering design methods.\nBased on optimization techniques, HERA determines which hydro plants should be built, including location, design, technical data (e.g. water head, reservoir area and volume, engineering design (dam, spillways, etc.) and costs). The results can be visualized in the HERA interface, exported to GIS software, Google Earth or CAD systems.\nHERA has a global scope of application since the main input data area a Digital Terrain Model and water inflows at gauging stations.

            "abstract": "The twin satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were launched on March 17, 2002 and have operated for over 13 years. The mission objectives are to sense the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth’s mass through its effects on the gravity field at the GRACE satellite altitude. The major cause of the time varying mass is water motion and the GRACE mission has provided a continuous decade long measurement sequences which characterizes the seasonal cycle of mass transport between the oceans, land, cryosphere and atmosphere; its inter-annual variability; and the climate driven secular, or long period, mass transport signals. In 2012, a complete reanalysis of the mission data, referred to as the RL05 data release, was initiated. The monthly solutions from this effort were released in mid-2013 with the mean fields following in 2014 and 2015. The mission is entering the final phases of operations. The current mission operations strategy emphasizes extending the mission lifetime to achieve mission overlap with the GRACE Follow On Mission. This presentation will review the mission status and the projections for mission lifetime, summarize plans for the RL 06 data re-analysis, describe the issues that influence the operations philosophy and discuss the impact the operations may have on the scientific data products.",

            "abstract": "The Dorado outcrop is a basaltic edifice that protrudes through the marine sediments that cover the seafloor along the eastern flank of the East Pacific Rise. This outcrop is an exit conduit for cool, chemically altered crustal fluids. We sampled exiting fluids using a variety of techniques including autonomous, time-series samplers (OsmoSamplers) and discrete sampling using the DSV Alvin. We also collected and analyzed pore fluids from a series of short sediment cores in the vicinity of hydrothermal springs. Samples for the major nutrients show that silicic acid is significantly enriched within the venting fluids relative to the concentration in bottom seawater, whereas dissolved phosphate is depleted within these fluids. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon appear to be slightly elevated in hydrothermal fluids relative to bottom seawater. Pore fluids are highly variable in their concentrations for the major nutrients, perhaps because of variable exchange between these fluids and the underlying crustal fluids. Our results indicate that the fluids within this crustal aquifer system undergo alteration during their rapid transit within the volcanic crust. The chemical composition of these fluids appears to be influenced by exchange with the overlying sediment pore fluids as well as reactions internal to the volcanic crustal reservoir.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates how Andean river sediments in the flat-slab segment of western Argentina record active mixing of lithologically and geochemically distinct source regions comprising the Principal Cordillera, Frontal Cordillera, Precordillera fold-thrust belt, Sierras Pampeanas basement uplifts, and recycled Neogene basin fill. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological results for modern river sands discriminate variations from hinterland source regions, through river tributaries and main trunks of the Bermejo, Jachal, San Juan, and Mendoza rivers, and their respective fluvial megafans within the active foreland basin. Proportions of proximal zircon populations in the hinterland trunk rivers (with extensive Permian-Triassic and Cenozoic igneous exposures) diminish downstream with progressive contributions from the frontal Precordillera fold-thrust belt (dominantly Paleozoic sedimentary rocks) and Pampean basement uplifts. However, this systematic downstream dilution is perturbed in several catchments by significant recycling of older foreland basin fill. The degree of recycling depends on the position and extent of Oligocene–Pliocene exposures within the catchments. To discern the effects of the variable detrital zircon sources, multiple statistical methods are utilized. Quantitative comparisons suggest that variations in detrital zircon age distributions among the modern sands, and with older foreland basin fill and exposed bedrock, are dependent on spatial and temporal variations in exhumation and drainage network evolution within their respective Andean catchments. The present surface area of competing source regions and the configuration of hinterland tributary rivers largely dictate the degree of downstream dilution and/or recycling. This study provides a modern analogue and baseline for reconstructing Neogene shifts in foreland basin provenance, depositional systems, and drainage configurations during a critical transition to flat-slab subduction.",

In this research we focus on three main aspects of the urban surface/atmosphere interactions that affect flood hazard: urban heat island (UHI) effect, increased surface roughness, and accumulated aerosols. These factors, along with the uncertainties in quantifying these components make risk analysis intractable. In order to perform a risk analysis, the impact of these components needs to be mapped to a variable that can be mathematically described in a risk-analysis framework. We propose defining hazard energy as a surrogate for the combined effect of these three components. Perturbations that can change the hazard energy come from diverse sources in the urban areas and these somewhat disconnected things can be combined by the energy concept to characterize the impacts of urban areas in risk assessment. This approach synthesizes across hydrological and hydraulic processes in UBL, land surface, subsurface, and sewer network with scrutinizing energy exchange across places. We can extend our understanding about not only the influence of cities on local climate in rural areas or larger scales but also the interaction of cities and nature affecting each other.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization significantly affects storm water runoff through the creation of new impervious surfaces such as highways, parking lots, and rooftops. Such changes can adversely impact the downstream receiving water bodies in terms of physical, chemical, and biological conditions. In order to mitigate the effects of urbanization on downstream water bodies, stormwater control measures (SCMs) have been widely used (e.g., infiltration basins, bioswales). A suite of observations from an infiltration basin installed adjacent to a highway in urban Maryland was used to evaluate stormwater runoff attenuation and pollutant removal rates at the well-instrumented SCM study site. In this study, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to simulate the performance of the SCM. An automatic, split-sample calibration framework was developed to improve SWMM performance efficiency. The results indicate SWMM can accurately reproduce the hydraulic response of the SCM (in terms of reproducing measured inflow and outflow) during synoptic scale storm events lasting more than one day, but is less accurate during storm events lasting only a few hours. Similar results were found for a suite of modeled (and observed) water quality constituents, including suspended sediment, metals, N, P, and chloride.",

            "abstract": "This work develops a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer seismic parameters of layered seabeds from large sequential reflection-coefficient data sets. The approach provides parameter estimates and uncertainties along survey tracks with the goal to aid in the detection of unexploded ordnance in shallow water. The sequential data are acquired by a moving platform with source and receiver array towed close to the seabed. This geometry requires consideration of spherical reflection coefficients, computed efficiently by massively parallel implementation of the Sommerfeld integral via Levin integration on a graphics processing unit. The seabed is parametrized with a trans-dimensional model to account for changes in the environment (i.e. changes in layering) along the track. The method combines advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (annealing) with particle filtering (resampling). Since data from closely-spaced source transmissions (pings) often sample similar environments, the solution from one ping can be utilized to efficiently estimate the posterior for data from subsequent pings. Since reflection-coefficient data are highly informative, the likelihood function can be extremely peaked, resulting in little overlap between posteriors of adjacent pings. This is addressed by adding bridging distributions (via annealed importance sampling) between pings for more efficient transitions. The approach assumes the environment to be changing slowly enough to justify the local 1D parametrization. However, bridging allows rapid changes between pings to be addressed and we demonstrate the method to be stable in such situations. Results are in terms of trans-D parameter estimates and uncertainties along the track. The algorithm is examined for realistic simulated data along a track and applied to a dataset collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle on the Malta Plateau, Mediterranean Sea.

We use a compound rupture model consisting of a set of M8 high stress drop sub-events superimposed on a background slip distribution of up to 20m that builds relatively slowly. The 3D simulations were conducted using a finite difference program and the finite element program Hercules. The high-frequency (≥ 1 Hz) energy in this rupture model is primarily generated in the portion of the rupture with the M8 sub-events. In our initial runs, we included four M7.9-8.2 sub-events similar to those that we used to successfully model the strong ground motions recorded from the 2010 M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake. At periods of 2-10 s, the 3D synthetics exhibit substantial amplification (about a factor of 2) for sites in the Puget Lowland and even more amplification (up to a factor of 5) for sites in the Seattle and Tacoma sedimentary basins, compared to rock sites outside of the Puget Lowland. This regional and more localized basin amplification found from the simulations is supported by observations from local earthquakes. There are substantial variations in the simulated M9 time histories and response spectra caused by differences in the hypocenter location, slip distribution, down-dip extent of rupture, coherence of the rupture front, and location of sub-events. We examined the sensitivity of the 3D synthetics to the velocity model of the Seattle basin. We found significant differences in S-wave focusing and surface wave conversions between a 3D model of the basin from a spatially-smoothed tomographic inversion of Rayleigh-wave phase velocities and a model that has an abrupt southern edge of the Seattle basin, as observed in seismic reflection profiles.",

Laser Absorption Spectrometer (LAS) estimates of column XCO2 can be derived from a combination of observed CO2 differential optical depths ( ) and measured/estimated values of temperature (T), pressure (P), and moisture (q) along the viewing path. XCO2 can be related to CO2 as\n(equation 1)\nwhere Δτother represents residual observed due to other species, is CO2 differential absorption cross section, psfc is surface pressure, q is local specific humidity and / represent the observation on/off-line wavelengths. The accuracy of retrieved XCO2 values depends on both the error characteristics of the observed and the ability to accurately characterize T, P, and q along the observed path. A radiative transfer (RT)-based simulation framework, combined with representative global upper-air observations and matched NWP profiles, was used to assess the impact of model differences in vertical T, vertical moisture, and surface P on estimates of column CO2 and O2concentrations.\nAdditionally we characterize the impact of a combined XCO2 retrieval approach based on either O2 LAS measurements or NWP data, as well as the additional impact due to water vapor. These analyses focus on characterizing the errors for a combined retrieval approach for LAS CO2 measurements in the 1.57 and 2.05 µm regions and O2 measurements in the 0.76 and 1.27 µm. The results provide a set of signal-to-noise metrics that characterize the errors in retrieved XCO2 associated with uncertainties in knowledge of the atmospheric state, and provide a method for selecting optimal differential line pairs for both CO2 and O2 measurements to minimize the impact of this noise term.",

Is it possible that the relative strengths of these feedbacks are incorrect, such that the net cloud feedback is overestimated in models? In this study we quantify the individual components that govern the magnitude of the LW high cloud altitude feedback and the SW low cloud optical depth feedback. The feedbacks are shown to depend on both mean-state cloud properties and the response of cloud properties to warming. Comparing with observations and exploiting relationships between forced and unforced cloud changes, we demonstrate that models likely underestimate the positive LW high cloud altitude feedback and likely overestimate the magnitude of the negative SW low cloud optical depth feedback. We conclude that it is unlikely that the net cloud feedback is strongly negative.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "We present here the first model of the Martian thermosphere/ionosphere in which we predict the density profiles of water vapor and water ions in the altitude range 80 to 400 km. The model is based on data from the MAVEN spacecraft, including the NGIMS, LPW, EUVM and STATIC. The model includes 28 ions, of which 14 are protonated species, and 10 minor neutral species. The protonated species include H2O+ and H3O+, and the minor neutral species include H2O. These species are coupled to each other and to the background species by over 400 reactions. The peaks of the density profiles of water ions and OH+ are in fairly good agreement with the values measured by the NGIMS instrument. The density profiles of water vapor are computed with zero flux boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the model, which shows that water can be made in situ via ion chemistry, somewhat like in the interstelllar medium. It appears, however, that the predicted densities may be too small to account for the densities of H3O+ that are seen at low altitudes beyond the terminator. On the other hand, the densities of water vapor must be small enough so that HCO+ is not destroyed completely by proton transfer. The actual amount of water in the thermosphere is bracketed by these two requirements. The computed water vapor densities at the lower boundary are smaller than some of those at the upper boundaries of middle atmosphere models. We tentatively predict that there must be some influx of water from below. We also compute the Hn + species, where n=(1-3), and convincingly demonstrate the the mass-2 ion is H2+ and not D+, as it is on Venus.",

            "abstract": "As the global demand for water and food escalates, the emphasis is on supply side factors rather than demand side factors such as consumers, whose personal water footprints are dominated (>90%) by food. Personal footprints include the water embedded in foods that are produced locally as well as those imported, raising the question of whether local shifts in people’s food choices and habits could assist in addressing local water shortages. The current situation in California is interesting in that drought has affected an agriculturally productive region where a substantial portion of its food products are consumed by the state’s large population. Unlike most agricultural regions where green water is the primary source of water for crops, California’s arid climate demands an enormous volume of blue water as irrigation from its dwindling surface and ground water resources. Although California exports many of its food products, enough is consumed in-state so that residents making relatively minor shifts their food choices could save as much local blue water as their implementing more drastic reductions in household water use (comprising <5% of their personal footprint). One of those shifts is reducing the intake of meat and dairy products that account for just under half of a Californian’s blue-green water footprint and that require the most water of any food group on both a caloric and gravimetric basis. Another change is wasting less food, which is a shared responsibility among consumers, producers and retailers; however, consumers’ actions and preferences ultimately drive much of the waste. Personal water footprints suggest a role for individuals in conserving local water resources that is neither readily obvious nor a major focus of most conservation programs.",

On the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska the yearly salmon runs provide a valuable stimulus to the economy. It is the focus of a large commercial fishing fleet, but also a prime tourist attraction. Modeling of anadromous waters provides a tool that assists in the prediction of future salmon run size. Beaver Creek, in Kenai, Alaska, is a lowlands stream that has been modeled using the Army Corps of Engineers event based modeling package HEC-HMS. With the use of historic precipitation and discharge data, the model was calibrated to observed discharge values. The hydrologic parameters were measured in the field or calculated, while soil parameters were estimated and adjusted during the calibration. With the calibrated parameter for HEC-HMS, discharge estimates can be used by other researches studying the area and help guide communities and officials to make better-educated decisions regarding the changing hydrology in the area and the tied economic drivers.",

            "abstract": "Insolation-driven warmth across the Arctic during the early to middle Holocene (the Holocene Thermal Maximum, or HTM) represents a geologically accessible analog for future warming and its impacts. Improved constraints on the magnitude and seasonality of HTM warmth around Greenland’s margins can advance the use of paleoclimate data to test and improve climate and ice sheet models. Here we present an overview of our recent efforts to reconstruct climate through the Holocene around the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet using multiple proxies in lake sediments.\nWe use insect (chironomid) assemblages to derive quantitative estimates of Holocene temperatures at sites with minimal soil and vegetation development near the eastern, northwestern and western margins of the ice sheet. Our chironomid-based temperature reconstructions consistently imply HTM July air temperatures 3 to 4.5 °C warmer than the pre-industrial late Holocene in these sectors of Greenland. The timing of reconstructed peak warmth differs between sites, with onset varying from ~10 ka to ~6.5 ka, but in good agreement with glacial geology and other evidence from each region. Our reconstructed temperature anomalies are larger than those typically inferred from annually-integrated indicators from the ice sheet itself, but comparable to the few other quantitative summer temperature estimates available from beyond the ice sheet on Greenland. Additional records are needed to confirm the magnitude of HTM warmth and to better define its seasonality and spatial pattern. To provide independent constraints on paleotemperatures and to elucidate additional aspects of Holocene paleoclimate, we are also employing oxygen isotopes of chironomid remains and other aquatic organic materials, and molecular organic proxies, in parallel (see Lasher et al. and McFarlin et al., this meeting). Combined with glacial geologic evidence, these multi-proxy records elucidate diverse aspects of HTM climate around Greenland – including temperature, hydroclimate, and the response of Greenland’s glaciers to past climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Galapagos Archipelago consists of a series of volcanic islands located ~1,000 km west of South America that are thought to be the result of a mantle plume. The southeasternmost island, Espanola, is one of the smallest of the major islands, measuring only 7 by 14 km and reaching an elevation of 200 m. Espanola is also the oldest island in the chain, with K-Ar dates from 3.01 ± 0.11 to 3.31 ± 0.36 million years (Hall et al. 1983; White et al., 1993). The southern coast is defined by cliffs that exceed 100 m in height, made up of nearly flat-lying lavas that are each several meters thick. The northern coastline consists of lavas that dip gently toward the ocean from the highlands, as well as remnants of eroded cinder cones. Paleomagnetic measurements made in the field indicate that the western half of the island is reversely polarized, whereas most lavas measured across the eastern half are normally polarized. Major element analyses of samples from across the island indicate that fractional crystallization is the dominant process controlling chemical variations in Espanola lavas, suggesting a relatively long-lived magmatic plumbing system. Stratigraphically constrained chemical variations suggest the magma chamber may have experienced periodic replenishment by compositionally homogeneous primitive melts. Variable fluid-mobile trace element concentrations provide some evidence for contributions from ancient, recycled oceanic crust to the parental melts. Espanola lavas have more depleted Sr and Pb radiogenic isotope ratios than either Floreana or Fernandina, and lie on a mixing curve between the composition of the plume and that of the depleted upper mantle. Between ~3 and 8 Ma, the Galapagos Spreading Center was closer to the Galapagos plume than it is today. Given that Espanola was constructed during the same period, the depleted isotopic signatures suggest that plume-ridge interaction may have been a strong influence on the island’s geochemical composition.",

Past research has shown, however, that the small and medium businesses that dominate the tourism sector could be greatly impacted by climate change. We have presented global climate and hydrologic model research results to pre-selected coastal tourism business owners in the Great Lakes region to determine the best methods for delivering user-friendly future climate scenarios, given that existing research suggests that climate change adaptive behaviors and resilience increase with information (message) clarity. Model output analyses completed for this work have focused on temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events due to their economic impact on tourism activities. We have also experimented with the development and use of infographics because of their ability to present information quickly and clearly. Initial findings of this work will be presented as well as lessons learned from stakeholder interactions. Two main results include that (1) extreme weather events may have more meaning to tourism business owners than general trends in climate and (2) long-term planning for climate is extremely difficult for tourism business owners because they operate on a much shorter planning timeline than those generally used for climate change analyses.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere of Venus is relatively transparent at radio wavelengths, providing an opportunity to examine its volcanic planetary surface using radar. The highest resolution radar images come from the Magellan mission, which mapped 98% of Venus’s surface by transmitting and receiving unidirectionally polarized radio waves. Upgrades to the ground-based Arecibo telescope in 1999 allowed further imaging of the surface of Venus at conjunction in 1999, 2001, and 2004 by the transmission of a circularly polarized beam at 12.6cm wavelength and then the reception of two orthogonal circular polarization components [Carter et al., 2006]. We apply the Stokes vector method to the Arecibo measurements to calculate the circular polarization ratio (CPR), an indication of surface roughness, and the degree of linear polarization (DLP), a measure of whether there is subsurface scattering of the radar wave. We combine both the CPR and DLP datasets to enable a more holistic geologic interpretation of Magellan images. This allows us to examine geographic variations in high-altitude, high-emissivity regions such Beta Regio, and to investigate regions that may contain young lava flows such as Themis Regio. Our approach permits a more precise geologic mapping of the textures of coronas and lava flow fields, including the identification of abnormally rugged lava flows. The data were also used to search for pyroclastics emanating from large and intermediate sized volcanoes within the region visible to Arecibo.",

            "abstract": "The primary goal of Earth System Models (ESMs) is to improve understanding and projection of future global change. In order to do this they must accurately represent the carbon fluxes associated with the terrestrial carbon cycle. Although Arctic carbon fluxes are small - relative to global carbon fluxes - uncertainty is large. As part of a multidisciplinary project to improve the representation of the Arctic in ESMs (Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments - Arctic) we are examining the photosynthetic parameterization of the Arctic plant functional type (PFT) in ESMs. Photosynthetic CO2 uptake is well described by the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis. Most ESMs use a derivation of the FvCB model to calculate gross primary productivity. Two key parameters required by the FvCB model are an estimate of the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco (Vc,max) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax). In ESMs the parameter Vc,max is usually fixed for a given PFT. Only four ESMs currently have an explicit Arctic PFT and the data used to derive Vc,max for the Arctic PFT in these models relies on small data sets and unjustified assumptions. We examined the derivation of Vc,max  and Jmax in current Arctic PFTs and estimated Vc,max  and Jmax for 7 species representing both dominant vegetation and key Arctic PFTs growing on the Barrow Environmental Observatory, Barrow, AK. The values of Vc,max currently used to represent Arctic PFTs in ESMs are 70% lower than the values we measured in these species. Examination of the derivation of Vc,max in ESMs identified that the cause of the relatively low Vc,max value was the result of underestimating both the leaf N content and the investment of that N in Rubisco. Contemporary temperature response functions for Vc,max also appear to underestimate Vc,max at low temperature. ESMs typically use a single multiplier (JVratio) to convert Vc,max to Jmax for all PFTs. We found that the JVratio of Arctic plants is higher than current estimates suggesting that the Arctic PFT will be more responsive to rising carbon dioxide than currently projected. Our data suggest that the Arctic tundra has a much greater capacity for CO2 uptake, particularly at low temperature, and will be more CO2 responsive than is currently represented in ESMs.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric total electron content maps derived from global networks of dual-frequency GPS receivers can reveal a plethora of ionospheric features in real-time and are key to space weather studies and natural hazard monitoring. However, growing data volumes from expanding sensor networks are making manual exploratory studies challenging. As the community is heading towards Big Data ionospheric science, automation and Computer-Aided Discovery become indispensable tools for scientists.\nOne problem of machine learning methods is that they require domain-specific adaptations in order to be effective and useful for scientists. Addressing this problem, our Computer-Aided Discovery approach allows scientists to express various physical models as well as perturbation ranges for parameters. The search space is explored through an automated system and parallel processing of batched workloads, which finds corresponding matches and similarities in empirical data.\nWe discuss density-based clustering as a particular method we employ in this process. Specifically, we adapt Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). This algorithm groups geospatial data points based on density. Clusters of points can be of arbitrary shape, and the number of clusters is not predetermined by the algorithm; only two input parameters need to be specified: (1) a distance threshold, (2) a minimum number of points within that threshold. We discuss an implementation of DBSCAN for batched workloads that is amenable to parallelization on manycore architectures such as Intel's Xeon Phi accelerator with 60+ general-purpose cores. This manycore parallelization can cluster large volumes of ionospheric total electronic content data quickly. Potential applications for cluster detection include the visualization, tracing, and examination of traveling ionospheric disturbances or other propagating phenomena.\nAcknowledgments.

Understanding how future changes in fire frequency, extent, and location will affect watersheds and the ecosystem services they supply to communities is of great societal importance in the USA and throughout the world. In this work we predict variability in post-fire sediment yield at a watershed scale as a function of future wildfire conditions throughout the western USA through 2050. Our predictions are based on future fire probabilities, climate change scenarios, and differing GIS-based implementations of watershed sediment yield models. We assess the uncertainties of our predictions and compare predictions based on the GEOWEPP (Geo-spatial interface for the Water Erosion Prediction Project) model, the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Sediment Retention model, and the InVEST Sediment Delivery Ratio model. We show that the models can be parameterized in a relatively simple fashion to predict post-fire sediment yield with accuracy at a watershed scale. Predictions indicate that sediment yield from post-fire hillslope erosion may increase dramatically in coming decades as a function of increased wildfire for many watersheds across the western USA.",

            "abstract": "Rábida Island in the Galapagos has experienced both explosive and effusive volcanism. It is located to the east of the most active volcanoes of the Galapagos, and previously determined ages range from 0.9 to 1.1 Ma. An unusually curved escarpment cuts the western sector of the island, which might be part of a caldera wall, although its radius of curvature is much greater than that of the island. Lavas range from basalt to rhyolite, and there are also several intermediate compositions, which are unique in the archipelago. A welded ignimbrite crops out in northeast sector, the only such deposit known in the entire region. The volumetric proportion of evolved rocks is unusually high; 25% of the rocks in our comprehensive sample set are intermediate to felsic. The siliceous rocks occur in two clusters in the southern and southwestern sections of the island, suggesting two separate sources. The intermediate rocks are concentrated in the center and northwestern parts of the island. Despite these foci of more siliceous lavas, basalt is the most widespread rock type across the island. It is notable that Rabida is immediately east of Volcan Alcedo, which is the only active Galápagos volcano that has also erupted rhyolite, and south of Santiago Island, which erupted the trachyte dome observed by Charles Darwin in 1835. These observations, in conjunction with the cumulate xenoliths observed in Rábida explosive deposits, are consistent with the evolved rocks resulting from fractional crystallization of a dying magma chamber, as the volcano is carried away from the hotspot.",

            "abstract": "Fernandina is the most active Galápagos volcano, and is located closest to the seismically defined hotspot. Allan and Simkin (2000) observed that the subaerial edifice is constructed of homogeneous basalts (Mg# = 49 ± 2) with highly variable plagioclase phenocryst contents and sparse olivine. Geist et al. (2006) proposed a magmatic plumbing system in which the volcano is supplied by interconnected sills, the shallowest of which is density-stratified: olivine and pyroxene are concentrated at greater depths, whereas less dense plagioclase mush is higher in the sill. Consequently, olivine-rich lava erupts laterally during submarine events, but plagioclase-rich lava supplies subaerial vents. To test this hypothesis, we examine lavas erupted in 1995, 2005, and 2009. These SW flank eruptions emerged alternatively from en echelon radial fissures on the lower flanks and circumferential fissures near the caldera rim. The 1995 radial fissure unzipped downslope and then formed a cone 4 km from the coast, sending flows to the ocean. In 2005, circumferential fissures erupted five flows south of the 1995 fissure. As in 1995, the 2009 fissures opened down the SW flank before focusing to a cone near the 1995 vents, producing 6 km-long flows that also reached the ocean. By correlating plagioclase crystal size distribution and morphologies with single event chronological sequences, we examine Fernandina’s magmatic plumbing system. Modal plagioclase in 1995 lava decreases (20% to <5%) throughout the middle eruptive phase. Early 2005 samples are nearly aphyric (Chadwick et al., 2010), with 1-2% plagioclase. The 2009 eruption has reduced plagioclase, similar to mid-1995 samples. Preliminary observations suggest that less plagioclase-rich mush is being flushed out during early-to-medial event sequences, whereas plag phenocrysts are transported more during later phases. Plausible plumbing dynamics suggest a zone of plagioclase-rich mush that is eroded and incorporated into radial fissure eruptions.",

We present a new database of plant trait, forest carbon cycling, and soil property measurements derived from multiple TERRA-PNW projects in the Pacific Northwest US, spanning 2000-2014. The database includes measurements from over 200 forest plots across Oregon and northern California, where the data were explicitly collected for scaling and modeling regional terrestrial carbon processes with models such as Biome-BGC and the Community Land Model. Some of the data are co-located at AmeriFlux sites in the region. The database currently contains leaf trait measurements (specific leaf area, leaf longevity, leaf carbon and nitrogen) from over 1,200 branch samples and 30 species, as well as plot-level biomass and productivity components, and soil carbon and nitrogen. Standardized protocols were used across projects, as summarized in an FAO protocols document. The database continues to expand and will include agricultural crops. The database will be hosted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORLN) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). We hope that other regional databases will become publicly available to help enable Earth System Modeling to simulate species-level sensitivity to climate at regional to global scales.",

            "abstract": "It has been debated whether drought has become more severe under climate change. Different data sources of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) have been used to address the issue. This study assesses drought frequency in the continental US using two PDSI datasets (generated by Sheffield et al., 2012 and Dai, 2013). The uni-variate return period for three drought characteristics (duration, severity and intensity) and the bi-variate return period based on the Copulas distribution for combinations of duration and severity/intensity are generated in a time series of sequential moving windows with a horizon of 40 years (1900-1939, 1901-1940, …, 1973-2012). This time series will allow us to analyze both short-term (e.g., 10-year) and long-term (e.g., 100-year) droughts. A change point detection method is applied to the generated time series to detect both abrupt and gradual changes of drought in terms of return periods. The detection results can tell whether short-term (e.g., 5-year return period) or long-term (e.g., 100-year return period) droughts have occurred with larger intensity, longer duration, and/or higher severity and when a trend, if existing, in those characteristics began or stopped (e.g., the increasing trend of intensity levels at all return periods began around 1970 at a location in Northern California as shown in Figure 1a). We find some different results when comparing short- and long-term drought events. For examples, the levels of duration, severity and intensity for short-term (e.g., 5-year and 10-year return period) and long-term (e.g., 50-year and 100-year return period) drought events experienced different trends in central Colorado (Figure 1b). This presentation will provide the results for the entire continental U.S. and especially the spatial heterogeneity and distribution of the changes.\n",

The harzburgites are at the depleted end of the global array of abyssal peridotite compositions in terms of moderately incompatible elements such as Al2O3, CaO, V and Sc. The whole-rock HREE abundances can be modeled as the residues of 15-25% near fractional melting of DMM however the LREE have much higher concentrations than predicted by this model and the samples show a significant positive Eu anomaly. The data can be fit well by a model of near-fractional melting followed by 0.5 to 2% precipitation of plagioclase that has a trace element composition in equilibrium with MORB. Plagioclase impregnation is common in the mantle section drilled at Site 895 although plagioclase is not observed petrographically in the samples studied here. The rocks are 20-70% altered and we hypothesize that plagioclase was entirely replaced during this alteration. The LREE-enrichment, relative to a melting residue, observed in the bulk-rock is not observed in clinopyroxene compositions. One explanation for this could be that the rocks were relatively cool when plagioclase impregnation occurred meaning diffusion was inefficient at modifying the clinopyroxene compositions [e.g. 1]. Whether melt-rock reaction occurs on- or off-axis is currently being investigated.\nRefs: [1] Niu, 2004. Journal of Petrology. Volume 45 (12), 2423-2458.",

            "abstract": "Satellite-based sensors provide a vast amount of observational data over the world ocean. Active microwave radars measure changes in sea surface height and backscattering from surface waves. Data from passive radiometers sensing emissions in multiple spectral bands can directly measure surface temperature, be combined with other data sources to estimate salinity, or processed to derive estimates of optically significant quantities, such as concentrations of biochemical properties. Estimates of the hydrographic variables can be readily used for assimilation or assessment of hydrodynamic ocean models. Optical data, however, have been underutilized in ocean circulation modeling. Qualitative assessments of oceanic fronts and other features commonly associated with changes in optically significant quantities are often made through visual comparison. This project applies a topological approach, borrowed from the field of computer image recognition, to quantitatively evaluate ocean model simulations of features that are related to quantities inferred from satellite imagery. The Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) provides a measure of the similarity of two shapes. Examples of applications of the MHD to assess ocean circulation models are presented. The first application assesses several models’ representation of the freshwater plume structure from the Mississippi River, which is associated with a significant expression of color, using a satellite-derived ocean color index. Even though the variables being compared (salinity and ocean color index) differ, the MHD allows contours of the fields to be compared topologically. The second application assesses simulations of surface oil transport driven by winds and ocean model currents using surface oil maps derived from synthetic aperture radar backscatter data. In this case, maps of time composited oil coverage are compared between the simulations and satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "Significant discrepancies exist when coarse resolution model precipitation forecast products on standard output grids are verified against high-resolution analyses, remaining a challenge for NWP model guidance products. To enhance the usefulness of the model products, tremendous efforts with various statistical post-processing techniques are being made to reduce those discrepancies and recover small scale features using observations and a long-term reforecast climatology as the baseline. Among them, downscaling ensemble using forecast analogs (Hamill et al., 2006) and multiplicative downscaling using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) Mountain Mapper by WPC show promising improvement in skill of forecasts. This work concentrates on these two commonly used statistical downscaling approaches along with the Frequency Matching Method (FMM, Zhu and Luo, 2015) developed at NCEP/EMC. In this work, these three approaches will be investigated when applied to the standard one degree NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) ensemble precipitation forecasts based on the 5-km high resolution NCEP Climatology-Calibrated Precipitation Analysis (CCPA) and 18 years ensemble control only reforecast data from the latest version of GEFS (GEFS v11.0). We will explore the effectiveness and feasibility of these approaches and to discover their strengths and weaknesses, with a focus mainly on generation of much higher 5km NDGD grid GEFS ensemble precipitation forecasts over the CONUS. This work is also expected to identify factors that influence the performance for each approach, such as the choice of case matching methods, the sample size, weighting function, regime definition, etc. A summary of the investigations and outcomes will be shown. Suggestions for some possible directions to produce such a high resolution ensemble precipitation forecast products in the future will be provided.",

Six holes (namely Sites SH1B, SH2B, SH3B, SH5B, SH5C and SH7B) were drilled, and gas hydrate samples were recovered at three sites: Sites SH2B, SH3B and SH7B. In order to investigate microbial diversity and community features in correlation to gas hydrate-bearing sediments, a study on microbial diversity in the surface sediments at hydrate-bearing sites (SH3B and SH7B) and -free sites (SH1B, SH5B, SH5C) was carried out by using 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic results indicated difference in microbial communities between hydrate-bearing and -free sediments. At the gas hydrate-bearing sites, bacterial communities were dominated by Deltaproteobacteria (30.5%), and archaeal communities were dominated by Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (33.8%); In contrast, Planctomycetes was the major group (43.9%) in bacterial communities, while Marine Benthic Group-D (MBG-D) (32.4%) took up the largest proportion in the archaeal communities. Moreover, the microbial communities have characteristics different from those in other hydrate-related sediments around the world, indicating that the presence of hydrates could affect the microbial distribution and community composition. In addition, the microbial community composition in the studied sediments has its own uniqueness, which may be resulted by co-effect of geochemical characteristics and presence/absence of gas hydrates.",

            "abstract": "In the American Southwest, hydrologic drought has become a new normal as a result of increasing human appropriation of freshwater resources and increased aridity associated with global warming. Although drought has often been touted to threaten freshwater biodiversity, connecting drought to extinction risk of highly-imperiled faunas remains a challenge. Here we combine time-series methods from signal processing and econometrics to analyze a spatially comprehensive and long-term dataset to link discharge variation and community abundance of fish across the American Southwest. This novel time series framework identifies ongoing trends in daily discharge anomalies across the Southwest, quantifies the effect of the historical hydrologic drivers on fish community abundance, and allows us to simulate species trajectories and range-wide risk of decline (quasiextinction) under scenarios of future climate. Spectral anomalies are declining over the last 30 years in at least a quarter of the stream gaging stations across the American Southwest and these anomalies are robust predictors of historical abundance of native and non-native fishes. Quasiextinction probabilities are high (>50 %) for nearly ¾ of the native species across several large river basins in the same region; and the negative trend in annual anomalies increases quasiextinction risk for native but reduces this risk for non-native fishes. These findings suggest that ongoing drought is causing range-wide collapse and replacement of native fish faunas, and that this homogenization of western fish faunas will continue given the prevailing negative trend in discharge anomalies. Additionally, this combination of methods can be applied elsewhere as long as environmental and biological long-term time-series data are available. Collectively, these methods allow identifying the link between hydroclimatic forcing and ecological responses and thus may help anticipating the potential impacts of ongoing and future hydrologic extremes in freshwater ecosystems.",

The interior structures of many planets, large moons, asteroids and comet nuclei have been modeled based on their gravitational fields and dynamical parameters derived from precision Doppler and range measurements, often called radio metrics. Advanced instrumentation has resulted in the high level of data quality that enabled scientific breakthroughs. This instrumentation scheme, however, is distributed between elements on the spacecraft and others at the stations of the Deep Space Network (DSN), making the DSN a world-class science instrument. The design and performance of the DSN stations directly determines the quality of the science observables and radio link-based planetary geodesy observations are established by methodologies and capabilities of the DSN. In this paper, we summarize major recent discoveries in planetary geodesy at the rocky planets and the Moon, Saturnian and Jovian satellites, Phobos, and Vesta; experiments and analysis in progress at Ceres and Pluto; upcoming experiments at Jupiter, Saturn and Mars (InSight), and the long-term outlook for approved future missions with geodesy objectives. The DSN’s role will be described along the technical advancements in DSN transmitters, receivers, atomic clocks, and other specialized instrumentation, such as the Advanced Water Vapor Radiometer, Advanced Ranging Instrument, as well as relevant mechanical and electrical components. Advanced techniques for calibrations of known noise sources and Earth’s troposphere, ionosphere, and interplanetary plasma are also presented.

            "abstract": "Deformation experiments on phyllosilicate-rich fault gouges reveal velocity-strengthening behavior and monotonic strength evolution in response to perturbations in slip velocity below ~10-4 ms-1. Fault gouge from the actively creeping zones at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) exhibits similar monotonic strength evolution and has been described in terms of rate-state friction-velocity dependence and ageing behavior. While these parameters provide phenomenological descriptions of gouge rheology on relatively short timescales, they are commonly applied in numerical simulations of repeating earthquakes within the SAF creeping section, often being adjusted arbitrarily in order to match seismological observations. With first assuming a deformation constitutive law, we performed comprehensive microstructural and mechanical characterization of fault gouge from the SAFOD Central Deforming Zone (CDZ). An in-situ displacement sensor was developed to provide direct measurements of gouge deformation under various loading conditions, including constant and variable strain rate and constant and variable shear stress. Constant and variable strain-rate tests confirm previous observations of low shear strength and reveal viscoplastic deformation below the frictional yield strength. Variable loading rate tests demonstrate an apparent yield stress for viscoplastic behavior at low loading rates, and a transition to elastic behavior with increasing loading rate up to 0.02 MPas-1. The elastic response of the gouge constrains the static shear modulus ~500 MPa, providing a lower bound of ~450 ms-1 for the shear velocity of the SAFOD fault core. Our microstructural and mechanical characterization of the gouge is consistent with the physical interpretation of an elastically perfect elastoviscoplastic solid. Parameterizing this model with our experimental data demonstrates general agreement with the observed loading rate-dependence of the gouge and provides a physical description of the deformation mechanisms. By relating the model parameters to micromechanical processes, gouge rheology may be employed as a constraint in models of the SAF creeping section and provides a physical framework for understanding lithological changes on the fault with depth.",

This project developed a proof-of-concept sensor system to map relative carbon dioxide levels to detect potential leaks. Ground tests were performed to verify and calibrate the system including wind tunnel tests to determine the optimal configuration of the system to account for dynamic calibration models required to determine accurate location of gas concentration in (x,y,z,t). Field tests were then conducted over a controlled release of CO2 as well as over controlled rangeland fires which released carbon dioxide over a large area. 3D maps of carbon dioxide were developed from the system telemetry that clearly illustrated increased CO2 levels from the fires.

            "abstract": "The Quake Catcher Network (QCN; qcn.caltech.edu) uses low cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors hosted by volunteers to collect seismic data. Volunteers use accelerometers internal to laptop computers, phones, tablets or small (the size of a matchbox) MEMS sensors plugged into desktop computers using a USB connector to collect scientifically useful data. Data are collected and sent to a central server using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed computing software.\nSince 2008, when the first citizen scientists joined the QCN project, sensors installed in museums, schools, offices, and residences have collected thousands of earthquake records. We present and describe the rapid installations of very dense sensor networks that have been undertaken following several large earthquakes including the 2010 M8.8 Maule Chile, the 2010 M7.1 Darfield, New Zealand, and the 2015 M7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake. These large data sets allowed seismologists to develop new rapid earthquake detection capabilities and closely examine source, path, and site properties that impact ground shaking at a site. We show how QCN has engaged a wide sector of the public in scientific data collection, providing the public with insights into how seismic data are collected and used. Furthermore, we describe how students use data recorded by QCN sensors installed in their classrooms to explore and investigate earthquakes that they felt, as part of ‘teachable moment’ exercises.",

            "abstract": "At present, the only publicly available seismic hazard model for mainland China was generated by Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program in 1999. We are building a new seismic hazard model by integrating historical earthquake catalogs, geological faults, geodetic GPS data, and geology maps. To build the model, we construct an Mw-based homogeneous historical earthquake catalog spanning from 780 B.C. to present, create fault models from active fault data using the methodology recommended by Global Earthquake Model (GEM), and derive a strain rate map based on the most complete GPS measurements and a new strain derivation algorithm. We divide China and the surrounding regions into about 20 large seismic source zones based on seismotectonics. For each zone, we use the tapered Gutenberg-Richter (TGR) relationship to model the seismicity rates. We estimate the TGR a- and b-values from the historical earthquake data, and constrain corner magnitude using the seismic moment rate derived from the strain rate. From the TGR distributions, 10,000 to 100,000 years of synthetic earthquakes are simulated. Then, we distribute small and medium earthquakes according to locations and magnitudes of historical earthquakes. Some large earthquakes are distributed on active faults based on characteristics of the faults, including slip rate, fault length and width, and paleoseismic data, and the rest to the background based on the distributions of historical earthquakes and strain rate. We evaluate available ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) by comparison to observed ground motions. To apply appropriate GMPEs, we divide the region into active and stable tectonics. The seismic hazard will be calculated using the OpenQuake software developed by GEM. To account for site amplifications, we construct a site condition map based on geology maps. The resulting new seismic hazard map can be used for seismic risk analysis and management, and business and land-use planning.",

The regional attenuation pattern is extracted from the ensemble of observations using a regularized inversion scheme. Preliminary results from the analysis of four events show good correlation with tectonic boundaries. The lowest apparent attenuation occurs in the upper Midwest, and corresponds to the Superior Craton; while high apparent attenuation dominates outside the cratonic continent as defined by the Rocky Mountain, Ouachita and Appalachian fronts.

            "abstract": "The triple disaster of the March 11, 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent radiation releases at Fukushima Dai-ichi were unprecedented events for the ocean and society. This presentation will provide an overview of studies of Fukushima radionuclides in the ocean. The radioactive releases from Fukushima will be compared to natural and prior human sources. The fate of cesium is largely determined by its soluble nature in seawater, though uptake in sediments does occur via cesium’s association with both detrital particles and biological uptake and sedimentation. Cesium’s continued supply from the rivers and ongoing leakages at the nuclear power plants suggests that coastal sediments may remain contaminated for decades to come. Although levels of cesium in the ocean and being released from Fukushima more than four years later are orders of magnitude lower than in 2011, other isotopes such as strontium-90 remain of interest as they are elevated relative to cesium in the groundwater and storage tanks at the reactor site. Across the Pacific, Fukushima cesium is starting to be detectable along the west coast of North America. Although models suggest cesium will be at levels well below those considered of human health concern, the public is worried about the lack of ocean monitoring of Fukushima radionuclides. We addressed these public concerns by creating “Our Radioactive Ocean” a citizen-scientist crowd-funded campaign that provides a sampling kit that can use to sample their favorite beach. Once collected, samples are returned to WHOI for analyses of the isotopes of cesium that allow us to distinguish Fukushima cesium from other sources (\nhttp://OurRadioactiveOcean.org\n). However to measure the low levels of cesium already in the ocean 20 liter samples are needed. To increase public participation, we will also present results from a new wearable sample collector, the “RadBand” which contains a small amount of cesium selective resin that surfers and swimmers can wear on their ankle. A prototype RadBand is being tested as part of The Longest Swim, an attempt by Ben Lecomte to swim from Tokyo to San Francisco (\nhttp://thelongestswim.com/\n). This swim is being used as another way to engage the public on ocean and environmental issues.",

During the main phases of moderate storms (with minimum Dst between -50 nT and -100 nT), ions of energies < 50 keV and electrons of energies of <35 keV contribute more significantly to the ring current energy than those of higher energies. During the recovery phase and quiet times higher energy protons dominate the ring current energy content. For the March 29, 2013 moderate storm, the contribution from O+ is ~25% of the ring current energy content during the main phase, and the majority of that comes from < 50 keV O+. This indicates that even during moderate geomagnetic storms the ionosphere is still an important contributor to the ring current ions and low energy O+ plays an important role in ring current dynamics. The contribution of electrons to the ring current energy content is up to ~7% during this moderate storm and the magnetic local time dependence of electron energy density is also investigated. However, the ring current energy partitions for different species and energy ranges are very different during the great storm of 17 March 2015 (with minimum Dst<-210 nT).",

            "abstract": "Continuous paleoclimate records are scarce from terrestrial sites in Southern California beyond the Last Glacial Period (i.e. Marine Isotope Stage 2, MIS 2). Baldwin Lake in the Big Bear Valley, San Bernardino Mountains (SBM), is a playa lake in the ecotone between desert and Mediterranean climate and vegetation. We recovered a 27 m core from the site in 2012, which spans ~96 – 10 ka, based upon radiocarbon dating, infrared stimulated luminescence dating, and orbital tuning. Total organic content, total carbonate content, density, magnetic susceptibility, x-ray fluorescence, and grain size data show a lake system that responded in tandem with Marine Isotope State transitions. After the basin closed during MIS 5b, Baldwin Lake was productive for MIS 5a, then cycled through an inorganic phase to a highly organic lowstand by the end of MIS 4. A stratified lake of rapidly-deposited organic silt prevailed throughout MIS 3, then shifted to an inorganic, slow sedimentation regime during MIS 2. Paleoecological data (charcoal and fossil pollen) suggest that the Valley was most prone to wildfire during climate transitions (e.g. the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, ~21 ka). Forest cover was dominated by pine for much of the basin’s history, save for the dry period at the onset of MIS 2, and a greater presence of oak woodland at the beginning of MIS 3. The reduced pine cover and increased sagebrush steppe in early MIS 2 suggests a more arid landscape of sagebrush steppe c. 29 – 25 ka, before reverting to wet conditions by the LGM. Throughout MIS 5a – 2, lake organic content fluctuates in tandem with solar radiation values; a possible link between lake productivity and insolation is currently being explored with biogenic silica (BiSi) analysis. The lake was desiccated by ~10 ka, perhaps driven by increasing insolation rates at the onset of MIS 1. ",

            "abstract": "The H2O layers of large icy satellites such as Ganymede, Callisto, or Titan probably include a liquid water ocean sandwiched between the deep high-pressure ice layer and the outer ice I shell [1]. It has been recently suggested that the high-pressure ice layer could be decoupled from the silicate core by a salty liquid water layer [2]. However, it is not clear whether accumulation of liquids at the bottom of the high-pressure layer is possible due to positive buoyancy of water with respect to high-pressure ice. Numerical simulation of this two-phase (i.e. ice and water) problem is challenging, which explains why very few studies have self-consistently handled the presence and transport of liquids within the solid ice [e.g. 3]. While using a simplified description of water production and transport, it was recently showed in [4] that (i) a significant fraction of the high-pressure layer reaches the melting point and (ii) the melt generation and its extraction to the overlying ocean significantly influence the global thermal evolution and interior structure of the large icy moons.\nHere, we treat the high-pressure ice layer as a compressible mixture of solid ice and liquid water [5]. Several aspects are investigated: (i) the effect of the water formation on the vigor of solid-state convection and its influence on the amount of heat that is transferred from the silicate mantle to the ocean; (ii) the fate of liquids within the upper thermal boundary layer – whether they freeze or reach the ocean; and (iii) the effect of salts and volatile compounds (potentially released from the rocky core) on the melting/freezing processes. Investigation of these aspects will allow us to address the thermo-chemical evolution of the internal ocean which is crucial to evaluate the astrobiological potential of large icy moons.\nThis work has been performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.\n[1] Hussmann et al.

SST variability in the JES and the ensuing air-sea process are important for local winter atmospheric condition. It is believed that the marginal sea processes also influence the storm track evolution far downstream. Dynamical processes leading to local and remote atmospheric circulation response to leading JES SST anomaly patterns are investigated using a hemispheric WRF atmospheric model with two-way multi-nesting capabilities. The atmospheric circulation in direct contact with anomalous diabatic forcing exhibits a linear baroclinic response with respect to sign of SST anomalies; that is, the northwesterly surface wind is strengthened (weakened) and the local precipitin is enhanced (reduced) over the warm (cold) SSTs. The linearity of the local response confirms the importance of fine-scale SST patterns to the predictability of regional weather and climate conditions. The downstream response, in contrast, is nonlinear, with an enhanced intraseasonal equivalent barotropic ridge emerging in the Gulf of Alaska irrespective of the polarity of JES SST anomalies. This downstream blocking high response is maintained by the positive low-frequency height tendency due to transient eddy vorticity flux convergence associated with altered storm track. The significant remote response in the North Pacific storm track and the blocking suggests that the marginal sea process is an active part of the North Pacific climate variability.",

            "abstract": "The PACE (Pre- Aerosol, Clouds and ocean Ecosystem) mission, anticipated for launch in the early 2020s is designed to characterize oceanic and atmospheric properties. The primary instrument on-board will be a moderate resolution (~1 km nadir) radiometer, called the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI). OCI’s main purpose will be to enhance current science in aquatic biogeochemistry by offering greater capability than either MODIS or SeaWiFS. To do so, OCI will provide high spectral resolution (5 nm) from the UV to NIR (350 – 800 nm), with additional spectral bands in the NIR and SWIR to support atmospheric correction. Supplementary instruments, such as a multi-angle imaging polarimeter are also being discussed, and these supplementary instruments are associated with the atmospheric objectives of the mission, although they may also offer important new measurements for oceanic objectives. However, the OCI itself is an excellent instrument for atmospheric objectives, providing measurements across a broad spectral range that in essence combines the capabilities of MODIS and OMI, but with the UV channels from OMI to be available at moderate resolution. In preparation for the PACE mission we have begun the theoretical work necessary to create a robust, operational aerosol retrieval for OCI. This retrieval is based on the MODIS Dark Target aerosol retrieval over ocean that returns aerosol optical depth and an estimate of aerosol size distribution. It then uses these retrieved parameters to constrain a retrieval of aerosol absorption in the UV, using the OCI UV channels. The algorithm is described and its sensitivity to retrieval assumptions is tested. The goal is to understand the limitations of such an algorithm and under what conditions could we expect to obtain quantitative aerosol absorption information from OCI on PACE.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is one of the most frequently limiting nutrients to terrestrial ecosystem productivity worldwide. As atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise, progressive N limitation is expected to constrain the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to store additional C, making an understanding of N inputs to terrestrial ecosystems increasingly important. In temperate forests, rock reservoirs and biological N fixation (BNF) represent two significant, but poorly characterized, inputs of bioavailable N. Recent research has demonstrated that bedrock can provide a substantial amount of ecosystem-available N in moderate-to-high relief areas with N-rich sedimentary bedrock. In these same ecosystems, asymbiotic BNF performed by heterotrophic microbes in plant litter can provide an additional N input of up to ~2 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Here, we tested the hypothesis that rock N inputs support increased litter BNF via enhanced ecosystem N fertility. We measured rates of BNF along with rock, soil, foliage, and litter chemistry across sites varying substantially in rock N concentrations (from 32 to 800 ppm N). The sites are dominated by Douglas fir and share similar climates and landscape positions (eroding slopes), yet display marked increases in foliar and soil N content as a function of rock N concentrations (foliar: R2=0.18, p<0.001, soil: R2=0.50, p=0.001). We found a significant positive correlation between rock N content and litter BNF rates (R2=0.11, p=0.0035), with rates of BNF at sites with greater than 400 ppm N in bedrock more than double rates of BNF at sites with lower than 400 ppm N in bedrock (p<0.001). These patterns could not be explained by increases in other rock-derived nutrients such as phosphorus or molybdenum, as neither of these known BNF controls increased over the rock N gradient. We found declining foliar lignin:N ratios with increased rock N, suggesting that rock N inputs can increase litter quality, supporting greater microbial activity, including BNF.",

            "abstract": "In order to make inferences about measurements and their relationship to model data it is essential to understand their uncertainty. Satellite retrievals of trace gas mixing ratios usually quantify uncertainty by using a retrieval error covariance matrix. This work evaluates the consistency of the reported error covariance of retrievals of XCO2 from the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) algorithm applied to the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2). The approach approximates inflation factors using a posteriori diagnostics derived from the state estimation of fields of CO2 mixing ratios in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System 5 (GEOS-5) model. A significant benefit of applying these diagnostics to the state estimation problem, as opposed to the inversion problem, is that they are able to separate retrieval errors from transport errors. The estimated retrieval error inflation factors for ACOS V3.4 are the greatest over Northern Africa and Australia. This presentation shows that over Northern Africa, the need for inflation is most likely due to the bias correction, and over Australia, the need for inflation is most likely due to uncertainty in the aerosol parameterization. The impact of the inflation is then assessed by comparing the results of the state estimation with and without inflation against in situ observations.",

            "abstract": "The importance of weather-driven renewable energies for the United States energy portfolio is growing. The main perceived problems with weather-driven renewable energies are their intermittent nature, low power density, and high costs. The Cooperative Institute for the Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado collaborated with the Earth Systems Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to construct a mathematical optimization of a reduced form of the US electric sector. Care was taken to retain salient features of the electric sector, while allowing for detailed weather and power data to be incorporated for wind and solar energies. The National Energy with Weather System (NEWS) simulator was created.\nWith the NEWS simulator tests can be performed that are unique and insightful. The simulator can maintain the status quo and build out a system following costs or imposed targets for carbon dioxide emission reductions. It can find the least cost electric sector for each state, or find a national power system that incorporates vast amounts of variable generation.\nIn the current presentation, we will focus on one of the most unique aspects of the NEWS simulator; the ability to specify a specific amount of wind and/or solar each hour for a three-year historical period for the least total cost. The simulator can find where to place wind and solar to reduce variability (ramping requirements for back-up generators). The amount of variable generation each hour is very different to an RPS type standard because the generators need to work in concert for long periods of time. The results indicate that for very similar costs the amount of back-up generation (natural gas or storage) can be reduced significantly.",

            "abstract": "Evan Hirakawa, Arben Pitarka, and Robert Mellors\nOne challenging task in explosion seismology is development of physical models for explaining the generation of S-waves during underground explosions. Pitarka et al. (2015) used finite difference simulations of SPE-3 (part of Source Physics Experiment, SPE, an ongoing series of underground chemical explosions at the Nevada National Security Site) and found that while a large component of shear motion was generated directly at the source, additional scattering from heterogeneous velocity structure and topography are necessary to better match the data. Large-scale features in the velocity model used in the SPE simulations are well constrained, however, small-scale heterogeneity is poorly constrained. In our study we used a stochastic representation of small-scale variability in order to produce additional high-frequency scattering. Two methods for generating the distributions of random scatterers are tested. The first is done in the spatial domain by essentially smoothing a set of random numbers over an ellipsoidal volume using a Gaussian weighting function. The second method consists of filtering a set of random numbers in the wavenumber domain to obtain a set of heterogeneities with a desired statistical distribution (Frankel and Clayton, 1986). This method is capable of generating distributions with either Gaussian or von Karman autocorrelation functions. The key parameters that affect scattering are the correlation length, the standard deviation of velocity for the heterogeneities, and the Hurst exponent, which is only present in the von Karman media. Overall, we find that shorter correlation lengths as well as higher standard deviations result in increased tangential motion in the frequency band of interest (0 – 10 Hz). This occurs partially through S-wave refraction, but mostly by P-S and Rg-S waves conversions.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344",

            "abstract": "The injection of a volcanic plume introduces a dynamic, localized, short-term heterogeneity in the atmosphere. Satellite-imagery based remote sensing techniques provide good spatial coverage for the detection of such plumes, but slow satellite repeat times (>30 minutes) and cloud cover can delay, if not entirely prevent, the detection. GPS, in turn, provides excellent temporal coverage, but requires favorable satellite-station-geometry such that the signal propagates through the plume if it is to be used for plume detection and analysis. Two methods exist to detect / analyze ash plumes with GPS: (a) Ash-heavy plumes result in signal dispersion and hence a lowered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A lowered SNR, recorded by some receivers, can provide useful information about the plume, such as location and velocity of ascent. These data can be evaluated directly as they are recorded by the receiver; without the need of solving for a receiver’s position. (b) Wet plumes refract the GPS signals piercing the plume and hence induce a propagation delay. When solving for a receiver position GPS analysis tools do not model this localized phase delay effect and solutions for plume-piercing satellites do not fit the data well. This can be exploited for plume analysis such as the estimation of changes to the atmospheric refractivity index.\nWe analyze GPS data of the ~2 month 2010 Eyafjallajökull erption and the week-long 2011 Grímsvötn eruption to infer a first order estimate of plume geometry and its progression. Using SNR and phase delay information, we evaluate the evolution of the partitioning of wet versus dry parts of the plume. During the GPS processing we iteratively solve for phase-delay and position and fix other parameters, hence reducing the mapping of least-squares misfit into position estimates and other parameters. Nearly continuous webcam imagery provides independent observations of first-order plume characteristics for the Eyafjallajökull event.",

These types of computer simulations have no analytical solutions with which to compare, so we use qualitative and quantitative inter-code comparisons to check if they are operating satisfactorily. To date we have tested the codes against benchmark exercises that incorporate a range of features, including single and multiple planar faults, single rough faults, slip-weakening, rate-state, and thermal pressurization friction, elastic and visco-plastic off-fault behavior, complete stress drops that lead to extreme ground motion, heterogeneous initial stresses, and heterogeneous material (rock) structure. Our goal is reproducibility, and we focus on the types of earthquake-simulation assumptions that have been or will be used in basic studies of earthquake physics, or in direct applications to specific earthquake hazard problems. Our group’s goals are to make sure that when our earthquake-simulation codes simulate these types of earthquake scenarios along with the resulting simulated strong ground shaking, that the codes are operating as expected.

            "abstract": "The traditional management systems of the Mixteca Alta Region of Oaxaca, Mexico offer historical lessons about resilience to climatic variability. We interviewed small farmers to inquire about the dynamics of abandonment and persistence of a traditional management systems. We interpret farmers' narratives from a perspective of general agroecological resilience. In addition, we facilitated workshops in small farmers described their adaptation to past climate challenges and identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. The most recent years presented increasingly extreme climatic and socioeconomic hardships: increased temperatures, delayed rainy seasons, reduced capacity of soils to retain soil moisture, changing cultural norms, and reduced rural labor. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers' climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-level indicators to be improved. Transformative change is required to develop novel cropping systems and complementary activities to agriculture that will allow for farming to be sustained in the face of these challenges. Climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.",

During the early Holocene, western Greenland Ice Sheet retreat in the Disko Bugt region was punctuated by rapid and dramatic advances, likely in response to abrupt climate changes at 9.3 and 8.2 ka. The character of early Holocene decadal-scale temperature and precipitation changes in western Greenland remains unknown, however, so direct comparison of climate and ice sheet reconstructions currently is not possible.

            "abstract": "Like continental environments, sinuous channels are common geomorphic features on deep-marine slopes. However unlike their fluvial counterparts well developed lateral accretion surfaces related to episodes of lateral channel migration are comparatively rare. Instead most deep-marine channels fill aggradationally. This, then, begs the question as to the nature and origin of the seemingly uncommon sedimentological conditions that result in laterally accreting deep-marine channels.\nIn the Neoproterozoic Windermere Supergroup (WSG) channels filled with well developed lateral accretion surfaces are well exposed and occur at the top of much larger, aggradationally-filled (sinuous) channels, or as isolated clusters. Channel fills are 10-15 m thick and consist of amalgamated beds of decimeter-thick, very coarse sandstone/granule conglomerate. These, in turn, are overlain abruptly vertically and obliquely-upward by mudstone interbedded with thin-bedded turbidites. These finer, thinner strata are interpreted to be the inner-bend levee deposits onto which the channel-filling, thicker-bedded, coarser grained strata onlap. Moreover, the successive several-meter-scale lateral-offset stacking of these strata is interpreted to be caused by the continuous lateral migration of a single channel. Notably also these strata are generally coarser than those that fill the many other WSG channels that lack lateral accretion. The coarseness, but more importantly the bimodal grain size distribution of the sediment supply, is interpreted to have had caused the channelized flows to be highly density stratified, and for density to be equally distributed throughout the lower part of the flow. Together these conditions caused the momentum and related fluid circulation patterns in the lower part of the flow to resemble those observed in rivers, and hence sediment transport patterns to be meandering-river-like with deposition along the inner bend and erosion along the outer bend.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, hydropower accounted for only 16% of the world electricity production, with other renewable sources totaling 3%. Thus, it is not surprising that when alternatives are evaluated for new energy developments, there is strong impulse for fossil fuel or nuclear energy as opposed to renewable sources. However, as hydropower schemes are often part of a multipurpose water resources development project, they can often help to finance other components of the project. In addition, hydropower systems and their associated dams and reservoirs provide human well-being benefits, such as flood control and irrigation, and societal benefits such as increased recreational activities and improved navigation. Furthermore, hydropower due to its associated reservoir storage, can provide flexibility and reliability for energy production in integrated energy systems. The storage capability of hydropower systems act as a regulating mechanism by which other intermittent and variable renewable energy sources (wind, wave, solar) can play a larger role in providing electricity of commercial quality.\nMinimizing water consumption for producing hydropower is critical given that overuse of water for energy production may result in a shortage of water for other purposes such as irrigation, navigation or fish passage. This paper presents a dimensional analysis for finding optimal flow discharge and optimal penstock diameter when designing impulse and reaction water turbines for hydropower systems. The objective of this analysis is to provide general insights for minimizing water consumption when producing hydropower. This analysis is based on the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the penstock, the total hydraulic head and the desired power production. As part of this analysis, various dimensionless relationships between power production, flow discharge and head losses were derived. These relationships were used to withdraw general insights on determining optimal flow discharge and optimal penstock diameter. For instance, it was found that for minimizing water consumption, the ratio of head loss to gross head should not exceed about 15%. Two examples of application are presented to illustrate the procedure for determining optimal flow discharge and optimal penstock diameter for impulse and reaction turbines.",

Here, we produce broadband synthetic seismograms for the 2003 M8.3 Tokachi-Oki, Japan earthquake. At long periods (> 1 sec), synthetic waveforms are produced using numerical simulations with the 3D Japan Integrated Velocity Structure Model (Koketsu et al., 2008). For comparison, these 3D numerical simulations were carried out using both (1) a finite difference method and (2) the finite element code, SPECFEM3D. The 3D simulations were used to validate a compound rupture model, in which slip on the fault consisted of multiple M7 high stress drop asperities superimposed on a background slip distribution with longer rise times. At short periods (< 1 sec), we used a summation of stochastic seismograms from point sources, and combined the short and long period synthetics using a matched filter. We compared the broadband synthetics to actual waveform data and the observed response spectral accelerations from the Tokachi-Oki event. We found that the synthetic response spectra are sensitive to the coherence of the rupture front. This work serves to validate this methodology for predicting ground motions for future M8-9 megathrust events in Cascadia.",

            "abstract": "Recent work suggests the distribution of methane emissions from fracking operations is a skewed distributed with a small percentage of emitters contributing a large proportion of the total emissions. In order to provide a statistically robust distributions of emitters and determine the presence of super-emitters, errors in current techniques need to be constrained and mitigated. The Marcellus shale, the most productive natural gas shale field in the United States, has received less intense focus for well-level emissions and is here investigated to provide the distribution of methane emissions.\nIn July of 2015 approximately 250 unique well pads were sampled using the Princeton Atmospheric Chemistry Mobile Acquisition Node (PAC-MAN). This mobile lab includes a Garmin GPS unit, Vaisala weather station (WTX520), LICOR 7700 CH4 open path sensor and LICOR 7500 CO2/H2O open path sensor. Sampling sites were preselected based on wind direction, sampling distance and elevation grade. All sites were sampled during low boundary layer conditions (600-1000 and 1800-2200 local time). The majority of sites were sampled 1-3 times while selected test sites were sampled multiple times or resampled several times during the day. For selected sites a sampling tower was constructed consisting of a Metek uSonic-3 Class A sonic anemometer, and an additional LICOR 7700 and 7500. Data were recorded for at least one hour at these sites.\nA robust study and inter-comparison of different methodologies will be presented. The Gaussian plume model will be used to calculate fluxes for all sites and compare results from test sites with multiple passes. Tower data is used to provide constraints on the Gaussian plume model. Additionally, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling will be used to calculate emissions from the tower sites. Alternative techniques will also be discussed. Results from these techniques will be compared to identify best practices and provide robust error estimates.",

            "abstract": "Though designed to measure soil moisture, the SMAP radiometer is an excellent sensor to measure sea surface salinity and sea surface wind speed. It is possible to retrieve both quantities from passive SMAP observations without using the SMAP radar, whose transmitter likely failed in July 2015.\nWith the demise of Aquarius the ability of the SMAP sensor to measure ocean salinity has gained importance. The main part of our presentation discusses the adaption of the Aquarius salinity retrieval algorithm to SMAP. It includes corrections for spurious signals coming from cold space, the galaxy, the sun and the moon as well as sidelobe and cross polarization effects from the SMAP antenna. Based on Aquarius observations, we have developed a radiative transfer model that characterizes the surface emission of a wind roughened ocean. Our surface roughness correction for the SMAP salinity retrieval will use match-ups of SMAP radiometer observations and surface wind speeds from WindSat or SSMIS.\nOur presentation will also address several important differences between the Aquarius and SMAP sensors that impact the ocean salinity retrievals. The full 360o look capability of SMAP makes it possible to take observations from the forward and backward looking direction basically at the same instance of time. We expect that this two-look capability will strongly aid the salinity retrievals. It will be possible to observe some of the spurious contamination sources like the reflected galaxy or the reflected sun from two different directions.\nFinally, we will address the capability to measure ocean surface wind speed with the SMAP radiometer. As it has been demonstrated with Aquarius and SMOS the L-band passive ocean surface emission exhibits very good sensitivity to surface wind speeds to at least 35 m/s and it is very little affected by precipitation. This allows the retrieval of ocean surface winds, in particular in storms and even under rainy conditions.",

            "abstract": "Passive microwave (PM) observations of soil moisture (SM), like those produced from data observed by the AMSR-E, WindSat, AMSR2, and SMOS instruments, provide global soil moisture data sets with moderate resolution (~25km), reasonable accuracy (±10%), and short revisit times (2-3 days). A principal source of the current error in these SM data sets is due to heterogeneous topography below the native resolution of the PM instrument. A single PM antenna footprint may encompass surface water, dense and/or sparse vegetation, and bare soil. We show that by using high resolution (~250m) visible/infrared (VIS/IR) observations to estimate the fractions of water, vegetation, and bare soil in each PM footprint, we can deconvolve the brightness temperatures from each individual component. This allows for greatly increased accuracy in the remotely sensed soil moisture content. We will present our results in applying this technique to the WindSat soil moisture algorithm using WindSat PM data and vegetation and water fraction estimates derived from MODIS VIS/IR data.",

            "abstract": "Accurate modeling of outlet glacier dynamics requires knowledge of many factors—ice thickness, bed topography, air/ocean temperature, precipitation rate—specific to individual glaciers, and for which only limited data exists. Furthermore, key processes such as iceberg calving remain poorly understood and difficult to include in models. In light of these challenges to even the most sophisticated models, there is great value in simple, computationally efficient models that can capture first-order effects. Many of the simplest models currently in use produce glacier profiles along a central flowline, either ignoring the contribution of tributaries or relying on a measure of “equivalent width” to handle those contributions. Here, we present a simple model that generalizes Nye’s 1953 perfect plastic approximation so that it also predicts the position of the glacier terminus based on the yield strength. Moreover, our model simulates not only a central flowline, but the interactions of a network of tributaries. The model requires only minimal information: glacier geometry (network structure and bed topography, available from observation for select glaciers) and basal shear strength (a reasonably-constrained parameter). We apply the model to Columbia Glacier, Alaska and show that, despite its simplicity, the model is able to reproduce observed centerline profiles and terminus retreat for the main branch as well as selected tributaries. Finally, we illustrate how our model can be applied to constrain the calving contribution of individual glaciers to 21st century sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "The climate of Mars during the late Noachian 3-4 Ga remains a long-standing mystery. Over the last three decades, the key debate has been whether the valley networks and other fluvial features were carved by rain in a warm, wet Earth-like climate or by snowmelt in a mainly cold climate. Recently, it has become clear that close intercomparison between the geology and 3D climate model predictions can be used to move this debate forward. Here I describe new work comparing three-dimensional simulations under warm and cold climate scenarios with the surface distribution of valley networks. I discuss how the lack of periglacial landforms at equatorial latitudes (the ‘periglacial paradox’) and destabilizing climate influence of Tharsis can be used to rule out scenarios where the surface water inventory was extremely high, indicating a mainly cold, snowmelt-driven scenario for valley network formation is most likely. Finally, I discuss plausible episodic warming mechanisms and the importance of early Mars to our conception of exoplanet habitability.",

Reactions in the sediment bed affect these tails, and their tempering provides information about the reaction rate. These effects are notoriously difficult to measure directly, due to the low concentrations present in the tails, which leads us to ask if other signatures of reactive anomalous transport can be sought. We adopt a stochastic transport framework to quantify the effect of sediment bed reactions on the peak of the breakthrough curves. This allows us to extract information about the bed reaction rates based on conservative and reactive peak values. We then validate our results in the context of a simple model that represents transport in an idealized river.",

            "abstract": "In November 2011, three M≥4.8 earthquakes and thousands of aftershocks occurred along the structurally complex Wilzetta fault system near Prague, Oklahoma. Previous studies suggest that fluid injection in nearby wells was responsible for inducing the M4.8 foreshock [Keranen et al., 2013], which subsequently triggered the M5.6 mainshock [Sumy et al., 2014]. We examine earthquake source properties using waveforms collected by 47 temporary and permanent seismic stations installed within ~100 km of the events. Brune stress drops are calculated for a subset of 278 aftershocks of the Prague, Oklahoma sequence that range in magnitude from M1.0-4.9. We compute the horizontal amplitude spectra and smooth the spectra with a Konno and Ohmachi [1998] filter. We then assume a standard Brune source spectral model and iteratively solve for seismic moment (Mo), corner frequency (fc) and kappa (κ) using a Gauss-Newton method. We are able to recover reasonably fit Mo, fc, and κ for 172 earthquakes, but find the Mo determined by spectra fit are consistently overestimated for events with M<1.5. Therefore only stress drops for the 149 events with initial Mo > 1.5 are reported. The median stress drop is ~0.3 MPa (3 bars), which is significantly lower than typical values (10+ MPa) observed for CEUS events. We find minimal dependence of stress drop on focal depth for the depth range from 1-10 km. However, we observe some spatial variation of stress drops, with higher stress drops observed near the intersection of the mainshock rupture plane with the fault plane associated with the M4.8 aftershock. The low stress drops observed for events on both the foreshock and mainshock fault plane may indicate both of these segments of the Wilzetta fault system were influenced by local wastewater injection. Our results echo those of several recent studies [Hough, 2014; Sun and Hartzell, 2014], which conclude that induced earthquakes have lower stress drops than tectonic events.",

Researchers have often used gravity corers or piston corers to collect sediments and bottom seawater for estimating methane fluxes of these seeps. The actual sampling locations of these corers are difficult to match seeping vents detected by scientific echo sounder because of the difficulty in positioning of these corers when sampling at sea,. Thus, the hydrocarbon fluxes of the seeping vents estimated using these corers might not be representative hydrocarbon fluxes of seeping vents in the northern South China Sea. In this study, we used a real-time video multicorer to collect surface sediments and bottom seawater samples. This real-time multicorer can accurately obtain surface sediments and bottom seawater samples on hydrocarbon seeping vents. To estimate hydrocarbon diffusion fluxes of seeps in the northern South China Sea, we analyzed methane concentrations and carbon isotopes of methane in both porewater and bottom seawater. During the cruises conducted from August to December, 2014, methane fluxes in the study area ranged from 3 to 57000 μmol m−2 d−1 which are significantly higher than previously reported values (~160 μmol m−2 d−1). Besides, we have obtained some samples in the study area using real-time multicorer in 2015. These new results will be presented in the meeting. Overall, the observed result in this study suggests that the in-situ multicorer can be a suitable instrument sampling surface sediments and bottom seawater samples on hydrocarbon seeping vents.",

As a step to develop seismic hazard maps for mainland China, we compiled a homogeneous MW-based historical earthquake catalog. We started from an MS-based Chinese catalog spanning from 780 B.C. to present. We compared MS from the catalog with Mw for common earthquakes in the ISC-GEM and GCMT catalogs, and derived MS- MW regression relationships using orthogonal least square method. We derived regression relationships for different time periods considering the following factors: 1) Chinese seismograph network density has been improved with time; 2) the methodology for determining earthquake magnitude and location in the Chinese catalog has changed through time; and 3) different seismographs were used in different times. We also derived separate regression relationships for small and large events since the parameters of large events are usually reevaluated in the Chinese catalog. For events included in the ISC-GEM or GCMT catalogs, we use the location and magnitude from those catalogs. For other events, we used the location from the Chinese catalog and the converted MW. The final catalog has about 5,000 earthquakes of MW 4.5 and larger. The catalog is more complete for eastern China than western China because eastern China has much longer history of human settlement.\n  Key words\n  Earthquake catalog in mainland China, Surface magnitude, Moment magnitude, orthogonal regression.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthetic seasonality couples the evolutionary ecology of plant leaves to large-scale rhythms of carbon and water exchanges that are important feedbacks to climate. However, the extent, magnitude, and controls on photosynthetic seasonality of carbon-rich tropical forests are poorly resolved, controversial in the remote sensing literature, and inadequately represented in most earth system models. Here we show that ecosystem-scale phenology (measured by photosynthetic capacity), rather than environmental seasonality, is the primary driver of photosynthetic seasonality at four Amazon evergreen forests spanning gradients in rainfall seasonality, forest composition, and flux seasonality. We further demonstrate that leaf ontogeny and demography explain most of this ecosystem phenology at two central Amazon evergreen forests, using a simple leaf-cohort canopy model that integrates eddy covariance-derived CO2 fluxes, novel near-surface camera-detected leaf phenology, and ground observations of litterfall and leaf physiology. The coordination of new leaf growth and old leaf divestment (litterfall) during the dry season shifts canopy composition towards younger leaves with higher photosynthetic efficiency, driving large seasonal increases (~27%) in ecosystem photosynthetic capacity. Leaf ontogeny and demography thus reconciles disparate observations of forest seasonality from leaves to eddy flux towers to satellites. Strategic incorporation of such whole-plant coordination processes as phenology and ontogeny will improve ecological, evolutionary and earth system theories describing tropical forests structure and function, allowing more accurate representation of forest dynamics and feedbacks to climate in earth system models.",

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is one of the most widely used indices for monitoring drought. The SPI can reflect the deficit or surplus of precipitation at different time scales, thus it can be used for drought monitoring at these time scales. At present, more than 30 precipitation datasets are available with different resolutions and scales. This study compares seven of the precipitation datasets with relatively long records and high spatial resolutions to determine which is most appropriate for drought monitoring. These datasets include CRU (Climatic Research Unit) time series precipitation dataset, GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology Centre) dataset, PREC/L (Precipitation Reconstruction over Land) dataset, University of Delaware Precipitation dataset, PRISM dataset, NLDAS (North American Land Data Assimilation System) dataset, and CPC (CPC US Unified Precipitation) dataset. Monthly SPI were calculated using these different precipitation datasets for the period from 1980 to 2010 over the United States (PRISM, NLDAS and CPC) or at the global scale (CRU, GPCC, PREC/L, U. Del). GLDAS Noah soil moisture data were used for evaluating the SPI datasets. Our monthly and seasonally analyses indicate that over the United States, PRISM is most representative of soil moisture conditions, and at a global scale, CRU dataset is most representative of soil moisture conditions.",

In the Tropical Andes, Paramos form an archipelago-like pattern from Northern Colombia to Central Peru that effectively captures atmospheric moisture originated in the Amazon-Orinoco basins, while marking the highest altitude capable of sustaining vegetation growth (i.e., ‘the edge’). This study investigates the role of land management on mediating soil carbon stocks and fluxes in Paramo ecosystems of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. Observations were collected at a Paramo site strongly modified by land use change, including active potato plantations, pasture, tillage, and land abandonment. Results show that undisturbed Paramos soils have high total organic carbon (TOC), high soil water content (SWC), and low soil CO2 efflux (RS) rates. However, Paramo soils that experience human intervention show lower TOC, higher and more variable RS rates, and lower SWC. This study demonstrates that changes in land use in Paramos affect differentially the accumulation and exchange of soil carbon with the atmosphere and offers implications for management and protection strategies of what has been deemed the fastest evolving biodiversity ecosystem in the world.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity’s APXS investigation of the Murray Fm. (sols 755 - 950) at lower Aeolis Mons (Mt. Sharp) in Gale Crater, Mars has revealed (Mg, Ni)-sulfate diagenetic features and dark gray Ca-rich veins. The (Mg, Ni)-sulfate features occur as ~2 cm wide dendritic and botryoidal concretions that stand out in relief ~1 cm above the mudstone surface. APXS rasters over the features (Moenkopi, Mammoth, Morrison, Rosamond, Potatoe; sols 758 - 810) resulted in 1:1 molar variation of S and Mg consistent with a MgSO4 phase. The sulfate is not pure; the features are a mixture of 10 - 15% MgSO4 with the host mudstone. This mixture suggests the sulfates precipitated within pre-existing pore spaces, or were partially dissolved and replaced by sediment, preserving the crystal morphology. The sulfate features are enriched in Ni (2000 – 4250 ppm), indicating Ni-sulfate. The Murray Fm. mudstones that host the diagenetic features range to high SiO2 (60–73 wt%) and have bulk elemental signatures that are consistent with alteration by acid leaching. Low MgO (3.0 wt%) and low Ni (100 – 300 ppm) in the most apparently altered (highest SiO2) mudstones may link the acidic alteration with the fluids that formed the (Mg, Ni)-sulfates. Diagenetic Ca-sulfate-bearing veins that were abundant across Aeolis Palus persist at lower Aeolis Mons. A new vein type containing dark gray material as a separate crystalline phase within white Ca-sulfate veins was discovered in a cluster of veins in the Murray Fm. (Coalville, Alvord Mt., Amboy; sols 930 – 948). APXS rasters of the dark-toned material indicate high CaO (20 - 30 wt%) without concomitant increases in SO3. Ge (up to 650 ppm; 6.5X surrounding bedrock) and MnO (up to 1.0 wt%; 4X surrounding bedrock) are both enriched in the dark veins. These chemical observations are consistent with fluorite, although F (L.O.D. >5%) is not detectable in APXS spectra. The diagenetic features indicate that Ca, Mg, and Ni were mobilized with S in aqueous fluids, and that F may have played a role in the acidic alteration of the Murray Fm.",

            "abstract": "Science outreach demystifies science, and outreach media gives scientists a voice to engage the public. Today scientists are expected to communicate effectively not only with peers but also with a braod public audience, yet training incentiives are sometimes scarce. Media creation training is even less emphasized. Editing video to modern standards takes practice; arrangling light and framing shots isn't intuitive. While great tutorials exist, learning videography, story boarding, editing and sharing techniques will always require a commitment of time and effort. Yet ideally sharing science should be low-hanging fruit. FrontierScientists, a science-sharing website funded by the NSF, seeks to let scientists display their breakthroughs and share their excitement for their work with the public by working closely yet non-exhaustively with a professional media team. A director and videographer join scientists to film first-person accounts in the field or lab. Pictures and footage with field site explanations give media creators raw material. Scientists communicate efficiently and retain editorial control over the project, but a small team of media creators craft the public aimed content. A series of engaging short videos with narrow focuses illuminate the science. Written articles support with explanations. Social media campaigns spread the word, link content, welcome comments and keep abreast of changing web requirements. All FrontierScientists featured projects are aggregated to one mobile-friendly site available online or via an App. There groupings of Arctic-focused science provide a wealth of topics and content to explore. Scientists describe why their science is important, what drew them to it, and why the average American should care. When scientists share their work it's wonderful; a team approach is a schedule-friendly way that lets them serve as science communicators without taking up a handful of extra careers.",

            "abstract": "One of the world’s largest rare-earth element-rich carbonatite deposits is located in the eastern Mojave Desert at Mountain Pass, California. The eastern Mojave Desert carbonatite terrane consists of a ~1.7 Ga gneiss and schist rocks that are host to a ~1.417 Ga (Premo, 2013) ultrapotassic intrusive suite (shonkinite, syenite, and granite) and a ~1.375 Ga (DeWitt, 1983) carbonatite deposit . Regional geophysical data indicate that this carbonatite terrane occurs within a north-northwest trending ~1-km wide bench in a gravity high and along the eastern edge of a prominent magnetic high in the eastern Clark Mountain Range.\nTo improve our understanding of the geophysical and structural framework of the eastern Mojave carbonatite terrane, we collected over 2,300 gravity stations and over 640 physical rock property samples. Carbonatite rocks typically have distinct gravity, magnetic, and radioactive signatures because they are relatively dense, often contain magnetite, and are commonly enriched in thorium and/or uranium. Contrary to this trend, our results show that the carbonatite deposit is essentially nonmagnetic with an average susceptibility of 0.18 x 10-3 SI (n=31), and the ultrapotassic intrusive suite is very weakly magnetic with an average susceptibility of 2.0 x 10-3 SI (n=36). However, these rocks are found along a steep gradient of a prominent aeromagnetic anomaly.\nThe lack of magnetic signature from the rocks of the eastern Mojave carbonatite terrane suggests alteration of magnetic minerals. This is corroborated by its location within a broader alteration zone and observed magnetic low. If so, such an alteration event occurred after emplacement of the carbonatite deposit, which likely remobilized rare earth elements in the surrounding rocks. Further, an alteration event is consistent with geology, high rare-earth element concentration, and unusual geochemistry of the carbonatite deposit. Temporal constraints (DeWitt, 1987; Premo, 2013) also suggest alteration of the carbonatite, as the apparent age of the carbonatite deposit is ~40 Ma younger than the associated, and likely contemporaneous ultrapotassic intrusive suite.",

How these condensable species interact with each other and with the emitted soot particles depends on their levels and on ambient conditions. Both new particle nucleation and coatings on the soot particles can be observed in experimental data and predicted through detailed microphysical modeling.

We investigate the correlation between the spectrum of seismic energy and the local sea states. We deployed a single three-component broadband seismometer approximately $50$ m from the sea shore and recorded continuously for approximately 10 days. Our observations show that during elevated sea states, and presumably larger breaking waves in the surf zone, the power spectral density of the wave-generated seismic energy shifts to lower frequencies and higher spectral amplitudes. The correlation of the seismic spectral power to the height and period of ocean waves suggests that seismic observations can be used as a proxy for local sea states, which may have implications for sea shore sediment transport.",

When they encounter a field line that resonates at the same frequency, coupling to the Alfven field line oscillations occurs and the resonance can be detected on the ground at that particular latitude. There are different methods for determining resonant frequencies from ground ULF waves. the density profiles along the 0° geomagnetic longitude were obtained using both the gradient and the amplitude-phase methods for the analysis of the magnetic field data from the magnetometer arrays: SAMBA (South American Meridional B-field Array), MAGDAS and American Antarctic bases (Palmer, WAIS-D).

Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, IRIS spacecraft along with the ground based data from the New Solar Telescope (NST) present evidence that i) the flare and the eruption were directly triggered by a flux emergence that occurred inside a δ--sunspot at the boundary between two umbrae; ii) this event represented an example of an in-situ formation of an unstable flux rope observed only in hot AIA channels (131 and 94Å) and LASCO C2 coronagraph images; iii) the global PEA system spanned the entire AR and was due to global scale reconnection occurring at heights of about one solar radii, indicating on the global spatial and temporal scale of the eruption.",

Our approach is probabilistic but takes into account the physical constraints that seismic and aseismic slip must add to match the long-term slip rate on the fault. We thus use the rate of moment deficit buildup derived from the pattern of locking of the fault derived from modeling geodetic measurement of interseismic strain to place an upper bound on the average seismic rate release. We also make use of the instrumental and historical seismicity and the related Gutenberg-Richter (GR) statistics. Our method also takes into account aftershocks of the earthquakes with magnitudes larger than those in the instrumental catalog began, as the may substantially contribute to the slip budget. The method yields an estimate of the probability distribution of the magnitude and return period of the maximum possible earthquake.",

Estimates of TC size are available for all basins for the period 1978-2013. The climatological characteristics of TC size show interesting properties, varying by basin, TC intensity and latitude. Here we further analyze these datasets, by considering the dependence of TC size with the phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in various basins. Preliminary results in the North Atlantic and western North Pacific, show that the TC size distributions in these basins are statistically significant distinct in El Niño and La Niña years and are basin dependent. Furthermore, these shifts in the TC size distribution are not the same for all types of storms, with different TC size distributions shifts with ENSO phase for tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes. In this talk, we will present our results of on how TC distributions in all basins vary with ENSO and TC characteristics, such as intensity, lifetime, latitude, and seasonality. The differences and similarities between the results of the 2 size datasets will also be discussed.\n",

In this presentation we build over this study to further our understanding of these interactions on multiple dimensions: 1) Biomass burning smoke emissions are constrained using an inverse modeling technique to improve the representation of smoke loads and its impacts, 2) The representation of these smoke-tornado interactions are assessed when using a simplified aerosol scheme with the intent of introducing these feedbacks into numerical weather prediction in the future, 3) The occurrence of these interactions is investigated for other tornado outbreaks on the record to learn about their frequency and under what conditions they occur, and 4) Multi-scale simulations are performed from regional to tornado-resolving scales to assess the impact of smoke on the number of tornadoes formed and their EF intensity. Future steps will also be discussed.\nThe image below shows MODIS-Aqua satellite products for 27 April 2011 over the southeast US, Central America and the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), along with tornado tracks (red solid lines, thickness indicates the magnitude of the tornado reports , thickest=5, thinnest=1) for the period from April 26-28. The background is a true color image of the surface, clouds, and smoke, with yellow markers indicating fire detections and an iridescent overlay showing aerosol optical depth (AOD). Red, green and purple colors show high (1.0), medium (0.6) and low (0.1) AOD values. The article by Saide et al. (2015) shows that the increase in aerosol loads in the GoM is produced by fires in Central America, and this smoke is further transported to the southeast US where it can interact with clouds and radiation producing environmental conditions more favorable to significant tornado occurrence for the historical outbreak on 27 April 2011.

            "abstract": "Tephrochronology is an invaluable tool used to date, link, and reconstruct paleo-environments, climates, and landscapes. Single tephra layers represent isochronous markers across broad regions, thus accurate and precise temporal constraints on the timing of eruption are critical to their utility. If a U-bearing accessory phase such as zircon is present, U/Pb, U-series, and (U-Th)/He geochronometers may be selectively applied. Application of multiple geochronometers to the same sample corroborates accuracy, can potentially resolve mineral crystallization and volcano eruption dates, and can define an eruption age from inherited crystals, assuming complete thermal resetting of the (U-Th)/He system upon crystal incorporation into magma prior to eruption. The Emmons Lake Volcanic Center is one of the largest Quaternary volcanic systems in the Aleutian volcanic arc, and is characterized by at least two major caldera-forming eruptions. C1 has been dated by 40Ar/39Ar at ~238 ka, and was originally proposed as the source for the Old Crow tephra, the largest and most widespread Quaternary tephra in eastern Beringia, and a critical time horizon for reconstruction of Pleistocene paleo-environment and climate. C2 produced the widespread Dawson tephra, and has been dated indirectly by radiocarbon at ~27 ka. We present in-situ grain-surface ion microprobe (SHRIMP-RG) 238U-230Th and/or U/Pb data on a suite of autocrysitc zircon grains from a C1 sample, the Old Crow, and from the Dawson. On these same zircon crystals, we utilize a noble gas sector mass spectrometer to make sensitive, low blank, single crystal 4He measurements. With these datasets, we investigate the temporal and potential genetic relationship between C1 and Old Crow, and place absolute radiogenic time constraints on the C2 eruption. Coupled 238U-230Th and sector field (U-Th)/He application shows significant promise for generating accurate, precise dates for Quaternary tephra bearing a U-rich accessory mineral phase.",

            "abstract": "The Caribbean region has a documented history of damaging tsunamis that have affected coastal areas. Of particular interest is the Puerto Rico – Virgin Islands (PRVI) region, where the proximity of the coast to prominent tectonic faults would result in near-field tsunamis. Tsunami hazard assessment, detection capabilities, warning, education and outreach efforts are common tools intended to reduce loss of life and property. It is for these reasons that the PRSN is participating in an effort with local and federal agencies to develop tsunami hazard risk reduction strategies under the NTHMP. This grant supports the TsunamiReady program, which is the base of the tsunami preparedness and mitigation in PR. In order to recognize threatened communities in PR as TsunamiReady by the US NWS, the PR Component of the NTHMP have identified and modeled sources for local, regional and tele-tsunamis and the results of simulations have been used to develop tsunami response plans. The main goal of the PR-NTHMP is to strengthen resilient coastal communities that are prepared for tsunami hazards, and recognize PR as TsunamiReady.\nEvacuation maps were generated in three phases: First, hypothetical tsunami scenarios of potential underwater earthquakes were developed, and these scenarios were then modeled through during the second phase. The third phase consisted in determining the worst-case scenario based on the Maximum of Maximums (MOM). Inundation and evacuation zones were drawn on GIS referenced maps and aerial photographs. These products are being used by emergency managers to educate the public and develop mitigation strategies. Maps and related evacuation products, like evacuation times, can be accessed online via the PR Tsunami Decision Support Tool. Based on these evacuation maps, tsunami signs were installed, vulnerability profiles were created, communication systems to receive and disseminate tsunami messages were installed in each TWFP, and tsunami response plans were approved. Also, the existing tsunami protocol and criteria in the PR/VI was updated.\nThis paper describes the PR-NTHMP recent outcomes, including the real time monitoring as well as the protocols used to broadcast tsunami messages. The paper highlights tsunami hazards assessment, detection, warning, education and outreach efforts in Puerto Rico.",

It is operational in NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) which focuses on predicting surface ozone and PM2.5. In order to improve its performance, we tested several approaches, including NOAA Environmental Modeling System Global Aerosol Component (NGAC) simulation derived ozone and aerosol lateral boundary conditions (LBC), bi-direction NH3 emission and HMS(Hazard Mapping System)-BlueSky emission with the latest U.S. EPA Community Multi-scale Air Quality model (CMAQ) version and the U.S EPA National Emission Inventory (NEI)-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The operational NAQFC uses static profiles for its lateral boundary condition (LBC), which does not impose severe issue for near-surface air quality prediction. However, its degraded performance for the upper layer (e.g. above 3km) is evident when comparing with aircraft measured ozone. NCEP’s Global Forecast System (GFS) has tracer O3 prediction treated as 3-D prognostic variable (Moorthi and Iredell, 1998) after being initialized with Solar Backscatter Ultra Violet-2 (SBUV-2) satellite data. We applied that ozone LBC to the CMAQ’s upper layers and yield more reasonable O3 prediction than that with static LBC comparing with the aircraft data in Discover-AQ Colorado campaign. NGAC’s aerosol LBC also improved the PM2.5 prediction with more realistic background aerosols. The bi-direction NH3 emission used in CMAQ also help reduce the NH3 and nitrate under-prediction issue. During summer 2014, strong wildfires occurred in northwestern USA, and we used the US Forest Service’s BlueSky fire emission with HMS fire counts to drive CMAQ and tested the difference of day-1 and day-2 fire emission estimation. Other related issues were also discussed.",

            "abstract": "We present recent observation and modelling results, which suggest that retreat of the sea-ice edge in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean over several recent years may be an indication of the growing influence of Atlantic Water on the hydrographic regime (“Atlantification”). The ‘memory’ of ice-depleted conditions in summer is transferred to the fall season, through excess heat content in the upper mixed layer, which in turn transfers to mid-winter via thinner and younger ice. This thinner ice is more fragile and mobile, thus facilitating the formation of polynyas and leads. When openings in ice cover form along the Atlantic Water pathway, weak density stratification at the mixed layer base supports the development of thermohaline convection, which further entrains warm and salty water from deeper layers. Convection-induced upward heat flux from the Atlantic layer retards ice formation, either keeping ice thickness low or blocking ice formation entirely. The joint analysis of observations and modelling data is performed north-east of Svalbard where the top hundred meters of Atlantic inflow through the Fram Strait cools and freshens rapidly. Complementary research methods, including statistical analyses of observations and numerical modelling, support our basic “Atlantification” concept. A general conclusion from the analysis performed is that the recently observed retreat of sea ice northeast of Svalbard in winter may be explained by the positive feedback between summer ice decay and the growing influence of oceanic heat on a seasonal time scale.",

Pre-event scenario planning can help us to understand the likelihood of event type, size and duration while observational data can be used, once an event occurs, as calibration/validation to the pre-event modeling. During the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption uncertainty in initial plume dynamics and ash mass lead to significant variability in modeling the downwind ash clouds. To forecast the potential dispersal patterns from volcanic eruptions assumptions are made on eruption start time; initial plume dynamics; erupted mass; and erupted/dispersing particle size distributions. There is a need for pre-event inputs to the dispersion models used in operational ash cloud forecasting. There are a number of different initial plume models available and each has its own set of defined inputs that are needed to model the eruption plume. There is a need for updated rapidly produced scenarios daily at time of unrest and updated as soon as the event occurs. While validation with satellite data is key, the models can forecast ash in locations that could be below detection limits that are still relevant for mitigation strategies and aviation safety. So, are we sufficiently prepared to perform the number of initial plume modeling simulations to capture all the potential variability in the dispersion model inputs? Can a systematic approach be developed for application within the operational environment and for use by the volcanic ash advisory centers? Here we will present approaches to building a real-time workflow that encompasses the initial plume uncertainties and discuss how we as a community can develop tools to be implemented in an operational environment. The aim is to a build a complete system to provide the simulations of the ash cloud location and concentrations along with confidence levels that can then be used by the aviation community in their decision support systems.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen (H2) is produced in geological settings by dissociation of water due to radiation from natural radioactive decay of uranium (238U, 235U), thorium (232Th) and potassium (40K). To quantify the potential significance of radiolytic H2 as an electron donor for microbes within the South Pacific subseafloor basaltic aquifer, we calculate radiolytic H2 production rates in basement fractures utilizing measured radionuclide concentrations in 42 basalt samples from IODP Expedition 329. The samples are from three sites with very different basement ages and a wide range of alteration types. Major and trace element concentrations vary by up to an order of magnitude from sample to sample. Comparison of our samples to each other and to previous studies of fresh East Pacific Rise basalt suggests that between-sample variation in radionuclide concentrations is primarily due to differences in initial (pre-alteration) concentrations (which can vary between eruptive events), rather than to alteration type or extent. Local maxima in radionuclide (U, Th, and K) concentrations produce ‘hotspots’ of radiolytic H2 production; calculated radiolytic rates differ by up to a factor of 80 from sample to sample. Fracture width also greatly influences H2 production. Due to the low penetration distance of alpha radiation, microfractures are ‘hotpots’ for radiolytic H2 production. For example, radiolytic H2 production rates normalized to water volume are 170 times higher in 1μm-wide fractures than in 10cm-wide fractures.",

            "abstract": "The primary objective of NASA’s upcoming ICESat-2 mission is to collect altimetry data of the Earth’s surface optimized to measure ice sheet elevation change and sea ice thickness. The mission’s multi-beam, photon-counting lidar, ATLAS, will collect that data. Understanding ranging biases in the altimetry measurements for snow, ice and water is needed to quantify errors in the elevation data for those surfaces. One potential source of bias is penetration of ATLAS’s 532 nm (green) laser pulses into those materials with the associated volume multiple-scattering introducing photon path delays. Changes in penetration depth due to seasonal and/or inter-annual changes in snow and ice optical properties could result in small errors in the trends of ice sheet elevation change. Penetration differences into sea ice versus open water could introduce errors in sea ice freeboard measurements that are the basis for determination of sea ice thickness.\nTo study this issue of penetration bias the airborne Slope Imaging Multiple-polarization Photon-counting Lidar (SIMPL) acquired ice sheet and sea ice data based at Thule Air Force Base in Greenland during July and August, 2015. SIMPL acquires single-photon ranging data in four cross-track beams at two co-aligned wavelengths; 532 nm and 1064 nm (near infrared). The 1064 nm photons provide a reference to the true surface elevation because the penetration depth is negligible at that wavelength. The co-incident wavelengths illuminate small footprints (30 cm diameter) so that return pulse broadening due to surface slope and roughness is minimized in order to observe the broadening due to penetration. Eight cm single photon range precision enables sub-cm level determination of penetration depth using bias calibrated range histograms. SIMPL’s measurement of laser return depolarization uniquely identifies the presence of surface water, aiding in the interpretation of the penetration results. In order to examine ice sheet penetration biases as a function of surface conditions data was acquired for higher-altitude, interior dry snow as well as western coastal ablation zone ice and melt ponds. Data for multi-year sea ice with open leads was acquired north of Greenland and Ellesmere Island. Here we present results on the instrument measurement performance for these disparate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensed vegetation indices and field measurements have demonstrated that climate change has influenced vegetation phenology. The phenological changes are expressed in shifts in the timing of spring vegetation activity and the length of the active growing season. According to NDVI data from NOAA and GIMMS, the length of the active growing season north of 45°N has extended by 12 days due to 8 days advancement in spring and 4 days prolongation in autumn between July 1981 and June 1991. The same NDVI dataset from July 1981 to December 1999 has shown the growing season increased by 18 days in Eurasia and 12 days in North America. Phenology regulates vegetation interactions with climate by influencing the energy, water and carbon cycles. Here, we use observations and the Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5) in offline mode and coupled with CESM to evaluate influences of shifts in phenology on energy and water budget and partitioning and on interactions with the atmosphere. Satellite retrieved leaf area index (LAI) is used to prescribe shifts in vegetation phenology in CLM4.5. We find that phenological advancement of 12 days over the past few decades can result in monthly mean changes of (-5-7 Wm-2) in latent heat and (-5-9Wm-2) in sensible heat balance over wide regions. We will discuss (1) the capability of current climate models to predict the impacts of phenological shifts on climate change, (2) seasonal to annual changes in energy and water cycles in response to phenological shifts, (3) the spatial heterogeneity in phenological-induced energy and water partitioning in different plant functional types across regions and continents, and (4) phenology and plant-climate interactions in changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The Nazca-Antarctic plate boundary, the Chile spreading ridge, subducts beneath South America, forming the northward-migrating Chile Triple Junction (CTJ), now at ~46.5°S, where an actively spreading segment is currently in the Nazca trench. Ridge subduction is associated with diachronously developed variable structure and magmatism of overriding South America. To assess the effects of ridge subduction, we deployed a network of 39 broadband seismometers in southern Chile between 43 - 49°S and 71 - 76°W from Dec. 2004 - Feb. 2007, recording 102 earthquakes suitable for receiver function analyses, i.e., M > 5.9, of various backazimuths, and at epicentral distances of 30 - 90°. The network encompassed onland portions of the current triple junction and ridge subduction, areas to the south of the CTJ where ridge segments subducted during the last 6 m.y., and regions north of the CTJ not yet affected by ridge subduction, allowing the assessment of the effects of ridge subduction on crustal structure of overriding South America. We constructed 551 teleseismic receiver functions to estimate crustal thicknesses, H, and average compressional to shear wave velocity ratios, Vp/Vs = k, using the iterative time deconvolution method of Ligorria and Ammon (1999). H and k were calculated using the grid search method of Zhu and Kanamori (2000). Beneath stations closest to the trench, where the Nazca plate subducts, we found Moho depths between 28 and 55 km, thickening northward. At the locus of current ridge subduction, in the Taitao Pennisula, thinner crust ranges from 27 - 36 km. H is 36-38 km where the Antarctic plate subducts and the Chile ridge recently subducted. The direct effect of the subducting ridge on South America can be seen in H differences between forearc regions that have sustained ridge subduction versus those that have not. South American forearc crust above the subducted Nazca plate is as much as 28 km thicker than forearc crust recently affected by ridge subduction, and is as much as 11 km thicker than forearc crust above the subducting Antarctic plate. The latter difference may reflect primary crustal thickness differences. Crustal thinning above the current ridge subduction is a result of enhanced subduction erosion due to the Chile ridge’s greater buoyancy.",

            "abstract": "Millions of tons pollutant and greenhouse gases per year are emitted and subsequently removed from the atmosphere through oxidation reactions. The oxidation products are typically more soluble or have a low vapor pressure so that they become subject to deposition processes. The atmospheric oxidation capacity is primarily maintained by hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which initiate reaction chains that can recycle or destroy OH. Key questions are if the oxidation capacity is affected by growing pollution emissions, to what extent it is buffered by OH recycling, and how regions with specific photochemical and pollution characteristics act together through atmospheric transport at a global scale. While previous generations atmospheric chemistry-transport models have discounted OH recycling with schemes that lumped or truncated reaction sequences, we present an approach that does justice to the intricate interactions between reactive carbon, nitrogen and oxygen species. This gives rise to a global buffering mechanism of the oxidation capacity that explains the observed small variability of methane and other gases that are removed by reaction with OH.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice around Antarctica reached another record high extent in September 2014, recording a maximum extent of more than 20 million km2 for the first time since the modern satellite data record began in October 1978. This follows previous record maxima in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an overall increase in Antarctic September sea ice extent of 1.3% per decade since 1979. Several explanations have been put forward to explain the increasing trends, such as anomalous short-term wind patterns that both grow and spread out the ice, and freshening of the surface ocean layer from increased melting of floating ice from the continent. These positive trends in Antarctic sea ice are at odds with climate model forecasts that suggest the sea ice should be declining in response to increasing greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion.\nWhile the reasons for the increases in total extent remain poorly understood, it is likely that these changes are not just impacting the total ice extent, but also the distribution of pack ice, the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and polynyas, with important ramifications for phytoplankton productivity that in turn impact zooplankton, fish, sea birds and marine mammals. This study evaluates changes in the distribution of the pack ice, polynyas and the marginal ice zone around Antarctica from two sea ice algorithms, the NASA Team and the Bootstrap. These results are further compared with climate model simulations from the CESM large ensemble output. Seasonal analysis of the different ice types using NASA Team and Bootstrap shows that during ice advance, the ice advances as pack ice, with a seasonal peak in September (broader peak for Bootstrap), and as the pack ice begins to retreat, it first converts to a wide area of MIZ, that reaches its peak around November (NASA Team) or December (Bootstrap). CESM also shows a similar seasonal cycle, with a peak in the pack ice in August, and a December/January peak in the MIZ. Seasonal variability and trends are further compared between the algorithms and the CESM large ensemble output. Results are highly sensitive to the sea ice algorithms used for analysis and regions chosen for evaluation, illustrating the different sensitivities of the algorithms and CESM to the varying influences of dynamic and thermodynamic processes.",

            "abstract": "The elevated concentration of atmospheric CO2 increases the ratio of carbon fixation to water loss from plants or water use efficiency, which reduces transpiration. However, the magnitude of the effects of this vegetation acclimation on hydrologic dynamics, such as soil moisture content and surface runoff controlled by microtopographic variability on the land surface, remains unclear. Here we integrate a multi-layer canopy-root-soil model (MLCan) with a coupled surface-subsurface flow model (GCSFlow) to capture the acclimation responses of vegetation to climate change and predict how these changes affect hydrologic dynamics on landscapes at fine scales. The model is implemented on a hybrid CPU-GPU parallel computing environment to overcome challenges associated with the high density of computational grid and nonlinear solvers. The model is capable of simulating large-scale heterogeneities due to both microtopography and soils and lateral water fluxes at emerging lidar-scale resolutions (~1m). We demonstrate that hybrid computing is feasible for detailed, large-scale ecohydrologic modeling, which has been previously assumed to be an intractable computational problem. Simulations are performed for corn crop in the Goose Creek watershed in central Illinois, USA at present and projected higher concentrations of atmospheric CO2, 400 ppm and 550 ppm, respectively. The results show a net decrease of 11% for the average annual evapotranspiration of corn, which increases water content in the soil and at the land surface. These results highlight the critical role of a warming climate on atmospheric-soil-vegetation interactions and the need to understand other dynamics near the soil surface associated with water and vegetation.",

To estimate individual PM2.5 exposures in distinct, non-residential MEs and to determine exposure characteristics during haze and clean days, we conducted personal PM2.5 monitoring with portable PM2.5 personal environment monitors (MicroPEM) in 19 indoor/outdoor MEs in Nanjing, and compared personal exposure data with ambient PM2.5 levels. Personal PM2.5 exposure patterns displayed notable spatial variance, peaking in snack streets and restaurants and dipping in subways and labs. Under both haze and non-haze conditions, different characteristics of MEs and the background PM2.5 level jointly determine the spatial variance of individual exposure. Indoor MEs with better ventilation systems led to lower personal PM2.5 exposure levels. During haze days, impact from high ambient PM2.5 overwhelms influence from other factors and dominates personal exposure trends.",

We were simply enlisting volunteers to help capture, display and communicate the nature of small scale variability within northern Colorado storms. Climate change was talked about then, but not with the sense of concern and urgency as today. Now, many years later, the simple back-yard precipitation measurements being taken by thousands of volunteers across much of North America are creating valuable and easily-accessible data and information serving many and varied purposes from federal and state climate monitoring to drought and extreme storm analysis and research. Many volunteers have been with the project now for a decade or longer and have contributed literally thousands of individual observations and reports. Long-time participants along with recent recruits of all ages are seeing first-hand how day by day observations of weather conditions combine – over time and space -- to define and describe key elements of our climate and its variations. The fact that the data from volunteers are frequently used and applied by scientists and decision makers is one of the key factors in retaining long-term volunteers. Examples will be presented of volunteer precipitation data being used both independently and in combination with data from federal monitoring systems. Challenges of maintaining a large volunteer network will be discussed along with some plans and opportunities for the future.",

            "abstract": "Seismic data from ocean bottom seismometers at 9°50'N on the East Pacific Rise captured a seafloor eruption in January 2006 that was preceded by a prolonged buildup of seismicity. The seismicity buildup culminated in ~6 hours of most intense seismic activity interpreted as a period of dike propagation on January 22nd 2006 (Tolstoy et. al., 2006). Approximately 3 hours after the start of this seismic crisis, impulsive, waterborne seismic signals emerged and then gradually petered out over the next two weeks. The characteristics of these signals are similar to those observed during the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption (Garcia et. al.; Wilcock et. al., this meeting) and are believed to be associated with cooling/degassing of seafloor lava. Locations of ~2000 of these events delineate the lava flow region mapped using digital seafloor imagery in 2006-2007(Soule et. al., 2007) which confirms the association between these events and eruptions/lava flow. The spatiotemporal evolution of these events sheds light on the lava flow dynamics during this eruption. Earthquakes located during the 6-hour period of most intense seismic signals concentrated around 9°50-9°51’N which may be the main region where magma intruded from the axial magma lenses. Throughout the deployment, minute-long tremor bursts were also observed. The event count of these tremor bursts peaked at ~20 hours after the period of most intense seismic signals before petering out over the next few weeks. These events may be associated with magma movement and refilling of axial and/or sub-axial magma lenses during the eruption.",

            "abstract": "In preparation for the next phase of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE), we conducted an active-source seismic survey of Yucca Flat, Nevada, on the Nevada National Security Site. Results from this survey will be used to inform the geologic models associated with the SPE project. For this study, we used a novel 13,000 kilogram weight-drop seismic source to interrogate an 18-km North-South transect of Yucca Flat. Source points were spaced every 200 meters and were recorded by 350 to 380 3-component 2-Hz geophones with variable spacings of 10, 20, and 100 meters. We utilized the Refraction-Microtremor (ReMi) technique to create multiple 1D dispersion curves, which were then inverted for shear-wave velocity profiles using the Dix inversion method (Tsai and Haney, 2015). Each of these 1D velocity models was subsequently stitched together to create a 2D profile over the survey area. The dispersion results indicate a general decrease in surface-wave phase velocity to the south. This result is supported by slower shear-wave velocity sediments and increasing basin depth towards the survey’s southern extent.

            "abstract": "Present day landscapes have evolved over time through interactions between the prevailing climates and geological settings. Understanding the linkage between spatial patterns of landforms, soils, and vegetation in landscapes and their hydrological response is critical to make quantitative predictions in ungaged basins. Catchment co-evolution is a theoretical framework that seeks to formulate hypotheses about the mechanisms and conditions that determine the historical development of catchments and how such evolution affects their hydrological response. In this study, we selected 14 volcanic catchments of different ages (from 0.22 to 82Ma) in Japan. We derived indices of landscape properties (drainage density) as well as hydrological response (annual water balance, baseow index, and flow duration curves) and examined their relation with catchment age and climate (through the aridity index). We found signicant correlation between drainage density and baseow index with age, but not with climate. The age of the catchments was also signicantly related to intra-annual flow variability. Younger catchments tend to have lower peak flows and higher low flows, while older catchments exhibit more flashy runoff. The decrease of baseflow with catchment age confirms previous studies that hypothesized that in volcanic landscapes the major flow pathways have changed over time, from deep groundwater flow to shallow subsurface flow. The drainage density of our catchments decreased with age, contrary to previous findings in similar volcanic catchments but of signicant younger age than the ones explored here. In these younger catchments, an increase in drainage density with age was observed, and it was hypothesized that this was because of more landscape incision due to increasing near-surface lateral flow paths in more mature catchments. Our results suggest that as catchments further evolve, hydrologically active channels retreat as less recharge leads to lower average aquifer levels and less baseow.",

            "abstract": "The influences of anthropogenic aerosols have been suggested as an important reason for climate changes over Southeast Asia (SE Asia, 10°S~20°N and 90°E~135°E). Accurate observations and modelling of aerosols effects on the weather and climate patterns is crucial for a better understanding and mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. This study uses NASA satellite observations along with online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to evaluate aerosols impacts on climate over SE Asia. We assess the direct and semi-direct radiative effects of smoke particles over this region during September, 2009 when a significant El Niño event caused the highest biomass burning activity during the last 15 years. Quantification efforts are made to assess how changes of radiative and non radiative parameters (sensible and latent heat) due to smoke aerosols would affect regional climate process such as precipitations, clouds and planetary boundary layer process. Comparison of model simulations for the current land cover conditions against surface meteorological observations and satellite observations of precipitations and cloudiness show satisfactory performance of the model over our study area. In order to quantitatively validate the model results, several experiments will be performed to test the aerosols radiative feedback under different radiation schemes and with/without considering aerosol effects explicitly in the model. Relevant ground-based data (e.g. AERONET), along with aerosol vertical profile data from CALIPSO, will also be applied.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrological interfaces, represent the boundaries between water-dependent ecosystems that can alter substantially the fluxes of energy and matter. There is still a critical gap of understanding the organisational principles of the drivers and controls of spatially and temporally variable ecohydrological interface functions. This knowledge gap limits our capacity to efficiently quantify, predict and manage the services provided by complex ecosystems. Many ecohydrological interfaces are characterized by step changes in microbial metabolic activity, steep redox gradients and often even thermodynamic phase shifts, for instance at the interfaces between atmosphere and water or soil matrix and macro–pores interfaces.\nThis paper integrates investigations from point scale microcosm experiments with reach and subcatchment scale tracer experiments and numerical modeling studies to elaborate similarities in the drivers and controls that constitute the enhanced biogeochemical activity of different types of ecohydrologica interfaces across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We therefore combine smart metabolic activity tracers to quantify the impact of bioturbating benthic fauna onto ecosystem respiration and oxygen consumption and investigate at larger scale, how microbial metabolic activity and carbon turnover at the water-sediment interface are controlled by sediment physical and chemical properties as well as water temperatures. Numerical modeling confirmed that experimentally identified hotspots of streambed biogeochemical cycling were controlled by patterns of physical properties such as hydraulic conductivities or bioavailability of organic matter, impacting on residence time distributions and hence reaction times. In contrast to previous research, our investigations thus confirmed that small-scale variability of physical and chemical interface properties had a major impact on biogeochemical processing at the investigated ecohydrological interfaces. Our results furthermore indicate that to fully understand spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of ecohydrological interface functioning, including hotspots and hot moments, detailed knowledge of the impacts of biological behavior on the physic-chemical ecosystem conditions, and vice-versa, is required.",

Septic systems utilize microbial processes to eliminate organic wastes and nutrients such as nitrogen; these processes can contribute to air pollution through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs). At each of nine septic systems, we measured fluxes of CH4, CO2, and N2O from the soil over the leach field and sand filter, and from the roof outlet vent. These are the most likely locations for gas emissions during normal operation of the septic system. The majority of all septic system gas emissions were released from the roof vent. However, our comparisons of the gas fluxes from these locations suggest that biological processes in the soil, especially the soil over the leach field, can influence the type and quantity of gas that is released from the system. The total vent, sand filter, and leach field GHG emissions were 0.12, 0.045, and 0.046 tonne CO2e capita-1 year-1, respectively. In total, this represents about 1.5% of the annual carbon footprint of an individual living in the US.",

This study focuses on the changes in concurrences of heatwaves and meteorological droughts from 1960 – 2010. Despite an apparent hiatus in rising temperature and no significant trend in droughts, we show a substantial increase in concurrent droughts and heatwaves across most parts of the United States, and a statistically significant shift in the distribution of concurrent extremes.

Scattering inside the layer increases the photon path and makes the surface appear further away from the satellite. This effect is referred to as “atmospheric path delay”. The ICESat and ICESat-2 missions’ high accuracy requirement on the ice/snow surface elevation measurements makes understanding and quantifying this effect essential. We have developed a comprehensive framework that can simulate the analog waveform behavior of the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard ICESat and the photon counting signal of the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard ICESat-2. In this presentation, we will (1) review the cloud and blowing snow distributions over the polar ice sheets; (2) discuss how different factors affect the value of the atmospheric path delay, such as scattering layer height, optical thickness, and lidar field of view (FOV); (3) demonstrate that the delay is much less for ICESat-2 (centimeter level) compared to ICESat (decimeter level) due to the much smaller lidar FOV; (4) show the cloud detectability difference between ICESat and ICESat-2 and its implication to path delay corrections. The effect of cloud and blowing snow on first photon bias will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The need to classify solar wind states is partially the practical one of knowing what winds will strongly affect the Earth, but it is also to help in understanding the origin of the winds. In terms of the latter classification, of interest here, there is general agreement that \"ejecta\" represent a separate class from ordinary winds, although the details of which parcels qualify as ejecta are still subject to considerable disagreement. It has become clear that the distinction between \"slow\" and \"fast\" wind is at best misleading, and slow wind sometimes displays temperature anisotropies, fluctuation spectra, and the like that are characteristic of the typical fast wind. Recent work has focused on distinguishing \"coronal hole wind\" from \"streamer belt\" and \"strahl confusion zone\" (heliospheric current sheet) winds. The hope is to discern which wind comes from coronal holes versus the boundaries of holes versus near active regions or other sources. The present work extends a simple method of clustering in the parameter space of a selected set of variables to see if \"natural\" states of wind arise. This method (primarily \"K-means\" but we are also trying others) has proven capable of distinguishing states very similar to those in recent categorizations, especially when the variables of cross-helicity and residual energy are added to the parameter list, but we also find new, persistent, categories. The present work will look in more detail at the derived states and at different times in the solar cycle. One suggestion in the research so far is that shock-like structures are fundamental in the mix; these have largely been ignored in recent work in solar wind heating.",

            "abstract": "The year 2014 started out with a bang when a series of westerly wind bursts occurred west of the date line between January and April. These wind bursts generated a series of powerful downwelling Kelvin waves that led to anomalous warming in the equatorial cold tongue of the eastern Pacific, apparently signaling the onset of an El Niño. The Kelvin waves observed in February through April 2014 were as large as those seen at the onset of the 1997-98 El Niño, the strongest on record, leading to speculation that a major event was underway. Moreover, there was broad consensus among forecast models for development of an El Niño during the second half of 2014. Thus, the scientific community and the popular press were abuzz with the prospect of climate fireworks reminiscent of 1997-98. However, the atmosphere did not immediately respond to the initial oceanic warming and the positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks that characterize El Niño evolution did not materialize. By the end of 2014, only weak warm sea surface temperature anomalies were evident in the tropical Pacific, and those anomalies were predicted to dissipate in boreal spring of 2015. Instead of fading though, El Niño came roaring back with renewed vigor in 2015. This presentation will describe the surprising evolution of conditions in the tropical Pacific during 2014-15, how forecasts and conventional wisdom failed to anticipate what occurred, and what the implications are for future research on El Niño.",

            "abstract": "Lightning within heavy snowfall indicates the presence of heavy snowfall rates. Most studies within the literature examine this phenomenon using ground based networks that are primarily designed for identifying cloud to ground flashes. Thus, very little study of the three dimensional structure of the lightning flashes within heavy snowfall has been accomplished. Herein, total lightning mapping arrays, interferometers and ground based networks like the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) are utilized to document the characteristics of these flashes, including flash size, polarity, flash initiation location and inferred charge structure. A total of six events are examined, resulting in a total of approximately 80 flashes. Both individual case studies and overall population statistics will be used to characterize flashes within this winter environment.\nMany of these flashes are found to initiate from tall objects like television and radio communication towers, and come to ground in multiple locations along their path, resulting in one LMA derived flash containing multiple NLDN identified flashes. Cloud-to-ground flashes of both polarities are noted within the 80 flash sample. In one case, 3 separate flashes which resulted in ground flashes of both polarities were observed coming out of the same overall charge structure. This structure exhibited a highly sloped nature in the LMA data from east to west, and both +IC and -IC components of flashes were observed by the NLDN in the same region where the flashes initiated. A decrease in flash size is noted with time in at least three of these events due to weaker updraft (compared to their summertime thunderstorm counter parts) and smaller available of supercooled liquid water as inferred through trends in radar observations. These limiting factors are hypothesized to result in slower charging rates, and smaller flash sizes with time. Several flashes also exhibit sloped structures that match reflectivity, differential reflectivity and correlation coefficient patterns observed in radar data near the times of flash occurrence.",

            "abstract": "Vertically-propagating atmospheric thermal tides whose origins lie in Earth’s lower atmosphere are now widely recognized as one of the dominant \"meteorological” drivers of space weather. Many prior research efforts have focused on documenting and understanding the role that dissipating tides play in determining the longitudinal and seasonal variability associated with lower thermospheric winds, temperature, and constituent densities. However, considerably less attention has focused on understanding the potential solar cycle variability in the mean thermospheric state induced by the tides. In this paper we utilize the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM), forced with observationally-based tides at the model lower boundary from the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT, from Oberheide et al. [2011]), to elucidate how the dissipating tides induce variations of up to 30 K in the zonal-mean thermosphere temperature between solar minimum and maximum. Numerical experiments are performed for the month of September and for solar minimum, medium, and maximum conditions in order to quantify the solar cycle variability associated with the different terms in the thermodynamic energy, major and minor neutral constituent continuity equations. Our analysis indicates that solar cycle variability in neutral temperatures results from a combination of net eddy heat transport effects and tidal modulation of net nitric oxide (NO) cooling. The chemical and dynamical pathways through which dissipating tides affect mean NO cooling differently at solar minimum and maximum are diagnosed.",

            "abstract": "A 1973 paper by Lyons and Thorne explains the two-belt structure for electrons in the inner magnetosphere as a balance between inward radial diffusion and loss to the atmosphere due to pitch-angle scattering from Coulomb and VLF wave-particle interactions. In this paper, equilibrium solutions to a set of 1D radial diffusion equations, one for each value of the first invariant of motion, μ, were computed to produce the equilibrium structure. Each diffusion equation incorporated an L- and μ-dependent `lifetime' due to the Coulomb and wave-particle interactions. This model is appropriate under the assumption that radial diffusion is slow in comparison to pitch-angle scattering, and that there is no acceleration caused by the VLF wave-particle interactions. We have revisited this model using our DREAM3D 3D diffusion code, which allows the user to explicitly model the diffusion in pitch-angle and momentum rather than using a lifetime. We find that a) replacing the lifetimes with an explicit model of pitch-angle diffusion, thus allowing for coupling between radial and pitch-angle diffusion, affects the equilibrium structure, and b) over the long time scales needed to reach equilibrium, significant acceleration due to VLF wave particle interactions takes place due to the 'cross-terms' in pitch-angle and momentum and the sharp gradient in the equilibrium pitch-angle distributions. We also find that the equilibrium solutions are quite sensitive to various aspects of the physics model employed in the 1973 paper that can be improved, suggesting that additional work needs to be done to fully understand the equilibirum nature of the trapped electron radiation belts.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) play an important role in the hydrology, sedimentology, and geomorphology of the landmasses surrounding the western north Pacific. Advances in our understanding of these processes, and how they may have influenced the tectonic evolution of sites like Taiwan and Japan, have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of the paleoclimatology of tropical cyclones, the record of which only extends back to the mid 20th century. In particular, the climatology of tropical cyclones during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is poorly known but of prime interest for studies of sedimentology and landscape evolution. General circulation and regional climate modeling have been shown to provide realistic insights into the links between tropical cyclones and climate, but have not been applied to the paleoclimate periods of interest to geoscientists. We present dynamically-downscaled modeling results of tropical cyclone climatology from the Last Glacial Maximum and from the 20th century. The climatology of TCs in the LGM simulations is very similar to that from the modern control, consistent with large-scale indices that suggest that, despite lower sea-surface temperatures, the LGM in the western North Pacific was likely as favorable for TC development, if not more favorable, than the modern period. Our results suggest that tropical cyclone activity in the western North Pacific during glacial periods may have been broadly similar to that observed today.",

Investigating the behavior of those ecosystem functions within real-time model simulation can be a very challenging due to the complex of both model and software structure of an environmental model, such as the Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME) Land Model (ALM). In this research, author will describe the urgent needs and challenges for in-situ data analysis for ALM simulations, and layouts our methods/strategies to meet these challenges. Specifically, an in-situ data analysis framework is designed to allow users interactively observe the biogeophyical and biogeochemical process during ALM simulation. There are two key components in this framework, automatically instrumented ecosystem simulation, in-situ data communication and large-scale data exploratory toolkit. This effort is developed by leveraging several active projects, including scientific unit testing platform, common communication interface and extreme-scale data exploratory toolkit. Authors believe that, based on advanced computing technologies, such as compiler-based software system analysis, automatic code instrumentation, and in-memory data transport, this software system provides not only much needed capability for real-time observation and in-situ data analytics for environmental model simulation, but also the potentials for in-situ model behavior adjustment via simulation steering.",

            "abstract": "One of the expected and rather paradoxical consequences of anthropogenic global warming is an increase in Antarctic surface mass balance (or net snow accumulation), as robustly simulated by both global and regional climate models. This surface mass balance (SMB) increase occurs because the higher moisture content of a warmer atmosphere leads to increases in precipitation, with this precipitation falling in the form of snow over Antarctica. Despite these robust model projections, however, observations indicate that there has been no significant change in Antarctic SMB during the past several decades. Here, we show that this apparent discrepancy between models and observations can be explained by the fact that the anthropogenic climate change signal is still relatively small compared to the noise associated with natural climate variability. Using an ensemble of 35 global coupled climate models to separate signal and noise, we find that the forced SMB increase due to global warming in recent decades is unlikely to be detectable in a statistical sense as a result of large natural SMB variability on interannual-to-multidecadal timescales. However, our analysis reveals that if the world continues to follow the present trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, the anthropogenic impact on Antarctic SMB will emerge from natural variability by the middle of the current century. With this, SMB increases over Antarctica will begin to mitigate global sea-level rise, partially offsetting the effects of dynamic ice loss.",

            "abstract": "The rupture velocities of intermediate-depth and deep-focus earthquakes --- how they vary between subduction zones, how they vary with depth, and what their maximum values are --- may help constrain the mechanism(s) that generate the earthquakes. I select earthquakes >70 km depth with MW ≥ 5.7 since 1990 in Middle America, South America, Tonga-Kermadec, Izu-Bonin-Marianas, Japan-Kuril-Kamchatka, and Hindu Kush and analyze the rupture directivity of the P waves using teleseismic data from global and regional seismic networks. I assume a constant rupture vector and estimate the rupture velocity relative to the local P-wave speed (vr/α). Since the same method is used for all earthquakes, the results can be readily compared across study areas. The study areas include some of the warmest and coldest subduction zones: subducting plate ages range from 9-150 Myr and descent rates range from 1-13 cm/yr. Across all subduction zones and depth ranges, for the 226 earthquakes with observable directivity and well-constrained rupture vectors, most earthquakes rupture on the more horizontal of the two possible nodal planes. However, the rupture vectors appear to be randomly-oriented relative to the slip vector, so the earthquakes span the continuum from Mode II (i.e., parallel slip and rupture vectors) to Mode III rupture (i.e., perpendicular slip and rupture vectors). Estimated rupture velocities span a wide range of values, from zero (for earthquakes with no observable teleseismic directivity) to approaching the local P-wave speed. The range in estimated rupture velocities is similar between all subduction zones and all depths, suggesting that local slab heterogeneity plays a more important role than temperature in determining rupture velocity. The supershear ruptures are associated with earthquakes closer to Mode II than Mode III faulting. This observation is consistent with theoretical calculations, which limit the rupture velocity to the S-wave speed for Mode III rupture but the P-wave speed for Mode II rupture.",

It has become a tool for various national and international organizations to appraise flood conditions in various areas, including where rainfall and hydrology information is limited. The GFMS has been using the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) as its main rainfall input. Now, with the advent of NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission there is an opportunity to significantly improve global flood monitoring and forecasting.\nGPM’s Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) multi-satellite product is designed to take advantage of various technical advances in the field and combine that with an efficient processing system producing “early” (6 hrs) and “late” (16 hrs) products for operational use. The products are also more uniform in results than TMPA among the various satellites going into the analysis and available at finer time and space resolutions.\nOn the road to replacing TMPA with the IMERG in the operational version of the GFMS parallel systems were run for periods to understand the impact of the new type of data on the streamflow and flood estimates. Results of this comparison are the basis for this presentation. It is expected that an improvement will be noted both in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates and a smoother transition in and out of heavy rain events, helping to reduce “shock” in the hydrology model. The finer spatial resolution should also help in this regard. The GFMS will be initially run at its primary resolution of 1/8th degree latitude/longitude with both data sets to isolate the impact of the rain information change. Other aspects will also be examined, including higher latitude events, where GPM precipitation algorithms should also provide improvements. This initial work will help focus full implementation of the IMERG into GFMS and the retrospective calculations to be done for the full TRMM/GPM era.",

Observations across a range of sediment size and density suggested that incipient motion was induced by the pressure gradients in flows with large accelerations, by the shear stresses in flows with small accelerations, and by the combined effects for intermediate flows. The combined incipient motion formulation better predicted sediment mobilization under a range of oscillatory flows. Additionally, direct numerical simulations were performed for one set of experiments involving acetate beads. The resulting hydrodynamics and turbulent characteristics were compared with the laboratory experiments. Finally, here we attempt to close the problem with a theoretical investigation into the force balance on a single grain resting on the bed under prescribed monochromatic oscillatory forcing. The theoretical investigation combines formulae from a variety of sources including empirical and quasi-empirical relations to examine the incipient motion of particles across a wide range of conditions applicable in the marine environment.",

We use the climate change results (joint distribution of seasonal temperature and precipitation changes (future vs. current)) from the global climate models (GCMs) that provided boundary conditions for the six different regional climate models used in the program as informative priors for the bivariate Bayesian Model. The two variables involved are seasonal temperature and precipitation over sub-regions (i.e., Bukovsky Regions) of the full NARCCAP domain. The basic approach to the joint Bayesian hierarchical model follows the approach of Tebaldi and Sansó (2009). We compare model results using informative (i.e., GCM information) as well as uninformative priors. We apply these results to the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) model for the Colorado Springs Utility in Colorado. We investigate the layout of the joint pdfs in the context of the water model sensitivities to ranges of temperature and precipitation results to determine the likelihoods of future climate conditions that cannot be accommodated by possible adaptation options. Comparisons may also be made with joint pdfs formed from the CMIP5 collection of global climate models and empirically downscaled to the region of interest.",

            "abstract": "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone depleting compounds whose production was phased out by the regulations of the Montreal Protocol (1987). Accidental release and disposal also led to contamination of groundwater at many locations, however, and this legacy persists. Although very stable, CFCs may degrade via abiotic and biotic pathways. Quantification of the degree of transformation of CFCs has been challenging due to other processes such as dilution, sorption and volatilization. Compound specific stable carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) has been successfully applied for a variety of priority pollutants to distinguish degradation from other processes and to quantify transformation rates. A Purge & Trap - CSIA method developed in our lab was applied to determine the stable carbon isotopic signature of CFCs and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) in groundwater samples from a contaminated site. Preliminary results suggest that degradation of CFCs and HCFCs may result in enriched δ13C values, consistent with fractionation during bond breakage as has been reported for many other hydrocarbon pollutants. The effect of volatile loss during sampling on the isotopic signatures of CFCs was examined in laboratory experiments. Volatilization from pure phase CFCs showed a small inverse isotope effect during open system volatilization, opposite to the normal isotope effect generally observed during biodegradation. For volatilization of CFCs dissolved in water a much smaller isotope effect was observed. An important result from this work is that any volatile loss may introduce only a small change in CFC isotopic signatures in groundwater, and importantly, due to the opposite direction of isotope effects associated with volatilization versus degradation, any effects of volatile loss on the isotopic signatures cannot be confused with transformation of CFCs. At most, volatilization might contribute to a conservative estimate of the extent of degradation.",

            "abstract": "In the Pacific Northwest, clockwise rotation of upper crustal blocks and far-field subduction-related strain accumulation results in active north-south shortening in the back-arc of the Cascadian subduction zone. Recent paleoseismologic and geomorphic studies in the Yakima Folds (YF) of central Washington document Quaternary fault activity and differential river incision, suggesting that strain is accommodated on multiple structures and that seismic hazard may be underestimated. To investigate the tectonic evolution and potential seismic hazard of central Washington, we focus on constraining Holocene to Neogene tectonic activity across the YF using geomorphic, geologic, and paleoseismic records of deformation. We extract stream profiles from the Manastash and Umtanum anticlines from airborne lidar data and invert them for the post-middle Miocene uplift rate. Preliminary inversion results are suggestive of an increase in uplift rate along the Umtanum anticline after the late Neogene and are consistent with the Quaternary uplift rates determined from incised strath terraces. We present new age data for offset Miocene–Pliocene sedimentary units and construct cross-sections to compare to inversion results and to published incision rates. The modeled differential uplift between the Kittitas Valley and the Umtanum anticline closely matches the vertical displacement measured from Pliocene river gravels deposited in both localities. To constrain Holocene (?) deformation rates in the YF, we trenched a ~4–5 m-high scarp along the Burbank fault, a potential back-thrust related to the formation of Umtanum anticline. Together, these data provide a quantitative estimate for kyr- to Myr-scale uplift rates and horizontal shortening accommodated in the YF. We compare our Holocene to Neogene rates with the regional geodetic strain rate to assess the relative seismic hazards of individual tectonic structures in central Washington.",

            "abstract": "It has been known for many decades that Venus shows strong contrasts when observed at UV wavelengths, as opposed to longer wavelengths in the visible and NIR, where Venus looks very homogeneous. This has been explained by the presence of a so-called UV absorber, which chemical identity is still unclear. Two hypothesis concerning the source and distribution of the UV-absorber have been put forward. For one of them the argument is that the absorbing substance is being transported from below the clouds up to the cloud top level by means of convection. This implies that in regions with more convection the absorber would be more abundant at the cloud-tops, thus resulting in lower brightness when observed in the UV. In the other scenario, it is haze-forming material which is brought to the cloud-tops by convection; in this case regions with stronger convection produce higher cloud tops would therefore show brighter in the UV.\nThe premise behind the current analysis is to combine data from the Venus Express Radio Science experiment (VeRa) and from the Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC), to search for any correlation between the temperature structure (Tz and static stability, Sz) as sounded on one specific location and the UV brightness of that same location.\nBetween 25 November and 31 December 2013 a special observing “South Polar Dynamics” campaign was performed with Venus Express. On each orbit one VeRa atmosphere sounding was acquired shortly after the pericentre passage, as well as a series of VMC-UV images capturing the very VeRa sounding location on that orbit before and after the sounding as it moves across the planet pushed by the zonal and meridional winds. Additional data was found from the another 42 orbits from entire mission Venus Express data set. The sounded latitudes varied between 0˚and -83º.\nThe question is whether or not we can identify any statistically significant correlations between the temperature structure at a given location and the relative UV-brightness at that same location. We compare Tz and Sz for levels between 50 and 80km altitude to the relative UV brightness for 30 orbits. No significant correlations have been found.",

            "abstract": "Relict beaches adjacent to Lake Turkana provide a record of water level variability for the Late Quaternary. This study focused on deciphering the geomorphology, sedimentology, stratigraphy and 14C chronology of strand plain sequences in the Kalokol and Lothagam areas. Nine >30 m oscillations in water level were documented between ca. 15 and 4 ka. The earliest oscillation between ca. 14.5 and 13 ka is not well constrained with water level to at least 70 m above the present surface and subsequently fell to at least 50 m. Lake level increased to ~ 90 m between ca. 11.2 and 10.4 ka, post Younger Dryas cooling. Water level fell by >30 m by 10.2 ka, with another potential rise at ca. 8.5 ka to >70 m above current level. Lake level regressed by > 40 m at 8.2 ka coincident with cooling in the equatorial Eastern Atlantic Ocean. Two major >70 m lake level oscillations centered at 6.6 and 5.2 ka may reflect enhanced convection with warmer sea surface temperatures in the Western Indian Ocean. The end of the African Humid Period occurred from ca. 8.0 to 4.5 ka and was characterized by variable lake level (± > 40 m), rather than one monotonic fall in water level. This lake level variability reflects a complex response to variations in the extent and intensity of the East and West African Monsoons near geographic and topographic limits within the catchment of Lake Turkana. Also, for this closed lake basin excess and deficits in water input are amplified with a cascading lake effect in the East Rift Valley and through the Chew Bahir Basin. The final regression from a high stand of > 90 m began at. 5.2 ka and water level was below 20 m by 4.5 ka; and for the remainder of the Holocene. This sustained low stand is associated with weakening of the West African Monsoon, a shift of the mean position of Congo Air Boundary west of the Lake Turkana catchment and with meter-scale variability in lake level linked to Walker circulation across the Indian Ocean. A surprising observation is the presence of older, heavily dissected relict beaches up to 175 m above current lake level, which host beach rock and well developed carbonate rich soils. A preliminary OSL age of 145 ka, indicates that these surface are associated with MOI stage 6 and 5. The higher elevation of these beach either reflect tectonic up-warping, a change in elevation of the outlet to the Blue Nile or combination of these processes.",

            "abstract": "The forefield of Múlajökull—a warm-based, surge-type glacier in central Iceland—comprises the only known active drumlin field, with drumlins of similar morphometry to their Pleistocene counterparts but formed under better-known glaciological conditions.\nStudy of till magnetic and till fabrics, till densities and preconsolidation stresses, and drumlin stratigraphy indicates that drumlin relief reflects both erosion and deposition: 1) the package of basal tills that constitutes the drumlins thickens where the forefield has experienced more surging, but uniformities are common on drumlin flanks, 2) attitudes of till layers and patterns of deformation within them indicate till deposition occurred on drumlin slopes rather than prior to drumlinization, and 3) past effective stresses during quiescent periods were highest in interdrumlin areas.\nThese data suggest that erosion occurred during quiescence, rather than during surging, with erosion rates that increased under increasing effective stress. Stratigraphic evidence connecting specific till layers to surge moraines (Johnson et al., 2010, Geology 38, 943-6), on the other hand, indicates that deposition occurred during surges. Such deposition could have resulted from negative flux divergence in a shearing bed, but till fabrics provide no evidence for longitudinally compressive strain. A more likely origin for the basal till is that rapid, uniform bed shear during surging—consistent with the low and relatively uniform effective stresses expected during such periods—generated basal melt rates sufficient to release debris from ice and lodge it onto the bed. This conceptual model of alternating erosion and deposition implies drumlins formed by slow flowing ice elsewhere will be dominantly erosional, whereas drumlins with evidence of deposition may have experienced fast ice flow.",

            "abstract": "We have performed experiments on the evolution of fracture permeability during serpentinization of ultramafic rocks. The experiments were performed using a flow-through triaxial machine on samples of ultramafic rocks with a well-mated through-going tensile fracture at hydrothermal conditions at effective pressure of 30 MPa and temperature of 260°C. By determining the flow rate under a pore pressure gradient during the experiments and assuming a cubic law relating fracture aperture and permeability, the results showed that fracture permeability decreased by one to two orders of magnitude during the 200 to 340 hour experiments. Electron microprobe data and SEM images indicated the formation of needle-shaped crystals of serpentine composition along the walls of the fracture. Assuming the dissolution and precipitation reactions occur simultaneously along the fracture walls we found that the rate of transformation at the beginning of the experiments is ~10-4-5 (molm-2hr-1) and decreases monotonically for about an order of magnitude towards the end of experiments. The rate of transformation is converted to rate of reaction of 10-5-7 s-1 at the beginning of the experiments, which is in agreement with estimates of Martin and Fyfe, [1970] of the rate of serpentinization reactions. The results suggest that the reaction rate slowed with increasing time as available reactive surface area decreased. The results also indicate that the water-rock reactions were the main mechanism contributing to the reduction in fracture aperture and cubic law is a reasonable first approximation for understanding evolution of fracture permeability. The experimental results suggest that the fracture network in long-lived hydrothermal circulation systems can be sealed rapidly as a result of mineral precipitation, and generation of new permeability resulting from a combination of tectonic and crystallization-induced stresses is required to maintain fluid circulation.",

            "abstract": "Shahbazpur structure is located within the Hatia trough a southern extension of prolific Surma Basin, where lies all of the largest Gas fields of Bangladesh. A method is established to delineate the structural mapping precisely by interpreting four 2D seismic lines that are acquired over Shahbazpur structure. Moreover direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) related attributes analyzed for further confirmation of presence of hydrocarbon. To do this synthetic generation, seismic well tie, velocity modelling and depth conversion has been performed. Seismic attribute analysis used in this study is mostly related to bright spot identification in reservoir zones as well as to identify the similar response in both below and above of the reservoir zones. Seismic interpretation shows that Shahbazpur structure is roughly an oval shaped anticline with simple four way dip closure which will be a good trap for hydrocarbon accumulation. A limited number of seismic attributes functions that are available in an academic version of Petrel software are applied to analyze attributes. Taking in consideration of possible interpretation pitfalls, attributes analysis confirmed that bright spots exist in the shallower part of the structure above the present reservoir zones which might be a potential shallow gas reserve. The bright spots are located within Shahbazpur sequence I of Dupi Tila Group of Pleistocene age and Shahbazpur sequence II of Tipam Group of Pleistocene-Pliocene age. This signature will play a very important role in next well planning on the same structure to test the shallow accumulation of hydrocarbon. For better understanding of this shallow reserve, it is suggested to acquire 3D seismic data over Shahbazpur structure which will help to evaluate the hydrocarbon accumulation and to identify gas migration pathways.",

Additional funding is pouring into future ground-based auroral observation networks consisting of combinations of tossable, portable, and fixed installation ground-based legacy equipment. Our approach to this problem using the High Speed Tomography (HiST) system combines tightly-synchronized filtered auroral optical observations capturing temporal features of order 10 ms with supporting measurements from incoherent scatter radar (ISR). ISR provides a broader spatial context up to order 100 km laterally on one minute time scales, while our camera field of view (FOV) is chosen to be order 10 km at auroral altitudes in order to capture 100 m scale lateral auroral features. The dual-scale observations of ISR and HiST fine-scale optical observations may be coupled through a physical model using linear basis functions to estimate important ionospheric quantities such as electron number density in 3-D (time, perpendicular and parallel to the geomagnetic field).\nField measurements and analysis using HiST and PFISR are presented from experiments conducted at the Poker Flat Research Range in central Alaska. Other multiscale configuration candidates include supplementing networks of all-sky cameras such as THEMIS with co-locations of HiST-like instruments to fuse wide FOV measurements with the fine-scale HiST precipitation characteristic estimates. Candidate models for this coupling include GLOW and TRANSCAR. Future extensions of this work may include incorporating line of sight total electron count estimates from ground-based networks of GPS receivers in a sensor fusion problem.",

            "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in river temperature monitoring and research in recent years. This has been driven by factors including a greater awareness of the importance of river temperature for freshwater ecology, the potential for detrimental extremes under climate change and the availability of increasingly affordable dataloggers. A number of studies have attempted to collate and analyse pre-existing long-term (decadal) datasets to assess for evidence of temporal trends. These studies require considerable care given the magnitude of temporal trends (often < 1 degree per decade), the low signal to noise ratio in the data and the potential for bias across different makes, models and individual dataloggers. Despite these issues, data quality control often receives only a superficial consideration with subjective assessments of data quality or a reliance on manufacturer reported accuracy with consequences for the reliability and interpretation of findings. This study assessed the potential influence of logger bias on reported temperature trends in the Girnock Burn, Scotland over > 25 years. The bias of temperature measurements made by different dataloggers (two makes and five models) was determined through cross-calibration against a reference datalogger. Long-term trends in stream temperature metrics (daily mean, max, min) were characterised using Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMM). Models were fitted to (1) the raw data and (2) data corrected for logger bias. Significant non-linear temporal trends were observed in the raw data. These trends were accentuated when corrected for logger bias. Given the potential to accentuate or remove long-term trends, it is suggested that robust internal and external calibration and quality control procedures should be established for new temperature networks. Such approaches are capable of removing logger bias and improving accuracy by an order of magnitude over manufacturer stated values.",

            "abstract": "The Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) on the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) combines data from eight spectrometers, each with four deflection states, into a single map of the sky. Any systematic discontinuity, artifact, noise source, etc. present in this map may be incorrectly interpreted as legitimate data and incorrect conclusions reached. For this reason it is desirable to have all spectrometers return the same output for a given input, and for this output to be low in noise sources or other errors. While many missions use statistical analyses of data to calibrate instruments in flight, this process is difficult with FPI for two reasons: 1. Only a small fraction of high resolution data is downloaded to the ground due to bandwidth limitations and 2: The data that is downloaded is, by definition, scientifically interesting and therefore not ideal for calibration. FPI uses a suite of new tools to calibrate in flight. A new method for detection system ground calibration has been developed involving sweeping the detection threshold to fully define the pulse height distribution. This method has now been extended for use in flight as a means to calibrate MCP voltage and threshold (together forming the operating point) of the Dual Electron Spectrometers (DES) and Dual Ion Spectrometers (DIS). A method of comparing higher energy data (which has low fractional voltage error) to lower energy data (which has a higher fractional voltage error) will be used to calibrate the high voltage outputs. Finally, a comparison of pitch angle distributions will be used to find remaining discrepancies among sensors.\nInitial flight results from the four MMS observatories will be discussed here. Specifically, data from initial commissioning, inter-instrument cross calibration and interference testing, and initial Phase1A routine calibration results. Success and performance of the in flight calibration as well as deviation from the ground calibration will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Observations show large increases in summertime (JJA) surface solar radiation (SWdn) over the central and southeastern United States during the last 20 years, as much as a +40 Wm-2 at midday. At the same time, in response to environmental regulations in the early 1990s, emissions of U.S. aerosol precursors have decreased by as much as 60%. Detecting a possible connection between these two trends has been difficult due to the secondary effects of aerosols on cloud concentration and lifetime, and previous efforts have failed to find a direct link. Here we investigate the clear-sky direct effect of decreasing U.S. aerosols on climate, using a radiative transfer model (RRTMG) driven by 1997-2014 measurements of aerosol optical depth at Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites in the central and southeastern United States. We impose aerosol asymmetry parameters and single scattering albedos from nearby Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. Preliminary results indicate that declining aerosols drive a summer noontime change in clear-sky SWdn of +25 Wm-2 since 1997 at Goodwin Creek, MS, accounting for 56% of the observed increase in SWdn at that site. Similarly, we find that aerosols increase clear-sky SWdn by +6.5 Wm-2 in Bondville, IL, which accounts for 21% of the observed SWdn trend there. These results suggest that the climate in these regions of the U.S. may be sensitive to recent reductions in aerosol concentrations, especially during summer months. We also analyze in situ soil measurements from the Illinois Climate Network from 1990-present, and find that a significant decrease in soil moisture (-0.6 m3 m-3 a-1) accompanies the increase in SWdn, implying a link between aerosol trends and regional hydrology. Aerosol reductions are expected to continue in the United States and may further influence regional climate including hydrological factors. Our work has implications for polluted regions outside the U.S., where future reductions in the aerosol burden could increase vulnerability to drought.",

            "abstract": "Climate models project a greater likelihood of drought across much of the American southwest in the future due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, though there is large uncertainty about the possible severity of these extremes. One way to assess the skill of these models is to test their ability to simulate past known hydroclimate change. Middle to late Holocene droughts in the western US are a particularly good target because they were more severe than any observed in the short instrumental record and because they are documented by quantitative paleoclimate records. We chose Lake Tahoe for this comparison given its well-studied current condition and quantitative indicators of lake level changes during the middle Holocene (circa 6,000 years ago) and late Holocene (circa 11th-12th centuries AD). We used data output from eight different CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) models as input into a lake forward model to quantify lake level changes. The lake forward model has two components: an energy balance model that calculates lake evaporation and a water balance model that uses lake evaporation in conjunction with precipitation, runoff and other hydrologic quantities to calculate lake level. We find that the lake forward model significantly underestimates the severity of drought as indicated by proxy records. We will discuss possible causes of this discrepancy, including downscaling of coupled climate model output, tectonic impacts on the proxy record, and the models’ representation of Pacific sea surface temperatures.",

            "abstract": "A number of tropical hydroclimate reconstructions provide evidence for substantial changes in tropical rainfall patterns over the last millennium. One of the hypothesized features of the climate during the Little Ice Age (LIA; ca. 1300-1800 CE) is a more southerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We evaluate the evidence for, and mechanisms of, a southward shift of tropical precipitation during the LIA, utilizing the last millennium simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5/Paleoclimate Intercomparison Project Phase 3 archive. Six out of the seven model simulations analyzed demonstrate a southward shift in tropical precipitation during the LIA in (as determined by a decrease in tropical precipitation asymmetry between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere). While a southward shift of tropical precipitation during the LIA appears to be a robust feature across model simulations, the change is small and is manifested in the different model simulations in largely disparate ways. However, some common features emerge. We compare the simulated precipitation changes to proxy records and discuss to what extent the precipitation changes appear to be driven by thermodynamic scaling principles (i.e. a wet-get-drier, dry-get-wetter scenario associated with global cooling) and to what extent they appear to be tied to circulation changes in the atmosphere (e.g. a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone).",

The highest NAMA H2O outliers in the central continental United States are almost certainly the result of direct, local injection of ice into the lower stratosphere (LS) by convection that overshoots the tropopause. However, the relative importance of these direct injections in supplying the bulk of the NAMA LS humidity anomaly compared to that of transport from convection on the tropical side of the anticyclone has not been conclusively determined. Large-scale circulation models have reproduced the high NAMA LS water vapor with tropical convection followed by advection and ascent, however the handling of convection in such models is generally a source of uncertainty. NAMA H2O at 100--83 hPa is close to saturation at the low tropopause temperatures on the tropical side of the anticylone, and cold anomalies above this convection have been shown to act as cold traps, leading to an anticorrelation between NAMA LS humidity and tropical convective intensity. In this work we use MLS and other satellite-based observations to investigate the importance of direct convective injection in supplying the high H2O anomalies within the NAMA LS anticyclone.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand the impact environmental conditions have on infrasound detection, an automated detector that accounts for both correlated and uncorrelated noise is run on data from a number of infrasonic arrays, all in a regional context. Data from six seismo-acoustic arrays in South Korea (BRDAR, CHNAR, KMPAR, KSGAR, TJIAR, and YPDAR), which are cooperatively operated by Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) and Southern Methodist University (SMU), were used. An adaptive F-detector (AFD) (Arrowsmith et al., 2009) is applied that utilizes the F-statistic (Blandford, 1974) with an adaptive procedure that assesses variations in coherent noise in order to reduce false alarms. The adaptive procedure is characterized by the time dependent C-value that is found to depend on the weather conditions and local site effects. Arrays located on islands or near the coast produce noise power densities that are higher, consistent with both higher wind speeds as well as ocean wave contributions that vary seasonally. These results suggest that optimal detection processing requires careful characterization of background noise level and its relationship to enviornmental measures at individual arrays. This study also documents significant seasonal variations in infrasound detections including daily time of occurrence, total number of detections, and phase velocity/azimuth estimates. These time-dependent effects in most part explained by atmospheric models across the Korean peninsula as described by Drob et al. (2003).",

            "abstract": "Mount Paektu (also known as Changbaishan) is a large caldera located on the border between China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Circa 946 AD, Paektu produced one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history, the so-called Millennium Eruption (ME), whose combined fall and pyroclastic flow deposits total approximately 25 km3 dense rock equivalent (95% commendite, 5% late stage trachyte). Despite its recent and potentially destructive history, the volcano is not well studied due to its relative inaccessibility. A seismic swarm beneath the volcano’s summit in 2002-2005 spurred a unique collaboration between scientists from the DPRK, US, and the UK with the goals of characterizing Paektu’s eruptive history and assessing its current state of activity. We present new results from this collaboration, including major and trace element (XRF, EMP and SHRIMP-RG) and volatile data (SHRIMP-RG and FTIR) on feldspar-, clinopyroxene-, and olivine-hosted melt inclusions (MI), matrix glasses, and bulk pumices from four ME comendites and one ME trachyte. MI are halogen rich (F≤4000 ppm, Cl≤5000 ppm) with moderate S (≤250 ppm) and H2O (≤4 wt%) and minimal CO2 (≤15 ppm, detection limit ~2 ppm). H2O contents in comendite MI indicate saturation pressures (at 725 °C) of ~150 MPa, corresponding to a magma chamber depth of ~6 km, similar to the depth inferred for the magmatic injection thought to have resulted in the 2002-05 earthquake swarm. ME comendite is consistent with a ca. 25% residual melt by fractional crystallization from an ME trachyte parent. Published U-series zircon ages from ME comendite indicate a magma residence time of 11ky. Thus, the late stage ME trachyte likely represents a mafic recharge event of a melt separate from but geochemically similar to the original ME comendite parent.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind electron velocity distribution function (eVDF) displays a great variety of non-thermal features (e.g., core, halo and strahl electron populations; with superposition of different temperatures, thermal anisotropies, suprathermal tails, beam-like features, etc.) that deviate from thermal equilibrium. These electron nonthermal deviations provide a local source for whistler-cyclotron and firehose instabilities electromagnetic fluctuations that are commonly observed. We present clear observational evidence that the temperature anisotropy whistler instability threshold, of a nonthermal kappa distribution plasma, marginally bounds solar wind magnetic fluctuations — when the full electron distribution is considered, without regard of separation of the various electron components during slow solar wind periods. Analysis seems to suggest that during slow solar wind periods, collisional effects are dominant. During fast solar wind periods, magnetic fluctuations and solar wind anisotropies are enhanced above the parallel whistler anisotropic threshold boundary and collisional effects are drastically reduced. Preliminary calculations further show that the oblique electron whistler mirror anisotropic instability bounds both the slow and fast solar wind. Regardless of solar wind speed, the solar wind electron thermal anisotropy appears globally bounded by the parallel electron firehose instability for anisotropies Te⊥ / Te|| < 1 indicative of a firehose-stable electron plasma. Preliminary analysis suggests that skew-kappa nonthermal distributions also shows marginally stable threshold boundaries when considering electron heat flux instability thresholds. The results of our analysis suggests that the slow solar wind electron plasma, when considered globally as a single eVDF, is only marginally stable with respect to nonthermal skew kappa distributions and parallel propagating instabilities.",

            "abstract": "Irrigation is considered to be one of the best practices in agriculture to ensure food security. However water resources that are used for Irrigation activities are increasingly coming under stress, either due to extraction or climate variability and change. To adequately plan and manage water resources so as to ensure their sustainability requires a long term investigations of streamflow and climate. Streamflow analysis and forecasting gives signal of the occurrence of floods and drought situations. However the ability to maximise these early warning signal, especially for small watersheds, require the use of rainfall predictions approaches (Yucel et al., 2015). One approach to extend the predictions of these early warning signals is the coupling of mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model precipitation estimates with a spatial resolution hydrological model into streamflow estimates (Jasper et al. 2002;Wardah et al. 2008; Yucel et al. 2015). The study explored (1) the potential of the NWP model (WRF) in reproducing observed precipitation over the Tono basin in West Africa, and (2) the potential of a coupled version of WRF with a physics-based hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) in estimating river streamflow. In order to cope with the lack of discharge observation in the Tono basin, the WRF-Hydro performances are evaluated with a water balance approach and dam level observation. The WRF-Hydro predicted dam level is relatively close to the observation (dam level) from January to August (R2=0.93). After this period the deviation from observation increases (R2=0.62). This could be attributed to surface runoff due to peak rainfall (in August) resulting in soil saturation (soil reaching infiltration capacity) into the dam which has not been accounted for in the water balance model. WRF-Hydro has shown to give good estimation of streamflow especially for ungauged stations. Further works requires using WRF-Hydro modeling system for climate projection, and assess the sustainability of the Tono irrigation scheme.",

The deeper structure of the orogenic wedge and associated deformation processes, however, are poorly understood partly due to the lack of seismic images of the crust.\nTo better understand these differences in structure and deformation, we use data of a temporary seismic broadband network in Bhutan to image the crustal structure with receiver functions (RF). We apply an iterative 3D wave-based migration scheme including a high-frequency ray approximation, which satisfies Snell’s law for dipping interfaces. With this approach we image variably dipping intra-crustal interfaces and the Moho topography across the Bhutan Himalaya, and identify lateral variations in the orogenic structure, which we interpret jointly with a new local earthquake catalog.\nIn West Bhutan, RF imaging depicts a northward dipping Moho at ~50 km depth. The low-angle dip steepens north of ~27.6°N which matches well observations by wide-angle seismics in South Tibet and the hypocenter of a deep crustal earthquake recorded by our network. We also identify the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) at ~14 km depth in West Bhutan with a ramp-like structure north of ~27.6°N. The ramp is characterized by a negative impedance contrast in the RF signals and coincides with a concentration of seismicity. In the East, the Moho appears to be almost flat at a depth of ~50 km without clear indications of steepening towards north. Beneath the Kuru Chu Spur in East Bhutan, we observe listric-shaped structures reaching from the upper crust beneath the Lesser Himalaya down to the Moho beneath the Greater Himalaya, which we interpret as a stack of crustal material typical for an accretionary wedge.

            "abstract": "To accurately predict how the distribution of extreme events may change in the future we need to understand the mechanisms that influence such events in our current climate. Our current observing system is not well-suited for observing extreme events globally due to the sparse sampling and in-homogeneity of ground-based in-situ observations and the infrequent revisit time of satellite observations. Observations of weather extremes, such as extreme precipitation events, temperature extremes, tropical and extra-tropical cyclones among others, with temporal resolution on the order of minutes and spatial resolution on the order of few kms (<10 kms), are required for improved forecasting of extreme weather events. We envision a suite of low-cost passive microwave sounding and imaging sensors on CubeSats that would work in concert with traditional flagship observational systems, such as those manifested on large environmental satellites (i.e. JPSS,WSF,GCOM-W), to monitor weather extremes.\nA 118/183 GHz sensor would enable observations of temperature and precipitation extremes over land and ocean as well as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones. This proposed project would enable low cost, compact radiometer instrumentation at 118 and 183 GHz that would fit in a 6U Cubesat with the objective of mass-producing this design to enable a suite of small satellites to image the key geophysical parameters needed to improve prediction of extreme weather events. We take advantage of past and current technology developments at JPL viz. HAMSR (High Altitude Microwave Scanning Radiometer), Advanced Component Technology (ACT’08) to enable low-mass, low-power high frequency airborne radiometers.\nIn this paper, we will describe the design and implementation of the 118 GHz temperature sounder and 183 GHz humidity sounder on the 6U CubeSat. In addition, we will discuss the maiden airborne deployment of the instrument during the Plain Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) experiment. The successful demonstration of this instrument on the 6U CubeSat would pave the way for the development of a constellation which could sample tropospheric temperature and humidity with fine temporal and spatial resolution.",

In the initial download of images, acquired at 2.2 km/pixel, widely distributed impact craters up to 260 km diameter are seen in the near-encounter hemisphere. Many of the craters appear to be significantly degraded or infilled. Some craters appear partially destroyed, perhaps by erosion such as associated with the retreat of scarps. Bright ice-rich deposits highlight some crater rims and/or floors. While the cratered terrains identified in the initial downloaded images are generally seen on high-to-intermediate albedo surfaces, the dark equatorial terrain informally known as Cthulhu Regio is also densely cratered. We will explore the range of possible processes that might have operated (or still be operating) to modify the landscape from that of an ancient pristinely cratered state to the present terrains revealed in New Horizons images. The sequence, intensity, and type of processes that have modified ancient landscapes are, among other things, the record of climate and volatile evolution throughout much of the Pluto’s existence. The deciphering of this record will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Mars has a unique magnetic environment in the solar system. Not only does it have an induced magnetosphere as a result of the existence of an atmosphere and the lack of the global magnetic field, but its strong localized crustal magnetic fields can create noticeable effects on the induced magnetosphere near the planet. The configuration of the induced magnetosphere is therefore constantly changing because of planetary rotation and the non-steady interplanetary field. The quantitative knowledge of the induced Martian magnetospheric magnetic field is important in estimating the escape of charged particles from Mars, thus helping achieve the science objectives of MAVEN.\nThis study constructs an empirical model of the induced Martian magnetospheric magnetic field by adopting some of the approaches used for modeling the Earth’s magnetosphere as well as by incorporating new elements unique to the Martian magnetic field environment. The induced magnetosphere consists of components associated with the tail current sheet, the Mars counterpart of the Chapman-Ferraro current, and the draped fields. The crustal magnetic fields based on prior studies are also included. The empirical model has a set of parameters whose values can be obtained through matching MAVEN observations. Specifically, the MAG instrument provides the magnetic field data, and particle data are used to help locate boundaries between regions.\nCompared with global numerical models of the induced Martian magnetosphere, the empirical model has an apparent advantage in its capability of rapidly estimating the magnetic field configurations for different solar wind conditions. We will describe the methodology for modeling the induced Martian magnetospheric magnetic field and demonstrate the initial results based on the first year of MAVEN data.",

            "abstract": "A 1986 meeting on the future of rock magnetism proposed an idea for a center where researchers in rock magnetism, other earth science disciplines, and allied fields in the physical sciences could share ideas and have access to advanced instrumentation in magnetism. The idea became reality in 1990, when the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) was established as a shared resource for the GP and broader research communities, providing instruments to study the magnetism of rocks, sediment, biological materials and synthetic analogs. This is accomplished with a suite of instruments that measures magnetization from 2-1000 K, in DC fields up to 5 T and AC fields up to 10 kHz. These are complemented by Mössbauer spectrometers (4.2-300K, 0-6.5T), a high-temperature magnetic force microscope (Tmax~ 673 K), and a low-temperature probe (20-300 K) for vector remanence measurements. A unique aspect of the IRM was that it allowed for routine measurements below 300 K and provided new ways of \"seeing\" magnetism. This has enabled researchers to study magnetic behavior through magnetic ordering temperatures, crystal phase transitions, and blocking temperatures, providing new insights into mineral magnetism as well as developing new methods to interpret the magnetism of natural materials.\nThe main access to the IRM is the Visiting Fellowship (VF) program, where 379 have been awarded representing 157 institutions from the US and 30 countries. Nearly 50% of VFs have gone to students. The total output of visiting and in-house researches have produced about 800 publications to date. The IRM also provides education and outreach activities including: (1) The IRM Quarterly with over 600 subscribers; (2) The Biennial Santa Fe meetings on the current state and future trends in magnetic research; and (3) The Biennial Summer Schools for Rock Magnetism offering graduate students in the geosciences with instruction in rock magnetism theory and hands-on lab training.",

            "abstract": "The existence of ionospheric anomalies before earthquakes is now widely accepted. These phenomena started to be considered by GPS community to mitigate the GPS signal degradation over the territories of the earthquake preparation. The question is still open if they could be useful for seismology and for short-term earthquake forecast. More than decade of intensive studies proved that ionospheric anomalies registered before earthquakes are initiated by processes in the boundary layer of atmosphere over earthquake preparation zone and are induced in the ionosphere by electromagnetic coupling through the Global Electric Circuit. Multiparameter approach based on the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling model demonstrated that earthquake forecast is possible only if we consider the final stage of earthquake preparation in the multidimensional space where every dimension is one from many precursors in ensemble, and they are synergistically connected. We demonstrate approaches developed in different countries (Russia, Taiwan, Japan, Spain, and Poland) within the framework of the ISSI and ESA projects) to identify the ionospheric precursors. They are also useful to determine the all three parameters necessary for the earthquake forecast: impending earthquake epicenter position, expectation time and magnitude. These parameters are calculated using different technologies of GPS signal processing: time series, correlation, spectral analysis, ionospheric tomography, wave propagation, etc. Obtained results from different teams demonstrate the high level of statistical significance and physical justification what gives us reason to suggest these methodologies for practical validation.",

            "abstract": "Land-cover change is a fundamental contributor to changes in climate, hydrology, and carbon cycling. European settlers introduced a series of widespread land-cover changes in eastern North America beginning in the early 17th century. These changes varied both temporally and spatially, and were related to population growth, emerging technology, and land-use. To examine the potential influence of historical land-cover changes on local to regional climate, we adapted reconstructed fractional land cover from 1650, 1850, and 1920 as well as land cover interpreted from Landsat imagery circa 1992 (Steyaert and Knox, 2008) as input for regional climate model experiments. Observed changes included: deforestation and conversion to agriculture in the mid-Atlantic region from 1650 to 1850, region-wide expansion of agriculture from 1850 to 1920, and wetland drainage, reforestation, and increased urbanization from 1920 to 1992.\nWe translated the land cover datasets to the BATS (Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme) thematic classification on a 20 km2 grid for ingestion into the RegCM4 regional climate model. In BATS, land-cover classifications determine biophysical parameters such as the seasonal albedo cycle, fractional vegetation condition, stomatal resistance, leaf area index (LAI), and rooting depth. By defining and characterizing land cover in a consistent manner across the four time slices, we are able to explore interactions and feedbacks between land cover and regional climate in late prehistoric and historic times.\nSteyaert, L.

            "abstract": "Multiple competing theories suggest that power law behavior governs the observed first-order dynamics of streamflow recessions - the important process by which catchments dry-out via the stream network, altering the availability of surface water resources and in-stream habitat. Frequently modeled as: dq/dt = -aqb, recessions typically exhibit a high degree of variability, even within a single catchment, as revealed by significant shifts in the values of “a” and “b” across recession events. One potential source of this variability lies in underlying, hard-to-observe fluctuations in how catchment water storage is partitioned amongst distinct storage elements, each having different discharge behaviors. Testing this and competing hypotheses with widely available streamflow timeseries, however, has been hindered by a power law scaling artifact that obscures meaningful covariation between the recession parameters, “a” and “b”. Here we briefly outline a technique that removes this artifact, revealing intriguing new patterns in the joint distribution of recession parameters. Using long-term flow data from catchments in Northern California, we explore temporal variations, and find that the \"a\" parameter varies strongly with catchment wetness. Then we explore how the \"b\" parameter changes with \"a\", and find that measures of its variation are maximized at intermediate \"a\" values. We propose an interpretation of this pattern based on statistical mechanics, meaning \"b\" can be viewed as an indicator of the catchment \"microstate\" - i.e. the partitioning of storage ‐ and \"a\" as a measure of the catchment macrostate (i.e. the total storage). In statistical mechanics, entropy (i.e. microstate variance, that is the variance of \"b\") is maximized for intermediate values of extensive variables (i.e. wetness, \"a\"), as observed in the recession data. This interpretation of \"a\" and \"b\" was supported by model runs using a multiple‐reservoir catchment toy model, and lends support to the hypothesis that power law streamflow recession dynamics, and their variations, have their origin in the multiple modalities of storage partitioning.",

            "abstract": "The use of an approximation to the Bigeleisen-Mayer-Urey model for isotope fractionation has led to the concept of a constant, and later constrained, mass fractionation law for multiple isotopes of the same element. This concept has brought new insights to investigation in photochemistry, radical chemistry, or the contribution of quantum tunneling to chemical and biological processes. Despite previous work indicating that these mass fractionation laws can be highly variable, the concept of a constant relationship remains common in these fields. Using the diatomic case as a first-order approximation, we demonstrate generically that the mass fractionation exponent, θ, can take any value for small fractionations but is less variable for large fractionations. The predicted variability is larger than both theoretical and analytical precision. These deviations from the traditional range of mass-dependence exponents are the largest under cross-over scenarios, but can occur for any scenario with small fractionations. We advocate the use of ∆∆‡M or “change in cap-delta”, defined strictly with a slope of at the high-temperature limit, as a necessary, more reliable and more useful descriptor of mass-dependent fractionation. This work can bring new insights and a conventional explanation to low temperature experiments yielding traditionally unusual mass fractionation laws.",

            "abstract": "Patterns of climate response to anthropogenic aerosols and well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) changes are investigated using eight models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. In the 20th century, the principal climate response patterns show both similarities and differences between aerosol and GHG runs. This paper focuses on distinct patterns of climate response to aerosol and GHG changes, while a recent companion study discussed the similarities.\nThe GHG induced radiative forcing gives rise to amplified warming in the tropical upper troposphere and intensified mid-latitude jets in both hemispheres. However, for the anthropogenic aerosols, they are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere and the temperature change shows a deep cooling structure in the troposphere around 40°N. Consistent with thermal wind balance, the cooling anchors a westerly acceleration to its south in aerosol runs. The response to aerosol induced inter-hemispheric asymmetry is also interpreted in terms of an anomalous Hadley circulation across the equator. Careful comparison indicates that the aerosol forcing dominates the Northern Hemisphere response in atmospheric circulation and precipitation, including a southward shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, the drying trend over the East Asia monsoon region, the southward shift of the East Asia westerly jet and the North Pacific cooling. The GHG forcing dominates the tropical Pacific rainfall increase mediated by the sea surface temperature pattern. Several climate response pattern indices are evaluated for the relative importance of aerosol and GHG forcing. The aerosol induced inter-hemisphere thermal contrast plays a key role in inducing climate response patterns that are quite different from the results in GHG runs.",

Our composite speleothem records from Laos—a key site at the interface between the Indian and East Asian monsoon systems—will be used as a case study for interpreting speleothem δ18O in the South-East Asian Monsoon (SEAM) region.\nOur results show that δ18Op extracted from the grid point closest to four cave sites from IsoGSM shows very low correlation between δ18Op and local precipitation. δ18Op at Dongge cave reveals a negative correlation (0.4 to 0.5) with precipitation in the Bay of Bengal, suggesting that δ18Op from the East Asian monsoon area reflects upstream distillation over the Indian monsoon region. δ18Op in Laos exhibits a negative correlation with precipitation over the broad Indo-Pacific warm pool region, indicating increased convection over this area leads to more negative δ18Op over SE Asia. Given the low correlation between local precipitation and δ18Op at all four cave sites, we interpret the δ18Op at these locales as reflective of regional changes in hydroclimate, rather than local precipitation amount. In addition, δ18Op from IsoGSM at all fours sites, especially Qunf, Mawnluh, and Tham Mai cave, show a positive correlation with Pacific SSTs over the NINO3.4 region and in the western and northern Indian Ocean, suggesting that the δ18Op of annual rainfall may be influenced by ENSO and IOD.As a case study, after detrending, Laos δ18Op from IsoGSM since 1900 AD is moderately correlated with the NINO3.4 index (r=0.53) and with the IOD index at a lag of 1 year (r = -0.35). This indicates that interannual variability of δ18Op at our site is likely controlled by ENSO.",

            "abstract": "Two of the key missing features of fresh and evolving volcanic plumes are the particle size distribution and its partitioning into non-volatile ash and volatile sulfate particles. Such information would allow more refined estimates of the evolution and dispersal of the aerosol, of the impacts of the aerosol on radiation and on stratospheric chemistry, and of the overall amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere. To provide this information aerosol measurements must be sensitive to particles in the 0.1 - 10 µm radius range, with concentration detection thresholds > 0.001 cm-3, and to the total aerosol population. An added bonus would be a size resolved measurement of the non-volatile fraction of the aerosol. The measurements must span the lower and mid stratosphere up to about 30 km. There are no remote measurements which can provide this information. In situ measurements using aerosol and condensation nuclei counters are required. Aircraft platforms are available for measurements up to 20 km, but beyond that requires balloon platforms. Measurements above 20 km would be required for a large volcanic eruption. There are balloon-borne instruments capable of fulfilling all of the measurement requirements; however such instruments are reasonably large and not expendable. The difficulty is deploying the instruments, obtaining the flight permissions from air traffic control, and recovering the instruments after flight. Such difficulties are compounded in the tropics. This talk will detail some previous experience in this area and suggest ways forward to be ready for the next big eruption.",

Understanding water surface slope and width dynamics in river reaches is important for both developing and validating discharge algorithms to be used on future SWOT data. We collected water surface elevation and river width data along a 6.5km stretch of the Olentangy River in Columbus, Ohio from October to December 2014. Continuous measurements of water surface height were supplemented with periodical river width measurements at twenty sites along the study reach. The water surface slope of the entire reach ranged from during 41.58 cm/km at baseflow to 45.31 cm/km after a storm event. The study reach was also broken into sub-reaches roughly 1km in length to study smaller scale slope dynamics. The furthest upstream sub-reaches are characterized by free-flowing riffle-pool sequences, while the furthest downstream sub-reaches were directly affected by two low-head dams. In the sub-reaches immediately upstream of each dam, baseflow slope is as low as 2 cm/km, while the furthest upstream free-flowing sub-reach has a baseflow slope of 100 cm/km. During high flow events the backwater effect of the dams was observed to propagate upstream: sub-reaches impounded by the dams had increased water surface slopes, while free flowing sub-reaches had decreased water surface slopes. During the largest observed flow event, a stage change of 0.40 m affected sub-reach slopes by as much as 30 cm/km. Further analysis will examine height-width relationships within the study reach and relate cross-sectional flow area to river stage. These relationships can be used in conjunction with slope data to estimate discharge using a modified Manning’s equation, and are a core component of discharge algorithms being developed for the SWOT mission.",

We use the analysis of (Llovel, 2014) to study three different slices of the ocean as a function of depths, 0-700m, 0-2000, and 700-2000m. The contribution from 700-2000m was 0.38 +/- 0.05 mm/yr, a significant amount explaining in part the current hiatus. Wavelet analysis and SSA were used to study the time dependence; values of the first three periods were the same within the uncertainty considered in all three cases. In both the SSA and M-SSA, the first 8 modes were calculated. Llovel et al. (2014) found the contribution below 2000m was consistent with zero, when the uncertainties were considered.\nInternal variability of the ocean is investigated as a function of depth using M-SSA and Wavelet analysis. Here we consider the ocean to have 58 layers covering the top 2000 m of the ocean with higher resolution near the surface. Each one of the ocean layers is considered a different channel (58 channels in total), which is analyzed as a function of time. The first mode was the largest and had the most robust signal active throughout the full column (0-2000m) with a period that is larger than the data series span. Modes 2-8 are concentrated near the surface. They appears have two ribbons of variability. The first signal is at sea level down to about 120-170 m; below the first ribbon, the second ribbon exists from 120-170 m down to 300-500 m. These results are similar to those of Nieves et al., 2015, where they focused on longer time-scales. The results of these analyses will be presented with their implications explained.",

In the first example, we will compare ground methods for estimating ET by horticultural plants with scaled estimates of ET using both WV2 NDVI imagery and MODIS EVI which were used to determine water requirements of urban gardens in Adelaide, South Australia. In the second example, we will present the impacts of a 2014 environmental flow, released to the Colorado River delta in Mexico, on vegetation greenness and estimated ET using Landsat and MODIS data. Lastly, we will show the results for scaling sap flow transpiration of Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and associated vegetation along the Murrumbidgee River (a tributary of the River Murray) to MODIS-based estimates of evapotranspiration in the wider riparian reaches along the river. These three applications range in spatial scales from a few hectares for urban gardens, to several thousand hectares for the riparian ecosystem in Mexico, to a regional scale of a hundred thousand hectares for the Red Gum forest in Australia. Remote sensing methods can produce accurate estimates of ET across wide temporal and spatial scales, limited mainly by the accuracy of the ground methods by which they are calibrated and validated.",

These two sets of forecasts were performed on 50-to-3 km and 15-to-3 km smoothly-varying horizontal meshes, respectively. Both variable-resolution meshes have nominal convection-permitting 3-km grid spacing over the entire continental US. Here we evaluate the limited-area (vs. global) spectra from these NWP simulations. We will show the simulated spectral characteristics of total kinetic energy, vertical velocity variance, and precipitation during these spring and summer periods when diurnal continental convection is most active over central US. Spectral characteristics of a high-resolution global 3-km simulation (essentially no nesting) from the 20 May 2013 Moore, OK tornado case are also shown.

Increased share of variable renewable sources such as solar and wind in the California electricity system may require more grid flexibility to insure reliable power services. Such grid flexibility can be potentially provided by changes in end use electricity consumptions in response to grid conditions (demand-response). In the solar case, residential consumption in the late afternoon can be used as reserve capacity to balance the drop in solar generation.\nThis study presents our initial attempt to identify, from a behavior perspective, residential demand response potentials in relation to solar ramp events using a data-driven approach. Based on hourly residential energy consumption data, we derive representative daily load shapes focusing on discretionary consumption with an innovative clustering analysis technique. We aggregate the representative load shapes into behavior groups in terms of the timing and rhythm of energy use in the context of solar ramp events. Households of different behavior groups that are active during hours with high solar ramp rates are identified for capturing demand response potential. Insights into the nature and predictability of response to demand-response programs are provided.",

            "abstract": "Our society today relies heavily on electricity in order to meet its essential basic needs. However, to meet the rising demands for this energy, all power companies require smooth and efficient delivery of services to the consumers. The US power grid is a complex electrical apparatus that has well known sensitivities to space weather disturbances. Events produced by space weather includes solar storms or geomagnetic disturbances [GMD]. The propagation of such events in the direction of Earth perturbs the electric currents in the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, causing a unique effect known as a Geomagnetically Induced Current [GIC]. GICs are known to saturate and overheat transformers in the power grid, threatening the safe operation of the power system. A GMD induces a geoelectric field in high-voltage and extra high-voltage transmission circuits. This geoelectric field represents electromotive force, and causes GICs to circulate through transmission circuits and transformers. Power models are being developed using MATLAB/Simulink® software to simulate the propagation of GIC flows in a power system, while using New York State (NYS) power transmission network as an example. We will present results of the models used to assess the impacts of possible GMD strikes on the various parts of the power network.",

            "abstract": "For over 16 years, the Precipitation Radar of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite detected the three-dimensional structure of significantly precipitating clouds in the tropics and subtropics. This talk reviews and synthesizes studies using the TRMM radar data to present a global picture of the variation of convection throughout low latitudes. The multi-year dataset shows convection varying not only in amount but also in its very nature across the oceans, continents, islands, and mountain ranges of the tropics and subtropics. Shallow isolated raining clouds are overwhelmingly an oceanic phenomenon. Extremely deep and intense convective elements occur almost exclusively over land. Upscale growth of convection into mesoscale systems takes a variety of forms. Oceanic cloud systems may form by self-aggregation and generally have less intense embedded convection although they can form very wide stratiform regions, generally wider than seen over land. Continental mesoscale systems often have the most intense embedded convection. Some of these most intense convective cells and mesoscale systems occur near the great mountain ranges of low latitudes. The Maritime Continent and Amazonia exhibit convective clouds with maritime characteristics although they are partially or wholly land. Convective systems containing broad stratiform areas manifest most strongly over oceans. The stratiform precipitation occurs in various forms. Often it occurs as quasi-uniform precipitation with strong melting layers connected with intense convection. In monsoons and the intertropical convergence zone, it takes the form of closely packed weak convective elements. Where fronts extend into the subtropics, broad stratiform regions are larger and have lower and sloping melting layers related to the baroclinic origin of the precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The tension between local ontology development and wider ontology connections is fundamental to the Semantic web. It is often unclear, however, what the key decision points should be for new semantic web applications in deciding when to reuse existing ontologies and when to develop original ontologies. In addition, with the growth of semantic web ontologies and applications, new semantic web applications can struggle to efficiently and effectively identify and select ontologies to reuse. This presentation will describe the ontology comparison, selection, and consolidation effort within the EarthCollab project. UCAR, Cornell University, and UNAVCO are collaborating on the EarthCollab project to use semantic web technologies to enable the discovery of the research output from a diverse array of projects. The EarthCollab project is using the VIVO Semantic web software suite to increase discoverability of research information and data related to the following two geoscience-based communities: (1) the Bering Sea Project, an interdisciplinary field program whose data archive is hosted by NCAR’s Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL), and (2) diverse research projects informed by geodesy through the UNAVCO geodetic facility and consortium.\nThis presentation will outline of EarthCollab use cases, and provide an overview of key ontologies being used, including the VIVO-Integrated Semantic Framework (VIVO-ISF), Global Change Information System (GCIS), and Data Catalog (DCAT) ontologies. We will discuss issues related to bringing these ontologies together to provide a robust ontological structure to support the EarthCollab use cases. It is rare that a single pre-existing ontology meets all of a new application’s needs. New projects need to stitch ontologies together in ways that fit into the broader semantic web ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Dawn Framing Camera (FC) images of Ceres surface revealed tholi and mons, i.e., positive relief features with sub-circular to irregular basal shapes and varying height to diameter ratios and flank slopes. These domes and mounts are tentatively interpreted as volcanic constructs [1]. Alternative formation mechanisms, e.g., uplifting by diapirism or shallow intrusions [e.g., 2], could have also led to the observed features with different geological implications. FC images derived local digital elevation models reveal that the largest dome on Ceres (near Rongo crater) has a ~100 km wide base, concave downward margins with slopes of 10°-20°, a relatively flat top reaching altitudes of ~5 km relative to surrounding, and a summit pit chain of putative endogenic origin. A relevant mons on Ceres is a cone-shaped relief (10°S/316°E) with a ~30x20 km base, reaching a high of ~5 km relative to surroundings. Flank slopes approach a concave upward shape. These constructs are located in a complex geological area having resurfaced units with onlap contacts. Because of the varying morphometries of the reliefs, we explore several physical models of volcanic constructs, e.g., steep-sided dome and shield volcano. Physical models are based on radially spreading viscous gravity currents with a free upper surface [e.g., 3, 4]. Testing formation scenarios will exploit recently developed methods, such as time-variable viscosity and fixed-volume models [5], and constant flow rate models [6]. We aim to provide constraints on viable emplacement mechanisms for the different reliefs.\n[1] Platz et al. (2015), EPSC abstract 915, vol. 10; [2] Fagents, S.A.

            "abstract": "The marine Controlled Source Electromagnetic Method (CSEM) has been widely used to study the electrical conductivity distribution in the oceanic crust and the upper mantle. In recent years, the incorporation of the electrical vertical anisotropy in CSEM modeling permits the detection of very thin and shallow layers that are easily correlatable with seismic horizons and, therefore, an increasing application to hydrocarbon exploration. Nowadays, most of the marine electromagnetic surveys are made and interpreted in 3D; however, it is not uncommon to collect profile data, which are rarely modeled with 2D forward modeling algorithms that include electrical anisotropy.\nWe developed a 2D numerical modeling algorithm for marine CSEM data that takes electrical anisotropy into account and offers a better representation of finely layered geological units such as shale and interbedded hydrocarbon reservoirs. We solved the governing Maxwell equations that include vertical transverse anisotropy (TIV) using a finite difference (FD) scheme in the frequency domain. Our algorithm considers the field generated by a full three-dimensional Horizontal Electrical Dipolar (HED) source within a two-dimensional model with constant conductivity along the strike direction. We reduced the effective dimensionality by Fourier transforming the primary field in the strike direction and by solving for the secondary field using our 2D FD scheme in this domain.\nWe tested our algorithm on various homogeneous, stratified, and 2D heterogeneous models and gauged our solutions in terms of resolution for different processing parameters as compared with alternative 1D, 2D, or 3D forward modeling codes available.",

            "abstract": "This study uses 9.5 years of Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) data [1]. We have used the epithermal and fast neutron count rates to determine the water-equivalent-hydrogen (WEH) content of an upper layer, Wup, having thickness D. The “crossover” technique we utilized is an improvement over previous work [2,3]. We then used Monte Carlo simulated grids of epithermal and thermal count rates spanning Wup = 1% to 15% [4] to determine the WEH content, Wdn, of a semi-infinite lower layer buried at depth, D. We also advance upon previous work by using improved deconvolution methods to reduce spatial blurring in fast and epithermal maps [5]. The resultant count-rates were digitized into a 2°x2°cylindrical grid for all WEH computations.\nTwo sets of WEH maps will be shown. The first uses the one-layer model developed initially by Feldman et al. [6]. Comparison of the undeconvolved and deconvolved versions clearly illustrates the improvement obtained by deconvolution. We will also present the full two layer maps of Wup, Wdn, and D for the deconvolved data sets, which show: 1) contrary to our previous preliminary mapping [3], the fresh icy mid-latitude craters identified by [7] are NOT exclusively found in regions with average Wdn values that exceed the pore-filling threshold for regolith ice; 2) a maximum Wdn of about 80% by weight at the Phoenix site; 3) an isolated Wdn maximum just east of Gale crater that is centered on Aeolis Mensae; 4) a resolved Wdn maximum that overlays the Orsen Wells crater on Xanthe Terra; 5) Wdn local maxima that hug the western flanks of Olympus Mons and Elysium Mons, and 6) several Wdn maxima that cover Arabia Terra.

            "abstract": "The heights of natural surfaces can be measured with such spatial density that almost the entire spectrum of physical roughness scales can be characterized, down to the morphological form and grain scales. With an ability to measure ‘microtopography’ comes a demand for analytical/computational tools for spatially explicit statistical characterization of surface roughness. Detrended standard deviation of surface heights is a popular means to create continuous maps of roughness from point cloud data, using moving windows and reporting window-centered statistics of variations from a trend surface.\nIf 'roughness' is the statistical variation in the distribution of relief of a surface, then 'texture' is the frequency of change and spatial arrangement of roughness. The variance in surface height as a function of frequency obeys a power law. In consequence, roughness is dependent on the window size through which it is examined, which has a number of potential disadvantages: 1) the choice of window size becomes crucial, and obstructs comparisons between data; 2) if windows are large relative to multiple roughness scales, it is harder to discriminate between those scales; 3) if roughness is not scaled by the texture length scale, information on the spacing and clustering of roughness `elements’ can be lost; and 4) such practice is not amenable to models describing the scattering of light and sound from rough natural surfaces.\nWe discuss the relationship between roughness and texture. Some useful parameters which scale vertical roughness to characteristic horizontal length scales are suggested, with examples of bathymetric point clouds obtained using multibeam from two contrasting riverbeds, namely those of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, and the Snake River in Hells Canyon. Such work, aside from automated texture characterization and texture segmentation, roughness and grain size calculation, might also be useful for feature detection and classification from point clouds.",

            "abstract": "Prediction and thus preparedness in advance of hydrological extremes, such as drought and flood events, is crucial for proactively reducing their social and economic impacts. In the summers of 2011 Texas, and 2012 the Upper Midwest, experienced intense droughts that affected crops and the food market in the US. It is expected that seasonal forecasts with sufficient skill would reduce the negative impacts through planning and preparation. However, the forecast skill from models such as Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is low over the US, especially during the warm season (Jun - Sep), which restricts their practical use for drought prediction. This study analyzes the processes that lead to premature termination of 2011 and 2012 US summer droughts in CFSv2 forecast resulting in its low forecast skill.\nUsing the North American Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (NLDAS2) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) as references, this study investigates the forecast skills of CFSv2 initialized at 00, 06, 12, 18z from May 15 - 31 (leads out to September) for each event in terms of land-atmosphere interaction, through a recently developed Coupling Drought Index (CDI), which is based on the Convective Triggering Potential-Humidity Index-soil moisture (CTP-HI-SM) classification of four climate regimes: wet coupling, dry coupling, transitional and atmospherically controlled.\nA recycling model is used to trace the moisture sources in the CFSv2 forecasts of anomalous precipitation, which lead to the breakdown of drought conditions and a lack of drought forecasting skills. This is then compared with tracing the moisture source in CFSR with the same recycling model, which is used as the verification for the same periods. This helps to identify the parameterization that triggered precipitation in CFSv2 during 2011 and 2012 summer in the US thus has the potential to improve the forecast skill of CSFv2.",

The giant South Pamir Shakhdara-Alichur gneiss-dome system formed similarly by N-S extension along bivergent detachments. Prograde amphibolite-facies metamorphism in the domes and low-grade metamorphism in their hanging wall is dated at ~40 Ma (Lu-Hf garnet, U-Pb titanite) [Smit et al., 2014; Stearns et al., 2015] and ~33 Ma (K/Ar sericite). Retrograde metamorphism―driven by crustal extension―started at ~21 Ma (multi-method thermochronology; Stearns et al.[2013]). These Gneiss Domes offer a unique window into the Eocene-Miocene state of the Asian middle crust of the Pamir-Tibet Plateau.\nTop-to-N thrust stacking accommodated thickening in the upper crust, with displacements of single thrust sheets of > 30 and > 19 km. At depth, ductile flow formed km-scale recumbent fold nappes. We reconstruct their geometry by structural mapping and U-Pb zircon dating, documenting repetition of metatuffite, and paragneiss layers. In the interior of the domes, amphibolite-facies deformation fabrics with prograde kyanite define an E-W stretching lineation. Associated microstructures indicate top-to-E and top-to-W shear senses. Chocolate tablet boudinage indicate vertical flattening during bulk crustal thickening. We suggest that prograde E-W stretching relates to an early orogen-parallel flow component in the middle crust, contemporaneous with crustal stacking during bulk top-to-N convergence prior to ~21 Ma. Material likely evaded laterally out of the Pamir, contributing to >60 km thick crust in the Hindu Kush, west of the India-Asia frontal collision. In the Neogene crust extruded laterally from the Pamir Plateau to the west by dextral wrenching and E-W extension; this component of deformation is accommodated by E-W shortening in the Afghan-Tajik Depression.",

            "abstract": "This study inter-compares, among five global models, the potential impacts of all commercial aircraft emissions worldwide on surface ozone and PM2.5. The models include climate-response models (CRMs) with interactive meteorology, chemical-transport models (CTMs) with prescribed meteorology, and models that integrate aspects of both. Previously, few studies have addressed the effects of cruise-altitude aircraft emissions on surface air quality, and each has provided a marginally different result. Here, model inputs are substantially harmonized in an effort to achieve a consensus about the state of understanding of impacts of 2006 commercial aviation emissions. Whereas, all models find that aircraft increase near-surface ozone (0.4 to 1.9% globally), perturbations in the Northern Hemisphere are highest in winter, when ambient ozone levels are lower and potentially of not as much concern to human health compared to the higher ozone in the summer months. Changes in surface-level PM2.5 in the CTMs (0.14 to 0.4%) and CRMs (-1.9 to 1.2%) may depend on highly-varying background aerosol fields among models and the inclusion of feedbacks between aircraft emissions and changes in meteorology. The CTMs tend to show an increase in surface PM2.5 primarily over high-traffic regions in the North American mid-latitudes. The CRMs, on the other hand, demonstrate the effects of changing meteorological fields and potential feedbacks on aviation emission impacts, and exhibit large perturbations over regions where natural emissions (e.g., soil dust and sea spray) are abundant. Excluding these emissions in the CRMs results in a smaller-in-magnitude surface change due to aviation. The changes in ozone and PM2.5 found here may be used to estimate ranges in the net impacts of aircraft on human health.",

            "abstract": "Results of a pilot deployment of a major new version of the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM-7) are presented. The Unidata LDM was developed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and comprises a suite of software for the distribution and local processing of data in near real-time. It is widely used in the geoscience community to distribute observational data and model output, most notably as the foundation of the Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system run by UCAR, but also in private networks operated by NOAA, NASA, USGS, etc. The current version, LDM-6, uses at least one unicast TCP connection per receiving host. With over 900 connections, the bit-rate of total outgoing IDD traffic from UCAR averages approximately 3.0 GHz, with peak data rates exceeding 6.6 GHz. Expected increases in data volume suggest that a more efficient distribution mechanism will be required in the near future. LDM-7 greatly reduces the outgoing bandwidth requirement by incorporating a recently-developed “semi-reliable” IP multicast protocol while retaining the unicast TCP mechanism for reliability. During the summer of 2015, UCAR and the University of Virginia conducted a pilot deployment of the Unidata LDM-7 among U.S. university participants with access to the Internet2 network. Results of this pilot program, along with comparisons to the existing Unidata LDM-6 system, are presented.",

The current split-window algorithm used to produce the VIIRS LST product deviates from its MODIS counterpart both in terms of its functional form and emissivity correction method, resulting in systematic discrepancies between the products based on the land cover type and atmospheric conditions. To address this issue we have developed a different algorithmic approach to ensure an acceptable and high quality continuity data record between MODIS and VIIRS LST&E. A new MODIS LST&E product (MOD21, C6) has been developed based on the well established Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, initially developed for ASTER. TES is a physical-based algorithm that simultaneously retrieves the LST and a dynamically varying multi-spectral emissivity. Using the same methodology, we are also in the process of developing an equivalent product for VIIRS that will produce LST and emissivity for VIIRS bands 14-16, equivalent to MODIS bands 29, 31, and 32. We will show progress on the VIIRS LST&E algorithm development and an initial trend analysis demonstrating continuity between MODIS and VIIRS LST&E products using the TES approach over the CONUS and dedicated validation targets covering a broad range of land and atmospheric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Seismic wave propagation codes are essential tools to investigate a variety of wave phenomena in the Earth. Furthermore, they can now be used for seismic full-waveform inversions in regional- and global-scale adjoint tomography. Although these seismic wave propagation solvers are crucial ingredients to improve the resolution of tomographic images to answer important questions about the nature of Earth's internal processes and subsurface structure, their practical application is often limited due to high computational costs. They thus need high-performance computing (HPC) facilities to improving the current state of knowledge.\nAt present, numerous large HPC systems embed many-core architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs) to enhance numerical performance. Such hardware accelerators can be programmed using either the CUDA programming environment or the OpenCL language standard. CUDA software development targets NVIDIA graphic cards while OpenCL was adopted by additional hardware accelerators, like e.g. AMD graphic cards, ARM-based processors as well as Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. For seismic wave propagation simulations using the open-source spectral-element code package SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, we incorporated an automatic source-to-source code generation tool (BOAST) which allows us to use meta-programming of all computational kernels for forward and adjoint runs. Using our BOAST kernels, we generate optimized source code for both CUDA and OpenCL languages within the source code package. Thus, seismic wave simulations are able now to fully utilize CUDA and OpenCL hardware accelerators. We show benchmarks of forward seismic wave propagation simulations using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on CUDA/OpenCL GPUs, validating results and comparing performances for different simulations and hardware usages.",

            "abstract": "Extreme rainfall events, specifically in urban areas, have dramatic impacts on society and can lead to loss of lives and properties. Despite these hazards, little is known about the city-scale variability of heavy rain events. In the current study, 13 years of gridded Stage IV radar data, 2002-2014, is employed to investigate the statistical properties of the spatiotemporal variability of simultaneous rainfall exceedances in Greater New York Area. The 95th percentile of each gridpoint’s annual max intensity is considered as a threshold for storms. Then, multivariate k-means clustering is applied on extreme rainfall events’ intensity and area exposure for each rainfall duration and season of occurrence. Comparison of timing indicates most of extreme rainfall events (more than 40%) are occurring in summer. Clustering analysis results show that for short rainfall duration, most of the study area is hit by high intensity-large area storm in warm seasons while in cold seasons rainfall intensity is low and the areal exposure is also low. In contrast, long rainfall duration follows an opposite spatiotemporal pattern. Resultant maps geo-reference the probability of occurrence of high-intensity large-area exposure storm over the study area. These maps can become inputs for design of hydraulic systems with the spatial and temporal resolution of 4km X 4km and 1-hour respectively which corresponds to the input radar data.",

            "abstract": "NASA GSFC has delivered highly capable quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS) for missions to Venus (Pioneer Venus), Jupiter (Galileo), Saturn/Titan (Cassini-Huygens), Mars (MSL and MAVEN), and the Moon (LADEE). Our understanding of the Solar System has been expanded significantly by these exceedingly versatile yet low risk and cost efficient instruments.\nGSFC has developed more recently a suite of advanced instrument technologies promising enhanced science return while selectively leveraging heritage designs. Relying on a traditional precision QMS, the Analysis of Gas Evolved from Samples (AGES) instrument measures organic inventory, determines exposure age and establishes the absolute timing of deposition/petrogenesis of interrogated samples. The Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) aboard the ExoMars 2018 rover employs a two-dimensional ion trap, built analogously to heritage QMS rod assemblies, which can support dual ionization sources, selective ion enrichment and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The same miniaturized analyzer serves as the core of the Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (LITMS) instrument, which offers negative ion detection (switchable polarity) and an extended mass range (>2000 Da).\nTime-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) have been interfaced to a range of laser sources to progress high-sensitivity laser ablation and desorption methods for analysis of inorganic and non-volatile organic compounds, respectively. The L2MS (two-step laser mass spectrometer) enables the desorption of neutrals and/or prompt ionization at IR (1.0 up to 3.1 µm, with an option for tunability) or UV wavelengths (commonly 266 or 355 nm). For the selective ionization of specific classes of organics, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, a second UV laser may be employed to decouple the desorption and ionization steps and limit molecular fragmentation.\nMass analyzers with substantially higher resolving powers (up to m/Δm > 100,000), such as the Advanced Resolution Organic Molecule Analyzer (AROMA) and multipass QMS instruments now under development, offer the potential to disambiguate key chemical signatures in complex mass spectra. Other innovative technologies being pursued include: ion inlet systems; tunable lasers; high-temp pyrolysis ovens; and, sample capture/enrichment techniques.",

But many of these same educators striving for greater climate literacy are surprisingly ignorant about the climate itself (typical seasonal cycles, variations, extremes, spatial patterns and the drivers that produce them). As a result, some of these educators and their students are tempted to interpret each and every hot or cold and wet or dry spell as convincing evidence of climate change even as climate change \"skeptics\" view those same fluctuations as normal. Educators' overreaction risks a backfire reaction resulting in loss of credibility among the very groups they are striving to educate and influence.

Images were sampled from video recorded by a Xybion intensified camera (30 fps) at Poker Flat Research Range, AK. The primary observations of black aurora were observed during the substorm recovery phase and separate patches of pulsating aurora as well as pulsating aurora from diffuse aurora. In these observations the black aurora forms an apparent firm boundary between the auroral forms in a new behavior that is in contrast with previously reported observations. Also presented for the first time are black curls in conjunction with pulsating aurora. Curl structures that indicate shear plasma flows in the ionosphere may be used as a proxy for converging/diverging electric fields in and above the ionosphere. This new subset of black auroral behavior may provide visual evidence of black aurora as an ionospheric feedback mechanism as related to pulsating aurora.",

            "abstract": "Clouds radiation feedback processes in the Arctic have been identified as one of the greatest sources of uncertainties in the prediction of global climate in GCMs. In particular, mixed phase clouds (MPC) occur very frequently at low-level altitudes in the Arctic, representing between 30% and 50% of the clouds all along the year. However, the characterization of MPC on the whole Arctic region is not yet accurate enough to better understand cloud-radiation interactions. Thus, the knowledge of arctic MPC properties has to be improved.\nThe aim of this study is to characterize MPC properties from regional scale to small scale. This work is based on the synergy of spaceborne active remote sensing (CALIPSO/CloudSat) and airborne in situ observations.\nWe will present results about the time and space variability and vertical distribution of MPC over the entire Arctic region, with a focus on the Svalbard region. The influence of the seasonal cycle as well as surface type (open sea, sea ice, land) on the MPC occurrences will also be investigated.\nThen, this study will focus on a statistical analysis of MPC clouds properties based on in situ measurements carried out during several airborne campaigns in Svalbard region (14 flights corresponding to 54 vertical profiles). This will provide a detailed characterization of microphysical and optical properties of MPC, discriminating liquid and ice phases. Small scale processes occurring in arctic clouds will be also studied.\nFinally, accurate profiles of relevant clouds parameters (optical depth, liquid/water fraction, ice crystals morphology, ice and liquid water contents…) will be assessed to contribute to the improvement of clouds representation in global and mesoscale models and to improve airborne and spatial remote sensing retrievals algorithms.",

            "abstract": "To provide accurate forecasts of arrival times and waveforms of tsunamis caused by great earthquakes, it is important to rapidly and precisely determine a source using real-time tsunami waveforms and teleseismic body waves data. In order to do that, the Green's function and the \"tsunami\" Green's functions that can be calculated with a low computational cost and predict observed waveforms precisely are required. We separately inverted the 2010 Chile earthquake using teleseismic body waves and tsunami wave. The Green's functions of teleseismic body waves inversion and the \"tsunami\" Green's functions of tsunami waveforms inversion are used a full-waveforms calculated by the Direct Solution Method [e.g., Kawai et al. 2006] and a phase-corrected long-wave proposed by Watada et al. [2014], respectively. The phase corrected tsunami Green's functions include the effects of the long wave dispersion caused by the elasticity of the sea bottom, compression and dilatation of sea water, and gravitational potential change associated with mass motion during tsunami propagation of sea water. The slip distributions obtained by the teleseismic body waves and the tsunami waveforms data are almost consistent. The synthetic seismograms are explained the observed waveforms well including later arriving PP waves and W phase, which cannot calculate the conventional ray theoretical Green's functions. The synthetic tsunami waveforms also well explained the observed waveforms near and far-field DART data. The tsunami waveforms inversion without phase corrections cause an apparent shift of the large slip area away from the stations i.e., toward deeper part of the fault, because of faster propagation speed of conventional linear long wave tsunami Green's functions. Furthermore, the teleseismic body wave inversion obtained by conventional ray theoretical Green's functions also cause a wrong results. The main reason is that the ray theoretical Green's functions cannot calculate the W phase. A database of full-waveforms Green's functions (e.g., Pre-calculated Pyrocko GF Stores) make it possible to analyze rapidly and routinely source processes of great earthquakes. The new phase-corrected tsunami Green's functions is also able to calculate not much time than the conventional linear long wave tsunami Green's functions.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircon (DZ) age distributions from Cenozoic paleochannels in the Sierra Nevada (SN) offer a means to test fluvial connectivity, and thus relative paleoelevation, between the Basin and Range (BR) and SN. This test is independent from proxy records, inferred lapse rate, and assumptions of isotope behavior. Existing studies of DZ spectra from SN paleochannels have disagreed over such connectivity, due in part to differing sample coverage.\nWe present 11 new DZ spectra from the paleo-Yuba and American Rivers in the SN and BR, 5 of which result from large-n (300 grain) analyses (see Fig. A, B). Large-n analyses more accurately reveal the proportions of DZ age populations present in a given sample. Resampling experiments on a single, 4,117 grain DZ sample indicate that n = 300 analyses improve the accuracy of quantitative comparisons of multiple spectra as well as maximum depositional ages (MDA) from youngest DZ grains, relative to the smaller sample sizes used in many studies (n = 60, 100) (see Fig. C). Our analyses, along with 21 published samples, reveal 3 categories of DZ spectra in the paleo-Yuba and American Rivers, each with their own characteristic age peaks and MDA.\nType 1 samples (n = 12) occur in both the paleo-Yuba and American Rivers and are dominated by non-locally derived Cretaceous (K) grains, and have K MDA. Type 2 samples (n = 5) occur in the paleo-Yuba River, contain locally-derived Jurassic (J) and Devonian (D) grains, as well as extra-regional Eocene (Eo) grains, and have Eo MDA. Type 2 samples occur near J and D batholithic sources. Type 3 samples (n = 6) occur in the BR and eastern SN, contain Oligocene (O) grains, and have O MDA, suggesting derivation from O volcanics from the BR.\nThese results may reflect temporal evolution of SN paleochannel sediment sources, beginning with the erosion of K plutonic rocks to the east during K-Eo time (Type 1), followed by the aggradation of locally-derived material during Eo time (Type 2), then an influx of volcanic-rich sediments from the BR in O time (Type 3). These results suggest that paleochannels tapped regions east of the modern SN crest between K and Eo time, and again in the Oligocene. Expanded spatial and temporal sampling of paleochannel deposits, coupled with large-n analyses, may further elucidate the paleoelevation history of the BR throughout the early Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Impact craters on the terrestrial planets are typically surrounded by a continuous ejecta blanket that the initial emplacement is via ballistic sedimentation. Following an impact event, a significant volume of material is ejected and falling debris surrounds the crater. Aerodynamics rule governs the flight path and determines the spatial distribution of these ejecta. Thus, for the planets with atmosphere, the preserved ejecta deposit directly recorded the interaction of ejecta and atmosphere at the time of impact.\nIn this study, we develop a new framework to establish links between distribution of the ejecta, age of the impact and the properties of local atmosphere. Given the radial distance of the continuous ejecta extent from crater, an inverse aerodynamic modeling approach is employed to estimate the local atmospheric drags and density as well as the lift forces at the time of impact. Based on earlier studies, we incorporate reasonable value ranges for ejection angle, initial velocity, aerodynamic drag, and lift in the model. In order to solve the trajectory differential equations, obtain the best estimate of atmospheric density, and the associated uncertainties, genetic algorithm is applied.\nThe method is validated using synthetic data sets as well as detailed maps of impact ejecta associated with five fresh martian and two lunar impact craters, with diameter of 20-50 m, 10-20 m, respectively. The estimated air density for martian carters range 0.014-0.028 kg/m3, consistent with the recent surface atmospheric density measurement of 0.015-0.020 kg/m3. This constancy indicates the robustness of the presented methodology. In the following, the inversion results for the lunar craters yield air density of 0.003-0.008 kg/m3, which suggest the inversion results are accurate to the second decimal place. This framework will be applied to older martian craters with preserved ejecta blankets, which expect to constrain the long-term evolution of martian atmosphere.",

Close to a terabyte (TB) of data per day will be associated with the satellite’s Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument. These data will be archived and made available for the public through NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) located at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.\nBecause of the expected volume of data, NSIDC and its partners are working on new capabilities and preparations that will be required to fully support the user community. These include using new processes and protocols simply to move the data to the NSIDC, as well as new tools for helping users find and download only the data they need. Subsetting, visualization and analysis capabilities across all of the ICESat-2 data products will be critical to dealing with data. This presentation will explore the steps being taken by NSIDC and others to implement and make these capabilities available.",

            "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2) is naturally produced by radiolysis of water in subseafloor sediment due to radiation from decay of sedimentary U, Th, and K. This process has been hypothesized as a significant source of electron donors for the deep biosphere, especially in environments where organic matter is scarce. However, to constrain the importance of radiolytic H2 for subsurface organisms, H2 yields in natural geologic settings must be understood and quantified.\nAlthough H2 production from radiolysis of pure water is well established, the effect of natural materials on H2 yield is previously unknown. Published gamma-radiation experiments show enhanced H2 production from water radiolysis in the presence of various synthetic oxides, clay and zeolite minerals, or certain dissolved anions. Except for single studies of synthetic ZrO2 and TiO2, previous alpha-radiation experiments have been limited to purely aqueous phases.\nTo overcome this lack of information, we experimentally quantified H2 yields from gamma and alpha radiolysis of pure water, seawater, and slurries (φ = 0.85) of seawater with representative marine sediment types. The H2 yields of our pure water radiation experiments match well-established literature results for both gamma and alpha radiation (0.25 molecules H2/100eV and 1.53 molecules H2/100eV, respectively). In both our gamma and alpha experiments, H2 yields in seawater are statistically indistinguishable from yields in pure water. In contrast, our experiments with South Pacific abyssal clay increased H2 yields from gamma radiation by 3-5-fold and yields from alpha radiation by up to 6-fold, compared to pure water.\nThese results have significant implications for understanding subseafloor ecosystems. For example, at South Pacific IODP Site U1370, comparison of our experimentally derived hydrogen yields to net oxygen reduction rates shows that radiolytic H2 is the principal electron donor available to microbes at depths greater than a few meters.",

            "abstract": "Salmon spawning in streams involves the female salmon digging a pit in the bed where she deposits eggs for fertilization before covering them with gravel excavated from the next pit upstream. Sequences of pit excavation and filling winnow fines, loosen sediment, and move bed material into a tailspill mound resembling the shape of a dune. Research suggests salmonid nests (redds) destabilize streambeds by reducing friction between loosened grains and converging flow that elevates shear stress on redd topography. However, bed stability may be enhanced by form drag from redds in clusters that lower shear stress on the granular bed, but this effect will vary with the proportion of the bed surface that is occupied by redds (P). I used simulated redds and water-worked (“unspawned”) beds in a laboratory flume to evaluate these competing influences on grain stability and bedload transport rates with P=0.12, 0.34, and 0.41. Results indicate that competence (largest-grain) and reference transport rate estimates of critical conditions for particle entrainment inversely relate to P. Bedload transport increased as exponential functions of P and excess boundary shear stress. Therefore, redd form drag did not overcome the destabilizing effects of spawning. Instead, grain mobility and bedload transport increased with P because larger areas of the bed were composed of relatively loose, unstable grains and redd topography that experienced elevated shear stress. Consequently, the presence of redds in fish-bearing streams likely reduces the effects of sedimentation from landscape disturbance on stream habitats that salmon use for reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic observations after the 24 August 2014 M6 South Napa earthquake provide insight into the manifestation of fault frictional properties in the interseismic, coseismic, and postseismic periods. The West Napa fault (WNF) was not known to creep, although data to confirm this are lacking. Absence of creep could indicate a fault is locked interseismically and characterized by velocity weakening (VW) friction. A VW fault would not exhibit afterslip. However, field and geodetic data record a months-long postseismic signal starting within hours of the mainshock. The spatial pattern is consistent with afterslip on the WNF, implying the presence of velocity strengthening (VS) fault zone material.\nMarone et al. (1991) presented a one degree of freedom spring-slider model governed by VS friction in which shallow afterslip depends on the depth extent of the VS zone (h) and a rate and state friction variable (a-b). We fit this model to records from four alinement arrays on the WNF. For (a-b) in the laboratory range of 0.005 – 0.05, the data are consistent with h = 1 – 4 km, thinning to the northwest.\nGPS data are sensitive to deeper afterslip than near-fault measurements. While frictional properties may be optimized by fitting the space-time distribution of afterslip inferred from kinematic inversion of GPS data, stress-driven models encompass more of the underlying physics. We use the first month of postseismic GPS time series to constrain a steady-state VS friction model driven by coseismic slip inferred from seismic data (Wei et al., 2015). The optimal uniform value of (a-b), 0.021, adequately fits many time series, but significant misfit exists for some. We are investigating variations in frictional properties along-strike and with depth that can better explain the data. Such variations, if correlative with lithology or other fault zone features, could inform assessment of expected coseismic slip and damaging afterslip on faults that do not exhibit surface creep.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how boreal forest fires affect the fate of soil carbon in northern permafrost regions is critical to our understanding of feedbacks from Arctic ecosystems on global climate change. The frequency and intensity of fires have been increasing across the northern boreal and tundra region. Fire makes permafrost vulnerable because it removes the insulating plant and organic layers. The removal of these insulating layers in Siberian larch forests underlain by ice and carbon rich permafrost can lead to ground subsidence and saturate soils. Saturated and anoxic soils are ideal conditions for the production of methane, which is ~30x more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Most boreal ecosystems are currently considered to be sinks for methane, but not much research has been done to study how fire may affect methane production in these regions. We predict that fires will increase methane production in boreal ecosystems underlain by permafrost due to increases in thaw depth, ice wedge thawing, and ground subsidence. This study focused on a ten-year old burn site composed of mainly larch trees and tussocks located near the bank of the Kolyma River in Northeastern Siberia. The ground of the burn site was substantially more subsided and had larger areas of surface water and saturated soils than the nearby unburned forest. We investigated the flux of methane from the surfaces of small ponds that formed over thawing ice wedges and in the subsided depressions. While previous studies have reported low dissolved organic carbon concentrations in streams affected by fire in permafrost regions, we found high DOC concentrations in pond water (21-27 mg/L). Methane fluxes from ice wedge ponds ranged from 20 to 180 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. These values are comparable to fluxes from other permafrost ecosystems including bogs, wet tundra, and fens that are considered globally significant sources of CH4. Additionally, the burned forest contained some subsided areas that were extreme CH4 hotspots, one of which released between 290 and 950 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. These results show that fires in boreal forests underlain by permafrost may cause substantial changes in topography, leading to increased areas of anoxic environments that promote methanogenesis and increase CH4 emissions, possibly turning Siberian forests from a CH4 sink to a source.",

            "abstract": "Climatic and environmental change are a powerful hook to engage students and the public with geoscience. Recent lake sediments often feature visual and compositional evidence of anthropogenic changes, which can pique curiosity and serve as a gateway for interest in more remote past changes. Cores provide an integrative, place-based geoscience education/outreach platform: lake dynamics incorporate principles of chemistry, physics, and biology; lake basin formation and sedimentary signals trace back to numerous geoscience subdisciplines. Lakes reflect local changes, and so are inherently place-based and relevant to both rural and urban populations. The esthetics of lakes in the landscape and sediments under the microscope spark the artistic sensibilities of those who do not consider themselves scientists: lakes are readymade for STEAM education.\nLacCore has exploited the magic of lake sediment cores in its 15 years as an NSF Facility, and now expands to additional environments as the NSF Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office. Part of scaling up is the formalization of major support for the Broader Impacts (BI) activities of Facility users. LacCore/CSDCO now musters its collaborative experiences in site REUs and other undergrad research projects, in-depth training of students, teachers, and faculty, a long list of informal education experiences, and common-good software development, to provide assistance to researchers seeking meaningful broader impacts and educators seeking extra- or co-curricular field and laboratory research experiences for their students. Outreach, diversity, and education support includes dissemination of best practices, as well as coordination, administration, and basic capacity for such activities in collaboration with project PIs and students, through no-cost support, or collaborative proposals or supplements from NSF where necessary for project scale. Community-driven research and broadening participation are central to the vision. In the same way that LacCore/CSDCO nurtures drilling and coring project concepts through to fruition, it can foster the BI activities critical to project success in 21st century geoscience, where the challenges are profound, the answers are depressing, and real impacts may occur on the scale of only a few individuals.",

            "abstract": "The ultimate EarthCube product has been described as a mobile app that provides all of the known geoscience data for a geographic point or polygon, from the top of the atmosphere to the core of the Earth, throughout geologic time. The database queries are hidden from the user, and the data are visually rendered for easy recognition of patterns and associations. This fanciful vision is not so remote: NSF EarthCube and Geoinformatics support has already fostered major advances in database interoperability and harmonization of APIs; numerous “domain repositories,” databases curated by subject matter experts, now provide a vast wealth of open, easily-accessible georeferenced data on rock and sediment chemistry and mineralogy, paleobiology, stratigraphy, rock magnetics, and more. New datasets accrue daily, including many harvested from the literature by automated means. None of these constitute big data – all are part of the long tail of geoscience, heterogeneous data consisting of relatively small numbers of measurements made by a large number of people, typically on physical samples.\nThis vision of mobile data discovery requires a software package to cleverly expose these domain repositories’ holdings; currently, queries mainly come from single investigators to single databases. The NSF-funded mobile app Flyover Country (FC; fc.umn.edu), developed for geoscience outreach and education, has been welcomed by data curators and cyberinfrastructure developers as a testing ground for their API services, data provision, and scalability. FC pulls maps and data within a bounding envelope and caches them for offline use; location-based services alert users to nearby points of interest (POI). The incorporation of data from multiple databases across domains requires parsimonious data requests and novel visualization techniques, especially for mapping of data with a time or stratigraphic depth component. The preservation of data provenance and authority is critical for researcher buy-in to all community databases, and further allows exploration and suggestions of collaborators, based upon geography and topical relevance.",

            "abstract": "During the seismic cycle, faults repeatedly fail and regain strength. The gradual strength recovery is often referred to as frictional healing, and existing works suggest that healing can play an important role in determining the mode of fault slip ranging from dynamic rupture to slow earthquakes. Laboratory studies can play an important role in identifying the processes of frictional healing and their evolution with shear strain during the seismic cycle. These studies also provide data for laboratory-derived friction constitutive laws, which can improve dynamic earthquake models.\nPrevious work shows that frictional healing varies with shear stress on a fault during the interseismic period. Unfortunately, the micromechanical processes that cause shear stress dependent frictional healing are not well understood and cannot be incorporated into current earthquake models. In fault gouge, frictional healing involves compaction and particle rearrangement within sheared granular layers. Therefore, to address these issues, we investigate the role grain size reduction plays in frictional re-strengthening processes at different levels of shear stress. Sample material was preserved from biaxial deformation experiments on granular Westerly granite. The normal stress was held constant at 25 MPa and we performed several 100 second slide-hold-slide tests in each experiment. We conducted a series of 5 experiments each with a different value of normalized shear stress (ranging from 0 to 1), defined as the ratio of the pre-hold shear stress to the shear stress during the hold. The particle size distribution for each sample was analyzed.\nIn addition, acoustic measurements were recorded throughout our experiments to investigate variations in ultrasonic velocity and signal amplitude that reflect changes in the elastic moduli of the layer. Acoustic monitoring provides information about healing mechanisms and can provide a link between laboratory studies and tectonic fault zones.",

Our new reconstruction is based on two aragonite stalagmites from southwestern Mexico which replicate oxygen isotope variations over the 950-1950 CE interval, and are calibrated to instrumental rainfall variations in the Basin of Mexico. Such data complement existing dendroclimatic reconstructions of early wet season and winter drought severity. Comparisons to indices of ocean-atmosphere circulation show a combined forcing by the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Monsoon strengthening coincided with synergistic forcing of a La Niña-like mode and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, and vice versa for droughts. Although drought is commonly invoked as an stressor leading to societal change, the role of intensified monsoon onto cultural development is rarely explored. We observe that prominent transitions from drought to pluvial conditions are associated with population increases in three of the major highland Mexico civilizations of Teotihuacan, Tula Grande, and the Aztecs. These data suggest a role for ocean-atmosphere dynamics arising from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on Mesoamerican monsoon strength.",

            "abstract": "As the global climate changes and the populations of many African countries grow, ensuring clean drinking water and food has become a pressing concern. Because of their vulnerability to malnutrition and food insecurity, children face the greatest risk for adverse health outcomes related to climate change. Vulnerability, however, is highly variable, with some children in food insecure communities showing healthy growth, while some children in food secure communities show signs of malnutrition.\nIn West Africa, Burkina Faso faces high levels of child malnutrition, loses to farmland and a large share of the population have no access to clean water. Because the overwhelming majority of children rely on locally grown, rainfed agriculture and well/surface water, the combined impact of climate change and population growth decreases water availability and farmland per person. However, there is notable community and individual variation in malnutrition levels suggesting that there are important coping strategies that vulnerable families may use to secure their children’s health. No spatially relevant analysis of water and food insecurity and children’s health exists for Burkina Faso.\nThe goal of this research is to identify and quantify the combined and inter-related impact of unsafe drinking water and community-level food availability on the physical health outcomes of Burkinabe children under five years of age. To accomplish this goal we rely on a publically available highly detailed, geo-referenced data set (Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)) to provide information on measures of childhood malnutrition and details on parental characteristics related to children’s health. Information on water source (covered/uncovered well, piped water, etc.) and water quality (measures of arsenic and pollution) comes from DHS along with a recently collected geo-referenced US Agency for International Development (USAID) data set. Critical information on food production, environmental characteristics and population density come from high resolution remotely sensed data.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic evolution of the Central Andes includes a complex combination of thrusting, wrenching and block rotation leading progressively to the curvature of the orogenic system of the South American continental margin at 18ºS (Bolivian Orocline). Tectonic deformation in the Bolivian Orocline cannot be realistically restored using information from balanced cross sections alone, as the deformation includes an important component of block rotation, associated to counterclockwise block rotation in southern Peru and clockwise rotation in northern Chile. Recent work shows that block rotations in the forearc are essentially pre-early Miocene, predating the onset of Neogene shortening in the Sub Andean zone. Most rotations in the forearc of northern Chile where acquired through a single tectonic event during the Paleogene-early Miocene which probably coincides with the Eocene orogen-wide Incaic event which affected large regions of the central Andes between ca. 50 and 40 Ma. Results from 2D restoration experiments support the hypothesis of the Paleogene formation of the Bolivian Orocline, as a consequence of differential shortening, concentrated in the Eastern Cordillera of Bolivia, southern Peru and northwestern Argentina. Within the southern central Andes four additional curvatures including striking changes in the pattern of rotations have been discovered. From north to south these are the Antofagasta-Calama Lineament, Vallenar, Maipo and Arauco oroclines. However, an important part of rotation needs to be balanced, in the forearc region, by two major conjugate oblique shear zones (Abancay Deflection and Antofagasta-Calama Lineament). These structural features are probably related to inherited lithospheric discontinuities associated with the accretion of basement terranes which could be responsible for producing and delimitating significant and abrupt changes in the magnitude of the Central Andean Rotation Pattern along the margin. While shortening and crustal thickening concentrated in the weak Andean arc and Eastern Cordillera, passive transport of large basement terrane blocks on top of the flowing ductile lower crust in the forearc region was accompanied by block rotations along vertical axis which, at the end, may have originated most of the Central Andean Rotation Pattern.",

            "abstract": "We analyze a set of 20 tide gauge records covering the contiguous United States (US) coastline and the period from 1929 to 2013 to identify long-term trends and multi-decadal variations in extreme sea levels (ESLs) relative to changes in mean sea level (MSL). Significant but small long-term trends in ESLs above/below MSL are found at individual sites along most coastline stretches, but are mostly confined to the southeast coast and the winter season when storm surges are primarily driven by extra-tropical cyclones. We identify six regions with broadly coherent and considerable multi-decadal ESL variations unrelated to MSL changes. Using a quasi-non-stationary extreme value analysis approach we show that the latter would have caused variations in design relevant return water levels (RWLs; 50 to 200 year return periods) ranging from ~10 cm to as much as 110 cm across the six regions. To explore the origin of these temporal changes and the role of large-scale climate variability we develop different sets of simple and multiple linear regression models with RWLs as dependent variables and climate indices, or tailored (toward the goal of predicting multi-decadal RWL changes) versions of them, and wind stress curl as independent predictors. The models, after being tested for spatial and temporal stability, explain up to 97% of the observed variability at individual sites and almost 80% on average. Using the model predictions as covariates for the quasi-non-stationary extreme value analysis also significantly reduces the range of change in the 100-year RWLs over time, turning a non-stationary process into a stationary one. This highlights that the models – when used with regional and global climate model output of the predictors – should also be capable of projecting future RWL changes to be used by decision makers for improved flood preparedness and long-term resiliency.",

            "abstract": "In response to the changing Antarctic climate, the Southern Ocean salp Salpa thompsoni has shown altered patterns of distribution and abundance that are anticipated to have profound impacts on pelagic food webs and ecosystem dynamics. The physiological and molecular processes that underlay ecological function and biogeographical distribution are key to understanding present-day dynamics and predicting future trajectories. This study examined transcriptome-wide patterns of gene expression in relation to biological and physical oceanographic conditions in coastal, shelf and offshore waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region during austral spring and summer 2011. Based on field observations and collections, seasonal changes in the distribution and abundance of salps of different life stages were associated with differences in water mass structure of the WAP. Our observations are consistent with previous suggestions that bathymetry and currents in Bransfield Strait could generate a retentive cell for an overwintering population of S. thompsoni, which may generate the characteristic salp blooms found throughout the region later in summer. The statistical analysis of transcriptome-wide patterns of gene expression revealed differences among salps collected in different seasons and from different habitats (i.e., coastal versus offshore) in the WAP. Gene expression patterns also clustered by station in austral spring – but not summer – collections, suggesting stronger heterogeneity of environmental conditions. During the summer, differentially expressed genes covered a wider range of functions, including those associated with stress responses. Future research using novel molecular transcriptomic / genomic characterization of S. thompsoni will allow more complete understanding of individual-, population-, and species-level responses to environmental variability and prediction of future dynamics of Southern Ocean food webs and ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "We performed a P-to-S receiver function (RF) study of the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) beneath South America. The dataset is a combination of all the available broadband seismic stations data of South America stored in three datacenters (IRIS, Universidade de São Paulo, and Rede Sismográfica Brasileira). RF stacking is made using the CCP method, with a nonplane wavefront assumption. RFs from 20803 teleseismic events generated 1861 stacked traces, with at least 4 RFs in 2 degrees radius. The results allow the identification of three major domains with distinct structure. The first domain, along the Cordillera has the 410 km discontinuity (D410) unusually deeper than normal, ~425 km depth, and reduced MTZ thickness, ~235 km. In the central portion of the continent, where the Nazca plate is believed to reach the MTZ, we find an area of about 10 degrees wide with the 660 km discontinuity (D660) depressed to ~675 km depth, and the MTZ is thicker, ~260 km. Lastly, the third domain occurs in the northeast of Brazil, where beneath the Archean cratons it was observed a very shallow D660 (~645 km) and thin MTZ (~235 km). The first domain indicates hotter than normal temperatures around the D410, most likely extending into the upper mantle, and might reflect an upwelling of a convection system behind the subducted plate. The second domain indicates colder than normal temperatures in the D660, and can be related to the emplacement of slab material above this discontinuity. In the third domain, the craton related environment, where colder and less altered lithosphere occurs, two hypotheses are offered to explain the shallow D660 and thin MTZ. Hot material is ascending from the lower mantle as part of the convective system related to the nearby mid-ocean ridge, or the Archean lithosphere acts as a refractory layer, not allowing heat to escape from the lower mantle upwards and being laterally dispersed by the MTZ.",

            "abstract": "Ozone pollution has huge impacts on the carbon balance in the United States, Europe and China. While terrestrial ecosystems provide an important sink for surface ozone through stomatal uptake, this process damages photosynthesis, reduces plant growth and biomass accumulation, and affects stomatal control over plant transpiration of water vapor. Effective mitigation of climate change by stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations requires improved understanding of ozone effects on the land carbon sink. Future effects of ozone pollution on the land carbon sink are largely unknown. We apply multiple observational datasets in combination with the Yale Interactive Terrestrial Biosphere (YIBs) model to quantify ozone vegetation damage in the present climatic state and for a broad range of possible futures. YIBs includes a mechanistic ozone damage model that affects both photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance for low or high ozone plant sensitivity. YIBs is embedded in the NASA GISS ModelE2 global chemistry-climate model to allow a uniquely informed integration of plant physiology, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. The YIBs model has been extensively evaluated using land carbon flux measurements from 145 flux tower sites and multiple satellite products. Chronic ozone exposure in the present day reduces GPP by 11-23%, NPP by 8-16%, stomatal conductance by 8-17% and leaf area index by 2-5% in the summer time eastern United States. Similar response magnitudes are found in Europe but almost doubled damage effects occur in hotspots in eastern China. We investigate future ozone vegetation damage within the context of multiple global change drivers (physical climate change, carbon dioxide fertilization, human energy and agricultural emissions, human land use) at 2050 following the IPCC RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. In the RCP8.5 world at 2050, growing season average GPP and NPP are reduced by 20-40% in China and 5-20% in the United States due to the global rise in methane, an important background ozone precursor. Failure to reduce air pollution emissions below present levels in this scenario would lead to catastrophic NPP reductions in eastern China that exceed 50%.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how glacier geometry and geographic setting govern a glacier’s response to meltwater and precipitation inputs. Does the up-glacier limit of enhanced summer basal motion vary across glaciers? Do non-surge glaciers show consistent spatial patterns of basal motion from year to year? We investigate such questions by documenting the seasonal-to-annual evolution of surface velocity for over 25 surge- and non-surge type glaciers in the Wrangell-St Elias ranges of southeast Alaska, USA, during 2013-2015.\n We use the Python-implemented PYCORR image cross-correlation software to estimate ice surface velocity fields over ~35,000 km2 covered by four Landsat-8 (L8) scenes. PYCORR is an optimized version of IMCORR, and takes less than 5 minutes to process a full L8 scene. This computational efficiency allows us to calculate dozens of velocity fields for each scene to provide high temporal resolution. We automate the extraction of velocity profiles along longitudinal glacier profiles to document their temporal evolution over timespans ranging from 16 days to greater than one year at spatial resolution of several tens to several hundred meters. This method provides much greater spatial coverage than GPS-derived velocities, and succeeds in terrain of rough surface texture and significant temporal elevation change, both of which present substantial challenges for deriving InSAR velocities.\nPreliminary data on Kennicott Glacier (Figure 1) resolve the annual velocity cycle in which speeds are lowest over winter and highest in summer reflecting meltwater-induced basal motion. We find notable seasonal velocity fluctuations at distances of more than 30 km from the glacier terminus. While longitudinal stress gradient coupling may explain a portion of these velocity variations, local basal motion must contribute, as the relatively thin (~500 m) ice cannot transmit longitudinal stresses over such distances. Regions downstream of tributary junctions show consistently accelerated flow, likely allowed by reduced wall friction.\nBy differencing summer and winter velocity estimates, we create spatially-distributed maps of the summer speedup and examine how this varies from year to year, as well as across different glaciers. These data will inform our understanding of the mechanics of glacier basal motion.",

Although the technology and infrastructure to determine spatially-distributed total surface water and groundwater supplies does not currently exist, satellite measurements of water resources have been useful for providing regional or global assessments of sustainable surface water or groundwater use. Here, we apply an innovative technique using GRACE to evaluate the sustainable use of both surface water and groundwater for the continental United States. Annual total water availability was estimated from the difference between the annual maximum and minimum change in total water storage as determined from GRACE. The available portion partitioned to humans was compared to the amount of water being used based on county-level USGS water use estimates to assess total water use sustainability at the HUC 2-digit spatial scale. This evaluation was conducted for a given wet, normal, and dry year according to GRACE records. Projected estimates of precipitation due to climate change across these regions were then used to compare present and future total water use sustainability. Such information is critical to better manage these resources so respective allocations to humans and the environment are more in line with the given quantities available at different spatial scales.",

            "abstract": "The observed shape of an impact crater is a result of multiple physical processes spread over time. Large lunar craters often have distinctive landforms dependent on diameter (e.g. a central peak), and then mass wasting and redistribution processes further alter their morphology over long time periods. In contrast, most small lunar craters (SLCs; 30 to 300 m diameter) have similar bowl shapes at formation, inferred from the shapes of the freshest SLCs. In particular, SLCs formed entirely within regolith are consistently bowl shaped, and changes to bowl shapes typically occur at target strength discontinuities. Starting from a fixed shape, degradation is largely responsible for the difference in the observed shapes of SLCs. SLC impact events are significant contributors to regolith formation and morphologies of SLCs are critical to our understanding of the regolith. Observed shapes of SLCs reflect, at least in part, the target properties where a crater formed and, perhaps, various layers below the surface. Variation in shapes of fresh SLCs can be attributed mostly to the thickness of the regolith layer and the general nature of the target region. Shapes of fresh and older SLCs differ by the amount of change due to degradation and is also dependant on target properties. However, there is currently no comprehensive observation-based comparative standard for the SLC shapes, both fresh and degraded. Shapes of SLCs at the Apollo 16 and 17 landing sites were analyzed from high-resolution topography (2 m/pixel) enabling a new standardized shape model for fresher SLCs (freshness classification via image analysis). We found that most SLCs (> 65%) analyzed were shallow inverted cone shaped and with decreasing freshness, SLCs were shallower and had flatter walls. The influence of degradation rates to the SLC shape is investigated and a larger degradation rate (at least twice) and higher percentage (>10%) of cone shaped craters is observed for Apollo 17 (compared to Apollo 16) SLCs. Finally, possibilities that allow SLC shapes to be influenced by target properties are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Source regions for 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events detected 1 AU from the Sun are typically found within ~20-30 degrees of the footpoint of the field line connecting the observer to the corona. However, some events have been detected by multiple spacecraft at significantly greater longitudinal separations. The broadest event (7 Feb 2010), which may be attributable to perpendicular transport caused by scattering in the interplanetary medium, shows a strong decrease of detected 3He fluence with increasing separation from the best connected field line. On the other hand, an event that occurred on 2 May 2014 under conditions of minimal interplanetary scattering appears to be the result of a large expansion of the active-region field between the photosphere and the source surface. In this event, similar 3He intensities were detected at locations separated by 38 degrees. These observations suggest correlations among the field expansion in the corona and fluence variations between observation points at 1 AU. We report results of a study in which the coronal spreading inferred from potential source surface field (PFSS) maps is compared with measured fluence ratios to establish the extent to which the spreading mechanisms inferred in these two prototypical events are applicable the the larger population of 3He-rich SEP events observed in the era of multispacecraft observations.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthesis in the terrestrial ecosystems contributes to the largest carbon flux in the global carbon cycle. The use of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy of photosynthesis at the ecosystem scale (Gross Primary Production, GPP) is a critical emerging technology. Satellite measurements of SIF were found to be significantly correlated with GPP, and several ground campaigns suggested that SIF could improve the GPP estimation. However, it remains unclear to what extent this relationship is due to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and/or light use efficiency (LUE). In addition, models that simulate SIF have not been rigorously validated. Here we present the first time-series of near-surface measurement of canopy-scale SIF at 760nm in temperate deciduous forests during year 2013-2014. SIF correlated with GPP estimated with eddy covariance at diurnal and seasonal scales (r2=0.82 and 0.73, respectively), as well as with APAR diurnally and seasonally (r2=0.90 and 0.80, respectively). SIF/APAR is significantly positively correlated with LUE and is higher during cloudy days than sunny days. Weekly tower-based SIF agreed with SIF from GOME-2 (The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2, r2 = 0.82). We further compared SIF observations with those simulated by Soil Canopy Observation Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. We found that key parameters in SCOPE including Vcmax, LAI, chlorophyll content, and viewing angles determine the agreement between observations and model. Our results provide support to the use of SIF to estimate canopy photosynthetic activities, and present a framework of validating fluorescence simulated by canopy radiative transfer models.",

            "abstract": "Global mean temperatures will increase in response to future increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The magnitude of this warming for a given radiative forcing is still subject of debate. Here we provide estimates for the equilibrium climate sensitivity using paleo-proxy and modeling data from the last eight glacial cycles (~784,000 years). First of all, two reconstructions of globally averaged surface air temperature (SAT) for the last eight glacial cycles are obtained from two independent sources: one mainly based on a transient model simulation, the other one derived from paleo- SST records and SST network/global SAT scaling factors. Both reconstructions exhibit very good agreement in both amplitude and timing of past SAT variations. In the second step, we calculate the radiative forcings associated with greenhouse gas concentrations, dust concentrations, and surface albedo changes for the last 784, 000 years. The equilibrium climate sensitivity is then derived from the ratio of the SAT anomalies and the radiative forcing changes. Our results reveal that this estimate of the Charney climate sensitivity is a function of the background climate with substantially higher values for warmer climates. Warm phases exhibit an equilibrium climate sensitivity of ~3.70 K per CO2-doubling – more than twice the value derived for cold phases (~1.40 K per 2xCO2). We will show that the current CMIP5 ensemble-mean projection of global warming during the 21st century is supported by our estimate of climate sensitivity derived from climate paleo data of the past 784,000 years.",

We recently initiated two science-management climate change adaptation partnerships, one with three national forests and one national park in south central Oregon, and the other with 16 national forests, three national parks and other stakeholders in the northern Rockies region. Goals of both partnerships were to: (1) synthesize published information and data to assess the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of key resource areas, including water use, infrastructure, fisheries, and vegetation and disturbance; (2) develop science-based adaptation strategies and tactics that will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and assist the transition of biological systems and management to a warmer climate; (3) ensure adaptation strategies and tactics are incorporated into relevant planning documents; and (4) foster an enduring partnership to facilitate ongoing dialogue and activities related to climate change in the partnerships regions. After an initial vulnerability assessment by agency and university scientists and local resource specialists, adaptation strategies and tactics were developed in a series of scientist-manager workshops. The final vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions are incorporated in technical reports. The partnerships produced concrete adaptation options for national forest and other natural resource managers and illustrated the utility of place-based vulnerability assessments and scientist-manager workshops in adapting to climate change.",

Evident in the Bouguer gravity at both poles are the signatures of a few large craters and basins. But at both poles, the Bouguer map also displays a large number of small, rather sinuous features, some outlining crater rims and some structures on crater floors, that are distributed more or less uniformly across the region. The root mean square (rms) variation over the 10° radius cap is less than 11 mGals at the south pole and less than 7 mGals in the north. This difference reflects the greater crustal complexity in the south compared to the north, but these magnitudes are approximately 10% of the total field in the polar regions, indicating that substantial density anomalies exist below 50 km depth. Modeling the crustal anomalies in the top 50 km by density contrasts at various depths suggest the rms magnitudes can be explained by small local variations in porosity, or possibly the presence of H2O at concentrations of a few percent. The required concentration increases with depth for a given volume but the possibility that the source of the polar anomalies includes small concentrations of H2O in the crust, however, cannot be ruled out.",

            "abstract": "In an effort to seek new perspectives on identifying precipitation patterns associated with the precipitation time series, this study explored the potential use of the information metrics through Multi-scale Sample Entropy (MSE) analysis. The objectives were to develop MSE analysis in investigating if discernable changes in long term patterns could be identified when the information metrics in the data were studied in terms of how they change with scales. Scales, in the present context, are the intervals of days that sample entropy (SE) is sampled within a time series. For this study we looked into the characteristics of precipitation before and after 1980 for the regions upstream of Yangtze River in southwestern China, based on the daily rain-gauge data collected from 70 gauges since 1951. The results suggest three main patterns of SE with scale, they are: significant decrease, relatively flat and significant increase. These three patterns correspond, respectively, to the downstream, midstream and upstream of the upper Yangtze River region. By the nature of entropy, a significant decrease in SE implies more regularity with scale, which could mean a longer continuous drought or a more evenly distributed continuous precipitation. In this case, our analysis shows that it is attributed to the longer continuous drought. For the case of significant SE increase, it was found to be tied to an increase in the rain frequency. These results appear to show that the MSE analysis could indeed be useful for long term precipitation study.",

The PF may represent a seismic risk due to its location in a densely populated urban area. In February 2015, we acquired high-resolution P- and S-wave seismic data across the approximately mapped trace of the PF at Dimond Canyon Park in Oakland, California to constrain the near-surface location and dip of the fault. Our seismic profile extended 315 m along a southwest to northeast trend. P- and S-wave data were acquired separately using hammer sources. Each shot was co-located with and recorded by 106 40-Hz (P-wave) and 4.5 Hz (S-wave) geophones, spaced 3 m apart. Both the P- and S-wave data show large differences in velocities on the southwest side of the profile (Vp =600-2100 m/s; Vs = 260-520 m/s) compared to the northeast side (Vp =800-3200 m/s; Vs = 500-800 m/s), with a near-vertical dip of velocity contours between the two sides. We interpret the abrupt, near-vertical zone of velocity transition to coincide with the PF. Vp/Vs and Poisson’s ratio models show pronounced lows associated with the apparent fault zone. Reflection images show diffractions and near-surface (~ 5 m) breaks in the continuity of reflectors at the location of our interpreted fault. We also evaluated the velocity structure along the profile using two different 2-D surface-wave techniques (MASW and MALW) that show velocities and structures similar to those determined by the tomographic method. Based on our interpreted location of the PF, drilling studies are planned to evaluate the recency of faulting along the PF.",

The goal of this study was to understand the soil-geomorphic evolution of Quaternary alluvial and eolian deposits in the Sonoran Desert using a data-driven DSM technique and mapping of soil-landscape relationships. An iterative principal component analysis (iPCA) data reduction routine was developed and implemented for a set of LiDAR elevation- and Landsat ETM+-derived environmental covariates that characterize soil-landscape variability. Principal components that explain more than 95% of the soil-landscape variability were then integrated and classified based on an ISODATA (Iterative Self‐Organizing Data) unsupervised technique. The classified map was then segmented based on a region growing algorithm and multi-scale maps of soil-landscape relations were developed, which then compared with maps of major arid-region landforms that can be identified on aerial photographs and satellite images by their distinguishing tone and texture, and in the field by their distinguishing surface and sub-surface soil physical, chemical and biological properties. The approach identified and mapped the soil-landscape variability of alluvial and eolian landscapes, and illustrated the applicability of coupling covariate selection and integration by iPCA, ISODATA classifications of integrated layers, and image segmentation for effective spatial prediction of soil–landscape characteristics. The approach developed here is data-driven, cost- and time-effective, applicable for multi-scale mapping, allows incorporation of wide variety of covariates, and provides accurate quantitative prediction of wide range of soil-landscape attributes that are necessary for hydrologic models, land and ecosystem management decisions, and hazard assessment.",

These trace element concentrations were compared to previously analyzed δ18O and δ13C values from JX-6, and to the results of previous studies comparing U concentrations in speleothems to paleoclimate. U concentrations of JX-6 correlate well with δ13C and δ18O values, and we interpret them to be a proxy for soil moisture above Juxtlahuaca Cave. This study concludes that U concentrations in JX-6 may be controlled by changes in the pCO2 of overlying soils in relation to plant respiration possibly linked to the consistency of wet season (May – November) rainfall and temperature between 240 BCE to 1800 CE. Comparison to previous studies suggests that speleothem U concentrations are controlled by local cave conditions and are best used with the support of additional trace element and stable isotope data. Anomalous spikes in trace element concentrations were also observed in JX-6 at ~1862, 1871, 1904, and 1933 CE. These spikes were interpreted to be caused by increased U mobilization in overlying soils related to multiple deforestation events in association with the clearing of land above Juxtlahuaca Cave for agricultural use.",

Satellite observations, although capturing the global impact on seasonal scales, are unable to resolve the details of the transport process. To investigate the interplay of convection and the large-scale monsoonal circulation in UT/LS transport, we analyzed the tracer behavior in the ASM region using NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model run in specified dynamics mode (WACCM-SD). Dynamical variability of the carbon monoxide, a tracer of tropospheric pollutants and their relationship with the tropopause are examined in association with the sub-seasonal variability of the anticyclone. The results show that monsoon convection creates a “bubble” of tropospheric air above the mean tropopause in the ASM region. The intra-seasonal oscillation at the UT/LS level plays an essential role in transporting convectively pumped boundary layer pollutants into the stratosphere. Our analysis also shows that there is a preferred location for the uplifted boundary layer to reach the tropopause level. Airborne in situ observations may be an essential tool to verify these model results.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric production rate of cosmogenic nuclides is linked to the geomagnetic dipole moment (GDM) by a non-linear inverse relationship. Large amplitude GDM variations associated with reversals and excursions can potentially be reconstructed using time variation of the cosmogenic beryllium-10 (10Be) production recorded in ocean sediments. Downcore profiles of authigenic 10Be/9Be ratios (proxy of atmospheric 10Be production) in oceanic cores provide independent and additional records of the evolution of the geomagnetic intensity and complete previous information derived from relative paleointensity (RPI). Here are presented new authigenic 10Be/9Be results obtained from cores MD05-2920 and from the top of core MD05-2930 collected in the West Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Completing data of Ménabréaz et al. (2012, 2014), these results provide the first continuous 10Be production rate sedimentary record covering the last 800 ka. Along these cores, authigenic 10Be/9Be ratio peaks are recorded – within methodological errors - at the stratigraphic level of RPI lows. High-resolution chronologies (δ18O-derived) lead to interpret these peaks as successive global 10Be overproduction events triggered by geomagnetic dipole lows present in the PISO-1500 and Sint-2000 stacks. The largest amplitude 10Be production enhancement is synchronous to the very large decrease of the dipole field associated with the last polarity reversal (772 ka). It is consistent in shape and duration with the peak recorded in core MD90-0961 from the Maldive area (Indian Ocean) (Valet et al. 2014). Two significant 10Be production enhancements are coeval with the Laschamp (41 ka) and Icelandic basin (190 ka) excursions, while 10Be production peaks of lower amplitude correlate to other recognized excursions such as the Blake (120 ka), Pringle-Falls (215 ka), Portuguese Margin (290 ka), Big Lost (540 ka) among others. This study provides new data on the amplitude and timing of dipole field variations, helping to understand the difference between paleosecular variation, excursions, aborted reversals and reversals regimes.",

            "abstract": "To improve understanding of the link between injection/production activity and seismicity, we apply an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model to an earthquake catalog from The Geysers geothermal field (GGF) between 2005-2015 using >140,000 events and Mc 0.8 . We partition the catalog along a northeast-southwest trending divide, which corresponds to regions of high and low levels of enhanced geothermal stimulation (EGS) across the field. The ETAS model is fit to the seismicity data using a 6-month sliding window with a 1-month time step to determine the background seismicity rate. We generate monthly time series of the time-dependent background seismicity rate in 1-km depth intervals from 0-5km. The average wellhead depth is 2-3 km and the background seismicity rates above this depth do not correlate well with field-wide injected masses over the time period of interest. The auto correlation results show a 12-month period for monthly time series proximal to the average wellhead depths (2-3km and 3-4km) for northwest GGF strongly correlates with field-wide fluid injection masses, with a four-month phase shift between the two depth intervals as fluid migrates deeper. This periodicity is not observed for the deeper depth interval of 4-5 km, where monthly background seismicity rates reduce to near zero. Cross-correlation analysis using the monthly time series for background seismicity rate and the field-wide injection, production and net injection (injection minus production) suggest that injection most directly modulates seismicity. Periodicity in the background seismicity is not observed as strongly in the time series for the southeast field. We suggest that the variation in background seismicity rate is a proxy for pore-pressure diffusion of injected fluids at depth. We deduce that the contrast between the background seismicity rates in the northwest and southeast GGF is a result of reduced EGS activity in the southeast region.",

Variation in anaerobic respiratory pathways can further, and dramatically, impact carbon oxidation rates. Within the aggregated structure of soils, steep chemical gradients arise from the supply of oxygen and nutrients along macropores that are rapidly consumed (relative to supply) within the micropore domains of aggregate interiors. As a consequence of demand exceeding oxygen supply within soil aggregates and peds, an appreciable fraction of the soil volume may persist in an anaerobic state within upland, agriculturally productive system. Factors limiting oxygen diffusion and availability such as soil texture, soil moisture content, organic matter input, and aggregate size (soil structure) provide central controls on microbial carbon mineralization rates. Here, we combine laboratory studies with manipulations of field samples and in-field measurements to illustrate how soil structure and carbon availability interact to impose anaerobic conditions and associated respiratory constraints on organic matter mineralization rates and thus storage within soils.",

            "abstract": "Energy considerations indicate that the power delivered to the present-day geodynamo comes mainly from the growth of the solid inner core, through light element and latent heat release. However, estimates of present-day core heat loss predict that inner core nucleation (ICN) occurred by 1 Ga, implying that the geodynamo operated over most of its history without the help of inner core growth. We use numerical dynamo simulations linked by thermochemical evolution of the core to determine signatures of ICN in the paleomagnetic field and possible ICN footprints in paleomagnetic data. First, we select a set of dynamo simulation parameters that produces a magnetic field structure compliant with the present-day geomagnetic field. Then, we use thermochemical evolution models to take this dynamo model backward in time, varying the inner core size and the forcing parameters accordingly. We find that the paleointensity is greater prior to ICN than at present-day, which contrasts with predictions from classical dynamo scalings. Our results suggest that the surface magnetic field is well-approximated by an axial dipole prior to ICN, although it contains an axial octupole component larger than at present-day. This stronger octupole is caused by the emergence of flow downwellings near the poles of the outer core prior to ICN, and may be resolvable using paleomagnetic data.",

            "abstract": "Intermediate-depth earthquakes in cold subduction zones are observed within the subducting oceanic crust, as well as the subducting mantle In contrast, intermediate-depth earthquakes in hot subduction zones predominantly occur just below the Moho. These observations have stimulated interest in potential relationships between blueschist-facies metamorphism and seismicity, particularly through the dehydration reactions involving lawsonite. The rheology of these high-pressure and low-temperature metamorphic minerals is largely unknown.\nWe conducted experiments on lawsonite accompanied by monitoring of acoustic emission (AE) in a Griggs-type deformation apparatus. Deformation was started at the confining pressure of 1.0 GPa, the temperature of 300 ˚C, and constant displacement rates of 0.16 to 0.016 μm/s, that correspond to equivalent strain rates (ε) of 9 × 10–5 to 9 × 10–6 1/s. In these experiments, temperature was increased at the temperature ramp rate of 0.5 to 0.05˚C/s above the thermal stability of lawsonite (600˚C) while the sample was deforming to test whether the dehydration reaction induces unstable fault slip. In contrast to similar tests on antigorite, unstable fault slip (i.e., stick-slip) occurred during dehydration reactions in the lawsonite gouge layer, and AE signals were continuously observed. Microstructural observations indicate that strain is highly localized along the fault (R1 and B shear), and the fault surface shows mirror-like slickensides. The unloading slope (i.e., rate of stress drop as a function of slip) during the unstable slip follows the stiffness of the apparatus at all experimental conditions regardless of the strain rate and temperature ramping rate. A thermal-mechanical scaling factor in the experiments covers the range estimated for natural subduction zones, indicating the potential for unstable frictional sliding within natural lawsonite layers to induce seismicity in cold subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Water quality and its response to climate change have been become one of the most important issues of our society, which catches the attention of many scientists, environmental activists and policy makers. Climate change influences the river water quality directly and indirectly via rainfall and air temperature. For example, low flow decreases the volume of water for dilution and increases the residence time of the pollutants. By contrast, high flow leads to increases in the amount of pollutants and sediment loads from catchments to rivers. The changes in hydraulic characteristics, i.e. water depth and velocity, affect the transportation and biochemical transformation of pollutants in the river water body. The high air temperature leads to increasing water temperature, shorter growing periods of different crops and water demands from domestic households and industries, which eventually effects the level of river pollution.\nThis study demonstrates the quantification of the variation of the water temperature and pollutant concentrations along the Molse Neet river in the North East of Belgium as a result of the changes in the catchment rainfall-runoff, air temperature and nutrient loads. Firstly, four climate change scenarios were generated based on a large ensemble of available global and regional climate models and statistical downscaling based on a quantile perturbation method. Secondly, the climatic changes to rainfall and temperature were transformed to changes in the evapotranspiration and runoff flow through the conceptual hydrological model PDM. Thirdly, the adjustment in nutrient loads from agriculture due to rainfall and growing periods of crops were calculated by means of the semi-empirical SENTWA model. Water temperature was estimated from air temperature by a stochastic model separating the temperature into long-term annual and short-term residual components. Next, hydrodynamic and water quality models of the river, implemented in InfoWorks RS, were simulated for both historical (2000-2010) and projected future periods (2050-2060). The advection movement and physico-biochemical processes were considered for simulation of the following water quality variables: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and organic nitrogen.",

This region, located between 21˚S-66˚S and 180-270˚E, is dominated by the Urvara basin in the east and cratered plains in the west. The elevation of the cratered plains is intermediate between the identified “highland” and “lowland” units of Ceres. Plains in the SW corner of the quadrangle are hummocky and heavily cratered, while the NW corner is smoother and less densely cratered. Features of note include 1) the 200 km diameter Urvara basin, which includes a degraded northern rim and smooth interior and exterior material that hosts a significantly lower impact crater density than most of the rest of Ceres’ surface; 2) semi-radial curvilinear structures extending to the east and west of Urvara; 3) two large-scale dome structures 10s of km in diameter exterior to Urvara; and 4) numerous small-scale domical structures (<12 km diameter) associated with the smooth material interior to the basin. Key goals of the ongoing mapping are to assess the types of resurfacing processes that might be responsible for producing the smooth units, and to assess the processes responsible for the development of large and small dome structures.\nAt the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including clear filter and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) images starting in December 2015.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident in Japan resulted in a significant dissemination of cesium-137 (Cs-137) over a wide area west of the plant, including the contamination of many watersheds and the subsequent evacuation of many communities. Today approximately 90% of on-land Cs-137 fallout following the accident resides in the upper 5 cm of forest soils. While this can be partially attributed to the forested composition of the prefecture (70%), there is also difficulty in cleanup efforts in these regions due to a lack of understanding and predictive capability of radioisotopes transport at the catchment to watershed scale. Subsequently, there is an uncertain, but likely long-term impact on local communities with implications for the use of nuclear energy use worldwide. Due to the complex nature of forest eco-hydrology, sophisticated modeling tools to accurately predict Cs-137 fluxes across different spatial and temporal scales are required. High fidelity, high resolution numerical modeling techniques in conjunction with parallel high performance computing is required to accurately determine transport and feedbacks in these complex systems. To better understand the fundamental transport of Cs-137, a watershed near the FDNPP is modeled with an integrated hydrologic model that includes variably saturated groundwater and overland flow in addition to atmospheric and vegetative processes via a coupled land surface model. Of specific interest is the impact of land cover type on hydrologic flow in the area, which will likely play an important role in erosion patterns and the consequent transport of Cs-137 strongly sorbed to surface soils. Risk management practices (for example, passive remediation versus active remediation such as targeted logging) for two principal tree types (evergreen and deciduous) are informed given the simulated responses to flow patterns assuming different quantities and spatial distribution patterns of each tree type.",

            "abstract": "The Lewis and Clark Fault Zone (LCFZ) is a megashear that extends WNW about 800 km across the northern Rockies. In Montana, the LCFZ is associated with recurrent seismicity including multiple M6 events near Helena. This raises the question of whether similar damaging earthquakes might occur along the western part of the LCFZ in northern Idaho and eastern Washington. Background seismicity is low in this region. However, three widely felt earthquakes (~M4) representing the first significant seismicity since 1942 in the Idaho Panhandle occurred near Sandpoint on April 24th 2015. Fault plane solutions of these events, along with recent GPS velocity results and a re-analysis of the 2001 swarm of M<4 events in Spokane, show that the stress field re-activating relict structures in the western LCFZ causes reverse mechanisms and contractional strain fundamentally different from the basin-and-range style extension along the eastern LCFZ in Montana. The M6 Montana events involved dextral strike-slip motion on the steeply-dipping WNW trending faults. Similar faults occur close to population centers in northern Idaho and eastern Washington. However, the stress field revealed by our study does not favor such fault motion in the western LCFZ. Our results constrain the western extent of the basin-and-range style extension along the LCFZ.",

This region is adjacent to the confluence of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean where often times, low-level jets (LLJs) are found in the boundary layer during summer months. An East Hampton Roads Aerosol Flux (EHRAF) campaign, was conducted from the campus of Hampton University (HU) to examine small-scale aerosol transport using aerosol, Raman, and Doppler lidars, as well as rawindsondes over a one-week period in May 2014 . LLJs were observed from evening of 20 May to the morning of 21 May, and were found to lead to cloud formation. In this paper, the cloud formation caused by LLJs is analyzed using data that includes high-resolution profiles of: aerosol backscatter, turbulence structure, temperature, wind speed and direction, and water vapor. It is found that enhanced nighttime turbulence triggered by LLJs causes the aerosol and water vapor content of boundary layer to be lifted up forming a well-mixed region. We show that this region contains the cloud condensation nuclei that are very important for the formation of clouds.",

            "abstract": "A forensic hydrological investigation of a major flash flood was conducted for the Blanco River in south-central Texas. The unprecedented flood occurred during the early morning hours of May 24th leaving 12 dead in the towns of Wimberley and San Marcos. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed, two reinforced concrete bridges were washed off their piers, and nearly 100 high water rescues were made the following day.\nThe present work characterizes the meteorological setup leading to the event, describes the flood hydrology using the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model, and reports on an extensive field campaign seeking to document high water marks throughout the 1200 km2 basin.\nResults indicate high precipitable water values, large CAPE, and strong mid and upper level winds aided in impressive divergence over the region. This allowed for storms to continually produce heavy rainfall over the same areas. Large regions of the catchment received greater than 200 mm across the upper portion of the basin with 24 hr maximums around 330 mm.\nGSSHA simulations indicate good performance when compared to a stage hydrograph recorded mid-catchment. The remaining USGS gauges failed early on during the rising limb of the hydrograph. Model estimates indicate peak streamflow was approximately 5500 cms with stage values nearing 13 m as the flood wave moved through the town of Wimberley. Approximately 125 locations were examined for high water marks along the mainstem of the river using RTK GPS. Stage values ranged from 12 – 18 m.",

We propose a novel technique to calculate the atmospheric opacity that is not sensitive to the degradation of the sensor due to the deposition of dust on it. We estimate the diffuse and total radiation signals by analyzing the events in which the direct solar beam was temporarily blocked by the masthead or by the mast of the rover. Then we use a radiative transfer model based on the Monte-Carlo method to obtain the UV opacity from those measurements.\nWe compare the UV opacities with the opacities derived from Mastcam observations at 880 nm. Both opacities follow a similar seasonal trend, with the UV opacity showing values generally lower than those at 880 nm. The difference between both opacities varies over the year, with the minimum difference occurring when both opacities show their annual lowest values (Ls ~ 130º). The temporal variation of this difference may be attributed to changes in the dust size distribution.",

Seven intervals were dated successfully: six tuffs and lapilli-tuffs between 680.99 and 1722.46 m below sea floor (mbsf) and a single peperitic rhyolitic intrusion at 1388.86 – 1390.07 mbsf. Thirty-two intervals which underwent mineral separation lacked zircon, or yielded zircon much older than age expectations for U1437. Geochronology results from separated zircons confirm and extend the shipboard age model to 1360.77 mbsf where Late Miocene (Tortonian) submarine volcanic rocks (11.3 ±0.7 Ma; n = 17) were sampled. In-situ measurement of zircons associated with magnetite crystals in the rhyolite intrusion yield an age of 13.6 ±1.7 Ma (n = 9). Zircon U contents are low (typically <300 ppm), with trace element ratios characteristic of oceanic lithosphere and near-mantle δ18O values (4-6 ‰). Individual Miocene zircon crystals are difficult to distinguish by age alone from those in the drilling mud (sepiolite) used during Expedition 350; the sepiolite is quarried by IMV Nevada in the Amargosa Valley. Our analysis of thirty-three zircons from the sepiolite finds that they have a broad and varied age distribution (2 – 2033 Ma) with a prominent peak at 12-14 Ma, bimodal δ18O values (peaks at 5-5.5 and 6.5-7.5 ‰), and dominantly continental trace element signatures. Three zircons from U1437 are tentatively identified as sepiolite-derived, but a single Eocene grain (51.7 ±2.4 Ma) recovered from 1722.46 mbsf has an age unlike those in the sepiolite, and potentially is genuinely xenocrystic. The majority of U1437 zircons thus crystallized from evolved melts lacking continental characteristics, although thermal and compositional conditions conducive for zircon crystallization appear to have been rarely attained.",

            "abstract": "The Gorkha earthquake provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of the Himalayan faults in Nepal, specifically the Main Himalayan Thrust, accommodating north-south compression due to convergence between Indian and Eurasian plate. We use four independent global seismic arrays to backproject the high frequency seismic radiation to its source, and produce high-resolution images of rupture propagation during this earthquake (Figure 1). The rupture propagates unilaterally from west to east for 120 km for at an average velocity of 2 km/s. The duration of rupture is estimated to be 60 s. Along the dip direction, rupture propagates downward from the epicenter for the first 50 s, and shows complexity after that. The details of the rupture revealed by the arrays indicate strong control of stress and/or geometrical heterogeneity over the rupture pattern. Interestingly, high frequency seismic radiation is spatially separate from the low-frequency patches derived from inversion of low frequency seismic data [NEIC, USGS]. High frequency sources are located downdip of peak co-seismic slip. As a result of this separation, sources of high-frequency radiations are located farther away from Kathmandu, the most densely populated city in Nepal, compared to the large slip patches. This earthquake broke the downdip part of the locked patch of the Main Himalayan Thrust. The updip part, with strong seismic coupling [Ader et al., 2012], still remains unbroken and can potentially produce large damaging earthquakes. Mapping of high frequency radiations using multiple arrays are providing robust details of rupture characteristics allowing us to assess the relationship between fault coupling, frictional heterogeneity and future earthquake hazard in the Nepal Himalayas.",

            "abstract": "Many outer planet satellites possess thick, icy crusts over an ocean of liquid water. Maintaining an ocean over geologic time requires internal heating by tidal dissipation, but the mechanisms of tidal dissipation in ice are poorly resolved. The physics of dissipation in the geological context (the “high temperature background”) are dominated by stress-induced chemical diffusion, which has a distinct length-scale dependence that is frequently cited as the grain size. The experiments of McCarthy [2009], however, measured attenuation simultaneously with steady-state creep in polycrystalline ice and showed distinctly grain size-insensitive dissipation. These data can instead be normalized by the steady-state creep stress, implying that the deformation-induced microstructure dominates the length scale of diffusion. Thus, the relationship between deformation-induced microstructure and dissipation is critical to understanding how tidal dissipation affects (or, perhaps, effects) the geodynamics of icy satellites.\nTo characterize the role of deformation microstructure in strain-energy dissipation, we conducted creep and stress-reduction experiments on polycrystalline ice. The stress (0.5–5 MPa), grain size (30 & 245 μm) and temperature (233K) of the experiments place our specimens in the rheological regimes of grain boundary sliding (geometrically accommodated by basal glide) or dislocation creep, both of which accrue significant plastic strain by the motion of lattice dislocations. Stress-reductions allow a specific deformation-induced microstructure—that produced in steady-state creep—to be probed for its effective viscosity (or “hardness”) at a variety of stresses. This “constant-hardness creep compliance” is affected by deviatoric stress, but not by grain size, confirming a characteristic length scale for relaxation that is dictated by deformation. The microstructures of deformed samples, analyzed via cryogenic electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and reflected light microscopy, suggest that the stress-sensitive microstructural feature that dominates the length scale of diffusion may be the dislocation structure of the grain boundaries proper.",

While the accumulation and depletion of snow cover extent provides an indication of the temporal progression of the snow pack, it does not provide insight into available water for irrigation. Therefore, we use snow model results from the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center to quantify snow water equivalent and volume of water available within the snowpack for irrigation. In an effort to understand how water availability, along with its inter-annual variability, relates to the food security of the country, we develop a simple, effective, and easy-to-implement model to identify irrigated areas across the country on both annual and mid-season basis. The model is based on applying thresholds to peak growing season vegetation indices—derived from 250-meter MODIS images—in a decision-tree classifier to separate irrigated crops from non-irrigated vegetation. The spatial distribution and areal estimates of irrigated areas from these maps compare well with irrigated areas classified from multiple snap shots of the landscape from Landsat 5 optical and thermal images over selected locations. We observed that the extents of irrigated areas varied depending on the availability of snowmelt and can be between 1.35 million hectares in a year with significant water deficit and 2.4 million hectares in a year with significant water surplus. The changes in the amount of available water generally can contribute up to a 30% change in irrigated areas. We also observed that the strong correlation between inter-annual variability of irrigated areas and the variability in the country’s cereal production could be utilized to predict an annual estimate of cereal production, providing early indication of food security scenarios for the country.",

            "abstract": "Large rivers of the Southwestern United States are central to both ecological and human communities. Complex relationships exist between water policy, management, and natural ecosystems. The San Acacia Reach of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico, a 50 mile stretch from San Acacia to San Marcial, has experienced multiple management and climate fluctuations over the past 80 years, resulting in threats to riparian and aquatic ecosystems. These changes have included channelization of the river, reduced seasonal flooding due to upstream dams and conveyance channels, and varying river flows as a result of drought cycles. Understanding how the location and composition of vegetation has responded to these changes is essential in understanding the larger influence on the riparian vegetation which surrounds the river. This research used remote sensing data, land cover change analysis, GIS, and a review of the on-the-ground management decisions to accomplish the following goals: 1) determine how the channel has changed spatially over time, 2) determine the location and composition of vegetation change, and 3) determine potential linkages between management and the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This research focused on four research periods which provide unique opportunities to observe a direct relationship between river management and land cover change. The periods are: 1) 1935 to 1962, 2) 1962 to 1987, 3) 1987 to 1999, and 4) 1999 to 2014. Initial results show increased invasive vegetation growth in response to early large scale, basin-wide changes in river management. Between 1962 and 1987, invasive forest/woodland land cover increased by more than 250%. However, as a result of restoration efforts over the past 25 years, combined with periods of increased precipitation and an aging ecosystem limiting new growth, native vegetation has responded and invasive vegetation growth has slowed. This has occurred despite a more constricted and incised river channel. Overall, the river has been greatly altered by years of natural and anthropogenic processes. Understanding the range of spatial and temporal response of vegetation to management may be the key to protecting it for many years to come.",

            "abstract": "LiDAR data are increasingly applied to support forest inventory and assessment across a variety of spatial scales. Typically this is achieved by integrating LiDAR data with forest inventory collected at fixed radius forest inventory plots. A well-designed forest inventory, one that covers the full range of structural and compositional variation across the forest of interest, is costly especially when collecting fixed radius plot data. Variable radius plots offer an alternative inventory protocol that is more efficient in terms of both time and money. However, integrating variable radius plot data with LiDAR data is problematic because the plots have unknown sizes that vary with variation in tree size. This leads to a spatial mismatch between LiDAR metrics (e.g., mean height, canopy cover, density, etc.) and plot data, which ultimately translates into errors in LiDAR derived forest inventory predictions. We propose and evaluate and novel approach for integrating variable radius plot data into a LiDAR based forest inventories in two different forest systems, one in the inland northwest and another in the northern lakes states of the USA. The novel approach calculates LiDAR metrics by weighting the point cloud proportional to return height, mimicking the way in which variable radius plot data weights tree measurements by tree size. This could increase inventory sampling efficiency, allowing for the collection of a greater number of inventory plots, and ultimately improve the performance of LiDAR based inventories.",

            "abstract": "The most recent planetary decadal survey, entitled Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022, provided a detailed set of priorities for solar system exploration. Those priorities drew on broad input from the U.S. and international planetary science community. Using white papers, town hall meetings, and open meetings of the decadal committees, community views were solicited and a consensus began to emerge. The final report summarized that consensus.\nLike many past decadal reports, the centerpiece of Vision and Voyages was a set of priorities for future space flight projects. Two things distinguished this report from some previous decadals. First, conservative and independent cost estimates were obtained for all of the projects that were considered. These independent cost estimates, rather than estimates generated by project advocates, were used to judge each project's expected science return per dollar. Second, rather than simply accepting NASA's ten-year projection of expected funding for planetary exploration, decision rules were provided to guide program adjustments if actual funding did not follow projections.\nTo date, NASA has closely followed decadal recommendations. In particular, the two highest priority \"flagship\" missions, a Mars rover to collect samples for return to Earth and a mission to investigate a possible ocean on Europa, are both underway.

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, a number of forecasting centers around the world have offered seasonal streamflow predictions, using methodologies that span a wide range of data requirements and complexity. In the western United States, two primary approaches have been adopted for operational purposes: (i) development of regression equations between future streamflow and in situ observations (e.g. rainfall, snow water equivalent), and (ii) ensemble hydrologic model simulations that combine initial watershed moisture states with historically observed weather sequences for the forecast period (e.g., Ensemble Streamflow Prediction, ESP). Nevertheless, none of these methodologies makes use of analyzed or forecast climate information, which might increase the skill of seasonal predictions. Further, there is a need to better understand the marginal benefits of using more complex methods (from statistical to dynamical) and different types of information.\nIn this work, we provide a systematic intercomparison of various seasonal streamflow forecasting techniques, including: (1) a dynamical approach based on conceptual hydrologic modeling and ESP, (2) statistical regression using climate information and/or initial hydrologic conditions, (3) an ESP trace weighting scheme based on analog climatic conditions, and (4) combination of dynamical and statistical forecasts (i.e. hybrid approach). Climate information is taken from the NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis and reforecast datasets. These methods are tested for predicting spring (e.g., May-September) runoff volumes at case study basins located in the US Pacific Northwest, and results obtained for several initialization times are evaluated in terms of accuracy, probabilistic skill and statistical consistency. Preliminary results show that for earlier initialization times (October 1 to December 1), statistical and hybrid techniques that make use of climate information outperform ESP in terms of correlation and probabilistic skill. Although ESP at times provides the best correlation between forecasts and observations after January 1, improved probabilistic skill is obtained through statistical and hybrid techniques that instead rely on initial hydrologic conditions.\nwebsite:  http://www.ral.ucar.edu/staff/wood/case_studies_wr/",

            "abstract": "The last deglaciation was marked by large scale and rapid changes in rainfall over the tropics. Previous studies have correlated pulses of increased terrigenous input off semi arid northeastern South America with abrupt cold events in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. However, deglacial climate changes in other areas of South America are still not resolved. Here we reconstruct deglacial (23-11.5 cal ka BP) continental conditions over eastern Brazil based on (i) Ti/Ca of a radiocarbon dated marine sediment core as a proxy for Doce River (draining eastern Brazil) terrigenous input, and (ii) δ18O of a suite of U-Th dated stalagmites from eastern Brazil. Our marine core was recovered from 1100 m water depth on the tropical Brazilian continental slope, while our stalagmites come from Lapa Sem Fim cave. Both the Doce River and Lapa Sem Fim cave are located in the highly populated and economically active eastern Brazil, where most of the rainfall is related to the activity of the South America Monsoon System (SAMS). The Ti/Ca record is relatively stable showing high proportions of Ti in relationship to Ca throughout the deglacial, with a major excursion towards lower values indicating a decrease in terrigenous input synchronous to the Bølling–Allerød. Interestingly, speleothem δ18O also record this major excursion as less negative values. Together, our results suggest a major decrease in precipitation likely related to a weakening of the SAMS. We further compared our results with the output of the SYNTRACE run of CCSM3 fully coupled climate model with transient forcing for the last deglaciation. Geochemical records and model output show a very good coupling and suggest that the eastern Brazil experienced the driest period of the whole last deglaciation during the Bølling–Allerød and this dry spell was indeed related to a decreased SAMS intensity.",

            "abstract": "Balancing the sea-level budget is critical to understanding recent and future climate change as well as balancing Earth's energy budget and water budget. During the last decade, advancements in the ocean observing system — satellite altimeters, hydrographic profiling floats, and space-based gravity missions — have allowed the global mean sea level budget to?be assessed with unprecedented accuracy from direct, rather than inferred, estimates. In particular, several recent studies have used the sea-level budget to bound the rate of deep ocean warming [e.g. Llovel et al. 2014].\nOn a monthly basis, the sum of the steric component estimated from Argo and the ocean mass (barostatic) component from GRACE agree total sea level from Jason within the estimated uncertainties with the residual difference having an r.m.s. of less than 2 mm [Leuliette 2014]. Direct measurements of ocean warming above 2000 m depth during January 2005 and July 2015 explain about one-third of the observed annual rate of global mean sea-level rise.\nExtending the understanding of the sea-level budget from global mean sea level to regional patterns of sea level change is crucial for identifying regional differences in recent sea level change. The local sea-level budget can be used to identify any systematic errors in the global ocean observing system. Using the residuals from closing the sea level budget, we demonstrate that systematic regional errors remain, in part due to Argo sampling. We also show the effect of applying revised geocentric pole-tide corrections for GRACE [Wahr et al. 2015] and altimetry [Desai et al., 2015].",

Flux ropes are helical magnetic structures created by multiple X-line reconnection in the tail current sheet in the presence of a guide field in the east – west direction. Many numerical simulations predict that the formation of small flux ropes, referred to as secondary islands, takes place as reconnection transitions from the slow Sweet-Parker mode to fast reconnection with inertial scale neutral points. High time resolution MMS magnetic and electric fields measurements are near ideal for the investigation of secondary island - type flux ropes carried Earthward from downstream reconnnection sites, as well as their interaction with the strong dipolar magnetic fields of the inner magnetosphere.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the late Pleistocene have been characterized from ancient air bubbles trapped within polar ice sheets. Ice-core records clearly demonstrate the glacial-interglacial relationship between the global carbon cycle and climate, but they are so far limited to the last 800 ky, when glacial cycles occurred approximately every 100-ky. Boron isotope ratios (δ11B) recorded in the tests of fossil planktic foraminifera offer an opportunity to extend the atmospheric pCO2 record into the early Pleistocene, when glacial cycles instead occurred approximately every 41-ky. We present a new high-resolution record of planktic foraminiferal d11B, Mg/Ca (a sea surface temperature proxy) and salinity estimates from the deconvolution of δ18O and Mg/Ca. Combined with reasonable assumptions of ocean alkalinity, these data allow us to estimate pCO2 over three of the 41-ky climate cycles at ~1.5 Ma. Our results confirm the hypothesis that climate and atmospheric pCO2 were coupled beyond ice core records and provide new constraints for studies of long-term CO2 storage and release, regional controls on the early Pleistocene carbon cycle, and estimating climate sensitivity before the mid-Pleistocene transition.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of iron isotopes in the deep Earth is of great importance, for it provides clues for determining the history of planetary differentiation and core formation, as well as the origin of the Earth. However, iron isotope composition of the Earth’s interior is rarely known due to lack of samples. Previous theoretical and experimental results are insufficient because they presume the spin state of iron or they are based on relatively low quality experimental data. Here we will use a newly developed technique --NRIXS(Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering)-- to measure the force constant of lower mantle mineral candidates ferropericlase and pervoskite at relevant pressure. A reliable iron isotope fractionation factor will then be derived using SciPhon, which is a software designed specifically for the isotope fractionation factor derivation from NRIXS data.\nWe report new high pressure 57Fe NRIXS spectra collected at beamline 3 ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source, with the aim to understand the pressure effect on iron isotope fractionation. The experiments were conducted using a 3-fold Diamond Anvil Cell and a >95% 57Fe enriched sample fp25((Fe0.25Mg0.75)O). NRIXS spectra were collected by tuning the x-ray energy range within ± 200meV around the 57Fe resonant energy of 14.4125keV. We will present the force constants and derived iron isotope fractionation factors of ferropericlase. It is expected that pressure will have an effect on the iron isotope fractionation factor and should be taken into account when modeling isotope fractionation of planetary scale and when using iron isotope systems to constrain the planetary differentiation.\nWe will also use first-principle studies and geochemical observations to study the Fe,O,Si isotope system in the deep Earth. Our ultimate goal is to build a self-consistent geophysical and geochemical model that can be used in deciphering the mystery of Earth’s history.",

            "abstract": "We employ a 3D methane hydrate reservoir simulator to model marine methane hydrate systems. Our simulator couples highly nonlinear heat and mass transport equations and includes heterogeneous sedimentation, in-situ organic methanogenesis, and the influences of both pore size contrast and salt exclusion from the hydrate phase on solubility gradients. Using environmental parameters of Walker Ridge, Gulf of Mexico, we first simulate hydrate formation in and around a thin, dipping, planar sand stratum surrounded by clay lithology as it is buried to 295mbsf. With sufficient methane supplied by methanogenesis in the clays, a 200x sand-clay pore size contrast allows for a strong enough concentration gradient to significantly drop the concentration of hydrate in clays immediately surrounding a thin sand, a phenomenon observed in corresponding well log data. Building upon previous work, our simulations account for a depth-wise increase in sand-clay solubility contrast from about 1.6% near the seafloor to 8.6% at depth, progressively strengthening the diffusive flux of methane with time. An exponentially decaying methanogenesis input to the clay lithology decreases the methane supplied to clays surrounding the sand layer with time, further enhancing the sand-clay hydrate saturation contrast. Significant diffusive methane transport occurs in a clay interval of about 11m above the sand and 4m below it, matching well log observations. Clay-sand pore size contrast alone is not enough to create hydrate-free zones seen in logs, because the corresponding diffusive methane flux is slower than the rate at which methanogenesis supplies methane. Therefore, it is likely that additional mechanisms are at play, notably bound water activity reduction in clays. Three-dimensionality allows for inclusion of lithologic heterogeneities, which focus flow and allow for heterogeneity in locally dominant methane migration mechanisms. Incorporating recent 3D seismic data to inform the model structure, we show that even with deep advective sourcing of methane, local hydrate accumulations can be sourced advectively or diffusively. Advectively sourced hydrates accumulate evenly in highly permeable strata, while diffusively sourced hydrates are characterized by thin strata-bound intervals of high clay-sand pore size contrasts.",

            "abstract": "Modeling aquifer heterogeneities (AH) is a complex, multidimensional problem that mostly requires stochastic imaging strategies for tractability. While the traditional Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) provides a powerful framework to model AH, the generic McMC is computationally prohibitive and, thus, unappealing for large-scale problems. An innovative variant of the McMC scheme that imposes priori spatial statistical constraints on model parameter updates, for improved characterization in a computationally efficient manner is proposed.\nThe proposed algorithm (PA) is based on Markov random field (MRF) modeling, which is an image processing technique that infers the global behavior of a random field from its local properties, making the MRF approach well suited for imaging AH. MRF-based modeling leverages the equivalence of Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution (GD) and MRF to identify the local properties of an MRF in terms of the easily quantifiable Gibbs energy. The PA employs the two-step approach to model the lithological structure of the aquifer and the hydraulic properties within the identified lithologies simultaneously. It performs local Gibbs energy minimizations along a random path, which requires parameters of the GD (spatial statistics) to be specified. A PA that implicitly infers site-specific GD parameters within a Bayesian framework is also presented.\nThe PA is illustrated with a synthetic binary facies aquifer with a lognormal heterogeneity simulated within each facies. GD parameters of 2.6, 1.2, -0.4, and -0.2 were estimated for the horizontal, vertical, NESW, and NWSE directions, respectively. Most of the high hydraulic conductivity zones (facies 2) were fairly resolved (see results below) with facies identification accuracy rate of 81%, 89%, and 90% for the inversions conditioned on concentration (R1), resistivity (R2), and joint (R3), respectively. The incorporation of the conditioning datasets improved on the root mean square error (RMSE) of an unconditionally randomly generated starting model by 65%, 77%, and 78% for R1, R2, and R3, respectively. The PA was also found to converge rapidly, requiring 1.3 hrs, 4.2 hrs, and 2.5 hrs of runtime, to invert R1, R2, and R3, respectively.

            "abstract": "Since the Pacific Decadal Oscillation's (PDO) identification in 1997, it has been widely used as a seasonal-forecasting and decision-making tool in Alaska. Gulf of Alaska sea surface temperatures have oscillated every few decades between warmer (positive PDO) and colder (negative PDO). In the historical record, there are two negative phases and two positive phases, but since 2000, the PDO has vacillated between warm and cold states annually. Recent inconsistencies in the phase of the PDO as well as its influence on climate have warranted further study of this climate phenomenon. Previous work found that strength and importance of the PDO teleconnections to temperature and precipitation varied widely over time in the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (v2) data and in CRU TS3.2.1. In light of the inherent problems with reanalyses and with gridded products in data-poor areas, it is necessary to examine individual station data to further understand the relationship of the PDO with climate in Alaska. This study examines temperature and precipitation data for individual stations across Alaska to determine the stability of PDO teleconnections. Individual station data were downloaded from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information GHCN-D database. For the months of January, February and March, stations with at least 90% complete data for all three months were selected. Using stations grouped according to the recently developed Alaska climate divisions, the stability of PDO teleconnections was analyzed in terms of station anomalies from the PRISM climatology. In many parts of the state, the relationship between the PDO and local climate was not as stable as expected. Even at individual stations, the strength and influence of the PDO was often inconsistent over time.",

            "abstract": "Most climate models project that precipitation will increase over the Arctic during the 21st century. This is viewed as a response to both increased atmospheric vapor flux convergence and loss of the sea ice cover which provides for local moisture sources. While observational evidence for increased precipitation is growing, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, especially given the sparse observational network, and strong impacts of low-frequency atmospheric variability. Here, we use station records from the National Climatic Data Center, The Norwegian Meteorological Institute and other national sources to examine the spatial characteristics of extreme daily precipitation events across the Arctic (the area poleward of 65 degrees N) and recent trends. The focus is on the period 1979-2014. Extreme events at each of the 145 stations selected for analysis are defined as those within the top 1% of their statistical distribution. The spatial distribution of the size of the 1% event broadly follows the spatial pattern of annual precipitation. For stations in Iceland, Svalbard and coastal Norway influenced by Atlantic moisture sources, the 1% event size ranges from 14 to 25 mm; recent work shows that these high-latitude events are often linked to atmospheric rivers. This contrasts sharply with polar desert sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and many locations along the Siberian coast, that, being removed from significant moisture sources, have values from 3-10 mm. When the Arctic region is assessed as a whole, the frequency of extreme events shows a slight positive trend over the study period. However, regional analyses, based on similarities between the size of the top 1% precipitation event, reveals areas of positive and negative trends that vary between region, season and month.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall induced landslides are one of the most frequent hazards on slanted terrains. They lead to great economic losses and fatalities worldwide. Most factors inducing shallow landslides are local and can only be mapped with high levels of uncertainty at larger scales. This work presents an attempt to determine slope instability at large scales. Buffer and threshold techniques are used to downscale areas and minimize uncertainties. Four static parameters (slope angle, soil type, land cover and elevation) for 261 shallow rainfall-induced landslides in the continental United States are examined. ASTER GDEM is used as bases for topographical characterization of slope and buffer analysis. Slope angle threshold assessment at the 50, 75, 95, 98, and 99 percentiles is tested locally. Further analysis of each threshold in relation to other parameters is investigated in a logistic regression environment for the continental U.S. It is determined that lower than 95-percentile thresholds under-estimate slope angles. Best regression fit can be achieved when utilizing the 99-threshold slope angle. This model predicts the highest number of cases correctly at 87.0% accuracy. A one-unit rise in the 99-threshold range increases landslide likelihood by 11.8%. The logistic regression model is carried over to ArcGIS where all variables are processed based on their corresponding coefficients. A regional slope instability map for the continental United States is created and analyzed against the available landslide records and their spatial distributions. It is expected that future inclusion of dynamic parameters like precipitation and other proxies like soil moisture into the model will further improve accuracy.",

            "abstract": "With nine years of retrievals, the CALIOP level 3 aerosol profile product provides an unprecedented synopsis of aerosol extinction in three dimensions and the potential to quantify changes in aerosol distributions over time. The CALIOP level 3 aerosol profile product, initially released as a beta product in 2011, reports monthly averages of quality-screened aerosol extinction profiles on a uniform latitude/longitude grid for different cloud-cover scenarios, called “sky conditions”. This presentation demonstrates improvements to the second version of the product which will be released in September 2015. The largest improvements are the new sky condition definitions which parse the atmosphere into “cloud-free” views accessible to passive remote sensors, “all-sky” views accessible to active remote sensors and “cloudy-sky” views for opaque and transparent clouds which were previously inaccessible to passive remote sensors. Taken together, the new sky conditions comprehensively summarize CALIOP aerosol extinction profiles for a broad range of scientific queries. In addition to dust-only extinction profiles, the new version will include polluted-dust and smoke-only extinction averages. A new method is adopted for averaging dust-only extinction profiles to reduce high biases which exist in the beta version of the level 3 aerosol profile product. This presentation justifies the new averaging methodology and demonstrates vertical profiles of dust and smoke extinction over Africa during the biomass burning season. Another crucial advancement demonstrated in this presentation is a new approach for computing monthly mean aerosol optical depth which removes low biases reported in the beta version - a scenario unique to lidar datasets.",

            "abstract": "Forest stands are dynamic in a status from severely, partially disturbed, or undisturbed to different stages of recovery towards maturity and equilibrium. Forest ecosystem models generally use potential biomass (an assumption of equilibrium status) as initial biomass, which is unrealistic and could result in unreliable estimates of disturbance-induced carbon changes. To accurately estimate spatiotemporal changes of forest carbon stock and fluxes, it requires accurate information on initial biomass, the extent and severity of disturbance, and following land use. We demonstrate a prototype system to achieve this goal by integrating 1-m small footprint Lidar acquired in year 2004, 30-m Landsat disturbances from 1984 to 2011, and an individual-based structure height Ecosystem Demography (ED) model. Lidar provides critical information on forest canopy height, improving the accuracy of initial forest biomass estimates; impervious surfaces data and yearly disturbance data from Landsat provide information on wall-to-wall yearly natural and anthropogenic disturbances and their severity (on average 0.32% for the natural and 0.19% for the anthropogenic for below test area); ED model plays a central role by linking both Lidar canopy height and Landsat disturbances with ecosystem processes. We tested the system at 90-m spatial resolution in Charles County, Maryland, by running ED model for six experiments, the combinations of three initial biomass (potential, moderate and low initial biomass constrained by Lidar canopy height) with two disturbance scenarios (with and without anthropogenic disturbances). Our experiments show that estimated changes of carbon stock and flux are sensitive to initial biomass status and human-induced land cover change. Our prototype system can assess regional carbon dynamics at local scale under changing climate and disturbance regimes, and provide useful information for forest management and land use policies.",

Prior to launch, MABEL serves as an airborne implementation for testing and algorithm development. Thus far, acquired data sets include flights over Arctic sea ice from the spring and summer: one in April 2012 (north of the Arctic coast of Greenland, and the other in the East Greenland Sea) and the other in July 2014 (Beaufort Sea). Here, we briefly describe the phenomenology of photon distributions in the sea ice returns and our approach for finding the heights of the ice and water surfaces, and the achievable height precision is discussed. Retrieved surface heights over relatively flat leads in the ice cover suggest that precisions of several centimeters are attainable. Comparisons of nearly coincident elevation profiles from MABEL with those acquired by an analog lidar show good agreement. Discrimination of ice and open water, a crucial step in the determination of sea ice freeboard and the estimation of ice thickness, is facilitated by contrasts in the observed signal/background photon statistics.",

            "abstract": "We review the distribution of modern-day seafloor hydrothermal activity along the global mid-ocean ridge crest (MOR) and the mineral deposits being formed at those sites. To date, one form of hydrothermal activity – “black smoker” venting – has been prospected for along >30% of the global mid ocean ridge crest and some important trends have emerged. Submarine venting can occur along all mid-ocean ridges, of all spreading rates, in all ocean basins. While the abundance of currently active venting (from water column signals), scales linearly with seafloor spreading rate (a proxy for magmatic heat-flux) there is an “excess” of high temperature venting along slow and ultra-slow spreading ridges when compared to early predictions. Consistent with this, no more than half of the sites responsible for “black smoker” plume signals along the slow spreading Mid Atlantic Ridge are associated with magmatic systems with the other half hosted under tectonic control. The latter appear both to be longer-lived than, and to give rise to much larger sulfide deposits than, their magmatic counterparts - presumably as a result of sustained fluid flow. Where these tectonic-hosted systems also involve water-rock interaction with ultramafic sources, seafloor massive sulfide deposits exhibit highly concentrated Cu and Au in surface samples (>10wt.% average Cu content and >3ppm average Au). Intriguingly, first detailed examinations of hydrothermally active sites along ultraslow-spreading ridges seems to indicate that they may depart beyond the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge pattern. Hydrothermal plume distributions may follow the same (~50:50) distribution of “black smoker” plume signals between magmatic and tectonics settings, but the first three “black smoker” sites tracked to source have all revealed large polymetallic sulfide deposits - in both magmatic as well as tectonic settings. Could ultra-slow ridges represent the richest mineral resource potential along the global MOR?",

In this study, we use ground-based measurements to investigate the mechanism by which soil moisture anomalies affect clouds and precipitation. From decade-long warm season observation by Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement at Southern Great Plains, we carefully select daytime weather regimes that are strongly coupled with land-surface processes such as clear-sky dry convection days, forced and active non-precipitating shallow cumuli days, and late-afternoon deep convective raining days (Zhang and Klein, 2010 and 2013). Based on this framework, we statistically assess: 1) the differences in soil moisture and surface heterogeneity between different convective regimes; and 2) the variances of the associated effects on surface and boundary layer meteorological conditions inside each convective regime. A specific question will be: under different soil moisture conditions, e.g. wet/dry, which convective weather regime will be favored and how this is related to large-scale environmental factors, such as free-troposphere stability and humidity? The answer to this question will improve our understanding of how soil moisture impacts boundary layer turbulence and thermodynamics, and influences the convection triggering and maintenance and their feedbacks on soil moisture, thus establish a link between soil moisture and convection at the process level.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Earth experienced several large impacts during its early evolution. Most likely these impacts led to the formation of one- or more magma oceans. Differentiation processes in such a magma ocean are important, since they set the stage for structure and the dynamics of the mantle. Differentiation in a magma ocean was clearly influenced by vigorous convection. Further, differentiation was possibly influenced by rotation, given the low viscosity of the molten magma and especially since the Early Earth was rotating much faster than today. In order to study the influence of rotation on the crystallization of a magma ocean, we developed a 3D model in Cartesian geometry, allowing for the simulation of silicate crystals in a vigorously convection flow, at low Prandtl number under strong rotation. A discrete element approach is employed to simulate the crystal behavior. The results show a crucial dependence of the dynamics on crystal density, rotation rate and latitude. At the pole, convection dominates at low rotation, keeping al large fraction of particles in suspension. Increasing rotation weakens convection and thus many particles settle at the bottom and form a stably stratified layer. Differently a the equator all particles settle at the bottom at low rotation, they form a layer of significant thickness with increasing rotation rate, and at highest rotation rate they are kept in suspension and form a layer at mid depth of the magma ocean. Due to Coriolis forces crystals of different densities separate from each other. At a given rotation rate lighter particles settle at the bottom while denser particles accumulate at mid depth. This results in an unstably stratified mantle in the equatorial region after magma ocean solidification. Thus rotation can lead to asymmetric crystallization of the magma ocean with an opposite layering in the polar- and equatorial region. This basically can explain the existence of local magma ocean at the core mantle boundary and the existence of mantle heterogeneities as relic structures originating from magma ocean crystallization.",

It is hypothesized that the recent massive growth of shale gas exploitation in North America could be the source of this change. However, state-of-the-science chemical transport models are currently unable to reproduce the hemispheric burden of C2H6 or the recent sharp increase, pointing to a potential problem with current emission inventories. To resolve this, we used space-borne CH4 observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to derive C2H6 emissions. By using known emission ratios to CH4, we estimated emissions of C2H6 from oil and gas activities, biofuels, and biomass burning over North America. The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model was used to simulate atmospheric abundances of C2H6 with the new emissions estimates. The model is able to reproduce Northern Hemisphere surface concentrations. However, the model significantly under-predicts the amount of C2H6 throughout the column and the observed Northern Hemispheric gradient as diagnosed by comparisons to aircraft observations from the Hiaper Pole-to-Pole (HIPPO) Campaign.",

(2011) provided evidence of a strong dipolar induction signature in Galileo’s magnetometer data from four different flybys. They further showed that the signal is consistent with electromagnetic induction from large amounts of rock-melts in the asthenosphere of Io. Modeling showed that the induction response from a completely solid mantle model is inadequate to explain the magnetometer observations. However, a layer of asthenosphere >50 km in thickness with a melt fraction ≥20% is adequate to accurately match the observed magnetic field.\nHere we summarize our current knowledge of Io’s interior from Galileo’s induction measurements, and then outline a scheme to further infer properties of Io’s interior, especially its internal temperature profile, by marrying the principles of thermodynamics with those of electromagnetism. In particular, we obtain guidance on stable mineral phases and their physical properties (such as density, melt state and electrical conductivity) from thermodynamic principles, whereas guidance on how the resulting internal conductivity profile affects the magnetic environment around Io is obtained from electromagnetic theory. We also explore how induction measurements can be obtained at multiple frequencies from a future mission and be used to constrain both the location and the thickness of the magma ocean.\nFinally, we explore the consequences of the global magma ocean on Io’s physical properties such as the current sites of tidal energy dissipation, the absence of an internal magnetic field and a lack of plate tectonics on its surface.",

            "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved in approximating snowflakes and ice-cloud particles by increasingly more realistic and detailed shape models and in calculating associated scattering properties crucial to snowfall remote sensing. The applied approximations of the snowflake microstructure applied for the scattering calculations, however, are still based on few available field measurement data, often integrated over many individual snow storms, and only include several microstructural properties that cannot fully capture the natural variability during snowfall, e.g. different degrees of riming or aggregate snowflakes formed from more than one distinct ice crystal habit. In this study, (i) the natural variability of key microstructural properties during snowfall is quantified for individual snow storms based on high-resolution multi-view snowflake imaging data collected with the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) at Alta ski area (Alta, UT), and (ii) the corresponding variability in snowflake scattering properties is calculated. In addition to snowflake size, orientation and aspect ratio, 'particle complexity' (specifying snowflake perimeter and brightness variations in the MASC snowflake images) is included in the presented approach, yielding a quantitative and objective measure of characteristic snowflake microstructure, including crystal habit and degree of riming, important for realistically modelling snowfall scattering properties. The aim is to present an analysis of the impact of the observed natural microstructural variability on the derived snowflake scattering properties and ultimately on the snowfall radar reflectivity integrated over the obtained variability of snowflake microstructure and scattering properties.",

Each iteration provided new features, improved performance, and usability enhancements. This development approach positioned the application to be integral to the structural design process and is now used to produce over 1800 reports daily.\nRecent efforts have enhanced the application to be a data-driven, mobile-first, responsive web application.

            "abstract": "Unconventional gas production from the Marcellus shale has proliferated in the past decade, raising concerns regarding impacts on fresh groundwater resources. Methane contamination of shallow groundwater can result from faulty seals on gas production wells or migration of methane along fractures during well development. Characterizing such contamination is of particular concern in the rural Marcellus shale region, where the water supply is primarily private, domestic wells and methane occurs naturally in shallow groundwater. High volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) is currently used to produce gas in all states overlying the Marcellus shale, with the exception of New York (NY), where HVHF is permanently banned. Given the similar regional geology, climate, and land use across areas underlain by the Marcellus, studies of methane occurrence in domestic wells in NY are representative of methane occurrence prior to HVHF in an area with conventional gas production. We measured methane concentrations in 137 domestic wells across 5 counties in southern NY covering an area of 10,230 km2. For each well, we determined the topographic position (valley or upland), the geologic unit of water extraction, the chemical water type, and distances to the nearest fault, lineament, and active or other conventional gas well. Methane concentrations in domestic wells were not significantly different between geologic units of extraction, nor did they correlate with distances to faults, lineaments, or gas wells. Methane concentrations did differ between valleys and uplands, but the significance of such differences varied based on the method of classification. Methane concentrations were significantly different between water types; Na-HCO3 waters had significantly higher methane concentrations than Ca-HCO3 waters (median values of 0.78 and 0.002 mg/L, respectively). Combining methane and water quality data from this study and other prior studies in NY and Pennsylvania (n=724), we found that although only 7.7% of domestic wells had >1 mg/L dissolved methane, 52% of valley wells producing Na-rich water had >1 mg/L dissolved methane. Our results suggest high methane concentrations in valley wells producing Na-rich water are likely to be naturally occurring, rather than the result of gas production by HVHF.",

            "abstract": "Soils are a crucial component of the global carbon (C) cycle, representing a highly dynamic and large reservoir of C stored as soil organic matter (SOM). An important control on SOM residence time is microbial mineralization. While the impact of climactic and site-specific constraints on SOM mineralization rates are recognized, the role of oxygen limitations remains elusive. If oxygen consumption (via heterotrophic respiration) outpaces supply (via diffusion), anaerobic microsites can occur even within seemingly well-aerated upland soils. Under anaerobic conditions, SOM mineralization rates are expected to be slower due to metabolic constraints on microbial C oxidation. Process-based C cycling models have begun to incorporate the inhibiting effect of oxygen limitations by estimating anaerobic pore volume. However, such model predictions still lack experimental validation and research on environmental controls thus far has largely been focused on soil moisture.\nHere we aimed to determine the extent of anaerobic microsites within seemingly well-aerated upland soils experimentally and identify whether texture, SOM content, and microbial biomass can act as useful predictors in modeling frameworks. To this end, we monitored oxygen dynamics in soils spanning natural and artificial gradients in texture, SOM content and microbial biomass. Anaerobic microsites was visualized using a planar optode imaging system. Oxygen consumption rates were determined using gas chromatography, while oxygen diffusion rates were estimated based on porosity and pore-size distribution quantified by x-ray microtomography.\nOur results show that bulk oxygen concentrations ranged from 70% to as low as 20% saturation. However, all soils showed substantial micro-scale variability in oxygen concentrations, leading to the formation of anaerobic microsites even at modest moisture content. The extent of anaerobic microsites correlated with an overall reduction in SOM mineralization rates, and depended on the interactive effect of texture-imposed diffusion limitations and the amount of bioavailable SOM driving oxygen consumption. Based on these results, a numerical model is presented to predict the extent of anaerobic microsites in a specific soil system using texture, SOM content and microbial biomass information.",

            "abstract": "Several new observations provide evidence that water may play a more important role in tectonism than previously realized. Among these,\n• Thermodynamical modeling suggests that hydration promotes crustal mineral assemblages with lowered vP/vS and decreased density. This sheds new light on the significance of low crustal vP/vS measured in the western U.S. Cordillera from joint inversion of EarthScope USArray receiver functions and gravity. vP/vS, previously interpreted in terms of quartz abundance, is strikingly low throughout the highest-elevation regions of the western Cordillera.\n• Rheological modeling of flexural rigidity measurements also can be used to map water variations, primarily in the uppermost mantle. Mantle hydration estimated from flexural rigidity exhibits very similar spatial distribution to crustal hydration inferred from vP/vS, with the notable exception that the Wyoming craton has dry mantle lithosphere but a hydrous crust.\n• In hydrated lithosphere of the high-elevation western U.S. Cordillera, Moho temperatures estimated from Pn velocities are systematically colder than predictions by simple geothermal models of surface heat flow. These differences can only be reconciled by invoking a previously unrecognized advective term in the deep thermal transfer.\n• New and improved estimates of magnetic bottom are much deeper than the depth of the magnetite Curie temperature in some apparently hydrous lithosphere (notably, east of the Siletzia accreted terrane). This may indicate exotic magnetic mineralogies thought to occur only under hydrous conditions.\nLithospheric hydration may be driven either by dehydration of subducted slab or by entrainment of water into upwellings passing through the mantle transition zone. Conceptualizing hydration as a large-scale process accompanied by increased buoyancy and decreased ductile strength, coupled with widespread changes in mineralogy, mass and energy transfer may help to illuminate many otherwise enigmatic processes of uplift and strain.",

            "abstract": "In the Arctic, single-layer mixed-phase clouds rooted in the boundary layer with cloud top heights between several hundred meters and 2 km are frequently observed. Ice particles grow fast in these mixed-phase clouds and thus produce solid precipitation. Understanding the water cycle in the Arctic region requires an extensive study of the precipitation properties of the Arctic single-layer mixed-phase clouds.\nThe US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility at Barrow, North Slope of Alaska conducts long-term measurements of mixed-phase clouds using a combination of active and passive sensors. Using the data of 35-GHz (Ka-band) zenith pointing radar (KAZR), ceilometer, and microwave radiometer, 1-hour averaged estimates of mixed-phase clouds are produced. A total of 553 hours of single-layer mixed-phase clouds were visually identified between October 2011 and December 2014.\nUsing the KAZR radar reflectivity measured just one radar range gate (30 m) below the liquid base of the mixed-phase, ice water content (IWC) estimates are derived. The correlation between the hourly-mean liquid water path (LWP) and IWC below the base is not high. On the other hand, the KAZR mean Doppler velocity (Vd) at the same level exhibits high correlation with the LWP. In the LWP regime above 220 g m-2, Vd is larger than 1.0 m s-1. Vd approached to 1.8 m s-1 at even higher LWP values. We assumed that the 1-hour averaged Vd values are representative of the reflectivity-weighted mean terminal velocity of the ice particles. The large terminal velocities cannot be explained if the ice particles grow only via the deposition process. It is suggested that the riming process contributed to the growth of the particles when large terminal velocities are observed. The correlation between LWP and the KAZR Vd near the surface is similarly high. From high correlations between LWP and Vd near the cloud base and near the surface, it is clear that the LWP exhibits some control over the precipitating ice mass flux. The observed relationships will provide constrains to numerical simulations of mixed-phase clouds.",

However, the physical state of the aerosol influences the kinetics of this reaction; liquid particles with a high diffusion coefficient are expected to be well mixed and homogenously oxidized, while oxidation of solid, diffusion-limited aerosol is expected to occur primarily on the surface, creating steep chemical gradients within the particle. We are working to develop several new techniques to study the heterogeneous oxidation of different types of aerosol.\nWe are developing a “modular” electrodynamic balance (EDB) that will enable us to study heterogeneous oxidation at aqueous interfaces using a mass-spectrometer (and potentially other detection techniques). Using a direct analysis in real time (DART) interface, preliminary droplet train measurements have demonstrated single-droplet mass spectrometry to be possible. With long reaction times in our EDB, we will be able to study heterogeneous oxidation of a wide variety of organic species in aqueous droplets.\nAdditionally, we are working to use aerosol photoemission and velocity map imaging (VMI) to study the surface of aerosol particles as they undergo heterogeneous oxidation. With VMI, we’re able to collect electrons with a 4π collection efficiency over conventional electron energy analyzers. Preliminary results looking at the ozonolysis of squalene using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) show that heterogeneous oxidation kinetic data can be extracted from photoelectron spectra. By moving to X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), we will determine elemental and chemical composition of the aerosol surface. Thus, aerosol XPS will provide information on the steep chemical gradients that form as diffusion-limited aerosol undergo heterogeneous oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Grounding zones where grounded ice sheets transition to floating ice shelves, are the primary gateways through which the Antarctic Ice Sheet loses mass to the ocean. In these environments, ice, ocean, meltwater and sediment meet and interact, influencing both the ice sheet and ocean circulation beneath the ice shelf. Here, we report on conditions near the grounding zone of the Whillans Ice Stream, which feeds into the Ross Ice Shelf. Cameras and instruments lowered through an access borehole to the ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf found a 10m-thick water column comprising an upper layer of colder ice shelf water formed from mixing between meltwater with the lower layer of warmer higher salinity shelf water. This style of stratification is typical of large ice shelves, but it was uncertain whether it existed so near the grounding zone, where stronger tidal currents and/or strong subglacial stream discharges could mix the water column. Salinity and temperature of the water suggest it formed from sea ice production in the Western Ross Sea, with minimal modification beneath the ice shelf. This source region is distinct from waters previously observed at the nearby J-9 borehole, illustrating the importance of the sub-ice shelf bathymetry in steering circulation between the ocean and the grounding zone. Preliminary data suggest an active exchange of heat and nutrients between the grounding zone and the open ocean, despite being separated by 600km. Thus life found near the grounding line is probably not an isolated oasis, but may instead be part of a much broader ecosystem that spans the ice shelf. Although sea ice formation presently maintains water in the sub-ice shelf cavity near the surface freezing point, buffering many larger ice shelves from gradual ocean warming, these findings suggest that even grounding zones of extensive ice shelves may respond quickly to abrupt changes in ocean circulation, such as that observed in the Amundsen Sea.",

            "abstract": "Rapid changes in ecosystem states have occurred naturally throughout Earth’s history. However, environmental changes that have taken place since the start of the Anthropocene may be destabilizing ecosystems and increasing the frequency of regime shifts in response to abrupt changes in external drivers or local intrinsic dynamics. To evaluate the relative influence of these forcers and improve our understanding of the impact of future change, we examined the effects of historical catchment phosphorus loading associated with agricultural land use on lake ecosystems, and whether this caused a shift from a stable, clear-water, regime to a turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated, state. The sedimentary pigments, diatom, and zooplankton (Cladocera) records from a currently clear-water shallow lake (Roxton Pond) and a turbid-water shallow lake (Petit lac Saint-François; PSF) were examined to determine if a cyanobacteria associated pigment (i.e. echinenone) showed an abrupt non-linear response to continued historical phosphorus load index (determined by phosphorus budget) over the last ~100 years. While PSF lake is presently in the turbid-water state, pigment and diatom analyses indicated that both lakes were once in the clear-water state, and that non-linear increases in catchment phosphorus balance resulted in an abrupt transition to cyanobacteria dominated states in each record. These results show that phosphorus loading has resulted in state shifts in shallow lake ecosystems that has been recorded across multiple paleolimnological indicators preserved in the sedimentary record.",

            "abstract": "Profound changes have been occurring in the Arctic. The most significant change is the rapid decline of sea ice coverage and thickness over past several decades. The observed reduction in Arctic sea ice is a consequence of both thermodynamic and dynamic processes, including such factors as preconditioning of the ice cover, changes in cloud coverage, ice export, advection of ocean heat, and ice-albedo feedback. Many crucially interactive physical processes occur in the Arctic boundary layers, where energy exchange at the interface is critical for sea ice evolution and clouds strongly interact with sea ice through radiation and turbulence. Our ability of understanding the Arctic boundary layer and modeling its temporal evolution and spatial distribution is essential to understanding the Arctic climate change.\nThis study presents a regional simulation study of summer Arctic boundary layers. The analysis includes an evaluation of the simulations during the ASCOS (Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study) field campaign; it also examines the model ability to simulate some key boundary layer structures observed during ASCOS. COAMPS (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System) is used in this study. ACNFS (Arctic Cap Nowcast/Forecast System) is used to provide sea ice conditions, including sea ice temperature and concentration, to COAMPS. An advanced surface layer parameterization based on SHEBA data is implemented to provide turbulent fluxes at the surface. The simulation domain is configured to contain four grid meshes (45 km, 15 km, 5km and 1.67 km) with 60 levels in the vertical. The model provides 24 h twice daily simulations between August 1 and September 6. Observations from ASCOS are used to evaluate simulations results with a focus on the turbulent and cloud structure of boundary layer. Compared with observations, the boundary layer (BL) warming/cooling and moistening/drying periods are generally well simulated. The model simulations can represent the basic features such as well-mixed and decoupled BL structures. The observed moisture inversion is, however, poorly represented. Simple single column COAMPS simulations suggest that the moisture inversion may contribute to the development of the BL decoupled structure. Detailed analyses will be presented in the AGU fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Relativistic Proton Spectrometer (RPS) aboard the Van Allen Probes spacecraft is designed to measure protons from about 60 MeV to multiple GeV, but it is also sensitive to electrons above several MeV. Its Cherenkov subsystem provides energy resolution for protons above a few hundred MeV, and electrons at extremely high energies, around 50 MeV and above, can also produce high levels of Cherenkov light.\nWhile mapping protons in the inner Van Allen Belt with RPS, Mazur et al. (Fall 2014 AGU meeting, paper SM22A-02) observed a concentration of particle events around L = 2 with Cherenkov light corresponding to protons at energies well above the limit for stable trapping there. We present a preliminary analysis that shows that the patterns of the Cherenkov light distribution are consistent with these particle events instead being caused by electrons at energies of at least several tens of MeV. This energy range is well above that expected from magnetospheric energization, even by a violent event like the March 1991 shock, which injected electrons peaked around 15 MeV (Looper et al., GRL 1994, doi:10.1029/94GL01586). We discuss the possibility that these electrons are instead due to the decay of pions and muons produced by cosmic-ray interactions with the atmosphere, with a characteristic energy set by the pion rest mass of 140 MeV.",

            "abstract": "We characterize the temporal variability of ambient noise wavefield and search for velocity changes associated with activities of the geothermal energy development at the Salton Sea Geothermal Field. The noise cross-correlations (NCFs) are computed for ~6 years of continuous three-component seismic data (December 2007 through January 2014) collected at 8 sites from the CalEnergy Subnetwork (EN network) with MSNoise software (Lecocq et al., 2014, SRL). All seismic data are downloaded from the Southern California Earthquake Data Center. Velocity changes (dv/v) are obtained by measuring time delay between 5-day stacks of NCFs and the reference NCF (average over the entire 6 year period). The time history of dv/v is determined by averaging dv/v measurements over all station/channel pairs (252 combinations). Our preliminary dv/v measurement suggests a gradual increase in dv/v over the 6-year period in a frequency range of 0.5-8.0 Hz. The resultant increase rate of velocity is about 0.01%/year. We also explore the frequency-dependent velocity change at the 5 different frequency bands (0.5-2.0 Hz, 0.75-3.0 Hz, 1.0-4.0 Hz, 1.5-6.0 Hz, and 2.0-8.0 Hz) and find that the level of this long-term dv/v variability is increased with increase of frequency (i.e., the highest increase rate of ~0.15%/year at the 0.5-2.0 Hz band). This result suggests that the velocity changes were mostly occurred in a depth of ~500 m assuming that the coda parts of NCFs (~10-40 s depending on station distances) are predominantly composed of scattered surface waves, with the SoCal velocity model (Dreger and Helmberger, 1993, JGR). No clear seasonal variation of dv/v is observed in the frequency band of 0.5-8.0 Hz.",

            "abstract": "Grasses in rangeland ecosystems cover a large portion of the contiguous United States and are used to support the production of livestock. These grasslands experience a wide range of precipitation and temperature regimes, as well as management activities like grazing. Assessing the coupled response of biomass to both climatic change and human activities is important to decision makers to ensure the sustainable management of their lands. The objective of this study is to examine the sensitivity of biomass under co-varying conditions of climate and grazing management.\nFor this, we used the Regional Hydro-ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys), a physically-based model that simulates coupled water and biogeochemical processes. We selected representative grassland sites using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system and information on major grass species. Historical data on precipitation, temperature, and grazing patterns (intensity, frequency, duration) were incrementally perturbed to simulate climatic change and possible changes in management. To visualize this multi-dimensional parameter space, we created surface response plots of varying climate and grazing factors for the mean and variance of both aboveground and belowground biomass, as well as the ratio between the two.\nMean biomass generally increased with warmer temperatures and decreased with more intense grazing. The sensitivity of biomass (i.e. variance) increased with more extreme perturbations in climate and intense types of grazing management. However, co-varying climate conditions with either grazing intensity, frequency, or duration revealed different biomass responses and tradeoffs. For example, some changes in grazing duration could be reversed by changes in climate. Effects of high intensity grazing could be buffered depending on the timing of grazing (i.e. start/end date). Using simple perturbations with process-based modeling provides useful information for land managers for future planning.",

            "abstract": "Ancient subducted tectonic plates have been observed in past seismic images of the mantle beneath North America and Eurasia including some that subducted before the end of the Mesozoic Era. It is likely that other ancient slab structures have remained largely hidden, particularly in the seismic-data-limited regions beneath the vast oceans in the southern hemisphere. Here we present a new global tomographic image, which shows a slab-like structure beneath the southern Indian Ocean with coherency from the upper mantle transition zone to the core-mantle boundary region – with striking similarities to past and current images of the Farallon slab. Based on the image and additional geoscientific observations, we postulate that the structure is an oceanic plate that sank into the mantle along a 7000-km intra-oceanic subduction zone that migrated southwestward across the ancient Tethys Ocean in the Mesozoic Era, perhaps beginning prior to 200 Ma. Slab material still trapped in the transition zone is positioned near the former edge of East Gondwana ca. 140 Ma suggesting that subduction terminated near the margin of the ancient continent prior to breakup and subsequent dispersal of its subcontinents. If our interpretation is correct, the slab likely represents the first of its kind with extensive transition zone stagnation (exceeding 100 million years) followed by eventual penetration into the lower mantle. It suggests that some slabs may sink through the mantle much slower than previously believed and may reside intact in the shallow mantle if left undisturbed by subsequent subduction episodes. We postulate other dynamic mechanisms that may be involved and a potential link to Indian Ocean MORB chemistry.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "The wetlands of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska are important breeding areas for geese and are experiencing rapid climate change, specifically earlier onset of the growing season. Consequently, geese arrive 'later' in the growing season than in the past, potentially setting up a phenological mismatch with consequences for their nutrition, plant growth, and C and N processes in the ecosystem. We examined the interactive effects between the start of the growing season and Black Brant arrival time on these processes in a manipulative experiment. Advancing the growing season had a modest influence on CO2 exchange and plant growth. An early growing season shifted the rate of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 1–1.5 µmol m-2 s-1 toward a carbon (C) source. This change was driven by an increase in the rate of ecosystem respiration (ER). The advanced growing season nearly doubled the rate of leaf elongation in the early summer and this difference persisted as taller vegetation later in the year; belowground biomass was not affected. Timing of grazing had greater influence on CO2 exchange and plant growth. Grazing early in the season shifted the system to a carbon source by ca. 2 µmol m-2 s-1 while delaying grazing enhanced the carbon sink by 1 µmol m-2 s-1. Here, the influence was not through ER, but through reducing and enhancing standing leaf area, respectively. Early grazing also reduced season-long root production by over 50% while delayed grazing enhanced root production by 30%. Although delaying grazing enhanced C uptake and promoted plant growth in this ecosystem, leaf tissue in delayed-grazing plots had C:N of 16.7 compared to 14.2 in the typical-grazing plots, potentially reducing the digestibility of goose forage and slowing rates of decomposition. Biotic forcing in arctic tundra can thus be major drivers of ecosystem function and need to be considered as tundra system respond to changing conditions.",

            "abstract": "The longest-wavelength and hemisphere asymmetric surface mass transport is characterized by three degree-one spherical harmonic components. Such mass transport modes cause geocenter motion between the center-of-mass of the total Earth system (CM) and the center-of-figure of the solid Earth surface (CF), and deforms the solid Earth. GRACE’s K-band ranging data system is not sensitive to these three variation modes. For a complete spherical harmonic spectral coverage of mass transport, degree-1 surface mass changes estimated through geocenter motion or degree-1 mass/deformation signatures from other space geodetic techniques should be combined with GRACE’s time-variable gravity data. The degree-1 coefficients are critically important for mass variation assessments over large regions. For example, 1 mm error in geocenter motion can result in an error of 190 gigatons of global oceanic water mass change or, equivalently, an error of 0.5 mm of global mean sea level change when the geocenter motion is converted to degree-1 mass and combined with GRACE data. Yet, several different methods of geocenter motion estimation differ in results by more than 1 mm in annual amplitude. These differences have to be resolved after 13 years of successful GRACE operation. Recently, the difference between results from direct satellite laser ranging (SLR) determination and from a global inversion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deformation measurements, GRACE, and an ocean bottom pressure (OBP) model has been largely reconciled as due to SLR’s sparse station distribution. This result and our current efforts to examine possible systematic errors in GNSS data and the OBP model will be discussed along with a future perspective.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic intrusions commonly occur in the rift zones of Kı̄lauea Volcano. Individual dike intrusions observed by geodetic methods are usually 5 to 10 km long, and can occur repeatedly in the same region. Five such intrusions in Kı̄lauea’s East Rift Zone, with inferred locations downrift of the bend where the NNW trending upper ERZ turns to the ENE trending ERZ, have occurred since the start of the ongoing ERZ eruption in 1983. The intrusions occur on one of two segments that correlate with seismic segments (Wright and Klein, USGS PP1806, 2014): Makaopuhi (1993 and 2007) and Nāpau (1983, 1997, and 2011). During each intrusion, the amount of dike opening was between 2 and 3 meters. Intrusions into the UERZ tend to be much smaller (~10 cm of dike opening) and occur more frequently. The time between ERZ intrusions for same-segment pairs are: 14.07 (1983-1997), 14.09 (1997-2011), and 13.95 (1993-2007) years, with the Nāpau segment becoming active about 3.5 years after the Makaopuhi segment in each case. The amount of modeled dike opening during each of these events roughly corresponds to the amount of seaward south flank motion and deep rift opening accumulated in the time between events, as was noted by Owen et al. (GRL, 2000) for the 1983 and 1997 intrusions. The recurrence interval of ~14 years appears to be unaffected by the magma surge of 2003-2007 (Poland et al., Nature, 2012), suggesting that flank motion, rather than magma supply, could be a controlling factor in the periodicity of intrusions.

The GRACE gravity mission provides an unprecedented global capability to monitor this important process with high accuracy and resolution. Accurate assessments of global mass transport patterns and budget also depend critically on changes in degree-1 coefficients (geocenter motion) and in Earth’s dynamic oblateness coefficient J2. We combine GRACE measurements, time series of GNSS data, JPL’s ECCO ocean bottom pressure model, and high-resolution loose a priori models of mass variation regimes to derive complete spherical harmonic spectra of detrended mass variations up to degree and order 180. Mass accelerations are estimated along with linear, annual, semiannual, and the 161-day tidal aliasing components from coefficient time series. The appropriateness of a priori information and estimate uncertainties are further evaluated by variance component estimation and residual statistics of fitting the time series. During the GRACE data period of 2002.2-2015.0, accelerations in mass transport are geographically uneven with significant positive or negative accelerations in various parts of the world. While Greenland and West Antarctica show strong accelerated mass losses, Alaska and the Arctic Ocean have significant positive accelerations with reversals of earlier mass loss trends. No evidence of non-Arctic global mean sea level acceleration due to mass has been found. Depending on region, some estimated accelerations are also not steady over time due to large irregular and interannual variations.",

            "abstract": "The Green-Ampt (GA) model has been widely used to estimate infiltration in many field applications due to its physically-based with simplicity and accuracy. The main objectives of this study are to (1) develop a modified Green-Ampt infiltration model for sloping layered soils (GASLS) and (2) investigate effective parameters of Green-Ampt model applicable to large-scale hydrologic and land-atmosphere simulations based on the developed GASLS. The GASLS model has extended the Green-Ampt equation to calculate the infiltration in layered soil profile for different slopes under constant ponding head. The model employs two assumptions: negligible flow caused by downslope component of gravity and instantaneous hydraulic equilibrium at layer interfaces. Cumulative vertical infiltration depth is obtained from GASLS model, which is used to determine the effective parameters and evaluate their performance. Essential in the effective parameters is to capture the infiltration process in the sloping layered soils by an equivalent homogeneous system (i.e. one layer homogeneous soil without sloping). Optimal sets of effective Green-Ampt parameters are determined by minimizing the root mean square errors of cumulative infiltration calculated from the discrepancy between the results from effective parameters and those from the GASLS. Performance of the effective parameters is investigated by comparing to results from the GASLS model using correlation coefficients under various scenarios of different sloping angles, layer formations, and ponding head depths. The effective parameters are also compared to the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean and geometric mean. The ability and potential of the three means as effective parameters in infiltration into sloping layered soils are then examined and discussed.",

These compounds are being discharged into the environment through treated wastewater or municipal sludge applications. The main goal of this study is determine their geochemical fate in natural soils. In this study we investigated sorption and transport behavior of diphenhydramine (DPH) and cetirizine (CTZ) in natural soils. These two commonly-used antihistamines are complex aromatic hydrocarbons with polar functional groups.\nTwo clean acidic soils (pH~4.5) were used for these studies – an A-horizon soil that had higher organic matter content (OM, 7.6%) and a B-horizon soil that had lower OM (1.6%), but higher clay content (5.1%). Sorption isotherms were measured using batch reactor experiments. Data indicated that sorption was nonlinear and that it was stronger in clay-rich soils. The pKa’s of DPH and CTZ are 8.98 and 8.27 respectively, i.e., these compounds are predominantly in cationic form at soil pH. In these forms, they preferentially sorb to negatively charged mineral surfaces (e.g., clay) present in the soils. Soil clay mineral characterization indicated that kaolinite was the dominant clay mineral present along with small amount of montmorillonite. The nonlinear sorption isotherms were fitted with Freundlich model.\nTransport behavior of both compounds was measured using glass chromatography columns. As expected both DPH and CTZ were strongly retained in the clay-rich soil as compared with OM-rich soil. The asymmetrical shape of the breakthrough curves indicated that there were likely two separate sorption sites in the soil, each with different reaction rates with each compound. A two-region advection-dispersion transport code was used to model the transport breakthrough curves. There was no evidence of transformation or degradation of the compounds during our sorption and transport studies.",

            "abstract": "Mechanistic model experiments will be presented, with the goal of understanding the excitation mechanism and interannual variability of the quasi two day wave (Q2DW) with zonal wavenumber 3. The model is initialized with the observed zonal mean structure of the atmosphere for austral summer solstice for various years. The summer jet contains regions that are baroclinically unstable, in which random wave excitation could stimulate unstable growth of the Q2DW, with rate and magnitude that depends on the variable mean state structure. Unstable modes do exist in linear inviscid model experiments, but they become marginally stable when the damping mechanisms of Newtonian cooling, eddy, and molecular diffusion are included in the model.\nIn nonlinear model simulations with no imposed wave forcing, synoptic waves spontaneously form off of the tropospheric jet structure, and the resulting waves weakly excite and maintain a Q2DW (along with other waves with the same phase speed with zonal wavenumbers 1-4). With the addition of a rich spectrum of waves forced by latent heating (derived from TRMM observations of rainfall rate), a robust Q2DW with amplitude similar to those observed is excited. The unstable regions in the mean flow still play a role in the ease to which QTDWs are excited: The QTDW first appears near the subtropical barotropically unstable region that is associated with the stratopause QTDW. EP flux of the mature QTDW emanates from the baroclinically unstable region in the midlatitude jet.\nFurther experiments, employing artificial local 2DW sources centered at various latitudes and altitudes, show that the QTDW is readily excited by any transient wave source with only moderate variation in efficiency. Furthermore, the amplitude and frequency of the QTDW does not strongly depend on which year the model is initialized. Thus a detailed understanding of the QTDW life cycle in a given year will depend on both the formation of the mean flow that will support resonant growth as well as the occurrence of a random wave event that will significantly excite it.",

SMAP has two instruments, a polarimetric radiometer and a multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar. Both instruments operate at L-band frequencies (~ 1GHz) and share a single 6-m rotating mesh antenna, producing a fixed incidence angle conical scan at 40⁰ across a 1000-km swath and a 2-3 day global revisit.\nThe SMAP SSS and ocean surface wind retrieval algorithm developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory leverages the QuikSCAT and Aquarius algorithms to account for the two-look geometry (fore and aft looks from the conical scan) and dual-polarization observations for simultaneous retrieval of SSS and wind speed. The retrieval algorithm has been applied to more than three months of SMAP radiometer data. Comparison with the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) wind speed suggests that the SMAP wind speed reaches an accuracy of about 0.7 ms-1. The preliminary assessment of the SMAP SSS products gridded at 50 km spatial resolution and weekly intervals is promising. The spatial patterns of the SSS agree well with climatological distributions, but exhibit several unique spatial and temporal features. The temporal evolutions of freshwater plumes from several major rivers, such as the Amazon, Niger, Congo, Ganges, and Mississippi, are all consistent with the timing of rainy and dry seasons, indicated in the SMAP’s soil moisture products. Rigorous accuracy assessment will be performed by comparison with in situ SSS data from buoys and ARGO floats. The SMAP evaluation products will be released to the public prior to November 2015.",

            "abstract": "Lightning mapping systems have detected high lightning flash rates at the top of convective cores above the environmental -30°C level, particularly in severe storms. Previous 3-D model simulations have reproduced similarly high flash rates using bulk (one or two moment) microphysics, but the details of the charge separation were not closely examined. Recent work has raised questions as to whether the charging processes have been adequately simulated, both in terms of grid resolution and microphysical processes.\nNew simulations of a severe supercell storm with Takahashi spectral bin microphysics and 4x better grid resolution (250m horizontal and 125 vertical spacing) are better able to capture the steep vertical temperature gradients (on the order of 8°C per km) and the process of freezing of larger liquid particles. The results suggest that high charge separation rates can occur as larger drops freeze homogeneously while smaller droplets remain liquid. This process far outstrips other small ice particle production processes like vapor nucleation or ice multiplication. This intense and vertically narrow charging zone then leads to sufficiently fast electric field growth that favors smaller flashes. These results form the hypothesis that high rates of spatially small lightning flashes result from a high density charging current in a relatively small volume, such that initiation electric field thresholds are met quickly before larger net charge regions have time to form.\nResults will also be presented for bulk microphysics with an updated droplet freezing scheme that emulates the freezing of droplets based on diameter and ambient temperature. An important consideration in both schemes is how to handle newly-freezing droplets in the calculation of riming rate (or cloud water content) in the charge separation rate equations.",

Although present-day emissions from these sources are quantified, long-lived infrastructure can also lock in future development and transportation choices and shape emission trajectories and climate as a result. To understand the impacts of infrastructure choice on the expected Earth system response, it is important to quantify the carbon commitment or lock-in resulting from the infrastructure’s long lifetime. Impacts from infrastructure can be evaluated by estimating the following components: (1) how emissions of short-lived and long-lived climate pollutants are affected by long-lived infrastructure; (2) how atmospheric concentration and radiative forcing are driven by these emissions, and (3) the resulting response of Earth’s temperature. In this study a simple model was used to estimate the emissions, radiative forcing, and temperature response to a time-dependent function characterizing the lifetime of the infrastructure. Outputs from this model are used to compare the short-term and long-term climate forcing resulting from infrastructure alternatives. The MAGICC climate model was used to validate the forcing and temperature outputs of the simple model.",

            "abstract": "Plant litter decomposition is an essential process in the first stages of carbon and nutrient turnover in terrestrial ecosystems, and together with soil microbial biomass, provide the principal inputs of carbon for the formation of soil organic matter. Photodegradation, the photochemical mineralization of organic matter, has been recently identified as a mechanism for previously unexplained high rates of litter mass loss in low rainfall ecosystems; however, the generality of this process as a control on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is not known, and the indirect effects of photodegradation on biotic stimulation of carbon turnover have been debated in recent studies. We demonstrate that in a wide range of plant species, previous exposure to solar radiation, and visible light in particular, enhanced subsequent biotic degradation of leaf litter. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mechanism for this enhancement involves increased accessibility for microbial enzymes to plant litter carbohydrates due to a reduction in lignin content. Photodegradation of plant litter reduces the structural and chemical bottleneck imposed by lignin in secondary cell walls. In litter from woody plant species, specific interactions with ultraviolet radiation obscured facilitative effects of solar radiation on biotic decomposition. The generalized positive effect of solar radiation exposure on subsequent microbial activity is mediated by increased accessibility to cell wall polysaccharides, which suggests that photodegradation is quantitatively important in determining rates of mass loss, nutrient release and the carbon balance in a broad range of terrestrial ecosystems.",

Simulations considered include those performed with six RCMs for the 1981–2003 period driven by National Centre for Environmental Prediction reanalysis II and by four Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models for the 1970–1999 and 2041–2070 periods (11 current-to-future period simulation pairs). Drought characteristics are extracted using two drought indices, namely Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which is solely based on precipitation, and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which is based on both precipitation and temperature in the form of evapotranspiration. Regional frequency analysis is used to project changes to selected 20- and 50-yr regional return levels of drought for fifteen homogeneous regions. In addition, multivariate analyses of drought characteristics, derived on the basis of SPI and SPEI values of six month time scale, are developed using the copula approach for each region. Results reveal that analysis of multi-RCM ensemble-averaged projected changes to drought characteristics and various return levels of drought characteristics show increases over the southern, western and eastern parts of the study area. Based on bi- and trivariate joint occurrence probabilities of drought characteristics, the southern regions along with the central regions are found highly drought vulnerable, followed by southwestern and southeastern regions. These projections will be useful in the development of appropriate adaptation strategies for the water and agricultural sectors, which play an important role in the economy of the study area.",

A significant challenge, however, is to make data archived under older standards useful in the new data environments. NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) recently released version 4 of its information model (PDS4). PDS4 is an improvement and has advantages over previous versions. PDS4 adopts the XML standard for metadata and expresses structural requirements with XML Schema and content constraints by using Schematron. This allows for thorough validation by using off the shelf tools. This is a substantial improvement over previous PDS versions. PDS4 was designed to improve discoverability of products (resources) in a PDS archive. These additions allow for more uniform metadata harvesting from the collection level to the product level. New tools and services are being deployed that depend on the data adhering to the PDS4 model. However, the PDS has been an operational archive since 1989 and has large holdings that are compliant with previous versions of the PDS information model. The challenge is the make the older data accessible and useable with the new PDS4 based tools. To provide uniform utility and access to the entire archive the older data must be migrated to the PDS4 model. At the Planetary Plasma Interactions (PPI) Node of the PDS we've been actively planning and preparing to migrate our legacy archive to the new PDS4 standards for several years. With the release of the PDS4 standards we have begun the migration of our archive. In this presentation we will discuss the preparation of the data for the migration and how we are approaching this task. The presentation will consist of a series of stories to describe our experiences and the best practices we have learned.",

The updated unwrapping strategy now includes the use of SNAPHU for data processing patches where the unwrapped coverage from the original residue-based unwrapper falls below a coverage threshold. In North America continental processing, first experiments show the strip void area is reduced by more than 50% and the number of strip void patches is reduced by 40%. Patch boundary voids are mitigated by reprocessing with a different starting burst and merging the unwrapping results. We also updated a low-resolution elevation database to aid with unwrapping bootstrapping, retaining isolated component of unwrapped phase, and assessing the quality of the strip DEMs.\nWe introduce a height ripple error correction to reduce artifacts in the strip elevation data. These ripples are a few meters in size with along-track spatial scales of tens of kilometers and are due to uncompensated mast motion most pronounced after Shuttle roll angle adjustment maneuvers. We developed an along-track filter utilizing differences between the SRTM heights and ICESat lidar elevation data. For a test using all data over North America, the algorithm reduced the ICESat-SRTM bias from 80 cm to 3 cm and the RMS from 5m to 4m.\nAfter merging and regridding the SRTM strip DEMs into 1x1-degree tiles, remaining voids are primarily filled with the ASTER-derived Global DEM. We use a Delta Surface Fill method to rubbersheet fill data across the void for a seamless merger. We find this to provide a more accurate fill than cut-and-paste patching. A new post-processing module creates DEM-derived layers from the void-free elevation data. The slope/aspect & plan/profile curvatures are found by fitting a local quadratic surface to each DEM post and computing metrics from the fit coefficients.",

            "abstract": "Peat cores from two micro-tidal marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California (the landward end of the San Francisco Estuary) were used to track the onset of anthropogenic pollution on the west coast of the United States. Cores were sectioned into 2-cm depth intervals and analyzed for lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and titanium (Ti) concentrations and Pb isotope compositions. Peat profiles were dated using radiocarbon, 210Pb, and 137Cs. Pre-anthropogenic concentrations of Pb and Hg in peat ranged from 0.60 to 13.0 µg g-1and from 6.9 to 71 ng g-1, respectively. For much of the past 6,000+ years, the Delta was free from anthropogenic pollution; however, beginning in ~1425 CE, Hg and Pb concentrations, Pb/Ti ratios, Pb enrichment factors (EFs), and HgEFs all increased. Pb isotope compositions of the peat suggest that this uptick was likely caused by mining and smelting activities originating in Asia. The next increases in Pb and Hg contamination occurred during the California Gold Rush (beginning ~1850 CE), when concentrations reached their highest levels (74 µg g-1 Pb, 990 ng g-1 Hg; PbEF = 12 and HgEF = 28). Pb concentrations increased again beginning in the ~1920s with the incorporation of Pb additives in gasoline. The phase-out of lead additives in the late 1980s was reflected in Pb isotope ratios and reductions in Pb concentrations in the surface layers of the peat. The rise and fall of Hg contamination was also tracked by the peat archive, with the highest Hg concentrations occurring just before 1963 CE and then decreasing during the post-1963 period. Overall the results show that the Delta was a pristine region for most of its ~6,700-year existence; however, since ~1425 CE, it has received Pb and Hg contamination from both global and regional sources. This study demonstrates that micro-tidal peatlands can be a highly useful archive for establishing the onset of anthropogenic contamination and chronicling the transition from a pristine to a polluted landscape.",

            "abstract": "To assure long-term security of geologic carbon sequestration site, evaluation of natural CO2 leakage should be preceded before actual construction of the CO2 facility by comparing natural and artificial reservoir systems. The Little Grand Wash fault is located at the northwestern margin of the Paradox Basin and roles on a bypass of deep subsurface CO2 and brine water onto the surface, e.g., cold water geyser, CO2 spring, and surface travertine deposits. CO2 degassed out from brine at the Little Grand Wash fault zone may react with formation water and minerals while migrating through the fault conduit. Leakage observed by soil CO2 flux on the fault trace shows this ongoing transition of CO2, from supersaturated condition in deep subsurface to shallow surface equilibria. The present study aims to investigate the reactions induced by changes in hydrological and mineralogical factors inside of the fault zone.\nThe methodology to develop site-specific geochemical model of the Little Grand Wash Fault combines calculated mechanical movements of each fluid end-member, along with chemical reactions among fluid, free CO2 gas and rock formations. Reactive transport modeling was conducted to simulate these property changes inside of the fault zone, using chemistry dataset based on 86 effluent samples of CO2 geysers, springs and in situ formation water from Entrada, Carmel, and Navajo Sandstone. Meanwhile, one- and two-dimensional models were separately developed to delineate features mentioned above.\nThe results from the 3000-year simulation showed an appearance of self-sealing processes near the surface of the fault conduit. By tracking physicochemical changes at the depth of 15 m on the 2-dimensional model, significant changes induced by fluid mixing were indicated. Calculated rates of precipitation for calcite, illite, and pyrite showed increase in 2.6 x 10-4, 2.25 x 10-5, and 3.0 x 10-6 in mineral volume fraction at the depth of 15m, respectively. Concurrently, permeability and porosity were decreased 4.0 x 10-18 m2 and 3.0 x 10-4 due to precipitation of minerals. At the middle of the fault conduit (400 m), however, indicates consistent dissolution of minerals in formation which enhances vertical fluid migration.",

            "abstract": "The North American and Pacific plate boundary is a unique example of past subduction of an oceanic spreading center which has involved oceanic plate capture and inception of a continental transform boundary that juxtaposes continental and oceanic lithosphere on a single plate. The amphibious ALBACORE seismic project (Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the California Offshore Region Experiment) deployed 34 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) on 15-35 Ma seafloor and offers a unique opportunity to compare the LAB in continental and oceanic lithosphere in one seismic study. Rayleigh waves were recorded simultaneously by our offshore array and 82 CISN network land stations from 2010-2011. Here we predict phase velocities for a starting shear wave velocity model for each of 5 regions in our study area and compare to observed phase velocities from our array in a least-squares sense that produces the best fit 1-D shear wave velocity structure for each region. Preliminary results for the deep ocean (seafloor 25-32 Ma) indicates high velocities reaching 4.5 km/s at depths of 50 km associated with the lithosphere for seafloor 25-32 Ma. A negative velocity gradient is observed below this which reaches a minimum of 4.0 km/s at 160 km depth. The mid-ocean region (age 13-25 Ma) indicates a slightly lower magnitude and shallower LVZ. The Inner Borderland displays the highest lithospheric velocities offshore reaching 4.8 km/s at 40 km depth indicating underplating. The base of the LVZ in the Borderland increases sharply from 4.0 km/s to 4.5 km/s at 80-150 km depth indicating partial melt and compositional changes. The LVZ displays a very gradual positive velocity gradient in all other regions such as the deep seafloor and continent reaching 4.5 km/s at 300 km depth. The deep ocean, Borderlands, and continental region each have unique lithospheric velocities, LAB depths, and LVZ character that indicate stark differences in mantle structure that occur on a single plate as well as across the continental margin.",

            "abstract": "Earlier observations of the Mars’ atmosphere have provided evidence that Mars was once abundance in water and CO2, which had been depleted via various mechanisms from the surface and atmosphere throughout the history of the planet. At the current epoch, the main mechanism that induces the loss of atomic O is suggested as dissociative recombination of O2+, which yields the hot O corona in the upper thermosphere and exosphere. To quantitatively understand the loss process, it is crucial to characterize the Martian hot O corona in detail by constraining the model in accordance with the analysis of the observed features of the atmosphere, allowing estimation of the global escape rate of atomic O. Here, we present a comparison between our 3D Martian hot O corona model predictions and the OI 130.4 nm emission detected by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) [McClintock et al., 2014] onboard Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutiN (MAVEN) [Jakosky et al., 2015]. We have simulated the hot O corona by coupling our Mars application of the 3D Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (M-AMPS) [Tenishev et al., 2008, 2013] and the Mars Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (M-GITM) [Bougher et al., 2015], based completely on our best pre-MAVEN understanding of the 3D structure of the thermosphere and ionosphere. The model predictions showed good agreement with the transition altitude from the cold thermosphere to the hot O corona, the altitude variation of the hot O density, and the spatial variation of the dayside-dominated corona. The model estimates the O escape rate of 3.46 × 1025 s-1 for the case considered. The brightness of the modeled hot O densities are a factor of a few lower than the IUVS measurement, which requires further analysis of MAVEN measurements to constrain our model as well as the possible consideration of other source mechanisms to close the gap with the observed brightness.",

            "abstract": "On Mars, volcanism within Elysium Planitia may have occurred as recently as ~10 million years ago, which associated lava flows being emplaced with ice-bearing permafrost. On Earth, there are few active volcanic regions that are cold enough to support permafrost, but the Seward Peninsula in Alaska is a prime location to study recent volcano–ice interactions. In the early 2000s, J.E. Beget and J.S. Kargel explored two areas in Alaska that exhibit features characteristic of explosive volcanism that may be the result of lava–ice interaction. These locations include the Lost Jim Lava Flow (65°29’N, 163°17’W) and several large maars (66°23’N, 164°29’W). The work presented here focuses on the Lost Jim Lava Flow, emanating from Lost Jim Cone and flowing West and North. The flow was erupted 1000-2000 years ago, covers ~225 km2, and ranges 3-30 m in thickness. Previous fieldwork identified pits along the margins of the flow that were interpreted to be collapse features (i.e., thermokarst) that formed as ground–ice beneath the lava melted due to heat transfer from the overlaying lava flow. This investigation utilizes stereo photogrammetry to generate high–resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) of these flow features to assess if these pits are indeed the products of thermokarstification, or if they are lava-rise pits formed by lava flow inflation. The DTMs were generated from ALOS PRISM data and DigitalGlobe Worldview 1 and 2 panchromatic satellite images taken as stereo–pairs or –triplets. With these new models the extent and morphology of the flow and pits will be categorized across the entire flow. These results are also compared to young lava flows on Mars, which may have experienced lava–ice interactions. Understanding the expression of such interactions on Earth may aid in the identification and interpretation of analogous eruptions on Mars.",

This work uses a 2.5D explicit Particle-In-a-Cell (PIC) code to investigate the effects of energized heavy ions on reconnection. This work differs significantly from previous investigations involving heavy ions in that, here, they are energized as opposed to simply thermal, a significant variation based firmly on published in-situ measurements. Two populations of energized heavy ions are investigated. First an energized dawn-dusk stream of heavy ions along Speiser Orbits is introduced across the current sheet. Second an energized beam of outflow ions is introduced along field lines to the reconnection site. The evolution of each of these cases is compared to the evolution of otherwise identically configured systems having either no heavy ions or with a background of thermal heavy ions. Two main results are shown. First, the dawn-dusk streaming ions clearly produce a dramatic suppression of reconnection significantly delaying its onset. Second, the outflowing beam does not have a significant effect on the overall progression of the reconnection system but does cause a tail-ward skew in the structure. Most notably the ions did not exhibit the (traditionally expected) non-gyroscopic reflection at the x-line, producing a counter-streaming beam, but passed through the current sheet and out the opposite side.",

            "abstract": "Forest fires are extremely harmful for the Amazon region, affecting the natural cycle of vegetation and ecosystem functioning. The effects of fire on net radiation and forest water cycling are not well understood, especially due to the difficulty of obtaining surface flux measurements in fire-affected areas with high temporal and spatial resolution. The present study aimed to characterize and analyse, using MODIS remote sensing data in combination with the SEBAL model, the temporal dynamics of net radiation and evapotranspiration in a 120 km2 mature Amazonian forest plot affected by fire in September 2010 in the state of Para, Brazil. The analysis of the surface energy fluxes in the month before and in the month after the fire indicated a 25% and 27% decrease in net radiation and evapotranspiration, respectively. The average values of net radiation and evapotranspiration for the 3 years pre-fire were 119.3 W m-2 and 1436.0 mm yr-1, respectively. After the significant decrease was verified immediately post-fire, net radiation values increased at an average annual rate of 3% and evapotranspiration values increased at an average annual rate of 20%. In both cases, the highest increase in rates were verified one year after the fire, corresponding to 5% in net radiation and 58% in evapotranspiration. The average values of net radiation and evapotranspiration 3 years post-fire were 119.2 W m-2 and 1382.6 mm yr-1, respectively, which are quite close to the average values verified prior to burning. Thus, we conclude that 3 years was enough time for this forest plot to recover its original state in terms of surface fluxes. Despite this result, it is important to note that a high severity fire can alter the canopy characteristcs more strongly than a low severity fire, which means that distinct disturbance regimes will affect the energy fluxes after the fire in forested areas quite differently.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological forecasts at local scale and seasonal time scales have the potential to inform decision-making by individuals and institutions to improve management of water resources and enhance food security. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding climate variability and its predictability over African regions. However, there remain many challenges in translating large-scale evaluations and forecasts into locally relevant information. This is hampered by lack of on the ground data of hydrological and agricultural states, and the generally low skill of climate forecasts at time scales beyond one or two weeks. Additionally, the uptake of forecasts is not prevalent because of lack of capacity, and institutional and cultural barriers to using new and uncertain information. New technologies for monitoring and forecasting relevant hydrological variables, and novel approaches to understanding how this information may be used within decision making processes, have the potential to make substantial progress in addressing these challenges.\nWe present a quasi-operational drought and flood monitoring and forecasting system and its use in understanding the potential of hydrological forecasts for improved decision-making. The system monitors in near real-time the terrestrial water cycle for the African continent based on remote sensing data and land surface hydrological modeling. The monitoring forms initial conditions for hydrological forecasts at short time scale, aimed at flood forecasting, and seasonal scale aimed at drought and crop yield forecasts. The flood forecasts are driven by precipitation and temperature forecasts from the Global Forecast System (GFS). The drought forecasts are driven by climate forecasts from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). The seasonal forecast skill is modest and seasonally/regionally dependent with part of the skill coming from persistence in initial land surface conditions. We discuss the use of the system in the context of operational implementation by regional climate centers and in local evaluations of the predictions. We also discuss how forecasts might be used within the decision making process of smallholder farmers and the practicalities of disseminating information from operational centers to local actors.",

            "abstract": "Climate literacy and climate education are important topics in current socio-political debate. Despite numerous scientific findings supporting global climate changes and accelerated greenhouse warming, there is a social inertia resisting and slowing the rate at which many of our students understand and absorb these facts. A variety of reasons, including: socio-economic interests, political and ideological biases, misinformation from mass media, inappropriate preparation of science teachers, and lack of numancy have created serious challenges for public awareness of such an important issue. Different agencies and organizations (NASA, NOAA, EPA, AGU, APS, AMS and others) have created training programs for educators, not involved directly in climatology research, in order to learn climate science in a consistent way and then communicate it to the public and students. Different approaches on how to deliver such information to undergraduate students in diverse environments is discussed based on the author's experiences working in different minority-serving institutions across the nation and who have attended AMS Weather and Climate Studies training workshops, MSI-REACH, and the School of Ice. Different parameters are included in the analysis: demographics of students, size of the institutions, geographical locations, target audience, programs students are enrolled in, conceptual units covered, and availability of climate-related courses in the curricula. Additionally, the feasibility of incorporating a laboratory and quantitative analysis is analyzed. As a result of these comparisons it seems that downscaling of climate education experiences do not always work as expected in every institution regardless of the student body demographics. Different geographical areas, student body characteristics and type of institution determine the approach to be adopted as well as the feasibility to introduce different components for weather and climate studies. Some ideas are shared on how to integrate meteorology and climatology topics in other disciplines: Biology, Geology, Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Science Methods. Such approaches might help small institutions with curriculum constraints to not fall behind in communicating climate science to the populations they serve.",

            "abstract": "On September 6, 2014, OCO-2 began routinely returning almost 106 soundings over the sunlit hemisphere each day. Over 10% of these soundings are sufficiently cloud free to yield full-column estimates of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2. Nadir soundings over land yield XCO2 estimates with single-sounding random errors of 0.5 - 1 ppm at solar zenith angles (SZA) < 60° while ocean glint soundings yield precisions near 0.5 ppm at SZA < 70°. Nadir soundings over the ocean and glint soundings over high-latitude land are less precise. Initially, OCO-2 recorded only nadir soundings or glint soundings on alternate, 16-day ground-track repeat cycles. This provided adequate coverage of the globe each month, but produced 16-day gaps in ocean coverage while observing nadir, and similar gaps over high-latitude land while observing glint. In July 2015, this strategy was modified to alternate between glint and nadir soundings on consecutive orbits to yield more continuous coverage each day.\nWhile XCO2 and other products are being validated to identify and correct biases, global XCO2 maps are starting to reveal the most robust features of the atmospheric carbon cycle. XCO2 enhancements co-located with intense fossil fuel emissions in eastern U.S. and eastern China are most obvious in the fall, when the north-south XCO2 gradient is small. Enhanced XCO2 coincident with biomass burning in the Amazon, central Africa, and Indonesian is also obvious in the fall. In mid spring, when the north-south XCO2 gradient was largest, these sources were less apparent in global maps. From late May to mid-July, OCO-2 maps show a 2-3% reduction in XCO2 across the northern hemisphere, as the land biosphere rapidly absorbs CO2. As the carbon cycle community continues to analyze these OCO-2 data, quantitative estimates of regional-scale emission sources and natural sinks are expected to emerge. This presentation will summarize the OCO-2 mission status, early products, and near-term plans.",

Here we will present measurements of CO2 and CH4 dry air mole fractions obtained using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) as part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Nework (TCCON). These measurements were performed in Indianapolis as part of the Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX). We will extract urban emission signals using high resolution modeling and in-situ tower measurements of CO2 and CH4 mixing ratios. In addition to quantifying the influence of surface emissions on the column measurements, we will also decompose the atmospheric columns into sub-layers to identify the origin of air masses at various altitudes. We will show that the variability in the origins of air masses increases the complexity of the observed signals in the column, which limits our ability to combine surface and column measurements. This work will also highlight the potential application of using total column measurements to detect local urban signals. We conclude that the deployment of multiple column sensors is required in order to measure the upwind (background) and downwind (urban) conditions. Such work provides a test case for using these methods with satellite measurements such as GOSAT and OCO-2 that provide global coverage.",

            "abstract": "Effective elastic thickness (Te) is a measure of integrated lithospheric strength that depends on rheological parameters such as lithology, temperature, water fugacity, and state of stress. It is a useful constraint for resolving in-situ rheology and stress within the lithosphere, and therefore critical to understanding surface deformation and controls on tectonic processes.\nTe is commonly estimated via comparison of observed and model-predicted spectral-domain coherence between Bouguer gravity and topography signals. The Te producing a model coherence that best fits observed coherence is taken to best represent lithospheric bending strength. However, the solution relies on accuracy of the method’s assumption that loads at the surface and in Earth’s interior are truly uncorrelated; Te estimates may be biased in regions where this criterion fails. Determining mechanical anisotropy is also ambiguous, as true anisotropy cannot be reliably distinguished from artefacts in gravity and topography data inversion.\nWe propose a new modeling approach that will refine existing Te estimation via two innovations. First, we reduce the null-space in estimates of surface- versus subsurface contributions to loading by assimilating independent estimates of subsurface mass variations derived from EarthScope USArray seismic imaging data. This reduces the ambiguity of loading estimates, and provides an independent means of testing for anisotropy of the applied loads. Second, we substitute a finite-element approach to forward modeling spatially-varying flexural response in place of conventional uniform-Te linear thin plate models. This modification allows Te to vary and and loads to update iteratively, and improves separation of intrinsic Te-anisotropy from effects introduced by lateral variations in isotropic Te. A variable-Te forward modeling approach also improves spatial resolution of the inversion as it is no longer limited by a need to subsample data through windowing or wavelets.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity has completed a detailed chemo-stratigraphy analysis at the Pahrump exposure of the Murray formation. In total >570 chemical measurements and supporting remote micro images to classify texturally were collected. Chemical trends with both stratigraphic position and with texture were evaluated. From these data emerges a complex aqueous history where sediments have interacted with fluids with variable chemistry in distinct episodes.\nThe ChemCam data collected at the nearby “Garden City” (GC) vein complex provides constraints on the chemical evolution of the Pahrump. GC is thought be stratigraphically above the Pahrump outcrop. Fluids producing the veins likely also migrated through the Pahrump sediments. Multiple episodes of fluids are evident at GC, forming distinct Ca sulfate, F-rich, enhanced MgO, and FeO-rich veins. These different fluid chemistries could be the result of distinct fluids migrating through the section from a distance with a pre-established chemical signature, fluids locally evolved from water rock interactions, or both.\nTexturally rocks have been classified into two distinct categories: fine grained or as cross-bedded sandstones. The sandstones have significantly lower SiO2, Al2O3, and K2O and higher FeO, and CaO. Fine grained rocks have further been sub-classified as resistant and recessive with other textural features such as laminations and pits noted.The strongest chemical trend in the fine-grained sandstones shows enhancements in MgO and FeO in erosion-resistant materials compared to fine grained recessive units, suggesting that increased abundance of Mg- and/or iron-rich cements may provide additional strength. The MgO and FeO variations with texture are independent of stratigraphic locations (e.g resistant material at both the bottom and top of the outcrop both are enhanced in MgO and FeO). The presence of the GC MgO and FeO rich veins provides additional evidence for fluids rich in these elements were present in the outcrop. Other elemental trends results including SiO2, Al2O3, K2O and Na2O will be explored in addition to key trace element signatures such as Li, Cr and F to understand the chemical evolution of the outcrop.",

We identify the dominant modes of variabilities and associated spatial patterns, and relate them to sea surface temperature (SST). The first two empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are highly correlated to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) — including both EP-ENSO (canonical ENSO) and CP-ENSO (ENSO Modoki). These modes are compared with those obtained using the CloudSat data. The same EOF analysis is applied to simulations from 20 AMIP5 models. In general, the models are able to simulate the first EOF, the EP-ENSO, in the data. However, only about half of the AMIP5 models could realistically reproduce the second EOF, the CP-ENSO.

Summertime convective storms over the southwestern peninsula of the UK were the subject of the COnvective Precipitation Experiment (COPE), conducted in July and August of 2013. With an aim to improving quantitative precipitation forecasts, one of the primary objectives of COPE was to document the microphysical evolution of convective storms and unravel the contributions of the many microphysical pathways that can lead to heavy convective rainfall.\nConvective storms over southwest England are somewhat unusual, with low but cool cloud bases that can still provide ample time for development of precipitation through warm processes. The production of precipitation between cloud base through (and somewhat above) the 0 °C level plays an important role in the further microphysical evolution of the cloud as ascent continues. In some cases, we observed a rapid transition from cloud liquid to ice, presumably amplified through secondary ice production. In others, we found very little production of ice at similar temperature levels.\nHere we investigate details of the microphysics and dynamics from select cases on four days from COPE using in situ observations from an instrumented aircraft and high-resolution measurements from an airborne radar. In particular, we investigate how frozen raindrops in the Hallet-Mossop zone (-3 to -8 °C) influences the production of small ice crystals. We further investigate the expected time these frozen drops, or graupel embryos, persist in the H-M zone to understand the role updraft speed plays in secondary ice production leading to rapid glaciation of the cloud.",

            "abstract": "Serviced-oriented computing provides an opportunity to couple web service models using semantic web technology. Through this approach, models that are exposed as web services can be conserved in their own local environment, thus making it easy for modelers to maintain and update the models. In integrated modeling, the serviced-oriented loose-coupling approach requires (1) a set of models as web services, (2) the model metadata describing the external features of a model (e.g., variable name, unit, computational grid, etc.) and (3) a model integration framework. We present the architecture of coupling web service models that are self-describing by utilizing a smart modeling framework. We expose models that are encapsulated with CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) Basic Model Interfaces (BMI) as web services. The BMI-enabled models are self-describing by uncovering models’ metadata through BMI functions. After a BMI-enabled model is serviced, a client can initialize, execute and retrieve the meta-information of the model by calling its BMI functions over the web. Furthermore, a revised version of EMELI (Peckham, 2015), an Experimental Modeling Environment for Linking and Interoperability, is chosen as the framework for coupling BMI-enabled web service models. EMELI allows users to combine a set of component models into a complex model by standardizing model interface using BMI as well as providing a set of utilities smoothing the integration process (e.g., temporal interpolation). We modify the original EMELI so that the revised modeling framework is able to initialize, execute and find the dependencies of the BMI-enabled web service models. By using the revised EMELI, an example will be presented on integrating a set of topoflow model components that are BMI-enabled and exposed as web services.\n",

            "abstract": "Continental extension is a fundamental plate tectonic process, and extensional environments are associated with significant production of basaltic magmas. Although tholeiitic magmatism produced by mantle decompression is common, dispersed, less voluminous and compositionally variable basaltic and related magmas also occur in association with continental extension. One of the most voluminous, best-preserved and least studied examples of the latter is the volcanic harrats of western Saudi Arabia. Uplift, crustal erosion and harrat volcanism occurred from ~15 Ma to recent over a considerable region of western Arabia. Volcanism trends north from the Red Sea along the Makkah-Madinah-Nafud (MMN) line as a number of discrete harrats, and geophysical evidence suggests this region is underlain by hot upwelling asthenosphere. Larger harrats occur along the central axis of the MMN line, with smaller fields on the periphery.\nWe present initial results of an ongoing study of harrat volcanism, including more than 50 new 40Ar-39Ar ages together with geochemical and isotopic data. Magma storage and fractionation appears to have occurred at a range of crustal levels, including deep storage and transport sufficiently rapid to preserve a range of lithospheric and crustal xenoliths. Melting commenced within the garnet peridotite field, however modeling of REE element abundances suggest that considerable differences exist in the thickness of the overlying lithospheric lid. Thinner lithosphere (<40 km) and higher degrees of melting occurs along the MMN line, whereas harrats peripheral to the MMN line have thicker lithosphere (>60-80 km) and magmas result from lower degree melts. The observed variability can be explained by a process of progressively thinning lithosphere along the main axis of the MMN line, as a result of regional lithospheric extension and mantle decompression melting, coupled with northward asthenospheric flow from the Red Sea and/or Afar hot spot.",

            "abstract": "A new mechanism for abundance enhancements of high-energy Helium-3 produced by impulsive flares is explored. Observations have shown a 103-104 increase in the high-energy Helium-3 abundance following impulsive solar flares. A likely mechanism is the resonant heating of Helium-3 in the corona by Alfvén-Cyclotron waves. While electron beams have been proposed as a source of these waves, this mechanism has not been firmly established in the impulsive flare context. We propose instead that the proton temperature anisotropy produced during magnetic reconnection drives these waves. We have shown, through 2-dimensional PIC simulations of magnetized plasmas, that low-beta magnetic reconnection produces strong temperature anisotropy in reconnection exhausts, with a higher temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field. Simulations further reveal that this temperature anisotropy drives Alfvén-Cyclotron waves whose frequency falls directly at the Helium-3 cyclotron frequency. The resulting resonant heating of Helium-3 leads to an increase in the temperature by a factor of 3-7. These simulations establish the potential viability of this mechanism. Ongoing simulations are being carried out to explore whether the resonant heating by these waves can drive Helium-3 to the MeV/nucleon range seen in the observational data.",

The proposed GeoCARB instrument would measure CO2, CH4, CO and O2 using a grating spectrometer with sensitivity in the same bands as OCO-2 for CO2 and O2. With a 2km by 3km footprint at nadir, extremely high resolution observations will be possible at multiple times each day that are fully customizable for different purposes (monitoring, field campaigns, large plume events). In this presentation, we will demonstrate the extraordinary potential for a geostationary mapping instrument to constrain both natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes at high space and time resolution through the use of OSSEs. This will elucidate the need for an instrument like GeoCARB to tackle the problem of understanding the leading order uncertainties present in the feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate systems, as well as providing a means by which to verify emissions treaties between nations and smaller geopolitical regions.",

            "abstract": "We present and evaluate a range of approaches that may be used to investigate ocean microseisms using seismic array data. At amplitudes below the dominant incoming signal, the ambient seismic energy (background noise) associated with microseisms arrives from multiple directions at any one time. Thus we address the challenge of detecting weaker signals from unpredictable directions in the presence of other strong signals. Our aim is to extract the most accurate information possible from such weaker signals in order to expand the capability of ocean storm studies, using seismology, including the ability to extract storm patterns from archive seismic array records.\nDetection of weaker microseism signals may be improved using algorithms widely used in astronomy. One example is the CLEAN algorithm which has wide usage in radio astronomy. This algorithm operates by finding the position and strength of point sources and iteratively deconvolving their contribution to the image. It may be combined to optimum effect with the previously published (Incoherently Averaged Signal) IAS Capon implementation for an accurate detection of weaker sources. Having detected weaker sources, they may be backprojected using a suitable Earth model, taking into account a correction for the mislocation due to slowness-azimuth station corrections. The microseism generation locations inferred in this manner are strongly frequency dependent, even within relatively restricted frequency ranges (0.325-0.725 Hz) for some arrays.\nOur advances in seismic array processing, with a focus on methods appropriate to weaker ambient noise signals, have led to insights, for example, regarding the generation of seismic noise. We find that secondary microseisms in the lower frequency band are generated mainly by ocean swell whereas higher frequency bands are generated by local wind conditions. These arrivals are investigated over a two-decade time frame for the Southern Ocean and west Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Municipal and urban land-use intensification in coming decades will place increasing pressure on water resources in California. The state is currently experiencing one of the most extreme droughts on record. This coupled with earlier spring snowmelt and projected future climate warming will increasingly constrain already limited water supplies. The development of spatially explicit models of future land use driven by empirical, historical land use change data allow exploration of plausible LULC-related water demand futures and potential mitigation strategies. We utilized the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) state-and-transition simulation model to project spatially explicit (1 km) future developed and agricultural land use from 2012 to 2062 and estimated the associated water use for California’s Mediterranean ecoregions. We modeled 100 Monte Carlo simulations to better characterize and project historical land-use change variability. Under current efficiency rates, total water demand was projected to increase 15.1% by 2062, driven primarily by increases in urbanization and shifts to more water intensive crops. Developed land use was projected to increase by 89.8%-97.2% and result in an average 85.9% increase in municipal water use, while agricultural water use was projected to decline by approximately 3.9%, driven by decreases in row crops and increases in woody cropland. In order for water demand in 2062 to balance to current demand levels, the currently mandated 25% reduction in urban water use must remain in place in conjunction with a near 7% reduction in agricultural water use. Scenarios of land-use related water demand are useful for visualizing alternative futures, examining potential management approaches, and enabling better informed resource management decisions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the influence of the solar wind (SW) on the propagation of a set of 191 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun during the period 1996-2013. The CMEs were observed by LASCO on board SOHO and their source regions were identified using the CME-associated eruptive features (flares, filament eruptions, dimmings) in X-ray, EUV, microwave, and Hα observations. The SW speeds above the CME source regions were estimated from the interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations from the Solar Terrestrial Environ Laboratory, Nagoya University. We considered only CMEs from close to the limb in order to avoid the projection effects. We also considered CMEs with at least 10 height-time measurements in order to avoid the large uncertainty in the acceleration measurements. We confirm the well-known CME-SW relationship that the CMEs propagating faster (slower) than the ambient solar wind are likely to decelerate (accelerate). The correlation between the acceleration and the difference of the CME and the SW speeds is high with a correlation coefficient of -0.74, slightly lower compared to the one for CMEs associated with interplanetary radio bursts (Gopalswamy et al. 2001, JGR, 106, 29219). There are many accelerating CMEs in our sample with a speed similar to the ambient solar wind speed. This could be due to selection effect because accelerating CMEs tend to remain visible longer than decelerating ones. We also found that CMEs originating from around the sources of the fast solar wind tend to be faster, indicating that the open magnetic fields above the CME source regions affect the CME propagation.",

            "abstract": "Due to the predominantly arid climate in Arizona, access to adequate water supply is vital to the economic development and livelihood of the State. Water supply has become increasingly important during periods of prolonged drought, which has strained reservoir water levels in the Desert Southwest over past years. Arizona’s water use is dominated by agriculture, consuming about seventy-five percent of the total annual water demand. Tracking current agricultural water use is important for managers and policy makers so that current water demand can be assessed and current information can be used to forecast future demands. However, many croplands in Arizona are irrigated outside of areas where water use reporting is mandatory. To estimate irrigation withdrawals on these lands, we use a combination of field verification, evapotranspiration (ET) estimation, and irrigation system qualification. ET is typically estimated in Arizona using the Modified Blaney-Criddle method which uses meteorological data to estimate annual crop water requirements. The Modified Blaney-Criddle method assumes crops are irrigated to their full potential over the entire growing season, which may or may not be realistic. We now use the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) ET data in a remote-sensing and energy-balance framework to estimate cropland ET. SSEBop data are of sufficient resolution (30m by 30m) for estimation of field-scale cropland water use. We evaluate our SSEBop-based estimates using ground-truth information and irrigation system qualification obtained in the field. Our approach gives the end user an estimate of crop consumptive use as well as inefficiencies in irrigation system performance—both of which are needed by water managers for tracking irrigated water use in Arizona.",

            "abstract": "Topography develops as a result of the interaction between tectonics, surface processes, and climate and can yield insight into the evolution of a mountain range. Global δ18O data from meteoric water show a linear relationship between net elevation and Δδ18O on the windward side of a mountain range, where δ18O values decrease as net elevation increases. The development of relief may generate leeside rain shadows where the δ18O values are lower due to rainout on the windward side. The magnitude of lowering in isotopic values in paleo-δ18O sampled from the leeside of a mountain range should therefore be related to the elevation of the range. Several studies have used this relationship to constrain the topographic evolution of mountain ranges using leeside isotope records. One assumption in this technique is that the interaction between the mountain range and atmosphere is two-dimensional and that all air masses surmount and record the highest elevation. For some mountain ranges, the topographic evolution from leeside isotope records is complicated by flow blocking and deflection. This does not appear to be the case in the New Zealand Southern Alps. The record of δ18O collected in kaolinites on the leeside of the Southern Alps agrees well with other lines of evidence suggesting that the mountain range uplifted ~2 ± 1 km over the last 5 Ma. In this study we aim to address to what extent flow deflection around a topographic barrier influences leeside isotope-based paleoaltimetry for the New Zealand Southern Alps. Flow deflection can be quantified using the nondimensional flow parameter Nh/U, where N is the buoyancy frequency (1/s), h (m) is the mountain height, and U (m/s) is the wind speed. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model to dynamically downscale NCEP 6-hourly reanalysis at 32 km grid spacing we run back-trajectory analyses for locations on the leeside of the Southern Alps. We also characterize storms that reach the leeside in terms of Nh/U to determine the degree of blocking during these events. Preliminary results suggest that flow deflection is relatively infrequent in the Southern Alps, at least in the modern climate, and that due to the relatively low elevation of the mountain range that leeside isotope-based paleoaltimetry records may not be as complicated by three-dimensional flow as other settings.",

            "abstract": "Several wave-particle interaction events have been detected by the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) instrument on the Van Allen Probes. Most of these occur during the recovery of electron injections by substorm activity. One example reported by Fennell et al [2014] occurred on January 13, 2013. The high resolution mode on MagEIS, with up to 1000 samples per spacecraft spin, provided very detailed pitch angle data for a few energy channels. This data showed quasiperiodic bursts of 30-40 keV electrons at oblique pitch angles that correlate with simultaneously detected emissions of whistler-mode, upper-band chorus. The electron bursts were superimposed on a pre-existing trapped electron distributions at that energy that were of the form sinn α, where α is the pitch angle and the exponent n is approximately 0.8. The data from the Helium, Oxygen, Proton and Electron (HOPE) instrument was investigated to determine if the electron distributions at lower energy were anisotropic. An electron population with high perpendicular anisotropy could provide free energy for the generation of the observed waves. In this case, only small amounts of anisotropy were observed by HOPE. This could indicate that the wave-particle interaction could be some distance away from the Van Allen Probes. But this conclusion appears inconsistent with the electron and the waves arriving simultaneously at the spacecraft for several bursts, despite traveling at different speeds. The result will be discussed and compared with theories and models of such interactions.",

            "abstract": "This study utilizes more than a year of observations made in shallow waters (~30 m) at the head of the Monterey Submarine Canyon to assess variability in the physical environment and internal bore field. The interaction of the internal tide with the canyon rim results in a semidiurnal tidal period pumping of cold water intrusions (subthermocline waters) onto the adjacent shelf (i.e., internal bores). These internal bores are shown to be significantly coherent with the surface (barotropic) tide with minimal spatial variability when comparing two sites on opposite sides of the canyon head. During the summer months, and periods of strong regional wind-driven upwelling and shoaling of the offshore thermocline, the canyon rim sites display elevated semidiurnal temperature variance. The semidiurnal variability reaches its annual minimum during the winter months when the regional upwelling favorable winds subside and the offshore thermocline deepens. Additionally, the observed internal bores show a distinct asymmetry between the leading (gradual cooling with velocities directed onto the shelf) and trailing edges (sharp warming with velocities directed into the canyon). It appears that the semidiurnal internal tide at the canyon head is a first-order control on the delivery of subthermocline waters to the nearshore coastal environment at this location.",

            "abstract": "Airglow imaging provides a unique means by which to study many wave-related phenomena in the 80 to 100 km altitude regime. Observations reveal quasi-monochromatic disturbances associated with atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) as well as small-scale instabilities often called ripples. Ripples are wavelike features that resemble AGWs in appearance, but have short horizontal wavelengths (<15 km) and short lifetimes (a few tens of minutes). The end product of the breakdown of ripples is turbulence, leading to increased eddy diffusion. Thus, ripple observations may help refine our understanding of the occurrence of turbulence in the upper Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere.\nThe Aerospace Corporation's Nightglow Imager (ANI) is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory near the crest of Cerro Pachon, Chile. ANI observes nighttime OH emission (near 1.6 microns) every 2 seconds over an approximate 73 degree field of view, which allows the study of AGW and ripple features over very short temporal and spatial scales. An automated wave detection algorithm is used to identify ripple and quasi monochromatic wave features in the ANI data. Ripples are characterized by their wavelength, orientation, drift speed and location in the image. Quasi-monochromatic waves are quantified by wavelength, wave period and propagation direction. We present a climatology of ripple instabilities at Chile, including comparisons to the background quasi-monochromatic wave field. Lidar and radar data are used to determine the background wind and temperatures, which allows comparisons between ripple observations and evanescent regions and potentially unstable regions identified by Richardson number.",

            "abstract": "Water stress is one of the most important environmental factors that influence plant water dynamics. To prevent excessive water loss and physiological damage, plants can regulate transpiration by adjusting the stomatal aperture. This enhances survival, but also reduced photosynthesis and productivity. During periods of low water availability, stomatal regulation is a trade-off between optimization of either survival or production. Water stress defence mechanisms lead to significant changes in plant dynamics, e.g. leaf and stem water content. Recent research has shown that water content in a corn canopy can change up to 30% diurnally as a result of water stress, which has a considerable influence on radar backscatter from a corn canopy [1]. This highlighted the potential of water stress detection using radar. To fully explore the potential of water stress monitoring using radar, we need to understand the driving forces governing plant water potential. For this study, the recently developed the Finite-Element Tree-Crown Hydrodynamic model version 2 (FETCH2) model is applied to a corn canopy. FETCH2 is developed to resolve the hydrodynamic processes within a plant using the porous media analogy, allowing investigation of the influence of environmental stress factors on plant dynamics such as transpiration, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf and stem water content. The model is parameterized and evaluated using a detailed dataset obtained during a three-month field experiment in Flevoland, the Netherlands, on a corn canopy.\n [1] van Emmerik, T., S.

The current operational LST EDR for the recently launched Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership’s (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) payload utilizes a split-window algorithm that relies on previously-generated fixed emissivity dependent coefficients and does not produce a dynamically varying and multi-spectral land surface emissivity product. Furthermore, this algorithm deviates from its MODIS counterpart (MOD11) resulting in a discontinuity in the MODIS/VIIRS LST time series.\nThis study presents an alternative physics based algorithm for generation of the NASA VIIRS LST&E EDR in order to provide continuity with its MODIS counterpart algorithm (MOD21). The algorithm, known as temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, uses a fast radiative transfer model - Radiative Transfer for (A)TOVS (RTTOV) in combination with an emissivity calibration model to isolate the surface radiance contribution retrieving temperature and emissivity. Further, a new water-vapor scaling (WVS) method is developed and implemented to improve the atmospheric correction process within the TES system. An independent assessment of the VIIRS LST&E outputs is performed against in situ LST measurements and laboratory measured emissivity spectra samples over dedicated validation sites in the Southwest USA. Emissivity retrievals are also validated with the latest ASTER Global Emissivity Database Version 4 (GEDv4). An overview and current status of the algorithm as well as the validation results will be discussed.",

The focus was on the influence of biogenic-anthropogenic interactions on the measured aerosol particles, especially as related to the formation of organic PM. Through a combination of meteorology, emissions, and chemistry, the T3 research site (located 70 km downwind of Manaus) was affected by biogenic emissions from the tropical rainforest that were periodically mixed with urban outflow from the Manaus metropolitan area as well as with biomass burning plumes. Results from the T3 site are presented in the context of measurements at T0a (ATTO) and T2, representing predominantly clean and polluted conditions, respectively.\nAt T3, in the wet season (1/Feb - 31/Mar 2014) the non-refractory PM1 mass concentration had values on order of 1 to 2 μg m-3, while in the dry season (15/Aug - 15/Oct 2014) PM1was eight times higher. In both seasons, the organic component was dominant, contributing 80-85% by mass.The analysis of the results aims at delineating the anthropogenic impact on the measurements, especially focusing on anthropogenic sulfate as a mediator. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis is applied to the time series of organic mass spectra. The factors and their loadings provide information on the relative and time-varying contributions of different sources and processes of organic PM. A factor associated with secondary organic material produced from the reactive uptake of epoxydiols (a product of isoprene photooxidation under HO2-dominant conditions) is resolved for both seasons (hereafter, IEPOX-SOA). The time trends of the factors, especially of IEPOX-SOA, are investigated against co-located measurements, toward the goal of improving the understanding of anthropogenic influences on the mass concentrations and composition of PM1.",

            "abstract": "Although stresses from convective flow in the mantle should deflect Earth’s surface vertically, the amplitude of such deflections remains unclear despite their importance for historic shoreline and sea-level reconstruction. Indeed, obtaining topographic constraints on this dynamically-supported topography is challenging, especially on continents where isostatic topography is enlarged by the long and complicated history of tectonic deformation. In contrast, the well-understood half-space cooling of young seafloor offers a relatively weak filter for the signal of dynamic topography. In this study we attempt to constrain both the sources and scales of dynamic topography by comparing deviations in unperturbed seafloor bathymetry with predictions of dynamic topography from a numerical mantle flow model. Here we define unperturbed seafloor as regions free from the direct influence of volcanic hotspots, oceanic plateaus, tectonic plate boundaries, or sub-lithospheric thermal alteration. We identify dynamic deflections of the seafloor by focusing on regions where normal seafloor resides on both sides of a mid-ocean ridge, specifically across the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of the Icelandic hotspot. Across both mid-ocean ridges the magnitude of the subsidence is greater in the direction of South America than away from it, which is consistent with long-wavelength dynamic subsidence of the seafloor above subduction-induced mantle downwelling. We compared models of dynamic topography driven by both negative and positive density heterogeneity (which induce upwelling and downwelling, respectively) in both the upper and lower mantle to the asymmetrical seafloor subsidence across these mid-ocean ridges. We used spherical harmonics up to degree eight for each model prediction of dynamic topography, and found that peak-to-peak amplitudes of 700-1200m sourced mainly from density contrasts in the lower mantle best explain the observed ridge asymmetries. Dynamic topography of this magnitude and pattern is best explained as being supported by active downwelling associated with subducted slabs in the lower mantle beneath eastern Asia and the Americas, without significant contribution from active upwelling driven by the seismically slow regions beneath Africa and the central Pacific.",

There was no indication of leader advance along this prior channel earlier during the fourth RS. The fourth stroke involves a stepped leader that started from the end of an observed prior dart leader branch which did not previously propagate to ground. The concurrent M-component and dart leader are preceded by an in-cloud event evidenced by a large amplitude, fast electric field change pulse, at 6.1 km estimated altitude, inferred as the connection to the channel for the M-component. The M-component current apparently initiates the dart leader about 40 μs later. A visible channel length of 10,400 m allows for the 2-D propagation speed of the M-component luminosity to be estimated in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 × 108 m s-1. The concurrent dart leader travels a visible length of 3445 m with 2-D speed of 1.7 × 107 m s-1, similar to other dart leaders in this flash. Luminosity evolution along the channel through the RS and M-component will also be described.

Combining planktonic larval abundance estimates over the course of a year with concurrent temperature and current data, this study provides empirical data linking a locally predominant internal tidal feature to patterns of biological abundance in the very nearshore environment at the head of Monterey Submarine Canyon. The physical observations indicate the presence of seasonally-variable semidiurnal internal bores that result in the pumping of cold (subthermocline) waters onto the adjacent shelf. Analysis of the larval abundance data indicates an assemblage shift from a relatively abundant shelf assemblage of larval fishes to a reduced abundance assemblage that is concurrent with the semidiurnal cold water intrusions driven by the tidal pumping. Results suggest that the tidal period pumping of subthermocline waters by internal bores dilutes or displaces shelf waters and their associated planktonic larval community. This could have important ecological implications at these scales and may also be of interest when siting industrial facilities that require seawater for cooling or desalination, as it would potentially reduce their impact on regional planktonic communities by diluting their rates of entrainment.",

After 15 iterations, we have obtained a high-resolution transversely isotropic Earth model (M15) using traveltime data from 253 earthquakes.\nTo obtain higher resolution images of the emerging new features and to prepare the inversion for azimuthal anisotropy and anelasticity, we expanded the original dataset with approximately 4,220 additional global earthquakes (Mw5.5-7.0) --occurring between 1995 and 2014-- and downloaded 300-minute-long time series for all available data archived at the IRIS Data Management Center, ORFEUS, and F-net. Ocean Bottom Seismograph data from the last decade are also included to maximize data coverage.\nIn order to handle the huge dataset and solve the I/O bottleneck in global adjoint tomography, we implemented a python-based parallel data processing workflow based on the newly developed Adaptable Seismic Data Format (ASDF). With the help of the data selection tool MUSTANG developed by IRIS, we cleaned our dataset and assembled event-based ASDF files for parallel processing. We have started Centroid Moment Tensors (CMT) inversions for all 4,220 earthquakes with the latest model M15, and selected high-quality data for measurement. We will statistically investigate each channel using synthetic seismograms calculated in M15 for updated CMTs and identify problematic channels. In addition to data screening, we also modified the conventional multi-taper method to obtain better frequency-dependent measurements of surface-wave phase and amplitude anomalies, and therefore more accurate adjoint sources, which are particularly important for anelastic tomography. We present a summary of these data culling and processing procedures for global adjoint tomography.",

            "abstract": "In the six years from 2009 to 2014, there have been eight triggered flashes at the ICLRT, from a total of 125, in which a total of ten return stroke channel-base currents exhibited a dip 3.0 to 16.6 μs after the initial current peak. Close range electric field measurements show a related dip following the initial electric field peak, and electric field derivative measurements show an associated bipolar pulse, confirming that this phenomenon is not an instrumentation effect in the current measurement. For six of the eight flashes, high-speed video frames show what appears to be suspended sections of unexploded triggering wire at heights of about 150 to 300 m that are illuminated when the upward current wave reaches them. The suspended wire can act as an impedance discontinuity, perhaps as it explodes, and cause a downward reflection of some portion of the upward-propagating current wave. This reflected wave travels down the channel and causes the dip in the measured channel-base current when it reaches ground and reflects upward. The modified transmission line model with exponential decay (MTLE) is used to model the close electric field and electric field derivatives of the postulated initial and reflected current waves, starting with the measured channel base current, and the results are compared favorably with measurements made at distances ranging from 92 to 444 m. From the measured time between current impulse initiation and the time the current reflection reaches the channel base and the current dip initiates, along with the reflection height from the video records, we find the average return stroke current speed for each of the ten strokes to be from 0.28 to 1.9×108 ms-1, with an error of ±0.01×108 ms-1 due to a ±0.1 μs uncertainty in the measurement. This represents the first direct measurement of return stroke current speed, all previous return stroke speed measurements being derived from the luminosity of the process.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, collaborations between the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, the National Weather Service (NWS), and the USGS led to the incorporation of Earth remote sensing imagery within the NOAA/NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT). The DAT is a smartphone, tablet, and web-based application that allows NWS meteorologists to acquire, quality control, and manage various storm damage indicators following a severe weather event, such as a tornado, occurrence of widespread damaging winds, or significant hail. Earth remote sensing supports the damage assessment process by providing a broad overview of how various acquired damage indicators relate to scarring visible from space, ranging from high spatial resolution commercial imagery (~1-4m) acquired via USGS and in collaboration with other federal and private sector partners, to moderate resolution imaging from NASA sensors (~15-30m) such as those aboard Landsat 7 and 8 and Terra’s ASTER, to lower resolution but routine imaging from NASA’s Terra and Aqua MODIS, or the Suomi-NPP VIIRS instrument. In several cases, the acquisition and delivery of imagery in the days after a severe weather event has proven helpful in confirming or in some cases adjusting the preliminary damage track acquired during a ground survey. For example, limited road networks and access to private property may make it difficult to observe the entire length of a tornado track, while satellite imagery can fill in observation gaps to complete a more detailed damage track assessment. This presentation will highlight successful applications of Earth remote sensing for the improvement of damage surveys, discuss remaining challenges, and provide direction on future efforts that will improve the delivery of remote sensing data and use through new automation processes and training opportunities.",

            "abstract": "The validity of land biosphere model outputs rely on accurate representations of ecosystem processes within the model. Typically, a vegetation or land cover type for a given area (several Km squared or larger resolution), is assumed to have uniform properties. The limited spacial and temporal resolution of models prevents resolving finer scale heterogeneous flux patterns that arise from variations in vegetation. This representation error must be quantified carefully if models are informed through data assimilation in order to assign appropriate weighting of model outputs and measurement data. The representation error is usually only estimated or ignored entirely due to the difficulty in determining reasonable values. UAS based gas sensors allow measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations with unprecedented spacial resolution, providing a means of determining the representation error for CO2 fluxes empirically. In this study we use three dimensional CO2 concentration data in combination with high resolution footprint analyses in order to quantify the representation error for modelled CO2 fluxes for typical resolutions of regional land biosphere models. CO2 concentration data were collected using an Atlatl X6A hexa-copter, carrying a highly calibrated closed path infra-red gas analyzer based sampling system with an uncertainty of ≤ ±0.2 ppm CO2. Gas concentration data was mapped in three dimensions using the UAS on-board position data and compared to footprints generated using WRF 3.61.\nChad Hanson, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR\nAndres Schmidt, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR\nBev Law, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR\n ",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of atmospheric temperature extremes is encoded in the tails of the probability distribution and is thus highly dependent on the degree and type of non-normality of that distribution. We use cumulants and higher order spectra to assess non-normality in radiosonde temperature data. For seasonal temperature anomalies, the convergence pattern is consistent with the Hasselmann paradigm of an autoregressive order one process (AR1) forced with non-normal innovations. An AR1 process forced with normal innovations can be rejected as inconsistent with radiosonde temperature observations. Previously observed features such as a variability that is normally distributed on particular time-scales or a parabolic relation between skewness and kurtosis can be explained as artifacts of filtering or sampling procedures. A ubiquitous technique for isolating physical processes is the use of linear band-pass filters or moving averages that remove variability outside of a prescribed frequency band. However, in the spectral domain non-normality is encoded in phase relations between frequencies across the full spectrum, and we show how linear filtering imposes a predictable tendency towards normality by preferentially decaying the higher order cumulants. Our results suggest that non-normality is introduced at the shortest time-scales resolved in daily temperature records, and normality on any particular narrow time scales is an artifact of filtering. As a consequence, it is important to have a sufficiently large spectral band, as controlled by the record’s resolution and duration, in order to properly constrain non-normality in atmospheric temperature variability.",

            "abstract": "Did humans affect global climate over the before the Industrial Era? While this question is hotly debated, the co-evolution of humans and the natural environment over the last 11,700 years had an undisputed role in influencing the development and present state of terrestrial ecosystems. Yet we still have a very incomplete picture of human-environment interactions over the Holocene. In order to address this lack of understanding, both bottom-up and top-down approaches have been used to reconstruct past human impact on the global carbon cycle and climate. Top-down approaches rely on the analysis of the concentrations and isotopic signature of trace gases trapped in polar ice to identify human contributions to atmospheric composition. Bottom-up approaches combine historical and archaeological data to reconstruct land use, and using these reconstructions drive earth system models that simulate carbon cycling and climate. Recently a number of studies, both top-down and bottom-up, have shed new light on the role of land use influencing the carbon cycle and climate over the preindustrial Holocene.\nIce core studies generally suggested that late Holocene CO2 was driven by natural fluctuations in climate and ocean circulation. The evidence from bottom-up studies is more nuanced. Most scenarios of Holocene anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) tend to agree in the net magnitude of deforestation at AD 1850. But ALCC scenarios vary widely in the timing of deforestation over the course of the preindustrial Holocene. These differences lead to multiple plausible explanations to the atmospheric composition record, including scenarios that allow for a substantial amount of anthropogenic deforestation in preindustrial time. Uncertainty in our understanding of preindustrial ALCC also leads to large differences in the estimated importance of land use on climate earlier in the Holocene. For example, modelling experiments performed for Europe representing conditions at the peak of the Roman Empire show potentially large impacts of land use on regional climate. The wide variety of results gained so far from ALCC and climate modelling experiments shows that the question of “how much did humans influence the state of the Earth System before the Industrial Revolution?” is far from being resolved.",

            "abstract": "Over 700 individual iceberg scours have been identified in seafloor bathymetry spanning the southern U.S. Atlantic margin, from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to the Florida Keys, in water depths from 170-380m. These iceberg scours represent the plowing path of iceberg keels transported southward along the margin in a cold, coastal boundary current derived from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Despite limited regional multibeam bathymetry data, the scours are traceable along the seafloor for >30 km and exhibit characteristic morphology of iceberg keel marks documented along glaciated continental margins. Many of the scours are flanked by lateral berms that are several meters high and often terminate in semi-circular pits ringed by several meter high ridges (i.e. grounding pits or iceberg plow ridges). The scours decrease in size and abundance moving southward, in accordance with increased iceberg melting farther from the ice calving margin. For example, the scours offshore of South Carolina (~32.5°N) are ~10–100m wide and incised 10–20m into the sediment, whereas scours off the Florida margin (31°N– 24.5°N) are narrower (10–50m wide) and incised 2–5m into the sea floor. Icebergs at these subtropical latitudes would likely have been comparable in size (up 300 m thick) to those calving from the modern-day Greenland Ice Sheet margin. Results from numerical simulations using MITgcm, a high-resolution, eddy-permitting, coupled ice-ocean model configured for the LGM suggest that cold, freshwater and small (≤90m thick) icebergs could have seasonally drifted to South Carolina, but iceberg transport to southern Florida requires much larger (5Sv) meltwater floods to overcome the northward flowing Gulf Stream. These meltwater flood events would most likely have been short-lived (<1 yr), but may have diverted a significant volume of freshwater away from the subpolar regions into the subtropical North Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "In California, in 2014, every barrel of oil produced also produced 16 barrels of water. Approximately 3.2 billion barrels of water were co-produced with California oil in 2014. Half of California’s produced water is generally used for steam and water injection for enhanced oil recovery. The other half (~215,000 acre-feet of water) is available for potential reuse. Concerns about the severe drought, groundwater depletion, and contamination have prompted petroleum operators and water districts to examine the recycling of produced water. Knowledge of the geochemistry of produced waters is valuable in determining the feasibility of produced water reuse. Water with low salinity can be reclaimed for use outside of the petroleum industry (e.g. irrigation, municipal uses, and industrial operations). Since a great proportion of California petroleum wells have produced water with relatively low salinity (generally 10,000-40,000 mg/L TDS), reclaiming produced water could be important as a drought mitigation strategy, especially in the parched southern San Joaquin Valley with many oil fields.\nThe USGS Produced Waters Geochemical Database, available at http://eerscmap.usgs.gov/pwapp, will facilitate studies on the management of produced water for reclamation in California. Expanding on the USGS 2002 database, we have more accurately located California wells. We have added new data for 300 wells in the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles Basin for a total of ~ 1100 wells in California. In addition to the existing (2002) geochemical analyses of major ions and total dissolved solids, the new data also include geochemical analyses of minor ions and stable isotopes. We have added an interactive web map application which allows the user to filter data on chosen fields (e.g. TDS < 35,000 mg/L). Using the web map application as well as more in-depth investigation on the full data set can provide critical insight for better management of produced waters in water-constrained California.",

            "abstract": "Totten Glacier, East Antarctica, a glacier that holds a 3.9 m sea level change equivalent, has thinned and lost mass for decades. Observed thinning by satellite altimeters is concentrated in areas of fast flow, hence is probably of dynamic origin. In this study, we derive time series of ice velocity from Landsat and interferometric (InSAR) data (ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-1, ALOS PALSAR, TanDEM/TerraSAR-X and COSMO-Skymed) for the past two decades. We find significant speed-up in ice velocity, especially in 2002-2007, followed by a period of slow decrease in 2010-2014. Comparing the results with RACMO2 surface mass balance suggests that the glacier mass balance was already negative in 1996 and became more negative into the 2000s. To examine the stability of the glacier, we develop high-resolution topographies of the ice surface and ice bottom using NASA Operation IceBridge data, TanDEM-X data, InSAR ice velocities and a mass conservation method. The results reveal a 1,500-2,300 m deep grounding zone that extends 15 km inland along two prominent side lobes grounded only 15-50 m above hydrostatic equilibrium, or ice plain. At the glacier center, we detect a 1-3±0.12 km retreat of the grounding line by comparing differential InSAR data acquired 17 years apart. The retreat is asymmetrical along the two lobes, but consistently indicates a total thinning of 12 m from 1996 to 2013. On the ice plain, the glacier is prone to rapid retreat around a region about 7 km long, but inland the bed elevation rises. Sustained thinning will cause further retreat and probably speed up, but will not be conducive to a marine- instability. The ultimate cause of the changes is not known, but probably of oceanic origin, with most changes taking place in 2002-2007. ",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic habitat models, which are logistically and technically challenging and expensive to produce, are frequently transferred between rivers without validation. Although this is known to be associated with problems, few studies have assessed the potential consequences for model predictions. This study investigated the local (within sub-catchment) transfer of hydraulic habitat models developed for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fry. Detailed 2D hydraulic models were developed for two adjacent reaches, each containing pool, riffle, glide and run habitats where salmon fry were stocked at uniform saturated densities. Substrate and cover were characterised using transects. Generalised Additive Models (GAM’s) were fitted to seasonal fry abundance data, with Froude number, dominant substrate and cover included as predictor variables. Despite attempts to select reaches with similar characteristics, the spatial distribution of Froude, dominant substrate and cover differed, with substrate and cover exhibiting the greatest inter-reach differences. Froude was the most important individual predictor of fry abundance, with the highest densities observed at moderate Froude across all seasons. When transferred between reaches, models which contained multiple predictor variables and their interactions transferred less well than models containing Froude alone potentially reflecting inter-reach differences in the distribution of substrate and cover. This study suggests that (1) habitat models should be developed at sites offering maximum environmental complexity at a local level (2) scientists and managers should avoid transferring models between locations with different environmental characteristics, especially in the absence of model validation (3) complex models should be avoided (4) the transferability of Froude only models should be further investigated, if predictions of habitat quality are to be made at new sites.",

            "abstract": "Two possible hydrous reservoirs in the deep mantle have been suggested from mineral physics and/or geochemical experiments, which are the mantle transition zone and the core-mantle boundary (CMB) region [Bercovici and Karato, 2003; Hirshmann, 2006; Nishi et al., 2014; Ohira et al, 2014; Pamato et al., 2015]. To understand and quantify how these reservoirs might form and be preserved, however, requires global-scale mantle dynamics models that include some form of water migration process. Recently, Nakagawa et al. [2015] has provided the first global-scale models that include a simplified water cycle in numerical mantle convection simulations. These calculations suggest that dehydration-hydration processes may play a crucial role. However, that study did not include important processes related to partial melting, such as degassing-regassing and partitioning of water into the molten material. Here we present new numerical models that incorporate dehydration-hydration, degassing-regassing and water partitioning effects. A parameter study of those effects suggests that the dehydration-hydration process may still be the most crucial for developing two hydrous reservoirs in the deep mantle simultaneously. In addition, when dehydration-hydration is included, the residual water content in solid mantle is obtained as ~ 1 ocean mass. This result is consistent with experimental constraints [e.g. Hirshmann, 2006]. Without dehydration, the mean water content of the mantle is an order of magnitude higher in the models. Whether the mantle transition zone provides a significant reservoir for water, depends on the rheological properties of hydrous minerals as they a strongly control temperature in the mantle [Nakagawa et al., 2015]. However, hydrous reservoirs in the CMB region can be found, which are not dependent on the specific water migration mechanism.",

            "abstract": "We present a noble gas study in glacial meltwater (GMW) from the Greenland Ice Sheet. It explores the information noble gases can provide in glacial environments with respect to GMW sources, relative source contributions, water residence times, and spatial locations where this GMW originates within the ice sheet. This study seeks to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the ice sheets, critical for the major role they play in climate change. This is possible due to the conservative nature of noble gases and the temperature dependency of their concentrations in water in equilibrium with the atmosphere (ASW) which allows estimation of the altitude at which GMW originated. In addition, crustal He accumulates in water over time, allowing for estimation of water residence times.\nGMW samples were collected at five locations in southern Greenland. Results show that the major source of subglacial meltwater is ASW rather than old, compressed glacial ice, which has a distinct noble gas signature not seen in our samples. Given that, GMW samples do deviate to a certain extent from ASW, with concentrations displaying two distinct patterns. The first one presents a relative Ar enrichment with respect to Ne, Kr, and Xe, first observed in high-altitude springs in the Galápagos Islands (Warrier et al., 2012). The second one displays a mass-dependent pattern, first observed in Michigan rainwater (Warrier et al., 2013). Ne and Xe analysis suggests that about half of the samples equilibrated at a temperature of ~0°C and altitudes between 1 km and 2 km, with a few samples pointing to lower equilibration altitudes and temperatures between 2°C and 5°C. Two samples suggest an origin as melted ice and lack of equilibration with surface conditions. He concentrations vary between 1.1 and 7 times that of ASW and suggest glacial meltwater ages between 100 and 3600 yrs, a result that is consistent with a preliminary 3H analysis.\n",

            "abstract": "The 4th IPCC report highlighted our limited understanding of Himalayan glacier behavior and contribution to the region’s hydrology. Seasonal snow and glacier melt in the Himalayas are important sources of water, but estimates greatly differ about the actual contribution of melted glacier ice to stream discharge. A more comprehensive understanding of the contribution of glaciers to stream discharge is needed because streams being fed by glaciers affect the livelihoods of a large part of the world’s population. Most of the streams in the Himalayas are unmonitored because in situ measurements are logistically difficult and costly. This necessitates the use of remote sensing platforms to obtain estimates of river discharge for validating hydrological models.\n In this study, we estimate stream discharge using cost-effective methods via repeat satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and SENTINEL-1A sensors. The methodology is based on previous studies, which show that ratio values from optical satellite bands correlate well with measured stream discharge. While similar, our methodology relies on significantly higher resolution imagery (30 m) and utilizes bands that are in the blue and near-infrared spectrum as opposed to previous studies using 250 m resolution imagery and spectral bands only in the near-infrared. Higher resolution imagery is necessary for streams where the source is a glacier’s terminus because the width of the stream is often only 10s of meters. We validate our methodology using two rivers in the state of Kansas, where stream gauges are plentiful. We then apply our method to the Bhagirathi River, in the North-Central Himalayas, which is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and has a well monitored stream gauge. The analysis will later be used to couple river discharge and glacier flow and mass balance through an integrated hydrologic model in the Bhagirathi Basin.",

            "abstract": "In alpine regions, snow delays hydrological responses to precipitation and controls initiation and length of the growing season. Therefore, precise simulations of snow accumulation and melt are crucial for understanding hydrological dynamics and predicting hydrologic response from watersheds. These predictions are important for water resource management and for ecological studies of vegetation distribution, growth and for wildlife habitat. Snow models require fine temporal resolution of meteorological inputs to capture diurnal changes. However, lack of meteorological data at fine-temporal resolution may force the use of coarser than hourly data. The objective of this work is to understand what sort of information can be lost over the watershed depending on the temporal resolution of meteorological inputs, for a range of hydroclimatic and topographic conditions. To address this goal, a spatially distributed and physics-based snow model (iSnobal) was run using 1-, 3- and 6-hourly meteorological inputs for a wet, average and a dry year over Boise River Basin (BRB), Idaho, USA. Simulated snow variables such as Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and Surface Water Input (SWI – melt draining from the snowcover plus rain on bare ground) were averaged over 3 elevation bands including rain dominated (≤1400m), rain-snow transition (>1400 and ≤1900m) and snow dominated (>1900m). Except at the rain dominated band, using 6-hr inputs causes considerable overestimation of SWE and SWI, particularly in the wet year. The results show that at the rain-snow transition and snow dominated bands at least 3-hr meteorological data are necessary for snow modeling, due to strong diurnal changes in meteorological variables at these elevations. However, using course temporal resolution data for the rain dominated band made only a small difference in results.",

Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic controlling factors are identified that favor double ITCZ.

We are developing methods to monitor the microseismically active zone so that we can identify faults at risk of slipping.\nWe are using the Virtual Seismometer Method (VSM), which is an interferometric technique that is very sensitive to the source parameters (location, mechanism and magnitude) and to the earth structure in the source region. Given an ideal geometry, that is, when two quakes are roughly in line with a recording station, the correlation of their waveforms provide a precise estimate of the Green's function between them, modified by their source mechanisms. When measuring microseismicity, this geometry is rarely ideal and we need to account for variations in the geometry as well. VSM enables us to virtually place seismometers inside a micro events cloud, where we can focus on properties directly between induced micro events, and doing so, monitor the evolution of the seismicity and precisely image potential fault zones. Here, we show that the cross-correlated signals recorded at the surface are a combination of the strain field between two sources times a moment tensor. Based on this relationship, we demonstrate how we can use this measured cross-correlated signal to invert for focal mechanism.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "The identification of preferential flow paths, their connectivity and their hydraulic properties in fractured rocks is critical for fluid flow and solute transport. Classical hydraulic tests allow defining a mean effective aperture based on simplified fracture models. Here we study the potential of using shear-thinning fluids as “smart” tracers to infer the distribution of fracture hydraulic properties. The main hypothesis considers that the flow of a shear-thinning fluid will sample specific pathways of the network as the fluid presents more viscous-shear behaviors. The flow field distribution of shear-thinning fluids in a 2D parallel fracture is first investigated numerically by implementing a viscous-shear model on classical flow equations. The relationship between fracture aperture and the degree of the flow enhancement due to the thinning behavior is quantified - given by the ratio between the non-Newtonian fluid average velocity and its corresponding Newtonian fluid at viscosity. A dimensionless solution describing the flow enhancement with respect to fracture aperture is derived from the theory. We also examine the impact of multiple fracture setups on the flow field redistribution in radial flow condition. Two main fracture configurations that can be found in a real network are considered: fractures organized in series and in parallel. We describe different flow enhancement behaviors controlled by the power exponent of the fluid and the fracture geometry. In perspective, some first experimental results are introduced that will guide the development of an inverse modelling framework.",

Whether a cusp structure is spatial or temporal is an important question because these structures reveal the spatial and temporal nature of magnetopause reconnection. We study temporal cusp ion signatures and their relation to the magnetopause processes during northward IMF using the Open Global Geospace Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) and the Liouville Theorem Particle Tracer (LTPT). OpenGGCM produces dayside reconnection within the framework of resistive MHD, while the LTPT calculates cusp ion signatures caused by the simulated reconnection. Our model produces temporal cusp ion dispersions with ion energies that increase with decreasing latitude during northward IMF, although these signatures are commonly associated with subsolar reconnection during southward IMF. We investigate which magnetopause process is responsible for the temporal cusp signatures.",

            "abstract": "Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most abundant carboxylic acids in the atmosphere, and a dominant source of acidity in the global troposphere. Recent work has revealed a major gap in our present understanding of the atmospheric formic acid budget, with observed concentrations much larger than can be reconciled with current estimates of its sources. In this work, we employ new space-based observations from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite instrument with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to better quantify the source of atmospheric formic acid from biomass burning, and assess the degree to which this source can help close the large budget gap for this species. The space-based formic acid data reveal a severe model underestimate for HCOOH that is most prominent over tropical biomass burning regions, indicating a major missing source of organic acids from fires. Based on two independent methods for inferring the fractional contribution of fires to the measured HCOOH abundance, we find that the pyrogenic HCOOH:CO enhancement ratio measured by TES (including direct emissions plus secondary production) is 5-10 times higher than current estimates of the direct emission ratio, providing evidence of substantial secondary production of HCOOH in fire plumes. We further show that current models significantly underestimate (by a factor of 2-6) the total primary and secondary source of HCOOH from tropical fires.",

The present study explores a the role of ocean model resolution (100 km to 10 km) on baseline physical and biogeochemical simulation characteristics and their response to climate change. We find the high resolution model to improve the representation of boundary currents and mesoscale phenomena, and to eliminate fictitious current structures that plague the coarse resolution models. Along with these expected improvements of smaller scales however, we also find a general lack of improvement in many of the large scale biases. With respect to sensitivity, we find the high resolution model to restrict ocean heat uptake towards the surface ocean and to exhibit somewhat less structure at the regional scale than the coarse resolution model. We find similarly more uniform patterns of carbon uptake and biogeochemicel response at high resolution consistent with a greater tendency in the high resolution model to accommodate change in the major current structures, and suggesting that some of the highly regional structure observed among CMIP5 models is due to their inability to represent the role of the mesoscale on the regional scale.",

Mitigation of atmospheric nitrogen deposition requires emissions characterization and quantification. Ammonia (NH3), a full suite of gas-phase oxidized nitrogen compounds, and particulate matter were measured from an aircraft that flew downwind from concentrated animal feeding operations, oil and gas extraction facilities, and urban areas along the Colorado Front Range in March and April 2015, as part of the Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) field study. Additionally, NH3 measurements from a fully instrumented aircraft that flew over the same region in July and August 2014 as part of the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) are used to examine atmospheric nitrogen emission and transport. Cross-wind plume transects and altitude profiles were performed over the source regions and 60-240 km downwind. Plumes were transported in the boundary layer with large NH3 mixing ratios (typically 20-100 ppbv) and were tens of km wide. The NH3 in these plumes provided an atmospheric nitrogen burden greater than 0.2 kg N/ha. Nitrogen oxides and their oxidation products and particulate matter were also enhanced in the plumes, but with concentrations substantially less than NH3. With efficient transport followed by wet deposition, these plumes have the potential to provide a large nitrogen input to the neighboring Rocky Mountain National Park, where nitrogen deposition currently exceeds the ecological critical load of 1.5 kg N/ha/yr.",

            "abstract": "Helium isotope ratios higher than the upper mantle value of 8 ± 1RA (RA = air 3He/4He) are unambiguous tracers of deep mantle (plume) volatile input in lavas and geothermal fluids from Ethiopia and Afar. However the significance of the surface distribution of He isotope ratios in terms of plume structure and melt distribution has received little attention. Recent seismic studies of this segment of the East African Rift give greatly improved lateral resolution of velocity anomalies allowing, for the first time, a detailed comparison of He isotope variations and tomographic imaging of melts, which presumably act to supply heat, mass and volatiles to the surface.\nTo produce a detailed map of He isotope ratios of the region, we generated 94 new high quality He measurements of fluid inclusions in mafic phenocrysts from lavas sampled along (and off) the axis of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and Afar. Our contribution nearly doubles the existing dataset. Now, ~95% of the region from Chamo Lake through Afar including flood basalts on the flank of the MER – an area of ~400 000 km2– falls within 90 km of a He isotope measurement. This allows us to compare the spatial distribution of He isotope ratios from young lavas with the pattern of upper mantle S-wave velocity anomalies (Hammond et al. 2013) to determine how regions of low velocity (high melt content) correlate with He isotope ratios.\nWe find that regions of higher 3He/4He ratios – up to 19 RA – correlate with anomalously low velocities at 75 km (i.e. shallow mantle) depth, and sites with low He isotope ratios cluster in higher velocity regions. Sustained upwelling and impingement of a deep mantle plume could explain this spatial correlation; however recent seismic evidence suggests shallow decompression melting accounts for most current volcanism in the MER and Afar (Rychert et al. 2012). Elevated He isotope ratios may therefore reflect shallow remobilization of stalled, undegassed plume material in the absence of a persistent deep volatile source. However this would require deep mantle He to remain in the shallow mantle for timescales on the order of 30 Myr., the approximate time since flood basalt cessation. The spatial correlation between He isotope ratios and seismic velocity anomalies therefore has profound implications for volatile cycling in the mantle and release at rift zones.",

            "abstract": "In the subalpine zone of the Colorado Front Range, field observations suggest that the Northern Pocket Gopher acts as a significant geomorphic agent within meadows, but not within forests. Field surveys during 2014 and 2015 demonstrate that the temporal and spatial digging patterns of gopher-excavated mounds and infilled tunnels are neither steady nor uniform. These include 1) gophers spend the winter near the forest-meadow (FM) edge and the remainder of the year within the meadow, and 2) surface mound generation greatly accelerates in late summer. Hourly subsurface temperatures across the FM pair, and daily digital snow depths at the FM boundary suggest that gophers spend the winter beneath thick snow cover where ground temperatures are warmest. LiDAR-based topography demonstrates that slopes are uniform across the FM pairs, diverging from that expected by extrapolation of the observed pattern of non-uniform geomorphic activity. The topography therefore suggests that the FM boundaries are not stationary. We hypothesize that the landscape is more uniformly impacted by gopher activity in the long term, which requires that 1) FM boundaries migrate significantly and/or 2) meadows are born in different places following forest death via fire followed by rapid gopher habitation.\nThe vertical geomorphic signature of gopher activity is more distinct. Preliminary probing of meadows reveals a 20 cm thick biomantle with a high concentration of stones at ~20 cm depth. The annual surface areas of mounds and infilled tunnels suggest that the entire meadow can be exposed to excavated tillings on century timescales. Further, annual mound volumes suggest that the biomantle is turned over also on century timescales. We will report results of stone line surveys and 137Cs concentration profiles within the forest and meadow that will test the long-term stability of meadows and the timescale over which vertical churning mixes the near-surface material within this landscape.",

            "abstract": "Many streams in the western United States (US) are listed as impaired by mercury (Hg), and it is important to understand the magnitudes of the various sources in order to implement management strategies. Atmospheric deposition of Hg and can be a major source of aquatic contamination, along with mine wastes, and other sources. Prior studies in the eastern US have shown that streams deliver less than 50% of the atmospherically deposited Hg on an annual basis. In this study, we compared annual stream Hg loads for 20 watersheds in the western US to measured wet and modeled dry deposition. Land use varies from undisturbed to mixed (agricultural, urban, forested, mining). Data from the Mercury Deposition Network was used to estimate Hg input from precipitation. Dry deposition was not directly measured, but can be modeled using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model. At an undeveloped watershed in the Rocky Mountains, the ratio of stream Hg load to atmospheric deposition was 0.2 during a year of average precipitation. In contrast, at the Carson River in Nevada, with known Hg contamination from historical silver mining with Hg amalgamation, stream export exceeded atmospheric deposition by a factor of 60, and at a small Sierran watershed with gold mining, the ratio was 70. Larger watersheds with mixed land uses, tend to have lower ratios of stream export relative to atmospheric deposition suggesting storage of Hg. The Sacramento River was the largest watershed for which Hg riverine loads were available with an average ratio of stream Hg export to atmospheric deposition of 0.10. Although Hg was used in upstream historical mining operations, the downstream river Hg load is partially mitigated by reservoirs, which trap sediment. This study represents the first compilation of riverine Hg loads in comparison to atmospheric deposition on a regional scale; the approach may be useful in assessing the relative importance of atmospheric and non-atmospheric Hg sources.",

            "abstract": "The incompressible assumption is widely used for studying the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and is generally accepted when the Mach number < ~0.3 (velocity < ~100 m/s). Since the tips of modern wind turbine blades can reach and exceed this threshold, neglecting air compressibility will introduce errors. In addition, if air incompressibility does not hold, then the Boussinesq approximation, by which air density is treated as a constant except in the gravity term of the Navier-Stokes equation, is also invalidated. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework, called NINB for Non-Incompressible Non-Boussinesq, in which air is not considered incompressible and air density is treated as a non-turbulent 4D variable. First, the NINB mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations are developed using Reynolds averaging. Second, numerical simulations of the NINB equations, coupled with a k-epsilon turbulence model, are performed with the finite-volume method. Wind turbines are modeled with the actuator-line model using SOWFA (Software for Offshore/onshore Wind Farm Applications). Third, NINB results are compared with the traditional incompressible buoyant simulations performed by SOWFA with the same set up.\nThe results show differences between NINB and traditional simulations in the neutral atmosphere with a wind turbine. The largest differences in wind speed (up to 1 m/s), turbulent kinetic energy (~10%), dissipation rate (~5%), and shear stress (~10%) occur near the turbine tip region. The power generation differences are 5-15% (depending on setup). These preliminary results suggest that compressibility effects are non-negligible around wind turbines and should be taken into account when forecasting wind power. Since only a few extra terms are introduced, the NINB framework may be an alternative to the traditional incompressible Boussinesq framework for studying the turbulent ABL in general (i.e., without turbines) in the absence of shock waves.",

            "abstract": "Long-term fault slip rates typically are assumed to sum to total plate velocity in kinematic models of strike-slip plate boundaries. However, in several locations in southern California, slip rates determined from geodetic data differ from geologic estimates. That sites of geologic investigation are not uniformly distributed along fault systems may compound these discrepancies. For example, releasing steps where sediment accumulates and leaves a continuous record of slip are favored trenching sites, but may not yield representative rates. We investigate the influence of site location on slip rate with: 1) a parametric study of step geometry using 2D mechanical models and 2) case studies of active southern California faults using 3D models. The suite of 2D models reveals how fault length, friction and step geometry (fault overlap and perpendicular separation) affect fault slip and off-fault strain over geologic time scales. We determine the probability that a site along the fault will reveal a representative rate (i.e. mean ± 1 mm/yr) and calculate each system’s kinematic efficiency. We find that the probability of sampling a representative slip rate is greater along short faults, due to the low overall slip magnitudes relative to typical errors. For longer faults the probability of sampling a representative rate is much less and more strongly controlled by step geometry. Faults with longer segments are most efficient, accommodating ~56-86% of plate displacement. For fault segments with no overlap, steps with the smallest separation are most efficient, whereas for overlapping segments, maximum efficiency occurs at larger separations. Systems with short segments, large overlap and small spacing are the least efficient, accommodating as little as 24% of plate displacement. Geologic slip rates from within the releasing steps along the San Jacinto Fault in southern California show reduced rates relative to other sites. This is consistent with the results of 3D models of the Elsinore and San Jacinto faults undertaken for this study. We find that rates within the step are within mean values for the faults, while those along the segments are not. The results of this study suggest that sites located in steps between long fault segments are most likely to yield representative geologic slip rate estimates.",

            "abstract": "Decades of aerosol measurements on Barbados and Miami have yielded a broad picture of African mineral dust transport to the Caribbean Basin. These measurements show that in summer the aerosol mass is often dominated by dust. At such times over 90% of the dust mass is comprised of particles less than 10 µm aerodynamic diameter and thus fits the EPA criteria for PM10. A number of sites in the Caribbean monitor PM10 using the same instrumentation commonly deployed in European and United States networks. By comparing data from individual islands that have multiple monitoring sites (e.g., Puerto Rico, Martinique, Guadeloupe), it is shown that during dust events PM10 concentrations track very closely and that local sources have a minor impact on PM10 above about 15 to 20 µg m-3. Moreover the PM10 measurements are coherent with the movement of dust clouds over the islands as observed by satellites. In this way dust movement can be tracked at PM10 sites along the Gulf and southeast coasts of the United States. To assess the specific impact of African dust on PM10 in the region, I compare the daily records of dust measurements at Miami and Barbados with concurrent measurements made at proximate PM10 sites. I then use these relationships and the long term dust measurements at Barbados and Miami to assess the long-term variability of PM10 across the region. At Barbados the record goes back 50 years and provides a basis of assessing the effects of climate variability on PM10 transport. This study shows that there is great variability on scales ranging from daily to decadal. The impact of the droughts in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant. Across the Caribbean, the rates of exceedances of the WHO PM10 guideline is comparable to those observed in many major urban areas in Europe and the US. The dominance of dust in large PM10 events and the absence of major pollution sources on many islands offers the opportunity to study the health impacts of desert dust in local populations with a minimal affects from confounding aerosol sources.",

            "abstract": "In space plasmas, collisions between constituent particles are usually negligible. Moreover, how to cause plasma mixing across different plasma regimes has been one of the fundamental problems in the plasma universe. At a plasma boundary where different plasma regimes are in contact, there often exists a velocity shear and a density gradient. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been studied as a promising mechanism to cause the plasma mixing. Although the importance of the density gradient has previously been pointed out, the structure of large-density gradient boundaries remains unknown due to lack of observations. Based on plasma observations at Mars by MAVEN, we show here that the real structure of velocity-sheared boundaries with a 3-order density gradient has a fundamental difference from the traditional input model used in various simulation studies. We propose a new boundary model adopting entropy considerations to agree with the new observations. Comparison of MHD simulation results with the two different initial conditions shows that the change in the initial condition alters the time evolution of KHI and it can potentially affect the escape rate of cold ionospheric ions. The effects on KHI also depend on the magnitude of the density gradient across the boundary. Particularly in high density gradient case with a density ratio of 5000, KHI cannot develop in the traditional boundary model. On the other hand, KHI can be excited in our realistic new model due to the difference in compressibility effects at the velocity shear layer.",

            "abstract": "Reactive transport problems are highly complex and contain a large number of factors that influence the temporal evolution of the system. Physical and chemical heterogeneity, mixing, and even the dimensionality of the system are all known to be important considerations but one important factor that has received comparatively little attention is the initial condition (IC). Oftentimes a single configuration for the IC is selected for a particular study and the other aspects of the problem are varied, but the sensitivity of the problem to perturbations in that IC is not addressed. This work specifically considers how minor changes to the IC affect a mixing limited reactive transport system.\nA relatively simple flow field is used to investigate changes in global reaction rates for a single, interface-mixing type transport problem. The IC is rotated to several different orientations for the simulations, each having identical reactant masses and initial particle distributions. Reactions are simulated using a Lagrangian, colocation based model that does not assume the reaction system is well mixed. The effects of the rotations on the mixing and reaction rates are variable, manifesting mostly as an increase in product formation relative to pure diffusion, but some configurations inhibit reactions at early times. The orientation of the interface relative to the directions of deformation and the velocity can be used to predict whether reactions rates will increase or decrease, relative to a deformation free flow. The same numerical experiments are then conducted in a transient, periodic shear flow, which exhibits similar results. Both sets of results have implications about how reaction rates should be upscaled and suggest that the configuration of the IC may be as important as proper characterization of the subsurface when considering reactions in complex systems.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between flow hydrodynamics and bedform characteristics at the transition between upper plane-bed bedload transport regime and sheet-flow have not yet been thoroughly described and still remain poorly understood. The present study focuses on the experimental study of this transition in open channel mode. The experiments were performed in the hydraulic laboratory of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the University of South Carolina in a sediment-feed flume, 9-m long by 19-cm wide with uniform material sediment of geometric mean grain size diameter of 1.11 mm. Sediment feed rates ranged between 0.5 kg/min and 20 kg/min with two different flow rates of 20 l/s and 30 l/s. We recorded periodic measurements of water surface and bed elevation to estimate the global flow parameters, e.g. mean flow velocity and bed shear stress, and to determine when the flow and the sediment transport reached conditions of mobile bed equilibrium. We define mobile bed equilibrium as a condition in which the mean bed elevation does not change in time. At equilibrium, measurements of bed elevation fluctuations were taken with an ultrasonic transducer system at six discrete locations. In the runs with low and medium feed rates, i.e. smaller than ~12 kg/min, the long wavelength and small amplitude bedforms typical of the upper plane bed regime, which were observed in previous experimental work, formed and migrated downstream. In particular, with increasing feed rates, the amplitude of the bedforms decreases and their geometry changes, from well-defined triangular shapes, to rounded shapes to flat bed with very small amplitude, long wavelength undulations. The decrease in amplitude corresponds to a decrease in form drag and an increase in the thickness of the bedload layer. The ultrasonic measurements are analyzed to statistically describe the observed transition in terms of probability distribution functions of the bed elevation fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "The current interest in human exploration of the Moon and other airless planetary bodies has rekindled research into the harmful effects of Lunar dust on human health. Our team has evaluated the spontaneous formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS; hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide) of a suite of lunar simulants when dispersed in deionized water. Of these species, hydroxyl radical reacts almost immediately with any biomolecule leading to oxidative damage. Sustained production of OH radical as a result of mineral exposure can initiate or enhance disease. The results in deionized water indicate that mechanical stress and the absence of molecular oxygen and water, important environmental characteristics of the lunar environment, can lead to enhanced production of ROS in general. On the basis of the results with deionized water, a few of the simulants were selected for additional studies to evaluate the formation of hydrogen peroxide, a precursor of hydroxyl radical in Simulated Lung Fluid. These simulants dispersed in deionized water typically produce a maximum in H2O2 within 10 to 40 minutes. However, experiments in SLF show a slow steady increase in H2O2 concentration that has been documented to continue for as long as 7 hours. Control experiments with one simulant demonstrate that the rise in H2O2 depends on the availability of dissolved O2. We speculate that this continuous rise in oxygenated SLF might be a result of metal ion-mediated oxidation of organic components, such as glycine in SLF. Ion-mediated oxidation essentially allows dissolved molecular oxygen to react with dissolved organic compounds by forming a metal-organic complex. Results of separate experiments with dissolved Fe, Ni, and Cu and speciation calculations support this notion.",

            "abstract": "Cassini CIRS and Radio-Occultation measurements obtained in 2004-2015 have tracked the evolution of temperatures and winds in Titan’s polar atmosphere, as the winter season shifted from the northern hemisphere to the southern. The dissolution of the strong circumpolar vortex initially seen in the northern hemisphere has been gradual. There is no evidence of the rapid distortion and disruption forced by planetary waves that can occur on Earth. Indeed, neither Cassini experiment has identified any thermal signature attributable to planetary-scale waves. The south-polar region has turned wintry fairly abruptly: temperature and zonal wind maps from CIRS data show that the 1-mbar temperatures at high southern latitudes in late autumn are already much colder than those at the corresponding latitudes in the north in midwinter, when the first extensive polar measurements were obtained. The south-polar region now has a strong circumpolar vortex, with maximum stratospheric winds occurring near 60° S, in contrast to the northern hemisphere in winter, where the polar vortex was much broader, extending to 20°-30° N. Potential vorticity maps now indicate steep meridional gradients at high southern latitudes, implying a barrier to efficient mixing between the polar region and lower latitudes. Radio-occultations have higher vertical resolution than CIRS, and they have recently probed latitudes as high as 65° in both hemispheres (latitudes closer to the pole are precluded because of the geometry of Earth occultations and the season). Above 80 km at these latitudes, where the radiative damping times are small enough that temperatures have large seasonal variations, the stratosphere in the north has warmed, and it has become much colder in the south. The abrupt transition region with negative vertical temperature gradient between 80 and 100 km, which was seen at high northern latitudes in winter, has weakened, but it is still visible. In the south, one can see the early stage of its formation. A key question is whether the more compact polar vortex and colder temperatures seen in the south will evolve to the conditions observed in the north in midwinter, or whether the poles behave asymmetrically. Observations from the remainder of the Cassini Mission can elucidate this.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of the radiation belts is dependent upon the acceleration and loss of radiation belt electrons that is largely determined by the interaction of georesonant wave particles with chorus and plasmaspheric hiss waves. The distribution of these waves in the inner magnetosphere is commonly presented as a function of geomagnetic activity as expressed by the geomagnetic indices (Ae, Kp, and Dst). However, it has been shown that not all geomagnetic storms necessarily increase the flux of energetic electrons at the radiation belts. In fact, almost 20% of all geomagnetic storms cause a decrease in the flux of energetic electrons, while 30% has relatively no effect. Also, the geomagnetic indices are indirect, nonspecific parameters compiled from imperfectly covered ground based measurements that lack time history. This emphasises the need to present wave distributions as a function of both geomagnetic activity and solar wind parameters, such as velocity (V), density (n), and interplanetary magnetic field component (Bz), that are known to be predominantly effective in the control of radiation belt energetic electron fluxes. This study presents the distribution of chorus and plasmaspheric hiss waves in the inner magnetosphere as functions of both geomagnetic activity and solar wind parameters for different L-shell, magnetic local time, and magnetic latitude. This study uses almost three years of data measured by the EMFISIS on board the Van Allen Probes. Initial results indicate that the intensity of chorus and plasmaspheric hiss emissions are not only dependent on the geomagnetic activity but also dependent on solar wind parameters. The largest average wave intensities are observed with equatorial chorus in the region 4<L<9 primarily on the dawn-side during active conditions, fast solar wind velocity, low solar wind density, and highly negative Bz respectively.",

            "abstract": "Climate simulations codes, such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM), are especially complex and continually evolving. Their on-going state of development requires frequent software verification in the form of quality assurance to both preserve the quality of the code and instill model confidence. To formalize and simplify this previously subjective and computationally-expensive aspect of the verification process, we have developed a new tool for evaluating climate consistency. Because an ensemble of simulations allows us to gauge the natural variability of the model's climate, our new tool uses an ensemble approach for consistency testing. As many of the variables are highly correlated, we opt for a Principal Component Testing setup, which projects the original variables unto orthogonal linear combinations. Using the ensemble, we obtain a statistical distribution that can be used to determine whether a new climate run is statistically distinguishable from the original ensemble.\nAn important question is how to create the ensemble and what ensemble size to use. We tested perturbation in initial conditions and using different compilers to create the ensemble and developed a systematic approach to assess the required ensemble size. The CESM Ensemble Consistency Test has already proven its utility in detecting errors in software and hardware environments and providing rapid feedback to model developers. The test is now incorporated with new CESM releases for the atmosphere part of the model. We present results from theoretical and practical cases studies and an extension of the testing framework to the ocean model.",

            "abstract": "Organic nitrogen (ON) compounds, which include amines, nitriles, organic nitrates, amides, and N-containing aromatic heterocycles, are an important class of compounds ubiquitously detected in atmospheric particles and fog and cloud droplets. Previous studies indicate that these compounds can make up a significant fraction (20–80%) of the total nitrogen (N) content in atmospheric condensed phases and play important roles in new particle formation and growth and affecting the optical and hygroscopicity of aerosols. In this study, we report the observation of ON compounds in submicrometer particles (PM1) at two locations in New York based on measurements using Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). One study was conducted as part of the US Department of Energy funded Aerosol Lifecyle – Intensive Operation Period (ALC-IOP) campaign at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL, 40.871˚N, 72.89˚W) in summer, 2011 and the other was conducted at the Queen’s College (QC) in New York City (NYC) in summer, 2009. We observed a notable amount of N-containing organic fragment ions, CxHyNp+ and CxHyOzNp+, in the AMS spectra of organic aerosols at both locations and found that they were mainly associated with amino functional groups. Compared with results from lab experiments, the C3H8N+ at m/z = 58 was primarily attributed to trimethylamine. In addition, a significant amount of organonitrates was observed at BNL. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) of organic aerosols identified a unique nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA) factor with elevated nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) at both BNL and QC. Analysis of the size distributions, volatility profiles, and correlations with external tracer indicates that acid-base reactions of amino compounds with sulfate and acidic gas were mainly responsible for the formation of amine salts. Photochemical production was also observed to play a role in the formation of NOA. Bivariate polar plots of NOA concentrations at both locations indicate that the amine salts were mainly from areas to the south of NYC. In addition, the NOA factor suddenly disappeared after Aug 1st during the BNL study, which suggests that it was mainly associated with anthropogenic activities.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem services and products are the foundation of sustainability for regional and global economy since we are directly or indirectly dependent on the ecosystem services like food, livestock, water, air, wildlife etc. It has been increasingly recognized that for sustainability concerns, the conservation problems need to be addressed in the context of entire ecosystems. This approach known as the ecosystem approach is fundamental to managing earth’s finite resources since it addresses the interactions that link biotic systems, of which human, flora and fauna are integral parts, with the physical systems on which they depend. This approach is even more vital in the 21st century with formidable increasing human population and rapid changes in global environment. This study is being conducted to find the state of the science of ecosystem models in the South-Central region of US. The propose of the project is to conduct a systematic review and synthesize relevant information on the current state of the science of ecosystem modeling in the South-Central region of US toward coupling these models with climate, agronomic, hydrologic, economic or management models to better represent ecosystem dynamics as affected by climate change and human activities; and hence gain more reliable predictions of future ecosystem functions and service in the region. Better understandings of such processes will increase our ability to predict the ecosystem responses and feedbacks to environmental and human induced change in the region so that decision makers can make an informed management decisions of the ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon River basin (AM) is considered among the most critical tipping points of Earth’s climate system. At seasonal timescales, the hydroclimatic variability of AM is influenced by sea surface temperatures (SST) over the tropical Atlantic, by the dynamics of the Inter Tropical and South Atlantic Convergence Zones, and by land surface-atmosphere feedbacks. At interannual timescales, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the main modulator of Amazonian hydroclimatology owing to teleconnections arising from the tropical Pacific and the tropical Atlantic, as well as by land surface-atmosphere feedbacks. Here we show statistical and physical evidences of the existence of two-way feedbacks between the TNA and AM regions at annual and interannual timescales, through lagged cross-correlation analysis of monthly series of the AM P-E index and TNA SST. The P-E index series are estimated with data from GPCC (P) and the ORCHIDEE model (E), and SST was obtained from ERSST v3b. The identified two-way feedbacks evidence that TNA SST influence the future AM hydrology, and that in turn AM hydrology influences the future TNA SST at both timescales (see Figure 1). The physical mechanisms and the time lags involved in the identified coupled dynamics are discussed using OLR data from NOAA, surface pressure gradient between TNA and AM (TNA-AM) and zonal winds velocities from the ERA-Interim Renalysis. Our results show that land-surface hydrological processes are not passive spectators but a key player of the large-scale ocean-atmosphere dynamics in the tropical Americas.",

            "abstract": "Most physically-based hydrological models simulate to various extents the relevant watershed processes occurring at different spatiotemporal scales. These models use different physical domain representations (e.g., hydrological response units, discretized control volumes) and numerical solution techniques (e.g., finite difference method, finite element method) as well as a variety of approximations for representing the physical processes. Despite the fact that several models have been developed so far, very few inter-comparison studies have been conducted to check beyond streamflows whether different modeling approaches could simulate in a similar fashion the other processes at the watershed scale. In this study, PIHM (Qu and Duffy, 2007), a fully coupled, distributed model, and HYDROTEL (Fortin et al., 2001; Turcotte et al., 2003, 2007), a pseudo-coupled, semi-distributed model, were compared to check whether the models could corroborate observed streamflows while equally representing other processes as well such as evapotranspiration, snow accumulation/melt or infiltration, etc. For this study, the Young Womans Creek watershed, PA, was used to compare: streamflows (channel routing), actual evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent (snow accumulation and melt), infiltration, recharge, shallow water depth above the soil surface (surface flow), lateral flow into the river (surface and subsurface flow) and height of the saturated soil column (subsurface flow). Despite a lack of observed data for contrasting most of the simulated processes, it can be said that the two models can be used as simulation tools for streamflows, actual evapotranspiration, infiltration, lateral flows into the river, and height of the saturated soil column. However, each process presents particular differences as a result of the physical parameters and the modeling approaches used by each model. Potentially, these differences should be object of further analyses to definitively confirm or reject modeling hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Sulfite (sensu lato), an intermediate in a variety sulfur redox processes, plays a particularly important role in microbial sulfate reduction. It exists intracellularly as multiple species between sets of enzymatic reactions that transform sulfate to sulfide, with the exact speciation depending on pH, T, and ionic strength. However, the complex speciation of sulfite is ignored in current isotope partitioning models of microbial sulfate reduction and simplified solely to the pyramidal SO32- (sulfite sensu stricto), due to a lack of appropriate constraints. We theoretically estimated the equilibrium sulfur isotope fractionations (33S/32S, 34S/32S, 36S/32S) among all documented sulfite species in aqueous solution, including sulfite (SO32-), bisulfite isomers and dimers ((HS)O3-, (HO)SO2-, S2O52-), and SO2(aq), through first principles quantum mechanical calculations. The calculations were performed at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level using cluster models with 30-40 water molecules surrounding the solute. Our calculated equilibrium fractionation factors compare well to the available experimental constraints and suggest that the minor and often-ignored tetrahedral (HS)O3- isomer of bisulfite strongly influences isotope partitioning behavior in the sulfite system under most environmentally relevant conditions, particularly fractionation magnitudes and unusual temperature dependence. For example, we predict that sulfur isotope fractionation between sulfite and bulk bisulfite in solution should have an apparent inverse temperature dependence due to the influence of (HS)O3- and its increased stability at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the need to appropriately account for speciation/isomerization of sulfur species in sulfur isotope studies. We will also present similar calculation results of other aqueous sulfur compounds (e.g., H2S/HS-, SO42-, S2O32-, S3O62-, and poorly documented SO22- species), and discuss the implication of our results for microbial sulfate reduction models and other sulfur-redox processes in nature.",

            "abstract": "During volcanic eruptions, ash concentration must be determined for aviation safety, but the limiting threshold is difficult to distinguish visually. Computational models are typically used to predict ash concentrations, using inputs such as plume height, eruptive duration, and wind speeds. The models also depend on empirical parameters, such as the entrainment of atmospheric air as a ratio of the air inflow speed and the jet speed. Entrainment of atmospheric air plays a critical role in the behavior of volcanic plumes in the atmosphere, impacting the mass flow rate, buoyancy, and particle concentration of the plume. This process is more complex in a crosswind, leading to greater uncertainty in the model results. To address these issues, a laboratory-scale study has been conducted to improve the entrainment models. Observations of a vertical, unconfined jet are performed using Particle Image Velocimetry, while varying jet density using different compressed gases and Reynolds number. To test the effects of a crosswind on plume entrainment rates, these are then compared with similar jet experiments in a wind tunnel. A series of jet geometries, jet speeds and tunnel speeds are considered. The measured velocities are used to determine the entrainment response, which can be used to determine ash concentration over time as atmospheric air is entrained into the plume. We also quantify the mean and the fluctuations in flow velocity.",

            "abstract": "The world’s megacities, defined as urban areas with over 10 million people, are growing rapidly in population and increasing in number, as the migration from rural to urban areas continues. This rapid growth brings economic opportunities but also exacts costs, such as traffic congestion, inadequate sanitation and poor air quality. Monitoring air quality has become a priority for many regional governments, as they seek to understand the sources and distribution of the species contributing to the local pollution. Hyperspectral infrared instruments orbiting the Earth can measure many of these species simultaneously, and since they measure averages over their footprints, they are less sensitive to proximity to strong point sources than in situ measurements, and thus provide a more regional perspective.\nThe JPL TES team has selected a number of megacities as Special Observation targets. These observations, or transects, are sets of 20 closely spaced (12 km apart) TES observations carried out every sixteen days. We will present the TES ozone (O3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), ammonia (NH3), formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) data collected over Mexico City, Lagos (Nigeria) and Los Angeles from 2013 through 2015, and illustrate how the seasonality in the TES measurements is related to local emissions, biomass burning and regional circulation patterns, and we will reinforce our arguments with MODIS AOD and TES CO data. One of the transects over Mexico City in October demonstrates very nicely the synergy obtained from simultaneous measurements of multiple trace species. We will also discuss the spatial variability along the transects and how it is related to topography and land use.",

Both online and offline versions of GOddard Chemistry Aerosols Radiation Transport (GOCART) model, which is driven by NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version 5, i.e. GEOS-5, meteorological condition are used in this evaluation. When compared to available satellite retrieval of SO2. GOCART model is able to capture the volcanic SO2’s magnitude and variation in the UTLS region in general. We further compare the GOCART results with in-situ SO2 measurement from ground based network and various aircraft campaigns in the recent decades. Sparse SO2 measurements in the UTLS region show significant temporal and spatial variations.

With a 12-year data record and daily, global observations in near real-time, AIRS data can play a role in applications that fall under many of the NASA Applied Sciences focus areas. For vector-borne disease, research is underway using AIRS near surface retrievals to assess outbreak risk, mosquito incubation periods and epidemic potential for dengue fever, malaria, and West Nile virus. For drought applications, AIRS temperature and humidity data are being used in the development of new drought indicators and improvement in the understanding of drought development. For volcanic hazards, new algorithms using AIRS data are in development to improve the reporting of sulfur dioxide concentration, the burden and height of volcanic ash and dust, all of which pose a safety threat to aircraft. In addition, anomaly maps of many of AIRS standard products are being produced to help highlight “hot spots” and illustrate trends. To distribute it’s applications imagery, AIRS is leveraging existing NASA data frameworks and organizations to facilitate archiving, distribution and participation in the BEDI.

The focus of this research is on the analysis of measured and modeled energy efficiency of various building types in selected urban areas and temporal variations in energy use for different morphologies under different microclimatic conditions; implications for different morphologies of future climate and urban growth scenarios; and potential energy projections and savings by morphology for selected climatically distinct US cities. This work considers population projections to inform morphological design by incorporating two new datasets in which these projections have been made for years 2030 and 2050 at 30 arc-second resolution, in order to determine potential siting and design of new urban development. The overarching objective is the integration of different approaches across three research areas: earth system modeling; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and urban planning in order to address three major gaps in the existing capability in these areas: i) neighborhood resolution modeling and simulation of urban micrometeorological processes and their effect on and from regional climate; ii) projections for future energy use under urbanization and climate change scenarios identifying best strategies for urban morphological development and energy savings; iii) analysis and visualization tools to help planners optimally use these projections.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, the First State of the Carbon Cycle Report estimated that rivers exported ~ 35 Tg-C yr-1 to coastal systems and reservoirs in the US served as sink of ~ 25 Tg-C yr-1 through sedimentation, each reported with 95% confidence that the estimate was within 100%. Significant progress has been made to constrain and improve these estimates by carefully considering how inland water ecosystems dynamically process, transport, and sequester carbon with attention given to the gaseous evasion of carbon across the air-water interface, a component that was not included in the 2007 estimates. As part of the U.S. Geological Survey’s LandCarbon program, we present the first integrated assessment of freshwater carbon cycling for the conterminous US and Alaska. We estimate that 147 (95% confidence interval of 101- 208) Tg-C yr-1 is exported downstream or emitted to the atmosphere and sedimentation stores 22 (95% confidence interval of 10-68) Tg-C yr-1 in lakes and reservoirs. We show that there is significant regional variation in aquatic carbon flux, but verify that emission across stream and river surfaces represents the dominant removal flux at 85 Tg-C yr-1, or 58% of the total aquatic carbon flux. These new estimates for aquatic carbon fluxes indicate that inland waters must be considered in the context of national scale carbon accounting. For the conterminous US, we compare our results to the output of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Analysis suggests that within the current modelling framework, calculations of Net Ecosystem Production may be overestimated by as much as 27%. Reconciliation of mass-flux interactions between terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources and sinks will require significant additional field data collection and modelling capacity.",

            "abstract": "Despite numerous experimental and numerical studies investigating transport over ripples and dunes in rivers, the spatiotemporal details of the pattern of transport over bedforms remain largely unknown. Here we report turbulence-resolving, simultaneous measurements of bedload motion and near-bed fluid velocity downstream of a backward facing step in a laboratory flume. Two synchronized high-speed video cameras simultaneously observed bedload motion and the motion of neutrally buoyant particles in a laser light sheet 6 mm above the bed at 250 frames/s downstream of a 3.8 cm backward-facing step. Particle imaging velocimetry algorithms were applied to the laser sheet images to obtain two-dimensional field of two-dimensional vectors while manual particle tracking techniques were applied to the video images of the bed. As expected, the experiments exhibit a strong positive correlation between sediment flux and near-bed fluid velocity. The effect of flow separation on the pattern of sediment flux is explored by comparing experimentally observed sediment transport to sediment transport modeled as a function of boundary shear stress using a Meyer-Peter Müller type equation. Modeled sediment transport underestimates observed sediment transport near flow reattachment. This region of underestimated transport corresponds to an increase in the variance of near-bed vertical fluid velocity. Localized, intermittent, high-magnitude transport events are more apparent near flow reattachment than farther downstream. Often, these high-magnitude events are seen to have significant cross-stream particle velocities. In addition, downstream and cross-stream sediment transport events are of comparable magnitudes near reattachment. In contrast, farther downstream of the zone of underestimated transport, cross-stream transport events are small compared to downstream transport. The pattern of intermittent, high-magnitude cross- and downstream transport events near flow reattachment is consistent with the existence permeable “splat events”, wherein a volume of fluid moves toward and impinges on the bed. The substantial effects of splat events on transport over bedforms cannot be modeled using simple bedload transport equations and must be included in future models of bedform evolution.",

            "abstract": "Whole-rock 40Ar/39Ar step-heating analyses of extra-terrestrial materials are used to constrain the impact history of the inner solar system, the formation age of the Moon, and timing of paleomagnetic fields. Despite the importance of knowing the timing of these important events, the samples we have in hand are usually disturbed through mixing, (multiple?) impact events, and perhaps recoil loss. Extra-terrestrial 40Ar/39Ar data are typically interpreted through the assignment of essentially arbitrary plateau ages rather than through a robust physical model. Although the use of models capable of quantitatively assessing diffusive 40Ar* loss in extra-terrestrial samples has been around for nearly 50 years, this early advance has been widely ignored. Here we present implications of applying a robust, multi-activation energy, multi-diffusion domain model to step-heated 40Ar/39Ar data, with temperature cycling. Our findings show that for even a single heating event, “plateau” ages are unlikely to record meaningful ages. Further, if the sample has experienced multiple heating events or contains inherited clasts, recovering a unique solution may be impossible. Indeed the most readily interpretable portion of the age spectrum is the early heating steps which represents a maximum age estimate of the last re-heating event. Our results challenge the chronologic validity of 40Ar/39Ar “plateau” ages and by extension the hypotheses that are based on this data (e.g., the Late Heavy Bombardment). Future work will require new analytical procedures, interpretative frameworks, and (potentially) the combination of multiple chronometers to derive a robust impact history for the early solar system.",

The sediments extracted from a western sinkhole and central Serbian oxbow lake are analyzed at 8-10-cm intervals to capture the nature and magnitude of the LIA at a resolution of 20 years. During the 15th-19th CE, indigenous tree (e.g. Quercus, Acer, Pinus) and herbaceous (e.g. Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) pollen from these records demonstrate fluctuations in woodland-grassland dynamics. While tree populations from Central Serbia remain comparatively stable (40-60%), the trees of western Serbia vacillate drastically between 15% and 50%. Similarly, central Serbian grasses show variations of ~18-36% whereas the western Serbian grass populations exhibit abrupt oscillations between high (55%) and low (19%) percentages. As a proxy for surface erosion and clastic input into the lakes, the 1-cm resolution potassium and titanium counts are in strong agreement with varying herbaceous taxa. These variations in ecological signals across the cores can account for local factors including altitude, terrain exposure, soils etc., however, the dynamic human component of the landscape is evident through crop pollen (e.g. Cerealia, Juglans) and microscopic charcoal highlighting the dominant role of people in ecological changes. Although the two sites show certain differences in charcoal concentration, extremely high charcoal indicates accelerated land clearance between the 15th and 17th CE. Until the beginning of 18th CE, the cultivars (e.g. Secale, Triticum) occur with very low percentages and then peak to suggest improved agriculture in the region. In the post-LIA era, the 20th CE exhibits increased arboreal percentages and declining grasslands in both the two Central Balkan records.",

In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey characterized water-quality stressors and ecological conditions in 100 streams in the Midwestern U.S. and 115 streams in the southeastern U.S., respectively. Water samples were collected weekly for 10-12 weeks during spring and early summer. Habitat, sediment chemistry, and ecological communities were sampled once at the end of the water-sampling period. Water and(or) sediment samples were analyzed for pesticides, nutrients, wastewater indicator compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds, metals, volatile organic compounds, and pharmaceuticals. The spatial and temporal distribution of detected compounds and health-based-benchmark-normalized summations of compound mixtures indicate important differences between agricultural and urban settings. In general, urban streams are affected by more complex chemical mixtures than agricultural streams. Although higher herbicide and nutrient concentrations generally are found in agricultural settings, the more frequent occurrence of insecticides, hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds, and metals in urban settings indicates higher potential toxicity in urban streams than in agricultural streams. The effects of these complex mixtures and other stressors are being evaluated in relation to stream ecological communities at the regional scale.",

            "abstract": "Seismicity rates have increased sharply since 2009 in the central and eastern United States, with especially high rates of activity in the state of Oklahoma. A growing body of evidence indicates that many of these events are induced, primarily by injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. The upsurge in activity has raised the questions, what is the background rate of tectonic earthquakes in Oklahoma? And how much has the rate varied throughout historical and early instrumental times? We first review the historical catalog, including assessment of the completeness level of felt earthquakes, and show that seismicity rates since 2009 surpass previously observed rates throughout the 20th century. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that most of the significant (Mw > 3.5) earthquakes in Oklahoma during the 20th century were likely induced by wastewater injection and/or enhanced oil recovery operations. We show that there is a statistically significant temporal and spatial correspondence between earthquakes and disposal wells permitted during the 1950s. The intensity distributions of the 1952 Mw5.7 El Reno earthquake and the 1956 Mw3.9 Tulsa county earthquake are similar to those from recent induced earthquakes, with significantly lower shaking than predicted given a regional intensity-prediction equation. The rate of tectonic earthquakes is thus inferred to be significantly lower than previously estimated throughout most of the state, but is difficult to estimate given scant incontrovertible evidence for significant tectonic earthquakes during the 20th century. We do find evidence for a low level of tectonic seismicity in southeastern Oklahoma associated with the Ouachita structural belt, and conclude that the 22 October 1882 Choctaw Nation earthquake, for which we estimate Mw4.8, occurred in this zone.",

            "abstract": "Recent research shows that a significant amount of seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2009 is likely related to fluid injection. Seismicity has been observed to generally increase in areas where injection volume and rates are highest but there is a significant amount of variation, with nearby areas experiencing notably different amounts of seismicity. Likely contributors to these differences are the presence of optimally oriented faults and differences in rock permeability structure since rocks with higher permeability are more likely to experience pore fluid pressure changes that can bring faults closer to failure. Most earthquakes occur at depths of ~4-8 km, within crystalline rock of the mid-Proterozoic western granite-rhyolite terrane. Within this terrane, drill-hole data show instances of mafic intrusive rocks that may in part be related to the mid-continent rift. To better understand relations between subsurface geology and seismicity, we reprocessed 1970’s NURE airborne magnetic data. The 5-8-km line spacing of the surveys is coarse, but the processed data show subtle, ~20-35-km long lineaments trending mostly NNW but also NW and NE. Some of these correspond to mapped faults; others are interpreted to represent faults or folds. In some areas the lineaments correspond to earthquake locations, but the magnetic data are often too coarse to establish a clear correspondence. The magnetic maps also show rounded highs that are located near sites where drilling has encountered mafic rock, strongly suggesting that the highs represent mafic intrusions. We find that many earthquakes cluster around or near the edges of the magnetic highs but much less frequently over them, even when they are located close to high-volume injection wells. We hypothesize that the rounded magnetic highs represent mafic intrusions with decreased permeability. In contrast, contacts at the edges of these intrusions may have higher permeability and are thus more likely to experience seismicity.",

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has monitored concentrations of suspended sediment (SS), total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) as well as streamflow upstream and downstream of Lahontan Reservoir since 1997 in support of USEPA Remedial Investigations. Differences between inflow and outflow concentrations indicate that nearly 90 percent of SS and unfiltered THg, and at least 50 percent of unfiltered MeHg and filtered (<0.45 µm) THg and MeHg is retained in the reservoir. However, outflow MeHg concentrations exceeded mean inflow concentration (2.9 nanograms per liter; ng/L) in 10 of 135 samples, indicating augmented mercury methylation. During August 2010 and June-September 2011, limnological profiles were measured and water samples collected from discrete depths in each of the reservoir’s 3 sub-basins, the inflow delta and 2 shallow and rarely inundated overflow basins to investigate mercury distribution and methylation. In most samples, MeHg concentrations were less than 5 ng/L and increased by less than 1 ng/L in deeper samples. After temperature, oxygen, and Eh profiles indicated thermal stratification in the deep (~25 m) lower basin, samples from the top 1 m still had less than 2 ng/L MeHg but samples collected from 2 m above the sediment-water interface yielded concentrations as high as 220 ng/L in filtered water samples, accounting for 100 percent of filtered and 65 percent of unfiltered THg concentrations in concurrently-sampled water. We hypothesize that anoxic conditions and decomposition of mercury-contaminated plankton and sulfate-reduction in the hypolimnion provide carbon and mercury necessary for mercury methylation that exceeds diffusion from bottom sediment.",

Induction measurements have been used to infer a partially molten region with ∼ 20% melt [3]. Here we investigate Io’s tidal response using these constraints and a model in which tidal heating and melt distribution are coupled.\nPrevious tidal models of Io have assumed a Maxwellian rheology [4, 5]. The Maxwell model is highly idealized which leads to estimates of Io’s mantle viscosity on order 1013 − 1016 Pa·s, much smaller than typical values for partially-molten rocks.\nHere we build on the work of [6], with two significant differences. First, we couple tidal heating to the melt distribution model of [6], using the approach developed in [7]. Second, rather than a Maxwell rheology we adopt the more realistic Andrade model [8]. The response of partially-molten rocks under periodic and steady-state (viscous) conditions is modeled using the experimental results of [8] and [9], respectively.\nInitial results yield Io mantle viscosities in excess of 1017Pa·s, compatible with experimental data, and melt fractions of up to 20%, consistent with the induction observations [3].\n[1] V.

Observations in this data-sparse and logistically remote region have never been so important, and many nations are rising to the challenge of supporting both experiments and long-term sustained observations. As illustrated in the figure from Meredith et al. (Current Op. Env. Sustain. 2013), autonomous in situ technologies are at the fore because of the difficulty and expense of sending ships year-round and because the crucial satellite remote sensing must be accompanied by in situ observations, including beneath sea ice and ice shelves. The Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) has grown out of this recognized need for coordinated observations from the Antarctic coastline northward to the subtropics, from the bottom water production regions in coastal polynyas over the continental shelves, to the regions of interaction of warm ocean waters with Antarctic ice shelves, beneath the vast seasonal sea ice region, and in the hot spots of air-sea fluxes and cross-Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) mixing where the ACC interacts with topography and continental boundaries. The future includes international coordination and collaboration and strengthening of new and existing technologies, which include satellite observing, ice-enabled profiling floats, profiling from marine mammals, moored measurements in many strategic locations, glider and other autonomous operations in all regions, and drilling through floating ice shelves to measure the ocean waters below. Improved and consistent weather observations around the Antarctic coastlines will improve forecasting and reanalysis. Ice breaker ships will remain necessary to provide access to all of these regions.",

            "abstract": "While the dust emission from arid and semi-arid regions is known as a natural process induced by wind erosion, human may affect the dust emission directly through land use disturbances and indirectly by climate change. There has been much debate on the relative importance of climate change and land use to the global dust budget, as past estimates on the proportion of dust contributed by land use, in particular agricultural practices, remains very uncertain. This to the large extent stems from the way how human-made dust sources are identified and how they are treated in models. This study attempts to assess the land use contribution to the dust emission in Central Asia during 2000–2014 by conducting multiple experiments on the total emission in the WRF-Chem-DuMo model, and applying two methods to separate the natural and anthropogenic sources. The model experiments include realistic treatments of agriculture (e.g., expansion and abandonment) and water body changes (e.g., Aral Sea desiccation) in the land cover map of WRF-Chem-DuMo, but impose no arbitrary labeling of dust source type or adjustment to the erosion threshold. Intercomparison of the model experiments will be focused on the magnitude, interannual variability, and climate sensitivity of dust fluxes resulting from the selections of surface input data and dust flux parameterizations. Based on annual land use intensity maps, the sensitivity of the anthropogenic dust proportion to selection of the threshold value will be evaluated. In conjunction with the empirical method, satellite-derived annual land classifications will be used to track the land cover dynamics, and separate potential human-made source areas.",

            "abstract": "Exchange of water between aquifers and the ocean critically affects the quality of coastal groundwater resources and modifies ocean chemistry on both short and long timescales. Fresh groundwater has been shown to exist far offshore, and this is a potential future resource. However, controls on the origin of offshore freshened groundwater and the timescale over which it responds to hydrologic change are not well known. Further, high rates of saline groundwater discharge have been observed directly nearshore and with tracers across continental shelves, but the physical explanation for these large fluxes is not well established. Steady-state variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport simulations incorporating geostatistically-generated distributions of aquifer lithology were performed to explore the role of geologic heterogeneity in large-scale coastal groundwater flow and solute transport processes. Results indicate that heterogeneity critically affects both salinity distributions and aquifer-ocean exchange. The position, size, and variability of the mixing zone are influenced by the shore-perpendicular connectivity of the geologic structure. Submarine groundwater discharge extends further offshore and is more highly variable in heterogeneous relative to equivalent homogeneous simulations, and this effect increases with connectivity. The circulation of saline groundwater is consistently higher in heterogeneous simulations relative to homogeneous regardless of aquifer connectivity, increasing up to several orders of magnitude. These simulations suggest that heterogeneous aquifers with high geologic connectivity can result in significant volumes of freshened groundwater accompanied by fresh and saline discharge tens to hundreds of kilometers offshore along the continental shelf, even under present-day equilibrium conditions. The complicated flow fields and salinity distributions resulting from geologic heterogeneity contribute to high rates of saline circulation driven by complex density gradients, as well as groundwater discharge far offshore. Thus geologic heterogeneity provides a potential explanation for both the presence of fresh groundwater far offshore and high groundwater discharge rates commonly observed along continental shelves.",

            "abstract": "The COSC project aims to provide a deeper understanding of mountain belt dynamics in the Scandinavian Caledonides. Scientific investigations include a range of topics, from understanding the ancient orogeny to the present-day hydrological cycle. Main objectives of the project, from a tectonic viewpoint, are to obtain (i) better understanding of the exhumation and emplacement of the hot middle allochthon, which may enable comparison with exhumation processes in the Himalaya-Tibet orogen, (ii) a broad understanding of orogeny and deformation in the middle to deep crust and upper mantle of mountain belts, and (iii) constraints on the abundant geophysical data that have been acquired in the area. COSC investigations and drilling activities are focused in central Scandinavia, near Åre (Sweden), where rocks from the mid to lower crust of the orogen are exposed. Rock units of interest include granulite facies migmatites (locally ultra-high pressure), gneisses and amphibolites in the middle allochthon (Seve nappe) that overlie greenschist facies metasedimentary rocks in the lower allochthons (Särv and Jämtlandian nappes). The base of the lower allochthon marks the contact with the autochthonous Precambrian basement. To investigate the high grade Seve nappe the COSC-1 borehole was drilled to 2496 m, with almost 100 % core recovery, during summer 2014. The top 1800 m consists mostly of sub-horizontal and shallowly dipping intermittent layers of gneiss and amphibolite, with lesser amounts of calc-silicates, metagabbro, marble and lenses of pegmatite. The first signs of increasing strain appear shortly below 1700 m in the form of narrow deformation bands and thin mylonites. Below c. 2100 m, mylonites dominate and garnets become common. A transition from gneiss into lower-grade metasedimentary rocks occurs between 2345 and 2360 m. The lower part of the drill core to TD is dominated by quartzites and metasandstones of unclear tectonostratigraphic position that are mylonitized to a varying degree. An integrated structural interpretation based on surface geological mapping, results from the COSC-1 borehole and high quality geophysics will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Watershed ecohydrological models are essential tools to assess the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological and ecological processes for watershed management. Existing models can be classified as empirically based model, quasi-mechanistic and mechanistic models. The empirically based and quasi-mechanistic models usually adopt empirical or quasi-empirical equations, which may be incapable of capturing non-stationary dynamics of target processes. Mechanistic models that are designed to represent process feedbacks may capture vegetation dynamics, but often have more demanding spatial and temporal parameterization requirements to represent vegetation physiological variables. In recent years, optimality based ecohydrological models have been proposed which have the advantage of reducing the need for model calibration by assuming critical aspects of system behavior. However, this work to date has been limited to plot scale that only considers one-dimensional exchange of soil moisture, carbon and nutrients in vegetation parameterization without lateral hydrological transport. Conceptual isolation of individual ecosystem patches from upslope and downslope flow paths compromises the ability to represent and test the relationships between hydrology and vegetation in mountainous and hilly terrain. This work presents an optimality-based watershed ecohydrological model, which incorporates lateral hydrological process influence on hydrological flow-path patterns that emerge from the optimality assumption. The model has been tested in the Walnut Gulch watershed and shows good agreement with observed temporal and spatial patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP). Spatial variability of ET and GPP produced by the model match spatial distribution of TWI, SCA, and slope well over the area. Compared with the one dimensional vegetation optimality model (VOM), we find that the distributed VOM (DisVOM) produces more reasonable spatial distribution of evapotranspiration and GPP. The model provides the ability to couple ecosystem patches along hydrological flow paths, and allows the representation of space/time patterns, providing new methods of diagnosing model behavior with observations.",

SPARTTA is TRL-4 and is able to characterize the mechanical (shear and compressive strength), thermal (conductivity), and electrical (dielectric spectroscopy and triboelectric charging) properties of soils through the integration of five specialized tools into a small, portable instrument, analogous to the Swiss army knife. All of the SPARTTA components are based on classical terrestrial soil analytical tools. Each component will be used to measure a specific physical property of a planetary regolith. SPARTTA will be easily adaptable to a wide range of surface environments for any future planetary robotic surface mission. A key innovation of SPARTTA is its state-of-the–art miniature packaging approach which enables in-situ comprehensive analyses of the physical properties of soils on any planetary body (e.g. asteroids, comets, etc.) with a single compact instrument. SPARTTA will specifically address several high-priority science goals identified in the Decadal Study regarding the physical properties of planetary soils, liquid water/water-ice detection, and electrostatics for bodies as diverse as comets, Trojan asteroids, Mars and the Moon [Planetary Science Decadal Study, 2013].

            "abstract": "Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) is a numerical simulation approach that represents a conducting fracture network using geologically realistic geometries and single-conductor hydraulic and transport properties. In terms of diffusion analogues, equivalent porous media derive from heat conduction in continuous media, while DFN simulation is more similar to electrical flow and diffusion in circuits with discrete pathways. DFN modeling grew out of pioneering work of David Snow in the late 1960s with additional impetus in the 1970’s from the development of the development of stochastic approaches for describing of fracture geometric and hydrologic properties. Research in underground test facilities for radioactive waste disposal developed the necessary linkages between characterization technologies and simulation as well as bringing about a hybrid deterministic stochastic approach.\nOver the past 40 years DFN simulation and characterization methods have moved from the research environment into practical, commercial application. The key geologic, geophysical and hydrologic tools provide the required DFN inputs of conductive fracture intensity, orientation, and transmissivity. Flow logging either using downhole tool or by detailed packer testing identifies the locations of conducting features in boreholes, and image logging provides information on the geology and geometry of the conducting features. Multi-zone monitoring systems isolate the individual conductors, and with subsequent drilling and characterization perturbations help to recognize connectivity and compartmentalization in the fracture network. Tracer tests and core analysis provide critical information on the transport properties especially matrix diffusion unidentified conducting pathways. Well test analyses incorporating flow dimension boundary effects provide further constraint on the conducting geometry of the fracture network.",

It is therefore critical to quantify the occurrence of extremes in major growing regions globally to understand the vulnerability of the global food supply to climate. First, we grid the GHCN historical climate data and evaluate the effect of gridding on estimation of agriculturally relevant climate extremes, such as heat waves, consecutive dry days, and precipitation intensity. We find that the differences between gridded indices and the raw station indices are small, mostly less than 10%. We then evaluate the climatology of climate extremes and the probability of concurrent extremes, both within one growing region and across multiple regions globally. We find that the correlation of two precipitation or temperature related indices are quite strong, such that the probability of another extreme occurring increases given the occurrence of one extreme. These results provide estimations of the global food supply’s vulnerability to climate variability and extremes, which is critical for planning in the coming decades with projections of more frequent and more intense climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "Studies of non-accreting forearcs show that their characteritic rock assemblages are the same as those found many ophiolites. These forearcs are thought to form during subduction initiation, as are supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites. Thus, the lithospheric mantle that underlies SSZ crust provides in situ samples of the mantle wedge, and allows us to study directly geochemical flux in the mantle wedge during subduction, which is critical to our understanding of the subduction factory process and arc volcanism.\nMost peridotites in SSZ ophiolites are harzburgites; lherzolites are important but much less common. The harzburgites are thought to represent >20% hydrous partial melting. Trace element data confirm this, and document REE patterns that are consistent with residues produced by boninite melting. These data also require an early stage of garnet phase melting, followed by continued melting in the spinel field. Lherzolites form by lower degrees of melting (<7%). Trace element data are consistent with spinel-field melting, although minor garnet field melting is permitted. Lherzolites may reflect trapped oceanic lithosphere, but we suggest most were parental to forearc basalts, and escaped continued melting as they moved upward to subsolidus depths.\nBecause most SSZ peridotites are partially serpentinized, assessing geochemical flux in the mantle wedge requires precision analyses of residual phases by EMPA and high-precision laser ablation ICP-MS. We derived an alogrithm that may be used to calculate the enrichment of FME:\nCwr,add=[Ccpx-obs/[[Dcpx/(Dbulk–PF)]*[1– (PF/Dbulk)](1/P)]]–[C0,wr]\nWhere Cwr,add = concentration of FME added to mantle wedge, Ccpx-obs= observed pyroxene, Dcpx and Dbulk = mineral and bulk partition coefficients, P=melt proportion, and F=melt fraction.\nWe use MREE-HREE to assess melt extraction, HFSE to assess melt enrichment, and fluid mobile elements (FME) to assess fluid flux. Our results show that high concentrations of fluid-mobile elements in supra-subduction peridotites result from a continuous flux of aqueous fluid or fluid-rich melt phase derived from the subducting slab, and allow us to quantify the composition of the fluid added. We also show that most lherzolites were exposed to a similar fluid flux, despite their low degree of melting.",

To extend the reach and impact of these efforts, it is necessary to coordinate them in order to reach a greater collective impact. The Collective Impact model, as described by Kania & Kramer (2011), requires five elements: 1) a common agenda; 2) shared measurement systems; 3) mutually reinforcing activities; 4) continuous communication; and 5) a well-funded backbone support organization.\nThe CLEAN Network, as an example of a rudimentary form of such an organization, engages in continuous communication through weekly teleconferences, an active listserv and other activities to share resources, activities, and ideas that is moving the network to develop common understandings that will likely lead to the development of effective collective impact on increasing climate and energy literacy. A Spring 2013 survey of the CLEAN Network provided insight as to how the CLEAN Network was addressing member needs and identified what other support was needed to increase its collective impact. In addition, community discussions identified the components needed for an effective overarching backbone support organization.\nA Fall 2015 survey of the CLEAN Network and the broader climate change education community is being conducted to examine 1) how the CLEAN Network make up and needs have evolved and how they compare to the broader community, and 2) to gather further input into the shaping of the elements of collective impact on climate and energy literacy.\n This presentation will describe the results from the 2015 survey and compare them to the 2013 survey and the community discussions. This will include describing the CLEAN Network’s evolving professional make up, engagement of its members network activities, the importance of the network to members; how the findings compare with the broader climate change education community, and how the collective impact can be increased.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater heating and pressurization of aquifers trapped between dikes in ocean island volcanoes has been proposed as a mechanism for destabilizing and triggering large-volume flank collapses. Previous modelling has indicated that heat transfer from sustained magma flow through dikes during eruption has the potential to produce destabilizing levels of pressure on time scales of 4 to 400 days, if the aquifers remain confined. Here we revisit this proposal from a different perspective. We examine evidence for pressure variations in dike-confined aquifers during eruptions at high elevation vents on ocean island volcanoes. Initially magmatic, these eruptions change to mostly small-volume explosive phreatomagmatic activity. A recent example is the 1949 eruption on La Palma, Canary Islands. Some such eruptions involve sequences of larger-volume explosive phases or cycles, including production of voluminous low-temperature, pyroclastic density currents (PDC). Here we present and interpret data from the Cova de Paul crater eruption (Santo Antao, Cape Verde Islands). The phreatomagmatic part of this eruption formed two cycles, each culminating with eruption of PDCs. Compositional and textural variations in the products of both cycles indicate that the diatreme fill began as coarse-grained and permeable which allowed gas to escape. During the eruption, the fill evolved to a finer grained, poorly sorted, less permeable material, in which pore fluid pressures built up to produce violent explosive phases. This implies that aquifers adjacent to the feeder intrusion were not simply depressurized at the onset of phreatomagmatic explosivity but experienced fluctuations in pressure throughout the eruption as the vent repeatedly choked and emptied. In combination with fluctuations in magma supply rate, driving of aquifer pressurization by cyclical vent choking will further complicate the prediction of flank destabilization during comparable eruptions on ocean island volcanoes.",

However,\nthis separation is done at the cost of implementing an ensemble Kalman filter at each scale. This presents problems\nwhen tuning the covariance inflation parameter at each scale. We present a method to adaptively tune a scale dependent\ncovariance inflation vector based on balancing the covariance of the innovation and the covariance of observations of\nthe ensemble. Our methods are demonstrated on a one dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S) model known to\ndemonstrate non-linear interactions between scales.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated how the character of magnetic fluctuations of solar wind plasma depends on radial distance from the Sun. We use measurements of the magnetic field taken at different distances from the Sun by different spacecraft: Helios between 0.4 and 1 AU, ACE and Wind at about 1 AU, and Ulysses at about 5.3 AU. Data intervals are selected to contain only what appear to be random fluctuations and to exclude solar wind structures such as coronal mass ejections, co-rotating interaction regions, heliospheric current sheets, shocks, etc. With these data we calculate the Jensen–Shannon complexity as a function of permutation entropy. Jensen-Shannon complexity maps indicate if the fluctuations in the magnetic fields are stochastic (low complexity and high entropy), or if they exhibit minimal or maximal complexity and lower entropy. The Jensen–Shannon complexity values determined from the spacecraft measurements evolve from moderate complexity and high entropy at 0.4 AU to lower complexity and higher entropy farther from the Sun. We interpret these data to mean that as the solar wind plasma expands outward, the magnetic field fluctuations evolve from chaotic (i.e., low dimensionality, deterministic fluctuations) to turbulent (i.e., low dimensionality, non-deterministic fluctuations). By separating the magnetic fluctuations into slow solar wind (<450 km/s) and fast solar wind (>550 km/s), we find that the younger solar wind (transported outward rapidly) has higher complexity than the older solar wind (transported outward slowly). These results can be tested by Solar Probe Plus to be launched in 2018.",

This assumption implies a radially variable continuous polytropic exponent, that is, our model is a multi-polytropic model of the Sun. We derived the equations for this type of multi-polytropic structure and solved them using numerical integration methods. Both, the exponent and proportionality factor in the polytropic model equation of state were taken as input functions, for each spherical layer in the solar interior. Using the spatial distribution of the density and pressure terms from a solar standard model (SSM) we obtained the variable with depth polytropic exponents. We found that the radial distribution of these exponents show four different zones. These can be interpreted as a first region where the energy transport is controlled by radiation. The second region is defined by a sudden change in the polytropic index, which can be associated to the tachocline, followed by a region with a nearly constant polytropic index which suits well a convective zone. Finally, the exponent decreases radially at the photosphere.",

These regions are characterized by low velocities compared to the flow in the main channel and long residence times that favor the deposition of contaminants, nutrient uptake and interactions with reactive sediments. The dynamics of the turbulent flows in these zones is very complex, typically characterized by a shear layer that induces a recirculating area, with multiple large-scale coherent structures of different temporal and spatial scales.\nIn this work we present the methodology and analysis of measurements in a natural surface storage zone. We report detailed information of a field campaign carried out in the Lluta River, located in northern Chile in the high altitude Andean environment known as the Altiplano (~4,000 masl). The area of study has great interest for the river ecosystem, since the water has high concentration levels of arsenic and other metals. The Lluta River is also a water source for many agricultural communities and urban centers located in the lower parts of the watershed.\nField information obtained was: detailed topography, 3D velocity components in several points, and sediment arsenic concentration in the main channel and in the recirculating region of the natural surface storage zone. Topography was obtained through DGPS and digital image processing. The 3D velocity field was measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and surface velocity data was obtained through the LSPIV technique. Arsenic concentration was obtained by sediment sampling analysis.\nWith this data we analyze the flow topology and characteristics features of the velocity, which constitute the controlling mechanisms of contaminant transport in the field. In addition, we contrast with preliminary results of a three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation, to determine the influence of different parameters on the transport and mixing processes in natural conditions.",

However, the results can be affected by mixing, boiling and vapor-phase separation. We present new strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) isotopic data from hydrothermal waters and fumarole condensates that allow us to evaluate fluid sources independent of near-surface mixing and boiling. Our sample set was selected to explore the range of fluid compositions found in the Yellowstone hydrothermal system, including waters/fluids that are thought to be exclusively meteoric, exclusively from the deep hydrothermal system, and those which are a mixture of these end members and/or that have been influenced by various hydrothermal processes such as boiling or gas/water interaction. We have identified at least three isotopic endmembers that persist in various features throughout the YNP hydrothermal system. The first endmember has relatively unradiogenic Pb with Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions that are consistent with Yellowstone basalts and rhyolites. This endmember is typified by low pH features. We interpret this fluid as surface water and shallow groundwater that has interacted with volcanic rocks associated with the YNP magmatic system, with the acidity derived from oxidation of volcanic gases. The second endmember has relatively radiogenic Pb, radiogenic Sr, and unradiogenic Nd. This endmember is typified by neutral pH features and near neutral fumarole condensates. We interpret this endmember to represent the hypothesized deep hydrothermal reservoir that interacts with and reflects the isotopic composition of the host rock. The third endmember contains radiogenic Pb, unradiogenic Nd, and unradiogenic Sr. We observe this endmember in neutral features, which are interpreted as hydrothermal waters (shallow, deep, or mixtures) that have interacted locally with Madison Limestone near the surface. Collectively, these data provide new constraints on the source of fluids that comprise hot springs in Yellowstone which has implications for interpreting variation in spring geochemistry and microbial diversity.",

Surface δ13CPOC values ranged from −27.4‰ to −19.0‰ and generally decreased from inner bay (south of 67°S) toward the Antarctic Divergence. Surface water 226Ra activity concentration ranged from 0.92 to 2.09 Bq/m3 and increased toward the Antarctic Divergence, probably reflecting the influence of 226Ra-depleted meltwater and upwelled226Ra-replete deep water. The fraction of meltwater, fi, was estimated from 226Ra activity concentration and salinity using a three-component (along with Antarctic Summer Surface Water, and Prydz Bay Deep Water) mixing model. Although the fraction of meltwater is relatively minor (1.6–11.9%, average 4.1±2.7%, n=20) for the surface waters (sampled at ~6 m), a positive correlation between surface δ13CPOC and fi (δ13CPOC=0.94×fi−28.44, n=20, r2=0.66, p<0.0001) was found, implying that sea ice melting may have contributed to elevated δ13CPOC values in the inner Prydz Bay compared to the open oceanic waters. This is the first time for a relationship between δ13CPOC and meltwater fraction to be reported in polar oceans to our knowledge. We propose that sea ice melting may have affected surface ocean δ13CPOC by enhancing water column stability and providing a more favorable light environment for phytoplankton photosynthesis, resulting in drawdown of seawater CO2 availability, likely reducing the magnitude of isotope fractionation during biological carbon fixation. Our results highlight the linkage of ice melting and δ13CPOC, providing insights into understanding the carbon cycling in the highly productive Antarctic waters.",

            "abstract": "At the present time, only one in eight residents of Haiti has access to electricity. Two recent engineering and statistical innovations have the potential for vastly reducing the cost of installation of hydropower in Haiti and the rest of the developing world. The engineering innovation is that wind, solar and fluvial energy have been used to compress air for generation of electricity for only $20 per megawatt-hour, in contrast to the conventional World Bank practice of funding photovoltaic cells for $156 per megawatt-hour. The installation of hydropower requires a record of stream discharge, which is conventionally obtained by installing a gaging station that automatically monitors gage height (height of the water surface above a fixed datum). An empirical rating curve is then used to convert gage height to stream discharge. The multiple field measurements of gage height and discharge over a wide range of discharge values that are required to develop and maintain a rating curve require a manpower of hydrologic technicians that is prohibitive in remote and impoverished areas of the world. The statistical innovation is that machine learning has been applied to the USGS database of nearly four million simultaneous measurements of gage height and discharge to develop a new classification of rivers so that a rating curve can be developed solely from the stream slope, channel geometry, horizontal and vertical distances to the nearest upstream and downstream confluences, and two pairs of discharge – gage height measurements. The objective of this study is to organize local residents to monitor gage height at ten stream sites in the northern peninsula of Haiti over a one-year period in preparation for installation of hydropower at one of the sites. The necessary baseline discharge measurements and channel surveying are being carried out for conversion of gage height to discharge. Results will be reported at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Coal-tar-based (CT) sealcoat is used to protect and improve the appearance of asphalt pavement of driveways and parking lots primarily in the central and eastern U.S. and in Canada. CT sealcoat typically is 20 to 35% crude coal tar or coal-tar pitch and contains from 50,000 to 100,000 mg/kg polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), about 1,000 times more than asphalt-based (AS) sealcoat or asphalt itself. Tires and snowplows abrade the friable sealcoat surface into fine particles—median total PAH concentrations in dust from CT-sealcoated pavement are 2,200 mg/kg compared to a median concentration of 11 mg/kg for dust from unsealed pavement. Use of CT sealcoat has several implications for urban streams and lakes. Source apportionment modeling has indicated that, in regions where CT sealcoat is prevalent, particles from sealcoated pavement are contributing the majority of the PAHs to recently deposited lake sediment, often resulting in sediment concentrations above toxicity thresholds based on effects-based sediment quality guidelines. Acute 2-day laboratory toxicity testing of simulated runoff from CT-sealcoated pavement to a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) demonstrated that toxicity continues for samples collected for weeks or months following sealcoat application and that toxicity is enhanced by exposure to UV light. Using the fish-liver cell line RTL-W1, runoff collected as much as 36 days following CT-sealcoat application has been demonstrated to cause DNA damage and impair DNA repair capacity. These results demonstrate that CT runoff is a potential hazard to aquatic ecosystems and that exposure to sunlight can enhance toxicity and genetic damage. Recent research has provided direct evidence that restricting use of CT sealcoat in a watershed can lead to a substantial reduction in PAH concentrations in receiving water bodies.",

We wrote and updated IDL software procedures to define disturbed days with varying threshold values and graphed Rn + Rn-1 against them. The aa threshold was derived from the Ap threshold. After comparing the graphs for Ap values from 20 to 50, an Ap threshold of 30 and the corresponding aa threshold of 44 were chosen as yielding the best correlation.

            "abstract": "Measurements of seismic anisotropy provide useful constraints on mantle deformation. In particular, shear wave splitting reflects anisotropic propagation of body waves within the Earth’s interior, and can be used to constrain patterns of deformation in the mantle. While shear wave splitting is a commonly used technique to study mantle anisotropy, it is most often applied to the upper mantle. While most of the lower mantle is thought to be isotropic, many studies have demonstrated that the D” layer at the base of the mantle exhibits significant anisotropy. Here we present measurements of the splitting of pairs of core-refracted shear phases (SKS-SKKS and PKS-SKKS) measured at stations in eastern North America. The goal of this study is twofold: first, we wish to place tighter constraints on the geometry of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle beneath North America, and second, we wish to understand whether there is a contribution from lowermost mantle anisotropy to the splitting of SK(K)S phases beneath eastern North America. Previous measurements of SKS splitting at stations in this region (Long et al., 2010) showed complicated splitting patterns, with likely contributions from both the lithospheric and asthenospheric upper mantle. We analyzed seismograms measured at stations in the southeastern US that showed clear arrivals for pairs of phases (SKS-SKKS or PKS-SKKS) with similar paths in the upper mantle, but different paths in the lower mantle. Many regions of the lowermost mantle beneath North America do not show evidence for differential splitting of these phases. However, we find clear discrepancies between the measured splitting parameters of the different phases for the same event-station pairs for a group of raypaths that sample the lowermost mantle along the margin of a fast shear anomaly beneath the Midwestern US. This is a straightforward indicator of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle in this region, consistent with previous studies.",

            "abstract": "Several body of knowledge have noted the importance of wetland ecosystems in climate moderation, resource supply and flood risk reduction amongst others. Relevant as it may, rapidly increasing population and uncontrolled urban development poses a challenge in some regions and require understanding of the ecosystem components and drivers of change over a long period of time. Thus, the main thrust of this paper is to analyse multiple drivers of wetland ecosystems degradation in the last 30 years in the Lagos megacity using field study, desktop review, satellite data and laboratory analysis. Key drivers identified includes: conversion of wetlands to settlements and waste sink, land use planning that neglects wetland conservation and restoration, ineffective legal status for wetlands, over exploitation leading to degradation and fragmentation of wetland ecosystems governance. In stemming further loss of this vital ecosystem, this study adopted and proposed respectively, the Drivers, Pressure, State, Impact and Response (DPSIR) and Integrated Planning Approach (IPA) frameworks in analysing policy and governance issues in wetland development. These analyses figured out amongst others, strict conservation and sustainable use of wetland resources, habitat restoration, climate adaptation measures, legal protection and wetland management institution as major responses to current multiple pressures facing wetland ecosystems in Lagos. For these frameworks to be made meaningful, weak coordination among government agencies and institutional capacity in implementation and law enforcement, unsustainable resource extraction by private/business organization and issues on alternative sources of income on the part of the local communities amongst others needs to be addressed.",

            "abstract": "Prediction for a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic system often encounters difficulties: the system may be too complicated to solve in full, and initial data may be missing because only a small subset of variables is observed. However, only a small subset of the variables may be of interest and need to be predicted. We present a solution by developing a discrete stochastic reduced system for the variables of interest, in which one formulates discrete solvable approximate equations for these variables and uses data and statistical methods to account for the impact of the other variables. The stochastic reduced system can capture the long-time statistical properties of the full system as well as the short-time dynamics, and hence make reliable predictions. A key ingredient in the construction of the stochastic reduced system is a discrete-time stochastic parametrization based on the NARMAX (nonlinear autoregression moving average with exogenous input) model. As an example, this construction is applied to the Lorenz 96 system.",

            "abstract": "Large portions of slow-spreading ridges have mantle-derived peridotites emplaced either on, or at shallow levels below the sea floor. Mantle and deep rock exposure in such contexts is often linked to extensional tectonics through low-angle detachment faults at oceanic core complexes or, along transform faults, to transtension due to small changes in spreading geometry.\nAt the large-offset St. Paul transform system, in the Equatorial Atlantic, a large body of ultramafic rocks forms the archipelago of St. Peter & St. Paul. These islets, emplaced near the axis of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, have intrigued geologists since Darwin’s time. They are made of variably serpentinized and mylonitized peridotites and the continuous uplift rate of 1.5 mm/yr reveals that they are presently under tectonic deformation. The existence of an abnormally cold upper mantle or cold lithosphere in the Equatorial Atlantic was, until now, the preferred explanation for the origin of these ultramafics.\nHigh-resolution geophysical data and rock samples acquired in the St. Paul transform system in 2013 show that the origin of the St. Peter & St. Paul archipelago is linked to compressive stresses along the large-offset transform fault. The islets are the summit of a large push-up ridge formed by deformed mantle located in the center of a positive flower structure, where large portions of mylonitized mantle are uplifted.\nThe transpressive stress field can be explained by the propagation of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) segment into the transform domain, which induced the migration and segmentation of the transform fault creating a series of restraining step-overs. A counterclockwise change in plate motion at ~11 Ma initially generated extensive stresses in the transform domain, forming a flexural transverse ridge, as observed in other transform faults. Shortly after the plate reorganization, the MAR segment started to propagate southwards, adapting to the new spreading direction. Enhanced melt supply at the ridge axis, possibly due to the nearby Sierra Leone thermal anomaly induced the robust response of this MAR segment.",

Aqua MODIS 1km LST products from MOD11 and MOD21 are validated by using combination of Radiance-based (R-based) method over bare and vegetation sites, and a Temperature-based (T-based) method over in-land water body sites. Validation results show that the MOD21 results are more accurate and are less uncertain over the bare sites while MOD11 products are more accurate over graybody surfaces, indicating their complementary nature over different land cover types. Using these results combined with an uncertainty analysis model, we leverage the strengths of each product to create unified and well characterized LST and emissivity Earth system data records (ESDR). We further validate the unified LST ESDR product and illustrate its use in monitoring long term trends and assessing variability in the Earth System.",

            "abstract": "An important aspect of eruption forecasting is predicting the path of propagating dikes. We have developed a method, which applies the minimum potential energy principle, for forecasting the path of laterally propagating dikes given the starting point of propagation. The method is computationally feasible and can be used to form a probability distribution for dike location in near-real time. We have compared our model to the propagation of the 2014 and 1996 dikes in the Bardarbunga volcanic system, Iceland. We found good agreement between predicted and observed propagation. Topography is very important for the model and our preferred forecasting model combines strain energy change of the crust and considers pressure gradients due to topography. We tested the influence of topography by running the model assuming no topography and found the path of the 2014 dike could not be hindcasted. The results suggest that not only is lateral dike propagation governed by deviatoric stresses but also pressure gradients and may, to lesser extent, be influenced by gravitational energy. Furthermore, the model predicts the formation of curved dikes around cone shape structures without the assumption of local deviatoric stress field. We suggest that a likely eruption site for a laterally propagating dike is in a topographic low. The method presented here is simple and computationally feasible. Our results indicate that this kind of a model can be applied to mitigate volcanic hazards in regions where the tectonic setting promotes formation of laterally propagating vertical intrusive sheets.",

            "abstract": "In coastal Southern California, variation in solar energy production is predominantly due to the presence\nof stratocumulus clouds (Sc), as they greatly attenuate surface solar irradiance and cover most\ndistributed photovoltaic systems on summer mornings. Correct prediction of the spatial coverage and\nlifetime of coastal Sc is therefore vital to the accuracy of solar energy forecasts in California.\nIn Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations, underprediction of Sc inherent in the\ninitial conditions directly leads to an underprediction of Sc in the resulting forecasts. Hence,\npreprocessing methods were developed to create initial conditions more consistent with observational\ndata and reduce spin-up time requirements.\nMathiesen et al. (2014) previously developed a cloud data assimilation system to force WRF initial\nconditions to contain cloud liquid water based on CIMSS GOES Sounder cloud cover. The Well-mixed\nPreprocessor and Cloud Data Assimilation (WEMPPDA) package merges an initial guess of cloud liquid\nwater content obtained from mixed-layer theory with assimilated CIMSS GOES Sounder cloud cover to\nmore accurately represent the spatial coverage of Sc at initialization.\nThe extent of Sc inland penetration is often constrained topographically; therefore, the low inversion\nbase height (IBH) bias in NAM initial conditions decreases Sc inland penetration. The Inversion Base\nHeight (IBH) package perturbs the initial IBH by the difference between model IBH and the 12Z\nradiosonde measurement.\nThe performance of these multi-initial-condition configurations was evaluated over June, 2013 against\nSolarAnywhere satellite-derived surface irradiance data. Four configurations were run: 1) NAM initial\nconditions, 2) RAP initial conditions, 3) WEMPPDA applied to NAM, and 4) IBH applied to NAM. Both\npreprocessing methods showed significant improvement in the prediction of both spatial coverage and\nlifetime of coastal Sc. The best performing configuration was then used to create a multi-parameter and\nmulti-physics ensemble. The ensemble forecast system is implemented operationally for San Diego Gas\n& Electric Company to improve system operations.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting the size, timing and style of volcanic eruptions is of primary interest to observatories and civil authorities world-wide, yet most observatories only have access to long-term data at a very limited number of volcanoes under their jurisdiction. When extensive long-term data sets are available to responsible agencies, volcanic eruptive size, timing and style can usually be successfully forecast using current monitoring data and knowledge of precursory eruptive patterns, enabling the communication of timely forecasts to civil authorities. Experienced agencies, such as Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geologic Hazards Mitigation and the USAID-USGS Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, utilize extensive collective experiences with multiple monitoring streams over multiple eruption cycles and across volcano types to successfully forecast eruption size, style and onset, as well as changes in eruptive style and size within ongoing eruptions.\nThe longest-term real-time monitoring parameter commonly available at volcanoes worldwide is seismic data. Seismic data is a direct measure of rate-dependent strain changes in the magmatic system from the deep magmatic input to shallow eruptive processes. Patterns of pre-eruptive earthquakes coupled with other available monitoring data and conceptual models of magma ascent enable short-term forecasting of eruption size, style, and onset. First order event locations, characterization of background seismicity, and changes in earthquake types and energy release are most important to successful eruption forecasting. This study demonstrates how this approach has been used to successfully forecast eruption onsets, changes in eruptive style, and to change alert levels and extend or contract evacuation zones during the ongoing eruption of Sinabung Volcano, Indonesia.",

Recent progress in the determination of fundamental acceleration parameters using novel techniques for the inversion of high resolution RHESSI hard X-ray spectra allows to determine non-thermal electron spectra at the loop top and foot points of a flare loop (Chen \\& Petrosian 2014). One outcome of this work is that the trapping and escape of the electrons is governed by wave particle scatterings and convergence of magnetic lines of force. Here, we present a computational study of the transport and escape processes of particles in the acceleration region. We employ a Fokker-Planck model, which includes pitch-angle scattering and magnetic mirroring in a non-uniform magnetic field. This allows to test analytical approximations for the particle escape times in the loop top region, which are helpful to constrain the key particle acceleration parameters. New perspectives will be given on how the insights gained from the analysis of the particle confinement will enable subsequent studies of a broader class of solar flares.",

            "abstract": "The appropriate representation of attenuation effects due to internal friction in the propagating media is an important factor in earthquake ground motion simulation. Inaccuracies in this regard may result in incorrect estimations of the amplification and duration of seismic waves. This is particularly relevant in regions with high dissipative properties. In physics-based simulations, the attenuation of seismic waves is typically introduced using viscoelastic models. Internally, the properties of these models are set based on the quality factor Q. In turn, the values of Q are set based on the seismic velocities Qp and Qs. In the case of shear waves, for instance, Qs is usually defined based on empirical rules that depend on the shear wave velocity, Vs. Typical Qs-Vs relationships are (piecewise) linear or polynomial functions. Several Qs-Vs relationships exist in the literature. There is, however, no consensus about the most appropriate choice. In this study we explore the behavior and effects of different Qs-Vs relationships in ground motion simulations of historical earthquakes. We propose a flexible Qs-Vs relationship and perform a parametric on different forms of the proposed Qs-Vs rule. The different relationship parameters are tested through the validation of synthetics with data from historical events, and through comparisons with intensity measures such as those used in empirical ground motion prediction equations. Our results suggest that there exist a preferred set of parameters for the choice of Qs-Vs relationships, and we provide insights on the selection process.",

This presentation briefly describes development of an objective detection algorithm based on integrated water vapor transport that can be used throughout the year and across the globe to identify AR-like features. Using output from this algorithm, we describe AR incidence over the North Pacific in terms of the long-term mean climatology, the seasonal cycle, and variability relating to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). The results indicate that ARs exist throughout the year over the North Pacific, but that their preferred locations shift substantially seasonally. It is also shown that changes to the North Pacific mean-state due to ENSO and the MJO may enhance or offset the seasonal cycle of AR activity, but that such impacts also vary greatly based on location. The characteristics of high-latitude ARs in places like Alaska--events that are not well documented in peer-reviewed journals--are discussed. Finally, the relationship between Alaska and U.S. West Coast AR activity and eastern Pacific blocking is also presented",

            "abstract": "The rapid movement of human civilization towards urbanization, industrialization, and increased agricultural activities has introduced a large amount of nitrate into groundwater. Nitrate is a toxic substance discharged from groundwater to rivers and leads to decreased dissolved oxygen and eutrophication. For this experiment, an electron donor is needed to convert nitrate into non-toxic nitrogen gas. Pyrite is one of the most abundant minerals in the earth’s crust making it an ideal candidate as an electron donor. The overall goal of this research was to investigate the potential for pyrite to be utilized as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification of nitrate-contaminated groundwater. Batch studies of particulate pyrite autotrophic denitrification (PPAD) of synthetic groundwater (100 mg NO3--N L-1) were set up with varying biomass concentration, pyrite dose, and pyrite particle size. Reactors were seeded with mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (VSS) from a biological nitrogen removal wastewater treatment facility. PPAD using small pyrite particles (<0.45mm) resulted in a favorable nitrate removal. The nitrate removal rate increased from 0.26 to 0.34 mg L-1h-1 and then to 0.86 mg L-1h-1, approaching that of the sulfur oxidizing denitrification (SOD) rate of 1.19 mg L-1h-1. Based on Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal amount of biomass concentration, pyrite dose, and pyrite particle size were 1,250 mg VSS L-1, 125 g L-1, and 0.815-1.015 mm, respectively. PPAD exhibited substantial nitrate removal rate, lower sulfate accumulation (5.46 mg SO42-/mg NO3--N) and lower alkalinity consumption (1.70 mg CaCO3/mg NO3--N) when compared to SOD (7.54 mg SO42-/mg NO3--N, 4.57 mg CaCO3/mg NO3--N based on stoichiometric calculation). This research revealed that the PPAD process is a promising technique for nitrate-contaminated groundwater treatment and promoted the utilization of pyrite in the field of environmental remediation.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol measurements from satellites in geosynchronous orbit allow for a unique opportunity to measure urban air quality at higher spatial and temporal resolution than possible with current ground-based monitoring and satellites in low earth orbit. Geosynchronous satellites will be able to measure air quality throughout the day for a specific region of interest (such as North America for the planned NASA TEMPO satellite). However, a key constraint on satellite measurements is the spatial resolution of the retrieved data products. As the satellite footprint increases, the precision of aerosol properties improves but the ability of the satellite to measure small-scale variations in pollution diminishes. Currently, TEMPO is planned to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD) with a spatial resolution of 36 square-km. In this study, sub-pixel variability is used as a metric of how representative the satellite measurement is of ground-based air quality.\nData from the DISCOVER-AQ airborne project are used to determine the sub-pixel variability in AOD, boundary layer extinction and other aerosol properties in four U.S. regions: Baltimore, Maryland, Houston, Texas, Denver, Colorado, and California’s San Joaquin Valley. Sub-pixel variability in boundary layer extinction was lowest in Denver (one sigma variability of 3 /Mm at 36 square-km spatial resolution) due to low aerosol loadings and highest in the San Joaquin Valley (19 /Mm) due to variable boundary layer depths and stagnant conditions. Variability in AOD (measured by an airborne high-spectral resolution lidar) was more consistent among the sites (0.017 to 0.035) due to a reduced dependence on changes in the planetary boundary layer. The effects of our analysis will also be discussed in relation to the use of satellite measurements to infer air quality attainment. Larger satellite data footprints reduce the ability of satellites to identify small regions in urban areas with elevated pollution (i.e. hotspots) which was found to be the case during the Houston campaign and thus may underestimate air quality problems in a region.",

            "abstract": "The deep-sea is the largest habitat on Earth, contains highly diverse biota, but is very little known. Many of its abundant benthic biota (e.g., nematodes) are not preserved in the fossil record. Calcareous and agglutinated benthic foraminifera (unicellular eukaryotes, Rhizaria; efficient dispersers) and ostracodes (Animalia, Crustacea; non-efficient dispersers) are the most common organisms providing a fossil record of deep-sea environments. Very little food is supplied to the deep-sea, because organic matter produced by photosynthesis is largely degraded before it arrives at the seafloor. Only a few % of organic matter is carried to the ocean bottom by ‘marine snow’, with its particle size and behavior in the water column controlled by surface ecosystem structure, including type of dominant primary producers (diatoms, cyanobacteria). Food supply and its seasonality are generally seen as the dominant control on benthic assemblages (combined with oxygenation), providing bentho-pelagic coupling between primary and benthic productivity. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages (composition and density) thus are used widely to estimate past productivity, especially during episodes of global climate change, ocean acidification, and mass extinction of primary producers. We show that some environmental circumstances may result in interrupting bentho-pelagic coupling, e.g. through lateral supply of organic matter along continental margins (adding more refractory organic matter), through trophic focusing and/or fine particle winnowing on seamounts (giving an advantage to suspension feeders), and through carbonate undersaturation (giving advantage to infaunal over epifaunal calcifyers). In addition, increased remineralization of organic matter combined with increased metabolic rates may cause assemblages to reflect more oligotrophic conditions at stable primary productivity during periods of global warming. As a result, benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates must be carefully evaluated before use as proxies for primary productivity.",

The utility of advanced FTICR-MS and 13C-NMR approaches is presented for assessing the seasonal variability in DOM composition for samples collected across the hydrograph (2008 and 2009) from the Yukon River at Pilot Station, Alaska. FTICR-MS analyses were obtained on whole water samples while one- and two-dimensional solid-state NMR analyses were performed on the hydrophobic organic acid (HPOA) and transphilic organic acid (TPIA) fractions obtained using XAD resins (accounting for 64-74% of the DOM). Both approaches indicated that lignin-derived and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) were major fractions of all samples collected throughout the year, and that contributions from black carbon were minor. Each approach also provided unique information. FTICR-MS indicated the presence in spring of compounds containing sulfur that previously were identified to be atmospherically deposited combustion products in glacial meltwaters. These likely were deposited with snowfall. NMR analyses indicated that HPOA isolates from the spring period were characterized by greater contributions from lignin residues and carbohydrate-like materials than those from summer-autumn and winter. In addition, the spring TPIA samples had a predominance of carbohydrate, which was much less evident in the structures of summer-autumn and winter TPIA isolates. Spring DOM, therefore, was representative of inputs from freshly leached plant materials. These relatively fresh organic materials were depleted in summer-fall and winter samples, indicating that summer-fall and especially winter DOM was associated with more extensively degraded DOM and older DOM pools. These results provide chemical evidence supporting observations that spring freshet DOM in Arctic rivers is more biolabile than DOM exported at other times of the year.",

            "abstract": "We address the problem of verifying the self-consistency of earthquake simulators with the data from which their parameters are drawn. Earthquake simulators are a class of computational simulations which attempt to mirror the topological complexity of the earthquake fault system on which the earthquakes occur. In addition, the physics of friction and elastic interactions between fault elements can be included in these simulations as well. In general, the parameters are adjusted so that natural earthquake sequences are matched in their scaling properties in an optimal way. Generally, these parameters choices are based on paleoseismic data extending over many hundreds and thousands of years. However, one of the problems encountered is the verification of the simulations applied to current earthquake seismicity. It is this problem, for which no currently accepted solution has been proposed, that is the objective of the present paper. Physically-based earthquake simulators allow the generation of many thousands of years of simulated seismicity, allowing for robust capture of statistical properties of large, damaging earthquakes that have long recurrence time scales for observation. Following past simulator and forecast model verification efforts, we approach the challenges in spatial forecast verification fo simulators; namely, that simulator output events are confined to the modeled faults, while observed earthquakes often occur off of known faults. We present two methods for overcoming this discrepancy: a simplistic approach whereby observed earthquakes are shifted to the nearest fault element and a variation of the Epidemic-type aftershock (ETAS) model, which smears the simulator catalog seismicity over the entire test region. To test these methods, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot was produced by comparing the rate maps to observed m>6.0 earthquakes since 1980. We found that the nearest-neighbor mapping produced poor forecasts, while the modified ETAS method produced rate maps that agreed with observations. These ETAS results were further analyzed by comparing them against catalogs of earthquakes randomly generated from the ETAS rate map. The observed ROC scores for all simulators were near or exceeded the 95th percentile of the distribution of random scores.",

            "abstract": "The current California drought has cast a heavy burden on statewide agriculture and water resources, further exacerbated by concurrent extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, industrial-era global radiative forcing brings into question the role of long-term climate change on CA drought. How has human-induced climate change affected California drought risk? Here, observations and model experimentation are applied to characterize this drought employing metrics that synthesize drought duration, cumulative precipitation deficit, and soil moisture depletion. The model simulations show that increases in radiative forcing since the late 19th Century induces both increased annual precipitation and increased surface temperature over California, consistent with prior model studies and with observed long-term change. As a result, there is no material difference in the frequency of droughts defined using bivariate indicators of precipitation and near-surface (10-cm) soil moisture, because shallow soil moisture responds most sensitively to increased evaporation driven by warming, which compensates the increase in the precipitation. However, when using soil moisture within a deep root zone layer (1-m) as co-variate, droughts become less frequent because deep soil moisture responds most sensitively to increased precipitation. The results illustrate the different land surface responses to anthropogenic forcing that are relevant for near-surface moisture exchange and for root zone moisture availability. The latter is especially relevant for agricultural impacts as the deep layer dictates moisture availability for plants, trees, and many crops. The results thus indicate the net effect of climate change has made agricultural drought less likely, and that the current severe impacts of drought on California’s agriculture has not been substantially caused by long-term climate changes.",

Characterization of weathered bedrock, under different weathering environments, can lead to an improved understanding of the regulating factors for forest health and drought tolerance. Little is known about spatial patterns of weathered bedrock characteristics in the southern Sierra Nevada, because of the challenges and cost of sampling. The objective of this study is to evaluate morphological, physical and chemical properties of soil and weathered granitic bedrock, along an elevation gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada Critical Zone Observatory. Three catchments were selected at elevation of 400 m, 1100 m, and 2000 m. Cores were collected using a Geoprobe to the depth of refusal. Preliminary results show that weathered bedrock thickness increased with elevation, while the degree of soil development (as indicated by clay stocks in soil) was greatest at the mid-elevation (1100 m). Weathered bedrock at 2000 m is a large reservoir for water and nutrient (plant available P & K) due to its thickness. The storage capacity of water and nutrients in weathered bedrock decreases dramatically as elevation and regolith thickness decreases. While carbon content in weathered bedrock is low, the C stock at 1100 m and 2000 m sites was similar to that of soil at 400 m. In general, trends across the elevation gradient for C, P and K are similar when comparing soil and weathered bedrock, increasing with elevation with the exception that available P in soil was highest at 1100 m. If relationships between characteristics of soil and weathered bedrock can be established, soil properties could be used to predict conditions in weathered bedrock that regulate forest productivity, which are currently unobtainable at broad scales.",

An in-situ soil observation protocol developed at Oregon State University has been deployed to observe soil water and temperature dynamics in seven ecological research sites in North America as part of the NASA AirMOSS project. Three instrumented profiles defining a transect of less than 200 m are installed at each site. All three profiles collect data for in-situ water and temperature dynamics employing seven soil water and temperature sensors installed at seven depth levels and one infrared surface temperature sensor monitoring the top of the profile. In addition, two soil heat flux plates and associated thermocouples are installed at one of three profiles at each site. At each profile, a small 80 cm deep access hole is typically made, and all below ground sensors are installed into undisturbed soil on the side of the hole. The hole is carefully refilled and compacted so that root zone soil water and temperature dynamics can be observed with minimum site disturbance. This study focuses on the data collected from three sites: a) Tonzi Ranch, CA; b) Metolius, OR and c) BERMS Old Jack Pine Site, Saskatchewan, Canada. The study describes the significantly different seasonal root zone water and temperature dynamics under the various physical and biological conditions at each site. In addition, this study compares the soil heat flux values estimated by the standard installation using the heat flux plates and thermocouples installed near the surface with those estimated by resolving the soil heat storage based on the soil water and temperature data collected over the total soil profile.",

Recent ambient-field studies have successfully observed higher-mode surface waves and body wave propagation at various scales of the Earth. These new observations paved the way for a more accurate seismic hazard assessment for which a detailed knowledge of seismic wave propagation is critical, especially in complex media such as sedimentary basins. While the effects of basin resonance are widely appreciated and understood, basin-edge effects are usually less well constrained, but have been used to explain zones of concentrated damage in the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. In this study, we use the dense MeSO-net (MEtropolitan Seismic Observation network) seismic network, deployed in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and the sparse, but high quality, Hi-net (High sensitivity seismograph network) to identify the dominant modes of wave propagation within the Kanto Basin. Our goal is to explore how the wavefield behaves in the vicinity of sharp basin edges. When combined with the ambient seismic field interferometry, dense, 3-component, seismic arrays provide a new opportunity to image such propagation effects. Using array processing techniques, we show that mode conversions, reflection, and diffractions, in particular at basin edges dominate the ground motion in the Kanto Basin. Accurate predictions of strong ground motion, and its variability, must account for these effects.",

            "abstract": "Tremor is often thought to be a proxy for slip during ETS events and has been shown to have a relatively abrupt updip boundary, implying an abrupt updip limit of slip. However, as shown by Houston (AGU abstract, 2012) and Hall and Houston (AGU abstract, 2014), slip inferred from GPS extended updip of the seismically-detected tremor in the 2010 M6.8 and 2012 M6.7 ETS events. If slip extending updip of tremor is a persistent phenomena, tremor cannot be directly used as a proxy for slip. Following the methods used on the 2010 and 2012 ETS event, we found that the August 2009 ETS around Portland, OR also showed slip updip of tremor. Principal Component Analysis was implemented to automatically select the direction and magnitude of the maximum displacement vector. Our Green’s functions use the Okada formulation of buried rectangular faults in a halfspace for a grid of 8x8 km subfaults based on the McCrory slab model. We then performed static inversions with 2nd order Tikhonov regularization to find slip on the fault surface. We also compared two different inversions for 2009, one where slip was allowed on a broad regional grid and a tremor-restricted inversion (TRI) where slip was restricted to subfaults in which tremor occurred. We found the 2009 ETS event released the equivalent of a M6.8 in slip. We also found that, as in the previous ETSs, the TRI forced up to 10 cm of slip to the updip edge of the grid, which is exceeds the amount of plate convergence expected in the inter-ETS periods and is therefore physically unsustainable over several ETS events. The excess slip along the updip edge in the TRI models also suggests that the geodetic data prefer slip with a larger footprint than the spatial pattern of tremor, and supports our conclusion that tremor does not represent all of the slip during an ETS event. We see consistent and clear spatial relationship between tremor and slip with some slip occurring updip of tremor. Our static inversions show where slip is occurring we also want to know when slip is occurring relative to tremor. We will further explore this relationship by using the Extended Network Inversion Filter (ENIF) (Segall and Matthews, 1997; McGuire and Segall, 2005). By using the ENIF we can estimate the slip and slip rate on subfaults, and find in particular, when the updip slow slip tends to occur relative to the tremor front.",

            "abstract": "The rivers that supply water to most of the West rise in the Rocky Mountains. As drought increases across the country, understanding the hydrology of these alpine regions becomes important to assuring water supplies in the future. Near surface geophysics can help in this effort. In this study, resistivity data from an airborne electromagnetic survey in the Snowy Range was analyzed to map groundwater distribution. The EM survey covered an area of approximately 60 km2 to a depth of around 150 m. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) point soundings provided ground truthing by testing whether water was present, at what depth, and how much. The survey area contained vertically dipping metasedimentary rocks, covered in places by unconsolidated glacial and fluvial deposits.\nThe resistivity data showed horizontal variation in water content much more clearly than vertical changes, which were best detected by NMR. To allow for comparisons across different lithologies and depths, resistivity measurements were first log transformed to produce a more normal distribution, then classed by depth and formation and assigned standardized scores using the mean and standard deviation for those classes. To determine the typical appearance of wet areas, points in the near surface were classed as wet or dry based on proximity to surface water. Logistic regression was used to determine the probability that points with a given standardized score were wet. Where a relationship existed between proximity to surface water and conductivity, this information was translated into a map of groundwater distribution at greater depths. NMR soundings provided quantitative measurements of water content, which were used as known points within these horizontal maps to determine the actual water levels being detected.",

            "abstract": "High-frequency multi-year observations of the water table at several wells in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in the Eel River Watershed in northern California show rapid fluctuations, where the water table, some 10-15 meters below the surface, rises by as much as 1 meter in a day or two after the first storms of the rain season. The observations highlight preferential flow through weathered bedrock, which can store as much as 30% of the moisture in the column (“rock moisture”). This rapid transfer of moisture and storage at depth could have a significant impact on ecosystem dynamics and the water and energy budgets of the atmosphere on various time scales.\nDespite its high importance, preferential flow through weather bedrock is not routinely captured in most climate models. This work presents a new hydraulic conductivity parameterization that captures the preferential flow, with straightforward implementation into current global climate models. The hydraulic conductivity is represented as a product of the effective saturation (normalized water content) and a background hydraulic conductivity Kbkg, drawn from a depth dependent lognormal distribution. A unique feature of the parameterization is that the variance of hydraulic conductivity is large when there is little rock moisture, and decreases with increasing saturation, mimicking flow through fractures.\nThe new method is applied to seven wells locations on a steep (35 degrees) hill-slope in the Eel River watershed in Northern California, for the duration of six years and estimates of the model parameters are provided by assimilating, into Richards’ equation, measurements of precipitation [mm] and water table depths [m] at 30-minute time intervals.\nThe simulation results show that the new approach yields a good agreement of the rapid rise of the observed water table at the tested well locations. Furthermore, the water stored in the weathered bedrock is estimated to be in the range between 32% and 41%, which could account for a large fraction of water in the column.",

            "abstract": "Snow sublimation can be an important component of the snow-cover mass balance and there is considerable interest in quantifying the role of this process within the water and energy balance of snow-covered regions. In recent years, robust eddy-covariance instrumentation has allowed for the direct measurement of snow sublimation over snow-covered surfaces. However, eddy covariance measurements can be challenging for monitoring turbulent fluxes in snow-covered environments because of intensive data and power needs, and rigorous fetch requirements; thus, alternative methods of estimating snow sublimation are often relied upon. To evaluate the performance of alternative methods, measurements made by eddy covariance were compared to estimates of snow sublimation made by the Bowen-ratio energy-balance, bulk-aerodynamic flux, and aerodynamic-profile methods in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Seasonal average sublimation rates measured by eddy covariance were 0.29 mm day-1 in water year 2014 and 0.34 mm day-1 in water year 2015, suggesting that at well exposed sites located below tree line, sublimation can account for approximately 8 – 16% of peak snow water equivalent in this region. The bulk-aerodynamic flux method exhibited the smallest bias and strongest correlation with eddy covariance, and has the simplest instrumentation requirements; thus was concluded to be the best alternative for estimating snow sublimation when eddy covariance measurements are not available. However, special care should be taken to properly assess (and calibrate) this method to avoid large flux biases as observed in this study.",

Understanding flow and solute transport over micro-patterned surfaces is essential to improve our predictive understanding of transport in structurally heterogeneous porous media, which provides insight of many environmental processes including CO$_2$ sequestration and bioremediation. We are interested in seeking the relationship between surface topological structure and its impact on solute transport. We consider a thin fracture embedded in a permeable porous matrix. By means of homogenization technique, we upscale the transport equation and obtain a macro-scale dispersion coefficient which depends on the geometrical characteristic of the matrix, i.e. porous layer permeability and width. This expression generalizes a number of former studies, including the classical form of the Aris-Taylor dispersion coefficient and more recent results based on the assumption of purely diffusive mass transport in the matrix. Based on the upscaled equation, we provide a two-dimensional solution for the concentration profiles both inside the fracture and the matrix. Finally, we show good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the experimental data performed on a series of microfluidic cells with different matrix geometries/permeabilities for a wide range of Peclet numbers.",

In northern Alaska, marine deposits now 5-10 m above modern sea level are assigned to this time period and termed the Pelukian transgression (PT). Complicating this interpretation is the possibility that an intra-Stage 5 ice shelf extended along the Alaskan coast, causing isostatic depression along its grounded margins, which caused RSL highs even during periods of low, global RSL. Here we use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date inferred PT deposits on the Beaufort Sea coastal plain. A transition from what we interpret to be lagoonal mud to sandy tidal flat deposits lying ~ 2.75 m asl dates to 113+/-18 ka. Above this, a 5-m thick gravelly barrier beach dates to 95 +/- 20 ka. This beach contains well-preserved marine molluscs, whale vertebrae, and walrus tusks. Pleistocene-aged ice-rich eolian silt (yedoma) blanket the marine deposits and date to 57.6 +/-10.9 ka. Our interpretation of this chronostratigraphy is that RSL was several meters higher than today during MIS 5e, and lagoons or brackish lakes were prevalent. Gravel barrier beaches moved onshore as local RSL rose further after MIS 5e. The error range of the OSL age of the barrier-beach unit spans the remaining four substages of MIS 5; however, the highstand of RSL on this arctic coastline appears to occurr after the warmest part of the last interglacial and appears not to be coeval with the eustatic maximum reached at lower latitudes during MIS 5. One possibility is that RSL along the Beaufort Sea coast was affected by isostatic depression caused by an ice shelf associated with widespread, intra-Stage 5 glaciation that was out of phase with lower latitude glaciation and whose extent and timing remains enigmatic.",

            "abstract": "Chromium used in Los Alamos National Laboratory cooling towers was released as effluent onto laboratory property between 1956 and 1972. As a result, the underlying regional aquifer is contaminated with chromium (VI), a toxin and carcinogen. The highest concentration of chromium is ~1 ppm in monitoring well R-42, exceeding the New Mexico drinking water standard of 50 ppb. The chromium plume is currently being investigated to identify an effective remediation method. Geologic heterogeneity within the aquifer causes the hydraulic conductivity within the plume to be spatially variable. This variability, particularly with depth, is crucial for predicting plume transport behavior. Though pump tests are useful for obtaining estimates of site specific hydraulic conductivity, they tend to interrogate hydraulic properties of only the most conductive strata. Variations in particle size distribution as a function of depth can complement pump test data by providing estimates of vertical variations in hydraulic conductivity. Samples were collected from five different sonically-drilled core holes within the chromium plume at depths ranging from 732’-1125’ below the surface. To obtain particle size distributions, the samples were sieved into six different fractions from the fine sands to gravel range (>4 mm, 2-4 mm, 1.4-2 mm, 0.355-1.4 mm, 180-355 µm, and smaller than 180 µm). The Kozeny-Carmen equation (k=(δg/µ)(dm2/180)(Φ3/(1-Φ)2)), was used to estimate permeability from the particle size distribution data. Pump tests estimated a hydraulic conductivity varying between 1 and 50 feet per day. The Kozeny-Carmen equation narrowed this estimate down to an average value of 2.635 feet per day for the samples analyzed, with a range of 0.971 ft/day to 6.069 ft/day. The results of this study show that the Kozeny-Carmen equation provides quite specific estimates of hydraulic conductivity in the Los Alamos aquifer. More importantly, it provides pertinent information on the expected variations with depth in hydraulic conductivity not obtainable from pump tests. This information is a prerequisite for modeling the spatial variation of the chromium plume and formulate remediation strategies.",

We have refined the crystal structures of these wadsleyites, analyzed the compositions by electron microprobe, and estimated M3 vacancy contents from b/a cell-parameter ratios. Trivalent cations, Fe, Cr and V, show a strong preference for M3 over M1 and M2 and significant substitution up to 2.8% at the tetrahedral site. Divalent Ni, Co, and Zn show site preferences similar to those of Fe2+ with M1≈ M3 > M2 > T. This site preference appears to be due crystal field stabilization energies rather than cation radius effects. Trivalent Cr, and V have much greater solubilities in wadsleyite than in olivine and so may be enriched in a melt or an accessory phase if hydrous melting occurs on upward convection across the wadsleyite-olivine boundary and may be useful as indicators of high pressure origin.",

            "abstract": "Marine terraces are low-relief platforms located along coastal areas. They are formed by waves action with the changes in the relative sea level (RSL) that is affected by combined effects of the eustatic sea level (ESL) and the tectonic movements (e.g. uplift, subsidence and isostatic effect). Therefore, determining the ages and the elevations of the marine terraces allows us to reconstruct the ESL and/or the tectonic history of the study area.\nThe Kii Peninsula and the southern coast of the Shikoku Island are located along the Nankai Trough where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Eurasian plate. There exist relatively well-preserved marine terraces along the coastal line with the elevation of ca. 50 –100 m. Because of this unique tectonic setting, the terraces are regarded as the suitable counterparts to reconstruct uplift history of the south coast of Japan. However, the ages of these terraces are poorly understood due to the lack of the ash layers that is suitable for the tephrochronology. In this study, we determine the age of the marine terraces using terrestrial in-situ cosmogenic radionuclides (TCN), 10Be and 26Al. This is the first age estimation of the marine terraces in Japan using TCN, allowing us to determine the uplift rates and the seismic history of the region.",

            "abstract": "Late Holocene earthquake timing and displacement data from 20 trench sites along the 260-km-long central Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) clarify whether structural complexities that define the five central segments act as persistent barriers to rupture. From these sites we compiled earthquake-timing probability density functions for 69 earthquakes younger than 7 ka. However, we rely mostly on earthquakes that are less than 3 ka because they have the smallest timing uncertainties and thus are the most suitable for discerning differences in earthquake timing along the fault and assessing fault segmentation. Along the northern segments, clear differences in earthquake timing across prominent structural and topographic boundaries (e.g., bedrock salients and areas of complex faulting) are consistent with models of a segmented fault. In contrast, along the southern segments, overlapping earthquake times and the greater structural complexity of the fault make it difficult to determine rupture extent. On the central WFZ as a whole, older, less-well constrained earthquake times, per-event vertical displacements, and the presence of smaller-scale (intra-segment) boundaries permit partial-segment, spillover, and multi-segment ruptures that are shorter (~20­–40 km) or longer (~100 km) than the defined lengths of the segments (35–59 km). We present a segmented model for the central WFZ that includes 24 ruptures since ~7 ka and yields mean estimates of vertical displacement (1.7–2.6 m), recurrence (1.0–1.3 kyr), and vertical slip rates (1.3–2.0 mm/yr) for the segments. However, for hazard analysis, additional rupture scenarios that include segment-boundary spatial uncertainties, earthquakes of varying rupture length allowed to float along the fault, and multi-segment ruptures are necessary to fully address epistemic uncertainties in segmentation and rupture length.",

            "abstract": "Because the terrestrial rock record extends only to ~4 Ga and older materials thus far identified are limited to detrital zircons, information about volatile abundances and cycles on early Earth is limited.  Carbon, for instance, plays an important role not only in the modern biosphere but also in deep recycling of materials between the crust and mantle.  We are investigating the record of carbon abundance and origin in Hadean zircons from Jack Hills (W. Australia) using two main approaches.  First, carbon may partition into the zircon structure at trace levels during crystallization from a magma, and better understanding of this partitioning behavior will allow for zircon’s use as a monitor of magmatic carbon contents.  We have measured carbon abundances in zircon from a variety of igneous rocks (gabbro; I-, A-, and S-type granitoids) via SIMS and found that although abundances are typically low (average raw 12C/30Si ~ 1x10-6), S-type granite zircons can reach a factor of 1000 over this background.  Around 10% of Hadean zircons investigated show similar enrichments, consistent with other evidence for the derivation of many Jack Hills zircons from S-type granitoids and with the establishment of modern-level carbon abundances in the crust by ca. 4.2 Ga.  Diamond and graphite inclusions reported in the Jack Hills zircons by previous studies proved to be contamination by polishing debris, leaving the true abundance of these materials in the population uncertain.  On a second front, we have identified and investigated primary carbonaceous inclusions in these zircons.  From a population of over 10,000 Jack Hills zircons, we identified one concordant 4.10±0.01 Ga zircon that contains primary graphite inclusions (so interpreted due to their enclosure in a crack-free zircon host as shown by transmission X-ray microscopy and their crystal habit).  Their δ13CPDB of -24±5‰ is consistent with a biogenic origin and, in the absence of a likely inorganic mechanism to produce such a signal in a felsic igneous setting, may be evidence that a terrestrial biosphere had emerged by 4.1 Ga, or ~300 Ma earlier than has been previously proposed.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of naturally reduced zones is common in alluvial aquifers in the western U.S.A. due to the burial of woody debris in flood plains. Such reduced zones are usually heterogeneously dispersed in these aquifers and characterized by high concentrations of organic carbon, reduced mineral phases, and reduced forms of metals, including uranium(IV). The persistence of high concentrations of dissolved uranium(VI) at uranium-contaminated aquifers on the Colorado Plateau has been attributed to slow oxidation of insoluble uranium(IV) mineral phases found in association with these reducing zones, although there is little understanding of the relative importance of various potential oxidants. Four field experiments were conducted within an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River near Rifle, CO, wherein groundwater associated with the naturally reduced zones was pumped into a gas-impermeable tank, mixed with a conservative tracer (Br-), bubbled with a gas phase composed of 97% O2 and 3% CO2, and then returned to the subsurface in the same well from which it was withdrawn. Within minutes of re-injection of the oxygenated groundwater, dissolved uranium(VI) concentrations increased from less than 1 µM to greater than 2.5 µM, demonstrating that oxygen can be an important oxidant for uranium in such field systems if supplied to the naturally reduced zones. Dissolved Fe(II) concentrations decreased to the detection limit, but increases in sulfate could not be detected due to high background concentrations. Changes in nitrogen species concentrations were variable. The results contrast with other laboratory and field results in which oxygen was introduced to systems containing high concentrations of mackinawite (FeS), rather than the more crystalline iron sulfides found in aged, naturally reduced zones. The flux of oxygen to the naturally reduced zones in the alluvial aquifers occurs mainly through interactions between groundwater and gas phases at the water table. Seasonal variations of the water table at the Rifle, CO site may play an important role in introducing oxygen into the system. Although oxygen was introduced directly to the naturally reduced zones in these experiments, delivery of oxidants to the system may also be controlled by other oxidative pathways in which oxygen plays an indirect role.",

            "abstract": "Coexistence of three methane phases (liquid (L), gas (G), hydrate (H)) in marine gas hydrate systems may occur according to in-situ pressure, temperature, salinity and pore size. In sediments with salinity close to seawater, a discrete zone of three-phase (3P) equilibrium may occur near the base of the regional hydrate stability zone (RHSZ) due to capillary effects. The existence of a 3P zone influences the location of the bottom-simulating reflection (BSR) and has implications for methane fluxes at the base of the RHSZ. We studied hydrate stability conditions in two wells, WR313-G and WR313-H, at Walker Ridge Block 313 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We determined pore size distributions (PSD) by constructing a synthetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time distribution. Correlations were obtained by non-linear regression on NMR, gamma ray, and bulk density logs from well KC-151 at Keathley Canyon. The correlations enabled construction of relaxation time distributions for WR313-G and WR313-H, which were used to predict PSD through comparison with mercury injection capillary pressure measurements. With the computed PSD, L+H and L+G methane solubility was determined from in-situ pressure and temperature. The intersection of the L+G and L+H curves for various pore sizes allowed calculation of the depth range of the 3P equilibrium zone. As in previous studies at Blake Ridge and Hydrate Ridge, the top of the 3P zone moves upwards with increasing water depth and overlies the bulk 3P equilibrium depth. In clays at Walker Ridge, the predicted thickness of the 3P zone is approximately 35 m, but in coarse sands it is only a few meters due to the difference in absolute pore sizes and the width of the PSD. The thick 3P zone in the clays may explain in part why the BSR is only observed in the sand layers at Walker Ridge, although other factors may influence the presence or absence of a BSR.",

            "abstract": "A significant fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is assimilated by tropical forests and stored as biomass, slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Because different plant tissues have different functional roles and turnover times, predictions of carbon balance of tropical forests depend on how earth system models (ESMs) represent the dynamic allocation of productivity to different tree compartments. This study shows that observed allocation of productivity, biomass, and turnover times of main tree compartments (leaves, wood, and roots) are not accurately represented in CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) ESMs. In particular, observations indicate that biomass saturates with increasing productivity. In contrast, most models predict continuous increases in biomass with increases in productivity. This bias may lead to an over-prediction of carbon uptake in response to CO2 or climate-driven changes in productivity. Compartment-specific productivity and biomass are useful benchmarks to assess terrestrial ecosystem model performance. Improvements in the predicted allocation patterns and turnover times by ESMs will reduce uncertainties in climate predictions.",

            "abstract": "For natural resource managers and other Great Plains stakeholders, climate uncertainties further confound decision-making on a highly altered landscape. Partner organizations comprising the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GPLCC) acknowledge climate change as a high-priority threat to grasslands and associated habitats, affecting water availability, species composition, and other factors. Despite its importance, incorporation of climate change impacts into planning is hindered by high uncertainty and lack of translation to a tangible outcome: effects on species and their habitats. In 2014, the GPLCC initiated a Landscape Conservation Design (LCD) process to ultimately improve the size and connectivity of grasslands – informing land managers of the landscape-scale impacts of local decisions about where to restore, enhance, protect, and develop lands. Defining this goal helped stakeholders envision a tangible product. High resolution land cover data recently completed for Texas and Oklahoma represent current grassland locations. By focusing climate change models to project changes in these land cover datasets, resulting land cover projections can be directly incorporated into LCD-based models to focus restoration where future climates will support grasslands. Broad organizational cooperation has been critical for this USGS-led project, which uses downscaled climate data and other support from the South Central Climate Science Center Consortium and builds on existing work including LCD efforts of the Playa Lakes Joint Venture and the Bureau of Land Management’s Southern Great Plains Rapid Ecological Assessment. Ongoing stakeholder guidance through an advisory team ensures effective application of a product that will be both relevant to and understood by decision makers, for whom the primary role of research is to reduce uncertainties and clear the path for more efficient decision-making in the face of climatic uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "With several rift segments at different stages of the rifting cycle, and the last orogenic episode more than 500 Mya, the young (<7 My) Eastern rift system in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya offers an ideal venue to study the role of magma and other fluids in continental rifting. To estimate both the location and volume of magma beneath the rift system, we generated 3D elastic wave images of the crust and uppermost mantle of this region by analyzing data recorded by a local deployment of 40 broad band seismic stations over a period of two years. We jointly inverted P and S wave arrival times from locally recorded earthquakes with Rayleigh wave dispersion curves derived from cross correlating ambient noise. These results were combined with Bouguer gravity anomalies to increase resolution and add constraints. The ambient noise signal appears to be channeled along the axis of the rift system, suggesting a waveguide effect. Tests with synthetic data estimate a spatial resolution in our images on the order of a few km. Our results demonstrate fundamental modifications of continental crustal structure by magmatic processes during the first few My of rift basin development. To first order, our models are dominated by regions of exceptionally low (by 10-20%) shear wavespeed relative to that of average continental crust. To a large extent the wavespeeds mimic the topography, with the slowest shear wave speeds corresponding to the lowest elevations, and tracing out a NE-SW striking region about 20 km wide from the Natron basin in the north to a NW-SE region of similar width beneath the Manyara basin in the south. These low wavespeeds are likely to be a consequence of the presence of magma and other fluids from at least 30 km depth, the limit of depth resolution for this dataset and near the base of the crust (~35 km), and extending to upper crustal levels in some areas. Somewhat surprisingly, a second region of significant low wavespeed beneath the Ngorongoro caldera appears to be physically cut off from the magma beneath the main part of the rift zone by a relatively thin (< 10 km) wide zone of higher shear wave speeds that lies along the western edge of the fault-bounded rift. The narrow ridge of higher velocity lower crustal material may be a consequence of flexural uplift of the rift flank in response to stretching of strong, cratonic lithosphere.",

Causality for the close NEP–SDV relationship is poorly understood, but radial stem growth has been suggested to play a crucial role. Despite its huge ecological implications, and being ‘hot’ in anatomical, ecophysiologial, and ecological disciplines, radial stem growth in trees remains poorly understood (Steppe et al. 2015). While high-resolution SDV mirror a source of tree physiological information, unambiguous interpretation of dendrometer readings is more complicated than it appears at first sight, with a great potential still waiting to be discovered (De Swaef et al. 2015, Zweifel 2015). Also an integrative framework to assess impacts of climate on stem growth is still lacking, although such a theory is very much needed to predict annual tree growth patterns as well as future production and carbon sequestration potential of forests (Steppe et al. 2015). In this keynote lecture, I will present the major fluxes and pools of water and carbon inside a stem segment of a tree. I will examine diel dynamics in radial stem growth from underlying water and carbon mechanisms under wet and dry conditions, distinguishing between known patterns and processes, and more speculative ones. Discussions will be based on observations in the different research disciplines, but also result from mechanistic plant models aiming at integration. Based on this, I will show missing pieces that might be critical to build an integrative theory to understand causes and consequences of tree stem growth. Addressing these key-missing pieces of information may help improving quantification of terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake and storage.\n",

There have been several studies in which Q is modeled using viscoelastic devices, where the effects of internal friction are represented by springs and dashpots. A recently introduced model, called the BKT model (after authors Bielak, Karaoglu and Taborda), proposed the use of two Maxwell elements (each made of a spring and a dashpot connected in series) in combination with a Voigt element (consisting of a spring and a dashpot connected in parallel). The BKT model showed very good adherence to intended values of constant Q = Qo. It, however, depended on a set of parameters precomputed arbitrarily for different values of Qo, and was limited to problems under the assumption of frequency independent attenuation. In this work we show that the internal parameters used in the BKT model can be set using exact expressions formulated based on a numerical optimization of the model's fit with Qo. This formulation holds for any value of Qo. In addition, we show that using three Maxwell elements substantially improves the accuracy of the model and increases its flexibility, allowing one to model problems with frequency-dependent Q = Qo(f). This latter extension of the BKT model is of critical significance for deterministic physics-based earthquake simulations done at frequencies of engineering interest (f > 1 Hz).",

            "abstract": "Up-looking total electron content (TEC) measurements from multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been utilized to study the topside ionospheric response to the 17 March 2015 great storm. The combined up-looking TEC observations from these LEO satellites are valuable in addressing the local time and altitudinal dependences of the topside ionospheric response to geomagnetic storms from a global perspective, especially over the southern hemisphere and oceans. In the evening sector, the up-looking TEC showed an obvious long-duration of positive storm effect during the main phase and a long duration of negative storm effect during the recovery phase of this storm. The increases of the topside TEC during the main phase were symmetric with respect to the magnetic equator, which was probably associated with penetration electric fields. Additionally, the up-looking TEC from different orbital altitudes suggested that the negative storm effect at higher altitudes was stronger in the evening sector. In the morning sector, the up-looking TEC also showed increases at low and middle latitudes during the storm main phase. Obvious TEC enhancement can be also seen over the Pacific Ocean in the topside ionosphere during the storm recovery phase. These results imply that the topside ionospheric responses significantly depend on local time. Thus, the LEO-based up-looking TEC provides an important database to study the possible physical mechanisms of the topside ionospheric response to storms.",

            "abstract": "A large data set comprising surface-wave phase anomalies, body-wave travel times, normal-mode splitting functions and long-period waveforms is used to evaluate the relationship between large-scale variations in anisotropic shear velocity, density and compressional velocity in the Earth’s mantle. The mantle-wave waveforms provide additional constraints on density and velocity scaling ratios (ν = dlnvS/dlnvP) in the lower mantle and are compatible with the estimates obtained from remaining datasets. We develop a methodology that allows construction of joint models with various levels of scaling complexity. Our preferred model of anisotropic shear and compressional velocity fits P-wave travel times and vP-sensitive modes up to 40 percent better than our recent anisotropic shear-velocity model S362ANI+M, which was constructed with a constant vP-vS relationship throughout the mantle. The RMS shear-velocity variations in the transition zone and lowermost mantle are slightly reduced from S362ANI+M (~0.1%) when vP-sensitive data are included. Several interesting properties of the lowermost mantle reported in earlier tomographic studies persist in our analysis; anti-correlation between bulk-sound and shear velocities, the associated increase in ν, and a lack of correlation between shear velocity and density are robust results that are largely independent of the regularization scheme. When positive correlation between density and shear-velocity variations is imposed in the lowermost mantle, variance reductions of several spheroidal and toroidal modes deteriorate by as much as 40 percent. Recent splitting measurements of 0S2, in particular, are largely incompatible with perfectly correlated shear-velocity and density heterogeneity throughout the mantle. A way to fit concurrently the various data sets in our inversions is by allowing independent density perturbations in the lowermost mantle. Our preferred joint model consists of denser-than-average anomalies (~1% peak-to-peak) at the base of the mantle roughly coincident with low-velocity superplumes. The relative behavior of anisotropic velocities and density disfavor a purely thermal contribution to heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle, which has important implications for the long-term stability and evolution of superplumes.",

Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, to project ecosystem carbon and nitrogen responses under different future climate change scenarios. Downscaled climate change inputs derived from two IPCC scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were interpreted by four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) at Andrews Forest. Model results showed decreases in foliar production under high temperature/CO2 scenarios due to increasing vapor pressure deficit. Projections by PnET-BGC suggest that under future climate changes in primary production coupled with an increasing rate of decomposition may result in decreases in litterfall carbon and nitrogen and soil organic carbon and nitrogen. Such changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen may cause wide range of changes in ecosystem processing of nitrogen and carbon, such as nitrogen mineralization, plant NH4+ uptake, and stream NH4+ and dissolved organic carbon concentrations depending on climate change scenario considered.\nUnder most high emission scenarios, net nitrogen mineralization and plant NH4+ uptake are projected to increase until the end of this century as result of increasing temperature and associated higher rates of decomposition. An accumulation of nitrogen in plant tissue due to decreasing litterfall decreases plant demand for nitrogen. Such changes in nitrogen mineralization and uptake will result in increase in stream NH4+ concentrations under high emission scenarios. Under low emission scenarios, net nitrogen mineralization and plant NH4+ uptake are projected to increase up to mid-century, then slightly decrease until the end of the century.",

Examples of space weather are the conditions that result from geomagnetic storms, solar particle events, and bursts of intense solar flare radiation. These conditions can have impacts on modern-day technologies such as GPS or electric power grids and on human activities such as astronauts living on the International Space Station or explorers traveling to the moon or Mars. While the ultimate space weather goal is accurate prediction of future space weather conditions, for many applications and services, we rely on real-time and near-real time observations and model results for the specification of current conditions. In this presentation, we will describe the space weather system and the need for real-time and near-real time data that drive the system, characterize conditions in the space environment, and are used by models for assimilation and validation. Currently available data will be assessed and a vision for future needs will be given. The challenges for establishing real-time data requirements, as well as acquiring, processing, and disseminating the data will be described, including national and international collaborations.

            "abstract": "Oceanic deposition of Asian-sourced, Iron-rich dust particulate has been linked to enhanced phytoplankton productivity in regions of the Pacific Ocean. High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean regions, such as the North Pacific, are hypothesized to play a significant role in changing atmospheric CO­2 concentrations on glacial-interglacial timescales. Phytoplankton blooms generate methanesulfonate (MSA), an atmospheric oxidation product of dimethylsulfide (DMS) that is readily aerosolized and deposited in nearby glacial ice. In the summer of 2013, an NSF-funded team from Dartmouth College and the Universities of Maine and New Hampshire collected two 1000 year-long parallel ice cores to bedrock from the summit plateau of Mount Hunter in Denali National Park, Alaska (62.940° N, 151.088° W, 3912 m elevation). The Mt. Hunter ice core site is well situated to record changes in trans-Pacific dust flux and MSA emissions in the North Pacific. Here we investigate the history of dust flux to Denali over the last millennium using major and trace element chemistry and microparticle concentration and size distribution data from the Mt. Hunter cores. We evaluate potential controlling mechanisms on Denali dust flux including conditions at Asian dust sources (storminess, wind speed, precipitation), the strength of the Aleutian Low, and large-scale climate modes such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We also evaluate the Mt. Hunter record for relationships between dust flux and MSA concentrations to investigate whether dust fertilization enhanced North Pacific phytoplankton production over the past 1000 years. Future work will create a composite North Pacific dust record using new and existing Mt. Logan ice core records to evaluate these relationships over the entire Holocene.",

Using seismic data we have identified three late Miocene-Pliocene MTDs, the largest of which is between 4500 and 6000 km3, comparable in size to the well-studied Storegga slide of Norway. The tsunamigenic potential of future, analog MTD events are modeled using GeoWave tsunami modeling software. The largest and youngest of these MTDs, the Santa Marta slide, is used as an analog to infer the location and input parameters for the tsunami model. The event is modeled as a translational slide ~46 km long and ~37 km wide with the center of the slide located ~57 km W/NW from the mouth of the present day Magdalena River in water depths of 1500 m. The volume for the initial failure is conservatively estimated at ~680 km3 of material. The resulting tsunami wave from such an event has an initial maximum trough amplitude of -65.8 m and a peak amplitude of 19.2 m. The impact of such a tsunami would include: 1) Kingston, Jamaica (population 938K), tsunami height 7.5 m, peak arrival at 60 min.; 2) Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (population 965K, height 6 m, peak arrival at 80 min.); and 3) Cartagena, Colombia (population 845K, height 21 m, peak arrival at 34 min.).

An Aerodyne Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift particle light extinction monitor (CAPS-PMex) was deployed to measure dry βext at λ=632 nm at 1 Hz. Data from a suite of gas-phase instrumentation were used to interpret the βext under various categories of aged air masses and sources. Extinction enhancement ratios of Δβext/ΔCO were evaluated under 3 differently aged air mass categories (fresh, intermediately aged, and aged) to investigate impacts of photochemistry on βext. Δβext/ΔCO was significantly increased in heavily aged air masses compared to fresh air masses (0.17 Mm-1/ppbv and 0.094 Mm-1/ppbv respectively). The resulting increase in Δβext/ΔCO under heavily aged air masses was represented by secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation. Aerosol composition and sources from urban, natural oil and gas wells (OG), and agriculture and livestock operations were also evaluated for their impacts on βext. Linear regression fits to βext vs. organic aerosol mass showed higher correlation coefficients under the urban and OG plumes (r=0.55 and r=0.71 respectively) and weakest under agricultural and livestock plumes (r=0.28). The correlation between βext and nitrate aerosol mass however was best under the agriculture and livestock plumes (r=0.81), followed by OG plumes (r=0.74), suggesting co-location of aerosol nitrate precursor sources with OG emissions. Finally, non-refractory mass extinction efficiency (MEE) was analyzed. MEE was observed to be 1.37 g/m2 and 1.30 g/m2 in OG and urban+OG plumes, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The Antrim Shale was one of the first economic shale gas plays in the U.S. and has been actively produced since the 1980’s. While previous studies suggest co-produced water in the Antrim is a mixture of brine from deeper formations and freshwater recharge, the extent of water-gas interactions has yet to be determined. The extent and source of thermogenic methane in the Antrim Shale are also under debate. This study uses stable noble gases’ (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) isotopic ratios and their volume fractions from the Antrim Shale gases to assess compositional variability and vertical fluid migration, in addition to distinguishing between the presence of thermogenic versus biogenic methane.\nR/Ra values of Antrim Shale gases (where R and Ra are the measured and atmospheric 3He/4He ratios, respectively) vary from 0.01 to 0.34 suggesting dominant crustal 4He in addition to minor mantle and atmospheric He. Elevated 20Ne/22Ne ratios (up to 10.4) point to mantle Ne. Similarly crustal 21Ne*, 40Ar* and 136Xe* are also suggested. High variability of noble gas signatures in the Antrim Shale are observed, which are mainly due to variable noble gas input from deep brines and, to a smaller extent, variable in-situ production in the Antrim Shale. Estimated 4He ages considering external 4He flux for Antrim water match well with timings of three major glaciation periods (Wisconsin, Illinoian and Kansan glaciations) in the Michigan Basin, suggesting that all our Antrim samples were more or less influenced by glaciation recharge. Consistency in measured and predicted 40Ar/36Ar assuming Ar release temperatures ≥ 250°C supports a thermogenic origin for the majority of the methane in our Antrim Shale gas samples. Thermogenic methane is likely to originate at greater depth, either from deeper portions of the Antrim Shale in the central Michigan Basin or from deeper formations underlying the Antrim Shale, as the thermal maturity of the Antrim Shale in our study area is low.",

            "abstract": "Robust optimization offers optimal solutions that are insensitive to uncertainty. This study proposes a robust multi-objective optimization model for short-term reservoir operation under inflow uncertainty. Variations in prediction of stream inflows are considered as uncertainty and are modelled with a mean inflow surrounded by an uncertainty envelope. The generalized polynomial chaos expansion method is used to connect the inflow uncertainty with the uncertainty of the solutions e.g., objectives. To quantify the uncertainty, the variance of each objective is defined as an additional objective. A recently developed optimization algorithm called BorgMOEA is used as the optimizer to solve this many-objective optimization (more than three objectives) problem. The model finds Pareto-optimal solutions for all objectives, which are used determining robust solutions. The model is applied to a multi-reservoir system for short-term operation under inflow uncertainty. Trade-offs between the mean and variance of the objectives are explicitly explored. Different levels of robust solutions (i.e., robustness) are determined based on the trade-offs and decision making preferences. The proposed robust multi-objective optimization model shows a promising result for robust decision making in reservoir operation under uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical interactions have been investigated extensively to characterize natural nutrient cycling and predict contaminant transport in surface and groundwater. Dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, many of which form biofilms, play an important role in reducing a variety of metals in these systems. It has been shown that biofilm morphology is impacted by flow conditions, but there has been little work that explores how reduction kinetics change as a result of these different morphologies. Different flow rates may affect physical properties of the biofilm that influence the rate of substrate reduction. We introduce an approach to calculate changes in Monod kinetic parameters while simultaneously evaluating biofilm morphologies under different flow rates. A vertical, cylindrical flow cell with removable glass slide sections coated in manganese dioxide (electron acceptor) was used to grow a biofilm of Geobacter sulfurreducens with acetate as the electron donor under both high (50 mL/hr) and low (5 mL/h) flow rates. The removable sections allowed for visualization of the biofilm at different time points with a confocal microscope, and quantification of the biomass on the surface using a combination of a protein assay and image analysis. Data collected from the experiments was used to determine yield and specific growth rate at the different flow rates, and a simple numerical model was used to estimate the half saturation constant of manganese dioxide at both flow rates. A smaller half saturation constant was estimated at the higher flow rate, indicating that the biofilm was more efficient in the high flow system, but a strong correlation between morphology and the faster reduction rate was not observed. Monod kinetic parameters are important for the development of accurate nutrient cycling and contaminant transport models in natural environments, and understanding how they are impacted by flow will be important for the development of new, improved models.",

This instrument has been used over the last ten years to identify and study a wide variety of ionospheric features. The advent of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, inserted into Mars orbit in September 2014, allows us to look at the ionosphere with two spacecraft. In this study, we find density features, primarily depressions with one apparent ionopause, identifiable within a few hours and a few tens of degrees in solar zenith angle in the MARSIS AIS and MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) data, and study them with a variety of instruments from both spacecraft. Most of the features identified occur in the vicinity of weak crustal magnetic fields and are slowly migrating toward higher solar zenith angles. During these events, MARSIS scalar magnetic fields are slightly elevated above the model crustal fields. Two of the three depressions are coincident with abrupt increases in the solar wind density, as measured by the MAVEN Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA), and with abrupt changes in the solar wind magnetic field clock angle, from MAVEN Magnetometer (MAG). We believe that both changes in the solar wind and proximity to crustal field anomalies are related to the existence of these dropouts.",

We focus on the extraction of ocean induced signals from Swarm satellite data and their interpretation by a comparison with synthetic signals. Results of our modeling and data processing efforts will be presented. We use two ocean circulation models: 1) DEBOT, a barotropic model of ocean tide flow and 2) LSOMG, a baroclinic model of global ocean circulation; and two different approaches for modelling the secondary magnetic field: 1) a single-layer approximation model and 2) a three-dimensional time-domain electromagnetic induction model. Swarm data are analyzed along night-time tracks of the satellites. Only a small amount of the data can be used for the analysis of ocean-induced signals because of permanently present strong signals from the magnetosphere and disruptive effects of polar electrojets. Nevertheless, the extracted signals from selected Swarm data tracks show a relatively good coincidence with predicted signals.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of unusually warm tropical East Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) during El Niño is an important predictor of seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity. In recent decades El Niño has been characterized more often by Central Pacific Ocean warming with weaker amplitude, and there is no consensus regarding how this shift in location of ocean warming impacts Atlantic TCs due to a short data record that is complicated by Atlantic SST variability. We attempt to resolve this issue using large ensembles of simulations with a tropical-extratropical channel model in order to isolate the El Niño influence from the confounding effects of Atlantic SST and stochastic atmospheric variability. We find that although Central Pacific El Niño significantly suppresses Atlantic tropical cyclones, it is less effective than East Pacific El Niño at doing so by about 50%, as measured by accumulated cyclone energy. Still, Atlantic TCs are suppressed regardless of maximum Pacific Ocean warming location and amplitude because both El Niño types are characterized by sufficient warming east of the Pacific warm pool, which satisfies the SST threshold for deep convection leading to TC suppression via tropical Atlantic vertical wind shear enhancements. We note the importance of stochastic atmospheric variability in contributing to variability in TC activity, as there is a considerable range between the maximum and minimum ACE in the ensemble of experiments for each El Niño type, despite having fixed SST and lateral boundary conditions. This large stochastic variability may explain some of the inconsistencies in observational analyses, as it is clear that analysis of an insufficient sample size could easily produce a misleading result that Central Pacific El Niño drives an increase or no significant change in Atlantic TC activity.",

            "abstract": "Permanent strain in sediments associated with shallow fault zones can be difficult to characterize. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data were obtained from 120 samples at 6 sites to assess the nature of fault-related AMS fabrics for 4 faults cutting Miocene-Pliocene basin fill sediments of the Rio Grande rift of north-central New Mexico. The San Ysidro (3 sites), Sand Hill, and West Paradise faults within the northern Albuquerque basin have normal offset whereas an unnamed fault near Buckman in the western Española basin has oblique strike-slip offset. Previous studies have shown that detrital magnetite controls magnetic susceptibility in rift sandstones, and in a 50-m-long hanging wall traverse of the San Ysidro fault, non-gouge samples have typical sedimentary AMS fabrics with Kmax and Kint axes (defining magnetic foliation) scattered within bedding. For the 5 normal-fault sites, samples from fault cores or adjacent mixed zones that lie within 1 m of the principal slip surface developed common deformation fabrics with (1) magnetic foliation inclined in the same azimuth but more shallowly dipping than the fault plane, and (2) magnetic lineation plunging down foliation dip with nearly the same trend as the fault striae, although nearer for sand versus clay gouge samples. These relations suggest that the sampled fault materials deformed by particulate flow with alignment of magnetite grains in the plane of maximum shortening. For a 2-m-long traverse at the Buckman site, horizontal sedimentary AMS foliation persists to < 15 cm to the fault slip surface, wherein foliation in sand and clay gouge rotates toward the steeply dipping fault plane in a sense consistent with sinistral offset. Collectively these data suggest permanent deformation fabrics were localized within < 1 m of fault surfaces and that AMS fabrics from gouge samples can provide kinematic information for faults in unconsolidated sediments which may lack associated slickenlines.",

            "abstract": "In most high-resolution studies of the Earth's Deep Interior, the limited amount and uneven distribution of high-quality observations of short-period teleseismic body waves are major obstacles. Dense broadband seismic networks help to overcome major challenges of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target phases and of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of other (often stronger) mantle phases when the slowness difference is large enough. Intuitive delay-and-sum (i.e. slant-stack) approaches are routinely applied to combine data of many spatially close stations to improve data quality. Alternative methods developed in the context of image processing, such as Radon transform-based methods, have proven useful in exploration seismology to facilitate enhancement and separation of signals according to their slowness and time of arrival. In this spirit, we have introduced the slant-stacklet transform to define coherency-guided filters able to exploit signals that would have been otherwise rejected because of low SNR or SIR. As an illustration, this method allows us to dramatically increase the amount of high-quality PcP observations using dense arrays in North America and Japan, sampling Central America, the western Pacific and Alaska/western Canada with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. After mantle corrections, the main signal left in these regions is relatively long wavelength in these regions of fast velocities around the Pacific, except at the western border of the Pacific large-low shear-velocity province (LLSVP) where we observe a rapid reduction of Vp velocity over a distance of about 10˚. This is just one step to further increase lowermost mantle imaging using P waves, much more information from PcP and other complementary signals (e.g. PdP) around the globe are needed to resolve volumetric structure, topography of the core-mantle boundary and D” discontinuity, and the trade-offs between them, in order to improve our understanding of the interaction between the earth's mantle and core.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is arguably the most important parameter controlling ductile deformation in tectonically active regions. Laboratory measurements at lower crust and upper mantle conditions define the mechanisms controlling ductile deformation and constrain quantitative rules relating stress and strain rate. Exhumed ductily deformed rocks reveal the micromechanics of deformation, supplying ground truth that can be compared with lab results. However, even if the mechanism and ductile deformation rules are accepted at face value, strain rates are exquisitely dependent on temperature. Here we critically assess observational data relevant to constraining the southern California lithospheric temperature field. Our goal is to improve estimates of the 3D temperature field and its real uncertainties and apply them to regional deformation modeling.\nWe use a phased approach to estimating geotherms, beginning with simple 1D steady state conductive models. We identify the most important parameters and disaggregate them, separately examining the effects of varying radiogenic heat source concentration, rock type, crust and lithosphere thickness and asthenosphere solidus. We assess geotherm uncertainties by assigning realistic error bounds on all input quantities, propagate these uncertainties by Monte Carlo sampling and determine probability density functions for the geotherm.\nWe find that although other parameter uncertainties contribute, variability in heat sources produces the largest variation in model-predicted geotherms. Because heat production depends strongly on rock type, better characterization of crustal lithology using refined seismic imaging results now becoming available beneath southern California is likely to produce the largest improvements in thermal models. Nonetheless, substantial uncertainty will remain, arguing for adoption of one or a few standard thermal models as common starting points for regional deformation modeling in southern California and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude ecosystems are important sinks, as well as potentially large sources of carbon as the climate continues to change. Belowground biomass of vegetation can act as both a sink and source of carbon; with live root biomass acting as a sink of carbon stores, and dead root biomass acting as a source of carbon to the atmosphere. There is significant literature citing the large ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass in tundra ecosystems, yet understanding of allocation in forested regions of the artic is less understood. Arctic vegetation is investing more resources and energy into belowground biomass relative to aboveground biomass compared to other ecosystems. However, permafrost ecosystems have low decomposition rates as a result of their cold and saturated soils. This allows for the accumulation of a thick organic layer mainly composed of decomposing belowground biomass. Fine roots are of particular importance because their rapid turnover rates makes them important contributions to soil carbon pools.\nTo quantify the ratio of dead to live roots in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems, soils were collected along a latitudinal gradient throughout Interior Alaska, the Arctic North Slope and Coastal Western Alaska. Several sites located in close proximity were chosen to control for geological and climatic differences among sites, allowing differences to be attributed to the proximal ecosystem. Soil samples were washed, sieved and the roots were sorted into the four categories, including fine-live, fine-dead, coarse-live, and coarse-dead. Classification of these roots followed well established protocols based on visual and physical cues with coarse roots being greater than 2mm. Dead to live ratios of root biomass varied from 4.91 to 45.98, averaging at 14.29 +/- 11.39. Belowground allocation of plant biomass and associated resources may not be significantly larger than aboveground allocation because the majority of the belowground biomass is dead and non-functioning. As global temperatures continue to increase so will decomposition rates, allowing the carbon stored in these dead roots to be released into the environment creating a potentially large carbon source.",

            "abstract": "Traditional seismic monitoring systems rely on discrete detections produced by station processing software, discarding significant information present in the original recorded signal. SIG-VISA (Signal-based Vertically Integrated Seismic Analysis) is a system for global seismic monitoring through Bayesian inference on seismic signals. By modeling signals directly, our forward model is able to incorporate a rich representation of the physics underlying the signal generation process, including source mechanisms, wave propagation, and station response. This allows inference in the model to recover the qualitative behavior of recent geophysical methods including waveform matching and double-differencing, all as part of a unified Bayesian monitoring system that simultaneously detects and locates events from a global network of stations.\nWe demonstrate recent progress in scaling up SIG-VISA to efficiently process the data stream of global signals recorded by the International Monitoring System (IMS), including comparisons against existing processing methods that show increased sensitivity from our signal-based model and in particular the ability to locate events (including aftershock sequences that can tax analyst processing) precisely from waveform correlation effects. We also provide a Bayesian analysis of an alleged low-magnitude event near the DPRK test site in May 2010 [1] [2], investigating whether such an event could plausibly be detected through automated processing in a signal-based monitoring system.\n[1] Zhang, Miao and Wen, Lianxing. \"Seismological Evidence for a Low‐Yield Nuclear Test on 12 May 2010 in North Korea\".

            "abstract": "Volcanic plumes are complex mixtures of mineral, lithic and glass fragments of varying size, together with multiple gas species. These plumes vary in size dependent on a number of factors, including vent diameter, magma composition and the quantity of volatiles within a melt. However, determining the chemical and mineralogical properties of a volcanic plume immediately after an eruption is a great challenge. Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite remote sensing of these plumes is routinely used to calculate the volcanic ash particle size variations and sulfur dioxide concentration. These analyses are commonly performed using high temporal, low spatial resolution satellites, which can only reveal large scale trends. What is lacking is a high spatial resolution study specifically of the properties of the proximal plumes. Using the emissive properties of volcanic ash, a new method has been developed to determine the plume’s particle size and petrology in spaceborne and ground-based TIR data. A multispectral adaptation of a FLIR TIR camera has been developed that simulates the TIR channels found on several current orbital instruments. Using this instrument, data of volcanic plumes from Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes in Guatemala were recently obtained Preliminary results indicate that the camera is capable of detecting silicate absorption features in the emissivity spectra over the TIR wavelength range, which can be linked to both mineral chemistry and particle size. It is hoped that this technique can be expanded to isolate different volcanic species within a plume, validate the orbital data, and ultimately to use the results to better inform eruption dynamics modelling.",

            "abstract": "Mineral precipitation significantly alters the transport properties of fractured rock. In an idealized parallel-plate fracture with uniform surface reactivity, the injection of a supersaturated fluid leads to faster precipitation near the inlet and rapid sealing of the fracture. However, it is likely that physical and chemical heterogeneities will perturb local reaction rates. Predicting the evolution of transport properties in heterogeneous fractures requires an improved understanding of the feedback between mineral precipitation and fluid flow. We present results from three experiments in transparent analog fractures: i) uniform aperture with uniform surface reactivity, ii) uniform aperture with heterogeneous surface reactivity, and iii) variable aperture with heterogeneous reactivity. We controlled surface reactivity by exposing one fracture surface to a solution supersaturated with calcium carbonate for different durations. We then injected a metastable mixture with log-saturation-index of 1.44 at a constant rate of 0.5 ml/min. Transmitted light techniques provided quantitative measurements of fracture aperture and fluid transport over the flow field. In the homogeneous fracture (i), as expected, aperture decreased most rapidly along the inlet. In the variable aperture fracture (iii), we observed enhanced reduction rates in small aperture regions; these local reactions organized flow into thin pathways that connected regions of low surface reactivity and grew to span the length of the fracture over the six-month duration of the experiment. An ongoing experiment (ii) will clarify the relative importance of chemical heterogeneity versus aperture variability on the formation of these preferential pathways.",

            "abstract": "An underground cavity (or low velocity anomaly) may interact with a seismic wavefield in several ways: scattering or reflecting seismic body waves, changing the dispersion of surface waves, inducing resonances within the cavity, or by generating waves traveling around the cavity interface. In theory, these features may be observed using either active or passive seismic surveys. We explore the possibility of detecting the sites of underground nuclear explosions using passive seismic data first by generating a set of synthetic models and second by a field experiment. We generated 3D synthetics on an idealized representation of the cavity and chimney and estimated constraints on detection. Eight broadband seismometers were deployed around the site of a known underground nuclear explosion (UNE) at the U.S. Nevada National Security Site. Examination of the observed data does not show clear indications of resonance within the cavity and chimney caused by seismic waves from teleseismic, regional, or local earthquakes. Green’s functions of raypaths between station pairs have been generated using seismic interferometry based on ambient seismic noise and these will be used to generate a tomographic model.

            "abstract": "Given two or more parameterizations that represent the same physical process in a climate model, scientists are sometimes faced with difficult decisions about which scheme to choose for their simulations and analysis. These decisions are often based on subjective criteria, such as “which scheme is easier to use, is computationally less expensive, or produces results that look better?” Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and model selection methods can be used to objectively rank the performance of different physical parameterizations by increasing the preference for schemes that fit observational data better, while at the same time penalizing schemes that are overly complex or have excessive degrees-of-freedom. Following these principles, we are developing a perturbed-parameter UQ framework to assist in the selection of parameterizations for a climate model. Preliminary results will be presented on the application of the framework to assess the performance of two alternate schemes for simulating tropical deep convection (CLUBB-SILHS and ZM-trigmem) in the U.S. Dept. of Energy's ACME climate model.

            "abstract": "Abstract: Landslide dams typically comprise unconsolidated and poorly sorted material, and are vulnerable to rapid failure and breaching, particularly in mountainous areas during high intense rainfalls. A large flash flood with high-concentrated sediment can be formed in a short period, and the magnitude is likely to be amplified along the flow direction due to the inclusion of a large amount of sediment. This can result in significant and sudden flood risk downstream for human life and property. Numerous field evidence has indicated the various risks of landslide dam failures. In general, cascading landslide dams can be formed along the sloping channel due to the randomness and unpredictability of landslides, which complexes the hydraulics of landslide dam failures. The failure process of a single dam and subsequent floods has attracted attention in multidisciplinary studies. However, the dynamic failure process of cascading landslide dams has been poorly understood. From a viewpoint of simulation, this study evaluates the formation and development of rapid sediment-charged floods due to cascading failure of landslide dams through detailed hydro-morphodynamic modelling. The model used is based on shallow water theory and it has been successful in predicting the flow and morphological process during sudden dam-break, as well as full and partial dyke-breach. Various experimental-scale scenarios are modelled, including: (1) failure of a single full dam in a sloping channel, (2) failure of two dams in a sloping channel, (3) failure of multiple landslide dams (four) in a sloping channel. For each scenario, different failure modes (sudden/gradual) and bed boundary (fixed /mobile) are assumed and simulated. The study systematically explores the tempo-spatial evolution of landslide-induced floods (discharge, flow velocity, and flow concentration) and geomorphic properties along the sloping channel. The effects of in-channel erosion and flow-driven sediment from dams on the development of flood process are investigated. The results improve the understanding of the formation and development mechanism of flash floods due to cascading landslide dam failures. The findings are beneficial for downstream flood risk assessment and developing control strategies for landslide-induced floods.",

To identify the signal of negative thermal anomaly, fifteen infrared images of core sediments with tens of meter in length have been analyzed the temperature distribution off southwestern Taiwan. This study results show that most of the core sediments were found lots of gaps with spiking pattern recognition of high temperature on the lower portions. The geochemistry study suggested that the gas in gaps and the sediments were mainly composed of methane which may be the indicators of gas hydrate dissociation in the higher temperature and lower pressure environment. The thermal gradients 0.044-0.114 ℃/m of core sediments are close to the observations in situ by the measurements of temperature probes that thermal gradient are 0.06-0.09 ℃/m. The temperature of all core sediments are greater than 20 ℃. It is obvious that the temperature of core sediments were increased tremendously by the heating of sea water. We found eight out of fifteen core sediments with significant negative thermal anomaly 0.4-1.0 ℃ in different depth between 2 and 10 meters below sea floor. Compare to the experiment in lab that the temperature could be decreased 1.1-1.5 ℃ due to the gas hydrate dissociation, the quantity of the negative thermal anomaly of the core sediments are possible related to the gas hydrate dissociation.",

Different models have been effectively used to examine relationships between rainfall and runoff. Cedar Creek Watershed Basin, the largest tributary of St. Josephs River, located in northeastern Indiana, was selected as a study area. The HEC-HMS model developed by US Army Corps of Engineers was used for the hydrological modelling. The national elevation and national hydrography data was obtained from United States Geological Survey National Map Viewer and the SSURGO soil data was obtained from United States Department of Agriculture. The watershed received hypothetical uniform rainfall for a duration of 13 hours. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number and Unit Hydrograph methods were used for simulating surface runoff. The simulation provided hydrological details about the quantity and variability of runoff in the watershed. The runoff for different curve numbers was computed for the same basin and rainfall, and it was found that outflow peaked at an earlier time with a higher value for higher curve numbers than for smaller curve numbers. It was also noticed that the impact on outflow values nearly doubled with an increase of curve number of 10 for each subbasin in the watershed. The results from the current analysis may aid water managers in effectively managing the water resources within the basin.\n1 Graduate Student, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois, 62901-6603\n2 Development Review Division, Clark County Public Works, 500 S.

            "abstract": "Within the Arctic, climate forcers like atmospheric aerosols are important contributors to the observed warming and environmental changes in the region. Quantifying the forcing by aerosols in the Arctic is especially difficult, given short aerosol lifetimes, annual variability in illumination and surface albedo, stratified atmospheric conditions, complex feedbacks, and long-range aerosol transport. However, in-situ surface measurements of Arctic aerosol optical properties can be used to constrain variability of light scattering and absorption, identify potential particle sources, and help evaluate the resulting forcing. Data from six WMO Global Atmosphere Watch stations are presented: Alert, Canada (ALT); Barrow, Alaska (BRW); Pallas, Finland (PAL); Summit, Greenland (SUM); Tiksi, Russia (TIK); and Zeppelin Mountain, Norway (ZEP). These sites contribute to the International Arctic System for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA), which facilitates Arctic-wide data collection and analysis. Climatologies of aerosol optical properties from each station show differences in magnitude and variability of observed parameters. For example, Figure 1 presents the annual cycle of aerosol light scattering at 550 nm at each site for 2012-2014, with most stations (ALT, BRW, TIK, ZEP) experiencing maximum scattering in winter/spring, while SUM and PAL exhibit minimum scattering in the winter. The observed range in scattering across these sites is large (almost an order of magnitude) - SUM has the lowest annual median scattering at 0.82 Mm-1 while BRW has the highest at 6.9 Mm-1. A closer look at systematic variability between optical properties at each station, as well as site back trajectories, suggest differences in aerosol processes, sources and transport. The development of consistent climatologies and additional analyses like the ones presented here can help provide a better understanding of trans-Arctic aerosol variability, which can be an asset for improving aerosol models in this remote region.",

            "abstract": "Until now, processing satellite radar altimetry data over inland water bodies on a large scale has been a cumbersome task primarily due to contaminated measurements from their surrounding topography. It becomes more challenging if the size of the water body is small and thus the number of available high-rate measurements from the water surface is limited. A manual removal of outliers is time consuming which limits a global generation of reservoir elevation profiles. This has limited a global study of lakes and reservoir elevation profiles for monitoring storage changes and hydrologic modeling.\nWe have proposed a new method to automatically generate a time-series information from raw satellite radar altimetry without user intervention. With this method, scientist with little knowledge of altimetry can now independently process radar altimetry for diverse purposes. The method is based on K-means clustering, backscatter coefficient and statistical analysis of the dataset for outlier detection. The result of this method will be validated using in-situ gauges from US, Indus and Bangladesh reservoirs. In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be done to ascertain the limitations of this algorithm based on the surrounding topography, and the length of altimetry track overlap with the lake/reservoir. ­­\nFinally, a reservoir storage change will be estimated on the study sites using MODIS and Landsat water classification for estimating the area of reservoir and the height will be estimated using Jason-2 and SARAL/Altika satellites.",

Here, we examine the biomass burning contribution to aerosols trapped in the cryosphere through investigating the specific molecular marker levoglucosan (1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose) in ice cores. Levoglucosan is only produced by cellulose combustion, and therefore is an ideal comparison for multi-proxy investigations incorporating other markers with multiple sources.\nWildfire combustion products are a major component of dark aerosols deposited on the Greenland ice sheet during the 2012 melt event. Levoglucosan concentrations that demonstrate the biomass burning contribution are similar to black carbon concentrations that record both fossil fuel and biomass burning during this same event. This similarity is especially important as levoglucosan and black carbon trends differ during the industrial era in the NEEM, Greenland ice core, demonstrating different contributions of fossil fuel and biomass burning to the Greenland ice sheet. These differences are also present in the EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice core. Low-latitude ice cores such as Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and Muztag, Tibet demonstrate that climate is still the primary control over fire activity in these regions, even with increased modern biomass burning and the possible impacts of atmospheric brown clouds.",

            "abstract": "We present an overview of ice velocity measurements produced from data acquired during the first Sentinel-1 full Antarctic ice sheet campaign. Satellite observations acquired over the past 25 years have shown marked ice velocity speed up on individual Antarctic ice streams, with ice velocity increases of over 42% observed on Pine Island Glacier. In Antarctica, areas of ice velocity speed up are dynamically unstable and comprise the largest component of ice sheet sea level rise contribution. However, despite a clear long term trend for increasing ice velocity in many regions, speed up has not been constant through time and multiple years with no significant change have also been observed. It is necessary to make present day measurements of ice velocity to provide an independent means of measuring ice mass loss from the most rapidly changing ice sheet regions. However the spatiotemporal coverage of historical ice velocity measurements has been limited by a paucity of suitable data over the full Antarctic ice sheet and to date, parts of east Antarctica have been observed only a few times during the last 25 years. We present 12 months of ice velocity measurements on 10 key Antarctic ice streams, produced from the normalised cross-correlation of real-valued intensity features in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode Sentinel-1a data. A time series of ice velocity measurements produced from short 12-day repeat Sentinel-1a data over Pine Island Glacier shows that in 2014 and 2015 the ice surface speed has remained constant at ~4 km/year. A Sentinel-1a ice velocity map of the Antarctic Peninsula demonstrates that good quality measurements can be obtained along the full length of the Peninsula using Sentinel-1a. TOPS mode SAR Interferometry (InSAR) results shows that interferometric coherence can be preserved over the 12-day repeat period on stable slower flowing ice covered terrain, however on fast flowing ice streams such as Totten Glacier in East Antarctica and Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica InSAR is less successful. We conclude that the short 12-day repeat period and large scale coverage of Sentinel-1a is an invaluable new resource, which in the future will be a critical tool for monitoring ice velocity change and dynamic instability of the Antarctic ice sheet.",

Data acquired by the ACE LEMS sensors during 1999 were used to identify EP boundaries that were not located at interplanetary shocks or caused by intermittent connection to Earth’s bow shock. It was found that at least 68%, and probably 80%, of such boundaries occur at significant changes in the plasma and magnetic field in the solar wind. Those changes are consistent with crossing pre-existing tangential discontinuities or flux-tube boundaries rather than being caused by local MHD turbulence or time-dependent bursts of acceleration.",

            "abstract": "As water resources become limited in Arizona due to drought and excessive use of ground water, treated wastewater effluent is becoming essential in creating natural ecosystems and recharging the decreasing groundwater supplies. Therefore, future water supplies are heavily dependent of the flow (quantity) and quality of the treated effluent. The Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant (NIWTP) releases treated wastewater from both Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico into the Santa Cruz River. This released effluent not only has the potential to impact surface water, but also groundwater supplies in Southern Arizona. In the recent past, the NIWTP has had reoccurring issues with elevated levels of cadmium, in addition to other, more infrequent, releases of high amounts of other metals. The industrial demographic of the region, as well as limited water quality regulations in Mexico makes the NIWTP and its treated effluent an important area of study. In addition, outdated infrastructure can potentially lead to damaging environmental impacts, as well as human health concerns.\nThe Santa Cruz River has been monitored and studied in the past, but in recent years, there has been a halt in research regarding the state of the river. Data from existing water quality databases and recent sampling reports are used to address research questions regarding the state of the Santa Cruz River. These questions include:\n1) How will change in flow eventually impact surface water and future groundwater supplies\n2) What factors influence this flow (such as extreme flooding and drought)\n3) What is the impact of effluent on surface water quality\n4) Can changes in surface water quality impact groundwater quality\n5) How do soil characteristics and surface flow impact the transport of released contaminants\nAlthough outreach to stakeholders across the border and updated infrastructure has improved the quality of water in the river, there are many areas to improve upon as the demand for treated wastewater increases.",

            "abstract": "The entire Piedmont of the Southeastern United States, where the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory (CCZO) is located, experienced one of the most severe erosive events in the United States during last two centuries. Forested areas were cleared to cultivate cotton, tobacco and other crops during the nineteenth and early twentieth century and these land use change, together with intense rainfalls, initiated deep gullying. An accurate mapping of these landforms is important since, despite some gully stabilization and reforestation efforts, gullies are still major contributors of sediment to streams. Mapping gullies in the CCZO area is hindered by the presence of dense canopy which precludes the identification through aerial photogrammetry and other traditional remote sensing methods. Moreover, the wide spatial extent of the gullies makes detailed field surveys, for the identification and characterization of entire gullies, a very large and expensive proposition.\nThis work aims to develop and assess an automated set of algorithms to detect and map gullies using morphological characteristics retrieved by very high resolution imagery (VHRI). A one-meter resolution LiDAR DEM is used to derive different morphometric indices whose combination, carried out using spatial analysis methods and fuzzy logic rules, are a tool to identify gullies. This spatial model has been calibrated using the reference perimeters of two gullies that we measured during a recent field survey. The entire procedure attempts to provide estimates of gully erosion patterns, which characterize the entire Calhoun CZO area and to develop and evaluate a method to measure characteristic features of gullies (i.e. depth and volume).",

However, due to uncertainties in the strength of climate system feedbacks, the full impact of the rapid carbon release on the Earth system is difficult to predict with confidence. Geologic analogues from past transient climate changes could provide invaluable constraints but only if the associated carbon release rates can be reliably reconstructed. We present a new technique - based on combined data-model analysis - to extract rates of change from the geological record, without the need for a stratigraphic age model. Given currently available records, we then show that the present anthropogenic carbon release rate is unprecedented during the Cenozoic (past 66 million years) by at least an order of magnitude. Our results have important implications for our ability to use past analogues to predict future changes, including constraints on climate sensitivity, ocean acidification, and impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, the fact that we have effectively entered an era of 'no analogue' state presents fundamental challenges to constraining forward modeling. Furthermore, future ecosystem disruptions will likely exceed the relatively limited extinctions observed during climate aberrations throughout the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "The role of hydrogeology in mediating long-term changes in mountain stream runoff, resulting from reduced snowfall in a potentially warmer climate, is not currently well understood. We explore this role by comparing simulated changes in stream runoff from a small (1-km2), mid-elevation catchment, located in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (Providence Creek), for different plausible combinations of reduced snowfall and subsurface hydrologic properties. Simulations are performed using a numerical watershed model, the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), forced by data from a nearby meteorological station and calibrated to a stream gauge and eddy covariance tower. For a reduction in snowfall ranging from 47% to 89%, plausible for 2 – 6°C of warming, simulated changes in annual runoff depend as strongly on subsurface hydrologic properties as they do on air temperature increases alone, as indicated by coefficients of variation with respect to hydrologic properties ranging from 1 to 3 in magnitude. Substrates with greater storage capacity can support elevated summertime evapotranspiration by storing rain and snowmelt delivered earlier during winter and early spring, incurring greater losses from runoff. These findings indicate that the hydrologic response of mountain catchments to potential reductions in snowfall may exhibit substantial spatial variability associated with elevational differences in soil thickness and bedrock weathering, a relationship not typically accounted for in approaches relying on space-for-time substitution. An additional implication is that model simulations of annual runoff for scenarios involving snowfall-to-rainfall transitions may exhibit large uncertainty where subsurface hydrologic properties are not well constrained.",

In this project, a newly developed remote sensing long-wave thermal infrared imaging hyperspectral sensor, was tested. The system employs a Sagnac interferometer and an uncooled microbolometer in rapid scanning configuration. This instrument is able to collect hyperspectral images of the scene between 8 and 14 and for each pixel a spectrum containing 50 samples can be retrieved. Images are spectrally and radiometrically calibrated using an IR source with a narrow band filter and two black bodies. The sensitivity of the system was studied by using a gas cell containing various known concentrations of SO2, which are representative of those found in volcanic plumes. Measured spectra were compared with theoretical spectra obtained from MODTRAN5 with the same viewing geometry and spectral resolution as the sensor. The MODTRAN5 calculations were carried out using a radiative transfer algorithm which accounts for the transmission and emission both inside and outside of the gas cell. These preliminary results and field measurements at Kīlauea volcano, Hawai’i will be discussed demonstrating the performance of the system and the ability of retrieving SO2 plume concentrations.",

The \"Age\" of Coulomb collisions is a measure of the extent of collisional thermalization, and has been used to study non-thermal features of the solar wind (Maruca et al 2013). However, such observational estimates of the Collisional Age have been forced to employ simplified formulae, given the limitations of spacecraft observations. In this work, we use a global 3-D MHD simulation of the solar wind that includes turbulence modeling to evaluate the Turbulence and Collsional Ages through the inner heliosphere. Our 3-D data-set enables us to use the complete analytical expressions for the ages without using approximations. We also evaluate the Ages using the approximate formulae employed in previous work, and compare these approximate results with our exact calculations to examine the validity of the simplified formulae, which necessarily must be used when working with spacecraft data, including that from Solar Probe Plus.",

            "abstract": "Marine organisms are the most abundant fossils scientists have discovered in the fossil record. Various factors affect the survival rate of individual organisms and entire genera including metabolic rate, genetic diversity, environmental availability, and ecology. We however chose to focus our attention on studying mean metabolic rates in correlation to life modes. A marine organism’s life mode is determined by three criteria: tiering, motility, and feeding mechanism. We believe an organism's life mode has an effect on its survivorship, especially since ecospace is the \"primary determinant of routine metabolic rate for marine organisms” (Seibel & Drazen 2007). Using the metabolic equation, we were able to plot metabolic rate changes for various life modes over time. Seibel and Drazen (2007) explain that \"metabolic variation in the ocean results from interspecific differences in ecological energy demand,\" thus allowing us to hypothesize that with different combinations of life modes, different marine organisms will have varying metabolic rates. To further compare our data, we created a heatmap to show the change in metabolic rates over the last 540 million years. Based on the collection of data, metabolic rates of marine organisms have shown an increasing trend. When analyzing ecospaces, pelagic (living in the water column), free moving organisms have relatively high metabolic rates in comparison to other modes of tiering. In other life modes, there’s a general trend of genera maintaining a stabilized and moderate metabolic rate that is neither extremely high nor low.",

            "abstract": "The Lesser Antilles subduction zone forms the eastern boundary of the Caribbean plate. The seismic potential of the megathrust remains poorly known, despite the hazard it poses to numerous island populations and its proximity to the Americas. As it has not produced any large earthquakes in modern times, the megathrust has often been assumed to be aseismic. However, historical records of great earthquakes in the 19th century and earlier, which were almost certainly megathrust ruptures, demonstrate that the subduction is not entirely aseismic. Recent occurrences of giant earthquakes in areas where such events were previously thought to be impossible have inspired the geoscience community to re-evaluate the seismic potential of other “low-hazard” subduction zones, such as the Lesser Antilles. Using the method of coral microatoll paleogeodesy developed in Sumatra, we examine 20th-century vertical deformation on the forearc islands of the Lesser Antilles and model the underlying strain accumulation on the megathrust. Our data indicate that the eastern coasts of the forearc islands have been subsiding relative to the arc islands, suggesting that on the time scale of the 20th century, a portion of the megathrust just east of the forearc islands has been locked. Our findings are in contrast to recent GPS-based models that suggest little or no strain accumulation anywhere along the Lesser Antilles megathrust. This discrepancy is potentially explained by the different time scales of measurement, as recent studies elsewhere have indicated that interseismic coupling patterns may vary on decadal time scales and that century-scale or longer records are required to accurately assess seismic potential. The accumulated strain we have detected will likely be released in future earthquakes, uplifting the previously subsiding areas as well as contributing to seismic and potentially to tsunami hazard in the region.",

            "abstract": "The lava effusion rate, the volumetric flux of lava from the vent, is of great importance in lava flow forecasting and in constraining magma supply conditions. It has been established in the literature that the effusion rates for basaltic lava flows exhibit a typical variation with time, hereafter referred as the “Wadge curve”, with effusion rates rising rapidly to a peak during the very early part of an eruption, before waning over a longer period of time until the eruption ends. We have used thermal infrared remote sensing data acquired by NASA’s MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate effusion rates for 107 eruptions from 35 volcanoes over the last 15 years. Two contrasting methods, those of Harris et al. (1997) and Coppola et al. (2013), were compared. Using the Wadge curves computed from the satellite data for each eruption, we predict (based on the peak effusion rate and a decay constant that describes the exponential waning phase) the time at which effusion rate equals zero, and hence the eruption ends. In order to produce a predictive tool, we derived decay constants for a subset of our eruptions (as training data), and then used these decay constants to predict the end of the remaining eruptions in our dataset. We have determined the decay constant that best describes all the eruptions and then used this global value to retro-cast the end of each eruption in our database to establish how well eruption cessation can be predicted using a globally applicable decay constant. Our approach is of great interest for monitoring of effusive activity and hazard mitigation, via the possibility that by the time an eruption reached its peak effusion rate, as observed from space, we would be able to predict when that eruption would stop.",

Understanding past natural variability of such features as the Intertropical Convergence Zone and El Niño Southern Oscillation provides information about the extent of anthropogenic climate change today. The hydrogen isotopic composition (D/H ratio) of algal lipids has been shown to track the isotopic composition of source water in which the organism grew, providing information about precipitation variability over time. However, culture work has revealed that environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, growth rate, and irradiance also influence algal lipid D/H ratios. Here I present work determining the effect of growth rate and irradiance on the hydrogen isotope composition of alkenone-producing algae in the water column in two North Pacific locations, off the coast of Oregon and near the Hawaii Ocean Time Series site.

HEC-RAS 5.0 integrated with ArcGIS, will be used to yield unsteady 2D hydrodynamic model of Ohio River at Olmsted area. Velocity, suspended sediment, bed sediment and hydrographic survey data acquired from public archives of USGS and USACE Louisville District will be input into the model. Calibration and validation of model will be performed against the measured stage, flow and velocity data. It will be subjected to completely unsteady 1D sediment transport modeling new to HEC-RAS 5.0 which incorporates sediment load and bed gradation via a DSS file, commercial dredging and BSTEM model. Sediment model will be calibrated to replicate the historical bed volume changes. Excavated cross-sections at Olmsted area will also be used to predict the sediment volume trapped inside the ditch over the period between excavations and placement of dam shells at site. Model will attempt to replicate historical dredging volume data and compare with the deposition volume from simulation model to formulate the dredging prediction model.

            "abstract": "This study is designed to investigate how the ambient ground temperature fluctuates with diurnal and seasonal changes under various hydrogeological system variations as part of the Intensively Managed Landscapes-Critical Zone Observatory. A fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) system is used to measure thermal profiles in two adjacent boreholes situated in a complex glaciated landscape. The test site is located in east-central Illinois on a terminal moraine of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The moraine crosses a buried preglacial bedrock valley that is 50 m deep. The valley fill contains alternating deposits of clayey glacial till and gravelly sand that have varying physical and hydrological properties. In the 100-m-deep borehole, a fiber-optic cable was installed without casing, sealed against the sidewall with grout. This borehole was drilled to the top of bedrock and penetrated a sequence of glacial sediments containing at least two aquifer units. Thick, Early Pleistocene glacial sand and gravel that penetrated near the bedrock forms an aquifer that is part of a regional groundwater system, the Mahomet Aquifer System. The aquifer system is primarily recharged by slow infiltration of surface waters and has been designated by the USEPA as a \"Sole Source\" of drinking water. At the same location, a second 40-m-deep borehole was drilled through Middle–Late Pleistocene till and fluvioglacial sediment, and a groundwater monitoring well was installed. Fiber-optic cable was attached along the outside of the casing, and the well was screened in a shallower, localized aquifer.\nAt a broad scale, thermal variations in the subsurface appear to be correlated with sediment type. The basal sand and gravel aquifer exhibits a unique thermal profile deviating from patterns at shallower depths. Temperature measurements with 1-m and 0.1°C resolutions have being collected at various temporal scales, ranging from 30-minute to 2-week intervals, since June 2015. The initial data show that the temperature variations in amplitudes and trends are correlated with previous characterizations of the geology and hydrogeological properties. Through continuous collection of data, we hope to understand how subsurface heat transport is correlated with climate change and agricultural practices on a larger temporal scale.",

We developed new functions for estimating NPP allocation dynamics, canopy cover and needlefall dynamics, effects of frost on production, density-independent and density-dependent tree mortality, biomass pools at variable starting ages, and the fertility rating. New functions to estimate merchantable volume partitioning were also included, allowing for economic analyses. The fertility rating was determined as a function of site index (mean height of dominant trees at age=25 years). We used the largest and most geographically extensive validation dataset for this species ever used (91 pots in 12 states in U.S. and 10 plots in Uruguay). Comparison of modeled to measured data showed robust agreement across the natural range in the U.S., as well as in Uruguay, where the species is grown as an exotic. Using the new set of functions and parameters with downscaled projections from twenty different climate models, the model was applied to assess the impact of future climate change scenarios on stand productivity in the southeastern U.S.",

Further, these cooling events do not normally occur during major storms; no such phenomenon was observed by DMSP during the March 2015 superstorm. Flow data from DMSP and the CINDI instruments on the C/NOFS spacecraft indicate these cooling events are associated with short-lived vertical flows bringing up cooler plasma from lower altitudes.

            "abstract": "The March 22, 2014, catastrophic landslide near Oso, Washington, rapidly emplaced approximately 8 million m3 of slide material onto the valley floor, blocking the North Fork Stillaguamish River. Overtopping of the landslide dam and subsequent channel incision through the deposit mobilized large volumes of the glacial outwash, till, and lacustrine (silts and clays) sediment. The abundant sediment introduced to the gravel-bed channel prompted concerns of downstream aggradation and elevated hazards from seasonal flooding and channel migration. Our assessment of downstream aggradation potential and channel change was primarily based on 1) comparison of pre-slide to post-slide field-based and remote-sensing observations, 2) measurements of bedload transport, and 3) modeling of bedload transport for eight flow scenarios between 25% of the 2-year flow and the 100-year flow at several sites along the lower 65-km alluvial portion of the river. Although measurements of pre-slide grain-size distributions were highly variable from year to year, comparison of those counts to 2014 post-slide measurements show a general fining of channel and bar surface material. Between 2014 and 2015, we observed coarsening at some bars, most notably for sediment smaller than 4 mm. From aerial photograph inspection, the shape, size, and distribution of gravel and sand bars between the landslide and the mouth of the North Fork Stillaguamish River appears to have been relatively unchanged between 2013 and 2015. Post-slide bedload transport capacity rates were calculated using Parker, Wilcock and Crowe, and two forms of Recking equations. Transport capacities for the narrow and confined channel where it has incised through the landslide are much greater compared with the low gradient and wide floodplain segments downstream. Nevertheless, because of fine grain sizes within the landslide debris, most of the sediment has been transported through the downstream channel, resulting in minimal aggradation.",

            "abstract": "The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded geophysical site characterizations at 191 seismographic stations in California and in the central and eastern United States. Shallow boreholes were considered cost- and environmentally-prohibitive, thus non-invasive methods (passive and active surface- and body-wave techniques) were used at these stations. The drawback, however, is that these techniques measure seismic properties indirectly and introduce more uncertainty than borehole methods. The principal methods applied were Array Microtremor (AM), Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW; Rayleigh and Love waves), Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW), Refraction Microtremor (ReMi), and P- and S-wave refraction tomography. Depending on the apparent geologic or seismic complexity of the site, field crews applied one or a combination of these methods to estimate the shear-wave velocity (VS) profile and calculate VS30, the time-averaged VS to a depth of 30 meters. We study the inter- and intra-method variability of VS and VS30 at each seismographic station where combinations of techniques were applied. For each site, we find both types of variability in VS30 remain insignificant (5–10% difference) despite substantial variability observed in the VS profiles. We also find that reliable VS profiles are best developed using a combination of techniques, e.g., surface-wave VS profiles correlated against P-wave tomography to constrain variables (Poisson’s ratio and density) that are key depth-dependent parameters used in modeling VS profiles. The most reliable results are based on surface- or body-wave profiles correlated against independent observations such as material properties inferred from outcropping geology nearby. For example, mapped geology describes station CI.LJR as a hard rock site (VS30 > 760 m/s). However, decomposed rock outcrops were found nearby and support the estimated VS30 of 303 m/s derived from the MASW (Love wave) profile.",

            "abstract": "It has been nearly ten years since the First State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR-1) was published in 2007. Much has changed in the intervening years, but much has remained the same. In anticipation of a Second State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR-2), we, the members of the SOCCR-1 Coordinating Team, felt that a perspective from the first SOCCR and reflection on changes in the state of carbon cycle science and policy in the intervening years would be appropriate. The purpose of SOCCR-1 was to provide “…a synthesis and integration of the current knowledge of the North American carbon budget and its context within the global carbon cycle [i]n a format useful to decision makers.” Being “useful to decision makers” was a guiding theme with three stakeholder workshops an integral part of the process. Drafting and revision of SOCCR-1 took place between 2005 and early 2007; the report’s carbon budget was for circa 2003. In 2003, North America’s fossil-fuel CO2 emissions were approximately 27% of global emissions. Nearly 85% of North American emissions were from the US, still at that time the world’s largest emitter of fossil-fuel CO2. China’s annual CO2 emissions exceeded those of the US for the first time while SOCCR-1 was being written. Today global CO2 emissions are dominated by emissions from China (28% in 2013), with US emissions only 14% of global emissions. Emissions from the US and North America have actually declined by approximately 10% since 2003 while emissions from China have doubled. Based on inventories of terrestrial carbon stocks, SOCCR-1 estimated that circa 2003 North American vegetation removed and stored a net 500 Mt C y-1 (±50%) from the atmosphere. A more recent synthesis incorporating additional estimates from atmospheric inversions and terrestrial biosphere modeling estimated the North American land sink for the decade of 2000-2009 at 350-470 Mt C y-1, with a slightly greater uncertainty due to the wider range of estimates from the different methods. Equally important are changes in the landscape of carbon cycle management and policy since SOCCR-1. These changes, including US Supreme Court decisions on the regulation of greenhouse gases, the 2014 US-China agreement on limiting emissions, and California’s cap-and-trade program, provide the context for a SOCCR-2 that is “…useful to decision makers.”",

            "abstract": "Current state-of-practice of geotechnical site response and soil-structure analyses generally assume a vertically propagating horizontally polarized plane wave is incident on a plane-layered (one-dimensional) soil column. Ground motions representing the wavefield incident to the bedrock base of the soil column are developed from observed and sometimes scaled time-histories or synthesized by various methods. The site-specific ground motion at the surface is then computed from the response of the soil column to the bedrock incident wavefield, possibly including non-linear response of the geotechnical near-surface. This is the so-called SH1D assumption. While this approach is widely used, it ignores important complexities of the incident wavefield. Specifically, the standard approach assumes: 1) the incident wavefield is only composed of vertically propagating body waves; 2) ignores oblique incidence; and 3) neglects the three-component nature of the wavefield that includes surface waves and rotational motions. Surface waves often carry much of the seismic energy and can excite all three components of motion. Therefore, it seems most appropriate to include the most representative characterization of the incident wavefield in site-specific analyses. We are performing parametric studies with three-dimensional (3D) elastic finite difference simulations to compare the near-surface response of sedimentary basins to horizontally polarized planes (arbitrary incident) and point source (double couple) earthquakes. Simulations involve simple, parametric representations of basin geometries and layered material properties of the sedimentary basin and surrounding hard rock. We compare the frequency-dependent site response for different excitations and attempt to quantify the differences between the plane-wave and fully 3D basin response.",

            "abstract": "The Kaikoura Mountains stand high as topographic anomalies in the oblique Pacific-Australian plate boundary zone known as the Marlborough Fault System (MFS), NE South Island New Zealand. The base of both the Inland and Seaward Kaikoura Ranges are bound on the SE by major, steeply NW-dipping, right lateral, active strike-slips (Clarence and Hope faults of the MFS, respectively). Previous geologic mapping, observations of predominantly horizontal fault slip at the surface from GPS and offset Quaternary deposits, and uplift of marine terraces, provide evidence for shortening and mountain-building via distributed deformation off of the main MFS strike-slip faults. However, quantitative estimates of the magnitude and spatial patterns of exhumation and of the timing of mountain-building in the Kaikouras are needed to understand more fully the nature of oblique deformation in the MFS. We present new apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He ages from opposite sides of the Hope and Clarence faults, spanning over 2 km of relief within the Kaikoura Mountains to identify spatial and temporal changes in exhumation rates in relation to the adjacent faults. Young (~3 Ma) apatite He ages and rapid (potentially > 1 mm/yr) exhumation rates from opposite sides of the faults are consistent with previously mentioned evidence of recent, regional, distributed deformation off of the main MFS faults. Moreover, early Miocene zircon He ages imply that parts of this region experienced an earlier phase of fault-related exhumation. Large changes in zircon He ages across the faults from ~20 Ma to > 100 Ma support hypotheses that portions of the Marlborough Faults may be re-activated, early Miocene thrusts. The zircon data are also consistent with the hypothesis of an early Miocene initiation of the oblique Pacific-Australian plate boundary in this region. Evidence for this comes from a change in sedimentation during this time from fine marine sediments to coarse, terrigenous conglomerates. Observing more than one phase of deformation in this active, oblique tectonic setting provides a new quantitative assessment of the evolution of the Pacific-Australian plate boundary in this region and how the accommodation of deformation may change over time.",

            "abstract": "Magnetospheric ions with energies less than tens of eV originate from the ionosphere. The low energy indicates the origin of the plasma but also severely complicates detection of the positive ions onboard sunlit spacecraft at higher altitudes, which often become positively charged to several tens of volts. We discuss some methods to observe low-energy ions, including a technique based on the detection of the wake behind a charged spacecraft in a supersonic flow.\nLow-energy ions typically dominate the density and flux in large regions of the Terrestrial magnetosphere, also at high altitudes. This is true both on the nightside and the dayside, during all parts of the solar cycle. The loss of this initially low-energy plasma to the solar wind is one of the primary pathways for atmospheric escape. The global outflow is of the order of 1026 ions/s and often dominates over the outflow at higher energies. The outward flux increases by a factor of 2 with increasing solar EUV flux during a solar cycle. The total outward flux may increase another factor of 2 due to an increased polar cap area at high geomagnetic activity. On the dayside, the increased density due to low-energy plasma will lower the Alfvén velocity and the magnetopause reconnection rate. In addition, the low-energy ions with a gyro radius between the gyro radii of electrons and hot ions introduce a new lengths scale important for magnetic reconnection and Hall currents.",

Pluto and Charon present a unique regime to investigate cratering physics due to a combination of circumstances: 1) their relatively low gravities—Pluto’s gravity (~0.66 m s-2) falls between those of the large icy satellites of Jupiter and their mid-sized saturnian cousins, while Charon’s gravity (0.28 m s-2) is more similar to the latter, 2) the low primary impact velocities onto Pluto and Charon’s surfaces (average ~2 km s-1), and 3) the mix of surface ices likely present (e.g., N2, CO, CH4, H2O). We use available images from both the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI; Cheng et al., 2008, SSR 140, 189-215) and data from the Ralph (Reuter et al., 2008, SSR 140, 129-154) color/composition instruments to characterize crater morphologies and ejecta characteristics.

            "abstract": "The diurnal cycle of convective clouds greatly influences the top-of-atmosphere radiative energy balance in convectively active regions of Earth, through both direct presence and the production of anvil and stratiform clouds. Previous studies show that the frequency and properties of convective clouds can vary on monthly timescales as a result of variability in the monthly mean atmospheric state. Furthermore, the top-of-atmospheric radiative budget in convectively active regions varies by up to 7 Wm-2. These facts suggest that convective clouds connect atmospheric state and radiation variability beyond clear sky effects alone. We use CloudSat and CERES data to further examine the nature of these connections.\nFirst, we quantify covaraibility in multiple Amazonian cloud properties, in particular the deep convective cores (DCCs) and associated convective anvils (DCAs). We find a large significant inverse relationship between DCC frequency and updraft intensity, the latter of which being estimated with radar reflectivity. There is also a significant positive relationship between intensity and DCC top height. DCAs have a similar inverse relationship of frequency to convective intensity, but the DCA top height is mostly insensitive to intensity. Ice water content increases in both DCCs and DCAs as intensity increases, but the magnitude of DCA sensitivity decreases with distance to the convective core. The microphysical properties of DCCs core also carry into DCAs, and the influence decreases with increasing distance from the core.\nSecond, we examine the role that cloud variability has on radiative variability. Previous research has found that anomalous atmospheric states that enhance (reduce) deep convection tend to shift the daily outgoing longwave radiation and cloud albedo maxima earlier (later) in the day by 2-3 hr. We find a similar sensitivity of the radiative diurnal cycle to anomalous cloud properties. In particular, increased anomalous DCC/DCA frequency shifts the longwave diurnal cycle almost identically to increased convective instability, and accounts for 1 W m-2 variability per standard deviation of frequency. Increased DCC/DCA top height shifts the longwave diurnal cycle in an opposing manner to frequency, likely an effect of the inverse relationship between cloud top height and frequency.",

            "abstract": "Ocean acidification is projected to shift reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution sometime this century. While retrospective studies show large-scale changes in coral calcification over the last several decades, it is not possible to unequivocally link these results to ocean acidification due to confounding factors of temperature and other environmental parameters. Here, we quantified the calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment to test whether reef calcification increases when ocean chemistry is restored to near pre-industrial conditions. We used sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to increase the total alkalinity of seawater flowing over a reef flat, with the aim of increasing carbonate ion concentrations [CO32-] and the aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) to values that would have been attained under pre-industrial atmospheric pCO2 levels. We developed a dual tracer regression method to estimate alkalinity uptake (i.e., calcification) in response to alkalinity enrichment. This approach uses the change in ratios between a non-conservative tracer (alkalinity) and a conservative tracer (a non-reactive dye, Rhodamine WT) to assess the fraction of added alkalinity that is taken up by the reef as a result of an induced increase in calcification rate. Using this method, we estimate that an average of 17.3% ± 2.3% of the added alkalinity was taken up by the reef community. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment performed on a natural coral reef community (without artificial confinement), we demonstrate that, upon increase of [CO32-] and Ωarag to near pre-industrial values, reef calcification increases. Thus, we conclude that, the impacts of ocean acidification are already being felt by coral reefs. This work is the culmination of years of work in the Caldeira lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science, involving many people including Jack Silverman, Kenny Schneider, and Jana Maclaren.",

The location catalog is based on first-arrival times and waveform data of both compressional and shear waves from over 181,000 events on and near the Island of Hawaii between 1986 and 2009 recorded by the seismic stations at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. We relocate all the earthquakes by applying ray-tracing through an existing three-dimensional velocity model, similar event cluster analysis and a differential-time relocation method. The resulting location catalog represents an extension of previous relocation studies, covering a longer time period and consisting of more events with well-constrained absolute locations. The focal mechanisms are obtained based on the compressional-wave first motion polarities by applying the HASH program to the waveform cross-correlation relocated earthquakes. Overall, the good-quality focal solutions are dominated by normal faulting in our study area, especially in the active Kaoiki and Hilea seismic zones. Kilauea caldera is characterized by a mixture of approximately equal numbers of normal, strike-slip, and reverse faults, whereas focal mechanisms in its south flank are predominantly reverse. Our results are essential for mapping the seismic strain and stress field and for understanding the seismo-volcano-tectonic relationships within the magmatic systems.",

The interplay of these features of the climate exert further control to the largest phenomenon of convective summer precipitation in NW Mexico and SW US: the North American Monsoon (NAM) which is the most important source of fresh water for the region. There is a pressing need to better understand especially in times of rapid warming how this monsoonal system is going to respond. Here we explore on the different modes of variability of the monsoonal regime in high-resolution reconstructions of the marine sediment record and their possible controls during the Holocene. The role of the teleconnections between the high and low latitudes climate, the interaction with the ITCZ, ENSO, PDO and AMDO are critical for the understanding of global climate.\nWe produced an XRF record of the relative abundance of Si and Al in high resolution laminated sediments obtained from the western margin of Pescadero basin (24N,108W) in the southern domain of the Gulf of California as proxies of terrigenous input. The laminated nature of this deposits at intermediate depths on its slopes sets the foundation for a potentially good record of changes in the transfer of lithogenic materials between the continent and the ocean in this region. Here we present recently acquired data from the terrigenous fraction on the marine sediment composite record from Pescadero basin (522 m water depth / 220 cm long). We determined the relative abundance of Si and Al from X-ray fluorescence from records that were absolutely dated with the aid and eight radiocarbon ages, which allowed us to produce a continuous record with a decadal temporal resolution. The time series analysis of the entire record of Si and Al show significant periodicities which were further cross-correlated with other paleoclimate proxy records like ice core, speleothems, lake and marine sediments records with the aim of explain the evolution of the NAM and the links between external and internal feedback effects.",

Principal among these limitations are: (1) the radar cross section of the ocean surface strongly depends on wind and wave activities and is therefore highly variable; (2) the radar cross section of oil covered waters is often indistinguishable from other dark ocean features such as low wind areas or oil lookalikes, leading to ambiguities in oil spill detection.\nIn this paper, we introduce two novel image analysis techniques to largely mitigate the aforementioned performance limitations, namely Lipschitz regularity (LR) and Wavelet transforms. We used LR, an image texture parameter akin to the slope of the local power spectrum, in our approach to mitigate these limitations. We show that the LR parameter is much less sensitive to variations of wind and waves than the original image amplitude, lending itself well for normalizing image content. Beyond its benefit for image normalization, we also show that the LR transform enhances the contrast between oil-covered and oil-free ocean surfaces and therefore improves overall spill detection performance. To calculate LR, the SAR images are decomposed using two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform (2D-CWT), which are furthermore transformed into Holder space to measure LR. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of wavelet transforms provide additional benefits related to the adaptive reduction of speckle noise.\nWe show how LR and CWT are integrated into our image analysis workflow for application to oil spill detection. To describe the performance of this approach under controlled conditions, we applied our method to simulated SAR data of wind driven oceans containing oil spills of various properties. We also show applications to several real life oil spill scenarios using a series of L-band ALOS PALSAR images and X-band TerraSAR-X images acquired during the Deep Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. From our analysis, we concluded that the LR and CWT have distinct advantages in oil spill detection and lead to high performance spill mapping results.",

Traditionally, in-situ observations are required to identify aquifer recharge events, while more advanced approaches such as the water-table fluctuation method or the episodic master recession method are necessary to delineate the recharge event. Our study uses the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations to estimate monthly changes in groundwater storage which are attributed to the combination of groundwater abstraction and episodic recharge in the arid southwestern United States. Our results illustrate the ability of remote sensing technologies to identify episodic groundwater recharge in arid regions which can be used within sustainable groundwater management frameworks to effectively manage groundwater resources.",

We present results from a study of data from the DMSP F13 and F15 satellites over the period from 2000 to 2007, that describe the location of the reversal boundary, the general plasma motion with respect to it, and how it is reconfigured by changes in By and Bz. The data suggest that: (1) changes in By and Bz are equally effective in producing reversal boundary motions and the boundary moves more prominently on the dawnside or duskside dependent on the sign of By, (2) in general the boundary is not well described by a circle that is usually considered in an expanding/contracting polar cap paradigm, (3) plasma flows across the boundary in the 6-7 and 17-18 LT sectors are very small and may be attributed to the viscous interaction during stable IMF periods, and (4) equatorward motions of the boundary and the plasma are most often seen at the highest latitude locations and poleward motions of the boundary and the plasma are most often seen at the lowest latitude locations.",

            "abstract": "Mass movement is a major activity that impacts lives of humans and their infrastructure. Human activity in steep, mountainous regions is especially at risk to this potential hazard. Thus, the identification and quantification of risk by mapping and determining mass movement susceptibility are fundamental in protecting lives, resources and ensuring proper land use regulation and planning. Specific mass-movement processes including debris flows, rock falls, snow avalanches and landslides continuously modify the landscape of the San Juan Mountains. Historically, large-magnitude slope failures have repeatedly occurred in the region. Common triggers include intense, long-duration precipitation, freeze-thaw processes, human activity and various volcanic lithologies overlying weaker sedimentary formations. Predicting mass movement is challenging because of its episodic and spatially, discontinuous occurrence. Landslides in mountain terrain are characterized as widespread, highly mobile and have a long duration of activity. We developed a 3-D model for landslide susceptibility using Geographic Information Systems Technology (GIST).\nThe study area encompasses eight USGS quadrangles: Ridgway, Dallas, Mount Sneffels, Ouray, Telluride, Ironton, Ophir and Silverton. Fieldwork consisted of field reconnaissance mapping at 1:5,000 focusing on surficial geomorphology. Field mapping was used to identify potential locations, which then received additional onsite investigation and photographic documentation of features indicative of slope failure. A GIS module was created using seven terrain spatial databases: geology, surficial geomorphology (digitized), slope aspect, slope angle, vegetation, soils and distance to infrastructure to map risk. The GIS database will help determine risk zonation for the study area. Correlations between terrain parameters leading to slope failure were determined through the GIS module. This 3-D model will provide a spatial perspective of the landscape to improve landslide prediction for future occurrences.",

            "abstract": "With elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic emissions and disruption to the carbon cycle, the effects of climate change are being accelerated. Approximately 80% of Earth’s terrestrial organic carbon is stored in soil, and the residence time of this carbon can range from hours to millenia. Understanding the dynamics of this carbon pool in the carbon cycle is crucial to both predicting climate and sustaining ecosystem services.\nSoil organic carbon is known to be strongly associated with high surface area clay minerals. The nature of these interactions is not well understood primarily due to the heterogeneity of soil, as much of the current knowledge relies on experiments that take a top-down approach using bulk experimental measurements. Our work seeks to probe physical, chemical, and molecular-level interactions at the organic-mineral interface using a bottom-up approach that establishes a model system where complexity can be built in systematically. By performing in situ techniques such as dynamic force spectroscopy, a technique where organic molecules can be brought into contact with mineral surfaces in a controlled manner using an atomic force microscope, we demonstrate the ability to mechanistically probe the energy landscape of individual organic molecules with mineral surfaces. We demonstrate the ability to measure the binding energies of soil-inspired organic functional groups (including carboxylic acid, amine, methyl, and phosphate) with clay and mineral surfaces as a function of solution chemistry. This effort can provide researchers with both guiding principles about carbon dynamics at the sub-nanometer length scale and insights into early aggregation events, where organic-mineral interactions play a significant role.",

            "abstract": "Traditional seasonal streamflow forecasting uses observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) as predictors in statistical models to provide seasonal runoff forecasts. Over the past 10-20 years, investigation of the ability to assimilate SWE observations into hydrologic models has shown mixed results. Additionally, these applications have generally been focused on well-known research basins or a limited basin set. Here we use a large-sample watershed scale basin dataset to explore the potential of SWE data assimilation in seasonal streamflow prediction across the entire Western US. Simple linear correlation analysis is used to define the extent to which springtime SWE observations provide information for 1 April to 31 July runoff volume forecasts. Comparing observed and simulated SWE-runoff correlations for over 100+ basins identify basins where assimilating SWE observations will have the most impact on seasonal volume forecasts. Results show that the least potential for SWE assimilation is in basins that are relatively well instrumented, as well as basins at higher altitude with well-defined accumulation and melt seasons. In these basins the precipitation input to the model (primarily snowfall) has similar information content to the SWE observations. A set of data assimilation experiments are conducted to illustrate inter-regional differences in the value of SWE assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Sea level rise estimates from the Last Interglacial period suggest collapse of part of the Antarctic ice sheet. However, there is no direct evidence of this from the ice sheet itself. Englacial layers in ice sheets, sampled directly by ice core drilling and indirectly by ice-penetrating radar, reveal a significant amount about glacial change over time and may contain a signature of the last ice sheet collapse.\nWe hypothesize there is evidence of ice sheet instability where the observed englacial record deviates from that expected for a steady state WAIS simulated using ice sheet models. However, discrepancies between modeled steady state and observed englacial layer geometry are confounded by uncertainties in model boundary conditions, observed layer ages, and model parameters. To know where the signal of collapse may be best preserved, we must account for the affect of these uncertainties on layer geometry.\nWe present several tests quantifying the sensitivity of simulated layer geometry to changes in model boundary conditions. We look to areas where englacial geometry has low sensitivity to uncertain boundary conditions to provide the largest signal of ice sheet instability. Where simulated layer geometry is responding strongly to uncertain boundary conditions, we are unlikely to be able to discern a signal of past deglaciation. In the latter case, uncertainty in layer geometry may overwhelm the signal of past ice sheet collapse.\nWe perform the simulations using the Variational Glacier Simulator (VarGlaS), an ice sheet model with the capacity to model the age of englacial isochrones (Figure 1). We use the latest boundary conditions for geothermal flux, basal topography, and surface mass balance to simulate the steady state behavior of englacial layers in the Thwaites Glacier catchment and the Marie Byrd Land dome. Ensembles of model runs sample the uncertainty in each of the boundary conditions, creating a distribution of simulated englacial layers which accounts for boundary condition uncertainty.",

However, artificially increasing the entrainment rate does not make convective parameterizations more realistic. This paradox highlights a lack of understanding and oversimplified representations of entrainment processes. A series of high-resolution simulations of deep convection initiated with a warm humid bubble are compared to a more conventional radiative-convective equilibrium simulation. Entrainment rates are diagnosed with the direct measurement method and the analysis does support an inverse relationship between entrainment and cloud radius, as is often assumed in plume models. A method for quantifying a cloud dilution rate associated with entrainment is presented. Dilution and entrainment are found to generally not be synonymous. Dilution is found to have a weak inverse relationship to cloud core radius, inadvertently supporting the simplifying assumptions of conventional parameterizations. Additional sensitivity experiments and suggestions for parameterization development are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the magnitude and variability of greenhouse gas fluxes from different terrestrial carbon pools is necessary for enhancing understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling. While much more is known about variability CO2 fluxes, we have little information on how CH4 fluxes vary across multiple carbon pools within terrestrial ecosystems. We measured fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from living tree stems, soils, and coarse woody debris within a temperate forested watershed during the growing season (May-November). Fluxes of both CH4 and CO2 were significantly different among carbon pools. Living tree stems were weak sources of both CH4 and CO2 with seasonal means (± 1 SD) of 0.08 ± 0.19 nmol CH4 m-2 s-1 and 1.16 ± 1.21 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Soils were sinks of CH4 and sources of CO2 with seasonal means (± 1 SD) of -2.00 ± 1.41 nmol CH4 m-2 s-1 and 3.07 ± 2.10 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from coarse woody debris were largely variable relative to the other pools with seasonal means (± 1 SD) of -0.21 ± 0.76 nmol CH4 m-2 s-1 and 2.61 ± 2.50 µmol CO2m-2 s-1. Gas fluxes varied significantly (p < 0.05) between sampling sites for both living stems and coarse woody debris, but not for soils. For living stems, this variability was explained by differences in tree species, where N. sylvatica had largest seasonal mean flux of CH4 and L. tulipifera had the largest seasonal mean flux of CO2. For woody debris sites, the variability was explained wood density, with dense, fresh wood acting as CH4 sources, and less dense, decayed wood acting as CH4 sinks. Our results show homogeneity in soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes, but a large heterogeneity in fluxes from tree stems and coarse woody debris. These results provide insights on how forest management strategies could influence greenhouse gas emissions from forested watersheds.",

Such high resolution is suitable for resolving dynamics that occur at ion and electron scales throughout Earth’s magnetosphere, in particular in the plasma sheet where low magnetic field magnitudes result in larger particle gyroradii and gyroperiods. Here we present initial data from FPI’s Dual Electron and Dual Ion Spectrometers taken in Earth’s nightside plasma sheet during MMS commissioning. Near the central current sheet, we observe a sub-proton-scale magnetic depression (i.e., 'magnetic hole') containing distinct signatures in the electron data that appear non-gyrotropic in the spacecraft frame of reference. These structures may provide key insights into the small-scale dissipation of energy injected into the magnetosphere via magnetic reconnection in the tail. We will present a detailed examination of the velocity distribution functions of both ions and electrons during this time period and compare with expectations from current theoretical models of magnetic depressions. Although plasma data was only available on a single MMS spacecraft during these events, we are able to leverage Fields data on all four MMS observatories to provide valuable context for the spatial and temporal variation of this magnetic structure.",

Although an increase in maximum body size has been observed during and after the Precambrian oxidation events in the Late Archean and at the onset of the Cambrian, these observations took into account the appearance of eukaryotic life and multicellular life respectively. Using a database of marine animal body sizes spanning the Phanerozoic, we conducted a series of Pearson product-moment correlation tests with igneous rock weathering (Strontium-87: Strontium-86), rate of carbon cycle (δ13C), temperature (δ18O), CO2 concentration, sulfate mineral weathering (δ34S), atmospheric oxygen concentration, and sea level as independent variables, and mean body size as the dependent variable. Our test yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.81 between δ18O and body size, and -0.78 between rCO2 and body size; since δ18O is inversely correlated with temperature, these results indicate that both temperature and CO2 have strong inverse relationships with body size. Atmospheric oxygen yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.09, demonstrating that it ceased to play an influential role in shaping body sizes following the start of the Phanerozoic.",

In previous calculations we assumed standard density air in the return stroke channel and the resulting optical spectrum was that of an optically thick emitter, unlike measured spectra that are optically thin. In this work, we improve our model by initializing our simulation assuming that the leader-heated channel is pre-expanded to a density of 0.01-0.05 ambient and near pressure equilibrium with the surrounding ambient air and by implementing a time-dependent, external heat source to incorporate the effects of continuing current. By doing so, our simulated spectra, illustrated in the attached figure, show strong spectral emission characteristics at wavelengths similar to spectra measured by Orville (1968). In this poster, we describe our model and compare our simulated results with spectra measured by Orville (1968) and Smith (2015). We also use spectroscopic methods to compute physical properties of the plasma channel, e.g. temperature, from Smith’s measurements and compare these with our simulated results.",

            "abstract": "The USGS is working with partners to develop the ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system (\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3083/\n) to protect life and property along the U.S. West Coast, where the highest national seismic hazard is concentrated. EEW sends an alert that shaking from an earthquake is on its way (in seconds to tens of seconds) to allow recipients or automated systems to take appropriate actions at their location to protect themselves and/or sensitive equipment. ShakeAlert is transitioning toward a production prototype phase in which test users might begin testing applications of the technology. While a subset of uses will be automated (e.g., opening fire house doors), other applications will alert individuals by radio or cellphone notifications and require behavioral decisions to protect themselves (e.g., “Drop, Cover, Hold On”). The project needs to select and move forward with a consistent alert sound to be widely and quickly recognized as an earthquake alert. In this study we combine EEW science and capabilities with an understanding of human behavior from the social and psychological sciences to provide insight toward the design of effective sounds to help best motivate proper action by alert recipients. We present a review of existing research and literature, compiled as considerations and recommendations for alert sound characteristics optimized for EEW. We do not yet address wording of an audible message about the earthquake (e.g., intensity and timing until arrival of shaking or possible actions), although it will be a future component to accompany the sound. We consider pitch(es), loudness, rhythm, tempo, duration, and harmony. Important behavioral responses to sound to take into account include that people respond to discordant sounds with anxiety, can be calmed by harmony and softness, and are innately alerted by loud and abrupt sounds, although levels high enough to be auditory stressors can negatively impact human judgment.",

This analysis consists of both private research by QuakeFinder, and institutional collaborators (PUCP in Peru, NCU in Taiwan, PUCC in Chile, NOA in Greece, Syiah Kuala University in Indonesia, LASP at U of Colo., Stanford, and USGS).\nRecently, NASA Hq and QuakeFinder tried a new approach to help with the analysis of this huge (50+TB) data archive. A collaboration with Apirio/TopCoder, Harvard University, Amazon, QuakeFinder, and NASA Hq. resulted in an open algorithm development contest called “Quest for Quakes” in which contestants (freelance algorithm developers) attempted to identify quakes from a subset of the QuakeFinder data (3TB). The contest included a $25K prize pool, and contained 100 cases where earthquakes (and null sets) included data from up to 5 remote sites, near and far from quakes greater than M4. These data sets were made available through Amazon.com to hundreds of contestants over a two week contest period.\nIn a more traditional approach, several new algorithms were tried by actively sharing the QF data with universities over a longer period. These algorithms included Principal Component Analysis-PCA and deep neural networks in an effort to automatically identify earthquake signals within typical, noise-filled environments.\nThis presentation examines the pros and cons of employing these two approaches, from both logistical and scientific perspectives.",

            "abstract": "The mission of the USDA Southwest Regional Climate Hub is to provide farmers, ranchers and forest land owners and managers with information and resources to cope with the impacts of climate change. As such, a clear understanding of landowner needs for weather and climate data and their attitudes about climate change is required. Here we present a summary of results from 17 peer-reviewed articles on studies pertaining to landowner needs and attitudes towards climate change adaptation and mitigation that span much of the continental U.S. and ideally represent a cross-section of different geographies. In general, approximately 75% of landowners and farm advisors believe climate change is occurring, but disagree on the human contribution. Studies found that most farmers were supportive of adaptation responses, but fewer endorsed farm-based greenhouse gas reduction mitigation strategies. Adaptation is often driven by local concerns and requires locally specific strategies. Perceiving weather variability increased belief in human-caused climate change. Presently farmers and ranchers rely on past experience and short-range forecasts (weeks to seasons) whereas some foresters are requesting long-term predictions on the order of years to decades. Foresters indicated that most of them (74%) are presently unable to find needed long-term information. We augment peer-reviewed literature with observations from landowner workshops conducted in Nevada and Arizona during 2014, the first year of Climate Hub operation. To better collect information about climate change needs and attitudes of farmers, ranchers and foresters across the globe, we created a Climate Change Attitudes collection in JournalMap (https://journalmap.org/usda-southwest-regional-climate-hub/climate-change-attitudes). Users anywhere can add articles to this collection, ultimately generating a comprehensive spatial resource in support of adaptation and mitigation efforts on working lands.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) regulates multiple ecosystem processes, including the exchange of trace gases and primary productivity. Recently, there has been vigorous debate over the role that microbial products play in forming stable soil organic matter, with increasing analytical evidence using isotopes, molecular chemistry, and microcopy all showing that SOM possesses a strong microbial signature. However, scaling these observations – typically made at the molecular to nano or micron scales – to ecosystems or larger scales remains challenging. Here we show that microbial physiological processes such as growth efficiency and growth rate regulate the accumulation of microbial products. These processes are also strongly regulated by ecosystem disturbance and can be readily incorporated into microbial-explicit global C cycling models.\n In our experiments with model artificial soils accruing SOM and field soils with varying soil C concentrations, the accumulation of SOM is closely related to microbial physiology. Further, the rate and efficiency that isotopically labelled C is converted to soil C depends strongly on microbial physiological characteristics. Given the sensitivity of microbial physiological characteristics to disturbance, these physiological traits can help explain ecosystem-scale SOM responses to environmental changes.\nVariation in microbial physiology can also be directly incorporated into models, allowing us to scale microbial processes that regulate SOM formation to regional and global scales. Here we demonstrate the incorporation of microbial processes into MIMICS, the MIcrobial MIneral Carbon Stabilization model. Moving from ecosystem to larger scales, we demonstrate that MIMICS, a microbial-explicit model with output strongly dependent on microbial physiology is able to predict large-scale soil C dynamics as well as or better than conventional models. Microbial physiology, which varies among microbial groups and is highly sensitive disturbance, can be used to scale from the smallest processes regulating SOM formation to global C cycling.",

            "abstract": "High resolution lacustrine sedimentary sequences hold substantial potential for paleoenvironmental analyses, particularly in regions where few alternatives are available. Increased attention to quantifying processes that generate sedimentary facies has yielded increasingly detailed environmental interpretations but these efforts have been limited by available field data. The Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) was initiated in 2003 to develop a long term site to evaluate the controls over sediment transport and the formation of clastic sedimentary records. This program in the Canadian Arctic has supported 13 years of research in paired watersheds and lakes, both of which contain clastic varves.\nResults from 2003-14 demonstrate how multiple climatic factors delivery sediment in a complex manner. This comparatively simple hydroclimatic system is dominated by runoff and sediment transport from spring snowmelt, with clear associations between catchment snow water equivalence (or total runoff) and sediment yield, with discharge limited by snow exhaustion as the season progresses. Major rainfall can constitute a dominant contribution to seasonal sediment yield, but antecedent conditions can significantly reduce runoff markedly. Hence, these results indicate two primary competing hydroclimatic factors that control catchment sediment yield, both with independent climatic and hydrological factors.\nAdditionally, the impact of landscape disturbance on downstream sediment yield has been evaluated following a major episode of permafrost thaw in 2007. Results show that localized slope disturbances resulted in enhanced erosion but downstream fluvial storage reduced the magnitude of transport. Sediment from disturbances will be gradually released and may generate decadal-scale sediment delivery changes in the downstream record.\nCollectively, this research indicates multiple controls over the formation of clastic varves. Advances in high resolution sedimentary structure and composition analysis provide methodological pathways for integrating a fuller set of controls over sediment deposition, and together with sustained process investigations, offer the opportunity for sedimentary records with the highest degree of fidelity.",

An array very near the launch pad detected infrasound due to the rocket during the full launch, while those further from the launch point were in an acoustic shadow zone while the source was at low altitudes. Analysis of the signals on all arrays found agreement with propagation modeling predictions, implying that signals from multiple arrays could provide a means to reproduce the trajectory of a rocket using infrasonic observations. Interestingly, high-altitude stage ignitions have been found to be very low amplitude in this particular data set, possibly due to inefficiency of the aeroacoustic source mechanism in the rarefied upper atmosphere.",

In unconventional realm, hydrocarbons are generated and stored in nanopores media ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers. Fundamental knowledge of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes that control fluid flow and propagation within nano-pore confinement is critical for maximizing unconventional oil/gas production. The size and confinement of the nanometer pores creates many complex rock-fluid interface interactions. It is imperative to promote innovative experimental studies to decipher physical and chemical processes at the nanopore scale that govern hydrocarbon generation and mass transport of hydrocarbon mixtures in tight shale and other low permeability formations at reservoir pressure-temperature conditions.\nWe have carried out laboratory investigations exploring quantitative relationship between pore characteristics of the Wolfcamp shale from Western Texas and the shale interaction with fluids at reservoir P-T conditions using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). We have performed SANS measurements of the shale rock in single fluid (e.g., H2O and D2O) and multifluid (CH4/(30% H2O+70% D2O)) systems at various pressures up to 20000 psi and temperature up to 150 oF. Figure 1 shows our SANS data at different pressures with H2O as the pressure medium. Our data analysis using IRENA software suggests that the principal changes of pore volume in the shale occurred on smaller than 50 nm pores and pressure at 5000 psi (Figure 2). Our results also suggest that with increasing P, more water flows into pores; with decreasing P, water is retained in the pores.",

CAMx source apportionment technology was used to track the impacts from multiple (14) different emissions source regions (i.e. field office areas) within one simulation, as well as to assess the cumulative impact of emissions from all source regions combined. The energy development emissions estimates were for the year 2021 for three different development scenarios: (1) low; (2) high; (3) high with emissions mitigation. Impacts on air quality (AQ) including ozone, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and air quality related values (AQRVs) such as atmospheric deposition, regional haze and changes in Acid Neutralizing Capacity (ANC) of lakes were quantified, and compared to establish threshold levels. In this presentation, we present a brief summary of the how the emission scenarios were developed, we compare the emission totals for each scenario, and then focus on the ozone impacts for each scenario to assess: (1). the difference in potential ozone impacts under the different development scenarios and (2). to establish the sensitivity of the ozone impacts to different emissions levels.

            "abstract": "Many silicate and oxide liquids of interest in the Earth sciences and in technology cannot readily be quenched to glasses, either because of low silica contents (and hence low viscosity at the melting point and accompanying liquid ‘fragility’) or because of liquid-liquid unmixing at high temperature. Although in-situ, high temperature structural tools have been in use for decades and are rapidly developing, many methods are still most informative for glass samples quenched to ambient pressure and temperature, e.g. high-resolution solid-state NMR.\nAmorphous oxides, including alumina and silicate compositions, have widespread technological applications. These are generally deposited by a variety of high-energy sputtering methods, as films of thicknesses of 10’s to 100’s of nm. Using Al-27, Si-29, and O-17 NMR, we have recently shown that for such films, very similar short-range structure is seen in materials made by very different kinetic pathways, such as sol-gel synthesis vs. ion-beam sputtering. This path-independent structure suggests that these materials pass through transient equilibrium states during their formation, probably that of deeply supercooled liquids just above glass transition temperatures. In the HfO2-SiO2 and ZrO2-SiO2 systems, for example, samples have well-resolved O-17 NMR spectra, allowing quantitation of O sites with only Hf(Zr) neighbors (so-called “free” oxide ions), with mixed Hf(Zr) and Si neighbors, and Si only. The observed oxygen speciation agrees well with a simple thermodynamic model of one of the most fundamental equilibria in silicate systems, namely the reaction of bridging (Si-O-Si) and “free” (e.g. OHf3 and OHf4) oxide ions to produce “non-bridging” oxygens (e.g. Si-OHf2). This new approach to sampling such structural equilibria in compositions far outside the range of normal glass-forming liquids may provide new insights into more geological compositions as well, as well as in more general models of silicate melt chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Alkyl nitrates (AN, molecular formula RONO2) play a crucial role in the troposphere as temporary reservoirs of nitrogen oxides (NOx =NO +NO2) and by acting as chain terminators in the photochemical production of ozone. Mixing ratios of AN in ambient air are commonly quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture or mass spectrometric detection (GC-ECD or GC-MS) coupled to purge-and-trap preconcentration, usually on Tenax sorbent, to improve the detection limits. The analysis, however, is quite laborious as there are many alkyl nitrates that are low in individual abundance (often less than 1 parts-per-trillion by volume, pptv) and that exhibit different instrumental response factors. An alternative method is to determine alkyl nitrates as a sum (ΣAN) by thermal dissociation (TD) to a common fragment (NO2), which can then be quantified with a uniform response factor by optical absorption, for example by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). However, the determination of ΣAN by TD-CRDS is hampered by its relatively high detection limits (several 100 pptv) and secondary chemistry following TD that results in both negative and positive interferences and depends on the composition of the ambient air sampled.\nIn this work, a TD-CRDS equipped with a Tenax preconcentration unit is described. Matrix effects are minimized by desorbing the samples from the Tenax in a background of nitrogen. The performance of the instrument, in particular the recovery from the Tenax sorbent, was evaluated by sampling laboratory-generated mixtures of alkyl and peroxyacyl nitrates. Field data from a coastal site collected during the Ozone-depleting reactions in a coastal atmosphere (ORCA) campaign, which took place at the Amphitrite Point Observatory in Ucluelet, BC, from July 6 - 31, 2015, are presented. Advantages and disadvantages of the new method are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Extension of the thermokarst features such as lakes and ponds had been noticed in many regions of the Arctic affected by the modern climate warming. Thermokarst is a process of permafrost thawing under the water bodies with depths larger than maximal thickness of seasonal ice in the area, i.e. with permanent positive temperature at the bottom. This process is most probable in the areas where massive ice bodies (wedges, lenses, layers etc) or ice rich deposits exist close to ground surface and even insignificant increasing of thaw depth can lead to its melting and surface subsidence. Local depressions such as low-centered polygonal ponds or interpolygonal troughs can potentially become triggers of thermokarst development. Current research was aimed on determination of warming impact of small water bodies on the permafrost temperature and seasonal thawing and estimation of risk of thermokarst development at Barrow Environmental Observatory area.\nComparison of temperature measurements under shallow (10 – 40 cm deep) with relatively dry spots and active layer thickness survey show that warming impact of small water bodies (mean annual temperature at the permafrost table here is up to 2oC higher then under “dry” geomorphological features) is not realized in increasing of the thawing depth. Active layer thickness does not exceed values of 45 cm under polygonal ponds and 35 cm under troughs that is less then thickness of protective layer above ice wedges in the area.\nFor estimation of risk of thermokarst development we used analytical equations developed by V.Kudryavtsev (1974). Results of calculations show that in this area crucial depth of water bodies required for mean annual temperature at the bottom of the pond became higher then freezing point consists of 0.95 cm.\nCurrent research was supported by US DOE as a part of research project Next Generation of Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE).",

            "abstract": "The polar regions, and the large ice sheets in particular, are quickly evolving harbingers of global change. Therefore, it is important that we measure and monitor the ice sheets in a consistent and repeatable manner over time. While kilometer-scale resolution sensors like MODIS and VIIRS can do this on a daily basis, the higher spatial and radiometric resolution of Landsat 8 supports a more quantitative measure of polar change over decameter spatial scales and weekly to seasonal timescales. To date, Landsat 8 has collected over two years of imagery of exceptional radiometric quality and geolocation accuracy, and with unprecedented acquisition rates for the poles. Building upon lessons learned from the Landsat 7 Antarctic mosaic (LIMA; Bindschadler et al., 2008, Remote Sensing of the Environment), this project harnesses the multispectral imaging capabilities of Landsat 8 with Google’s Earth Engine to produce time-series data sets for monitoring the remote, vast, polar ice sheets in a fraction of the time it would take to do so with traditional computational methods (or earlier manual efforts). We focus on building cloud-free, multi-temporal Landsat 8 mosaics (‘data cubes’) by applying a range of strategies (e.g., normalized indices, statistically based thresholds, image cross-correlation). These can then be used to quantify ice sheet surface and snow cover properties over time to study ice sheet change (e.g., ice sheet morphology, ice shelf extent, snow grain size, melt and melt pond extent, surface wind direction from drift orientation).",

            "abstract": "Over the past 500 years, global agricultural area has grown from 2 million km2 (1500) to 15 million km2 (2005), displacing forests and other natural ecosystems in the process (Hurtt et al., 2011). This expansion in area has been driven by changes in population, income, diet, and agricultural productivity. These factors will continue to evolve in the future; however, the effect of these changes on future land use, land cover, and emissions remains uncertain (e.g., Calvin et al., In Press). Additionally, future changes in land depend critically on the implementation of land-based mitigation options, such as bioenergy and afforestation (Wise et al., 2009; Reilly et al., 2012; Popp et al., 2013; Calvin et al., 2014). As all of these factors are uncertain in the future, the future evolution of land use and land cover is also uncertain. This presentation decomposes the drivers of past, present, and future land use change, characterizing the contribution of factors such as population, income, diet, agricultural productivity, and mitigation. In the historical period, we rely on a variety of land-based datasets (e.g., FAO, HYDE). For the future period, we analyze the integrated assessment modeling community’s implementation of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; O’Neill et al., In Press). The SSPs describe five different evolutions of socioeconomic development, varying several factors relevant to land use and land use change.",

            "abstract": "One of the most important challenges facing the ICESat-2 mission is to identify and minimize the effects of potential biases in estimates of ice surface heights. The mission is designed to make very precise estimates of ice-sheet volume changes, and small, spatially correlated biases in the surface height measurements can produce large spurious volume-change signals. One potentially significant signal comes from the subsurface scattering of the emitted laser pulse. Because pure ice is nearly transparent at the instrument’s 532 nm (green) operating wavelength, a photon from ICESat2’s laser can be scattered by hundreds or thousands of ice grains within the snowpack before it returns to the surface and travels back to the satellite.. The time required for this leads to a volume scattering bias, The magnitude of the volume scattering bias depends on the relative fractions of photons returning from near the surface and those scattered many times at depth, which in turn depends on the effective grain size of the snow and ice, the impurity content, and the vertical distribution of each.\nHere we present the results of the first ice-sheet survey designed to measure the magnitude of this potential problem. The NASA ICESat-2 project conducted an airborne survey in July, 2015 over the west coast of Greenland, using the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar (SIMPL). The SIMPL instrument makes photon-counting laser-altimetry measurements at two different wavelengths (532 and 1064 nm) using a common optical path to ensure accurate collocation. The infrared channel (1064 nm) was used in addition to the green because it is insensitive to volume scattering. These measurements were complimented by Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVRIS) measurements, intended to quantify variations in surface grain size and impurity content. Surveys were designed to measure a variety of surface conditions, from fine-grained snow at high elevations in the north to dirty, melting ice surfaces in the south. To derive maps of potential biases, we measure the spatial variation of the range difference between SIMPL’s green and infrared channels, and relate this to the surface conditions as measured by AVRIS.",

Here, effects of HRU size on simulated soil water and surface runoff are tested using the AgroEcoSystem-Watershed (AgES-W) model with three different resolutions of HRUs. We studied a 56-ha agricultural watershed in northern Colorado, USA farmed primarily under a wheat-fallow rotation. The delineation algorithm was based upon topography (surface flow paths), land use (crop management strips and native grass), and mapped soil units (three types), which produced HRUs that follow the land use and soil boundaries. AgES-W model parameters that control surface and subsurface hydrology were calibrated using simulated daily soil moisture at different landscape positions and depths where soil moisture was measured hourly and averaged up to daily values. Parameter sets were both uniform and spatially variable with depth and across the watershed (5 different calibration approaches). Although forward simulations were computationally efficient (less than 1 minute each), each calibration required thousands of model runs. Execution of such large jobs was facilitated by using the Object Modeling System with the Cloud Services Innovation Platform to manage four virtual machines on a commercial web service configured with a total of 64 computational cores and 120 GB of memory. Results show how spatially distributed and averaged soil moisture and runoff at the outlet vary with different HRU delineations. The results will help guide HRU delineation, spatial resolution and parameter estimation methods for improved hydrological simulations in this and other semi-arid agricultural watersheds.",

Sub-surface structure and stress field orientations of the Rotokawa Geothermal Field, New Zealand have been studied, for the first time, using observations obtained from analysis of three acoustic image logs, acquired using a high temperature BHTV. While an overall NE-SW fracture strike exists, heterogeneity in fracture dip orientation is evident. Dominant dip direction changes from well to well, due to proximity to variously oriented, graben-bounding faults. Fracture orientation heterogeneity also occurs within individual wells, where fractures patterns are consistent with expected antithetic faulting in extensional environments. A general SHmax orientation of NE-SW is determined from induced features on borehole walls. However, localised perturbations from this trend are evident, constituting stress field orientation heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is attributed to slip on fracture planes. Correlation of observed fracture properties and patterns to well permeability indicators reveal some fractures play a role in fluid flow in the Rotokawa geothermal reservoir. Permeable zones commonly contain wide aperture fractures, high fracture densities, with dominant NE-SW strike orientations and NW dip directions. Additional consideration of stress magnitudes on fracture permeability reveals some, but not all, fractures prone to slip occur in permeable zones.",

            "abstract": "Non-traditional isotopic systems, in particular molybdenum, chromium or iron, have become traditional tools in biogeochemical studies of ancient environments, raising hopes that selenium may join the group. Like sulfur, selenium is found in sulfide minerals and organic matter, it forms oxyanions under oxic conditions, and its isotopes are fractionated during dissimilatory reduction, albeit at relatively higher redox potential. One would therefore expect that redox changes over Earth’s history led to a response in selenium isotopes. For a first assessment, we analyzed selenium isotopes and abundances in black shales from marine and non-marine environments spanning the last 3.2 billion years (Stüeken et al. 2015). Combined with published data from the Phanerozoic eon, our results show that isotopic fractionations in bulk rocks are mostly between -2‰ and +2‰ in δ82/78Se (relative to NIST SRM 3149, bulk Earth ~ 0‰) and thus significantly smaller than what has been reported from biological experiments (up to 25‰, Johnson & Bullen 2004). In the Precambrian before 1.0 Ga, marine data are mostly positive (+0.4 ± 0.4‰); negative values occur in non-marine settings in the late Archean. In the Phanerozoic, the mean of open marine samples drops to -0.2 ± 0.6 ‰ whereas restricted anoxic basins are on average positive (+0.2 ± 0.4 ‰). The range of fractionations is generally larger in samples with a molar Setotal:Corg ratio greater than that of marine biomass (up to ~5·10-6, Mitchell et al. 2012). We conclude that selenium isotopes are sensitive to atmospheric and marine oxygenation events, but due to the scarcity and nutrient-type behavior of selenium in seawater, organic-binding likely dominates the selenium cycle, which leads to smaller net fractionations in black shales and a strong response to changes in biological productivity. The largest isotopic fractionations are probably observed where the selenium supply exceeds the biological demand due to a combination of enhanced oxidative selenium weathering, greater stability of selenium oxyanions in oxic waters, or declining biological assimilation. Selenium isotopes are therefore most powerful in combination with other biogeochemical proxies.",

KRB has high human-induced water demand and suffers from low water productivity. The future of the KRB and its growth clearly relies on sustainable water resources and hence, requires a holistic, basin-wide management and monitoring of natural resources (water, soil, vegetation, livestock, etc.). The KRB has dry regions in which water scarcity is a major challenge. In this study, we investigate changes in the hydrology of the basin during the past three decades including human-induced alterations of the system. We evaluate climatic variability, agricultural water use, land cover change and agriculture production. In this reaserch, we have developed a simple indicator for quantifying human influence on the hydrologic cycle. The results show that KRB’s hydrology is significantly dominated by human activities. The anthropogenic water demand has increased substantially caused by growth in agriculture industry. In fact, the main reason for water scarcity in the region appears to be due to the increased anthropogenic water demand resulting from substantial socio-economic growth in the past three decades. Our results show that continued growth in the region is not sustainable without considering major changes in water use efficiency, land cover management and water productivity.",

            "abstract": "We conducted high pressure, high temperature experiments to determine simultaneously the diffusivities of 24 trace elements (Sc, V, Rb, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta, Th, U) in liquids of basaltic composition. Pre-synthesis runs were conducted in graphite capsules in a piston-cylinder apparatus to create two glasses having relatively high and low trace element contents. These glasses were then powdered and paired in diffusion couples by repacking in graphite capsules. All diffusion experiments were executed in a piston cylinder apparatus at 1 GPa pressure and temperatures ranging from 1250-1500º C.\nConcentration gradients that developed in the glasses were characterized using a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS). Diffusion coefficients were determined from concentration profiles and show Arrhenian behavior within experimental error. Errors were assigned based on the linear fit of five time series experiments conducted over 500-9000 s to accurately represent the total experimental reproducibility of our results. Data show the highest activation energies are obtained for high field strength elements. Values for the pre-exponential factor, D0, also peak for the high field strength elements. We suggest that trace element diffusion in basaltic melts follows the compensation law (Winchell, 1969), with log D0 exhibiting linear dependence on activation energy. Calculated diffusivities indicate that transport through basaltic melt could be an effective mechanism for fractionating high field strength elements over geologically relevant time scales.\nWinchell (1969) High Temp.

Variation of the five chosen crop yields is overall in agreement with the three drought indicators SPI, SSI, and MSDI during the analysis period of 1980-2012. This study develops a bivariate copula model to investigate the statistical dependence of drought and crop yield. Copula functions are used to establish the existing connections between climate variables and crop yields during the Millennium drought in Australia. The proposed model estimates the likelihood of crop yields given the observed or predicted drought indicators SPI, SSI or MSDI. The results are also useful to estimate crop yields associated with different thresholds of precipitation or soil moisture.",

Changes in wind stress alone lead to similar AMOC responses in a climate-ocean circulation model, suggesting that atmospheric circulation changes in the North Atlantic due to the presence of ice sheets are an important control in the PMIP3 models' LGM response. These results improve our understanding of the LGM AMOC's driving forces and are relevant for the evaluation of models that are used in the IPCC's Assessment Reports for future climate projections, as well as for the currently ongoing design of the next round of PMIP.",

            "abstract": "Martian carbonates have been observed telescopically, from orbit, in situ and in Martian meteorites; however, a long-postulated geologic reservoir that accounts for proposed thinning of a multi-bar early Mars atmosphere by CO2 sequestration has not yet been identified. One striking aspect of the Martian geologic record is the presence of valley networks and open basin lakes last active around the Noachian/Hesperian boundary, at ca. 3.5 Ga. If surface waters were supported by a thicker atmosphere, hundreds of millibars to bars of CO2 would need to be lost to space during the Hesperian/Amazonian, inconsistent with current atmospheric models. Was this late CO2 sequestered in the Martian crust? We consider the role of diffuse and localized CO2 sequestration and constrain the timing and explore implications for late Noachian atmospheric conditions via examination of the age and composition of the largest contiguous exposure of carbonate-bearing rock on Mars, the Nili Fossae carbonate plains (21.5°N, 78.5°E). Morphological, spectral and thermophysical data sets from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer, Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, Thermal Emission Imaging System, and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment are considered in the context of past atmospheric drawdown.\nWe find the olivine-enriched (~20%–25%) basalts of the Nili Fossae plains have been altered, by low-temperature, in-situ carbonation processes, to at most ~20% Fe-Mg carbonate, thus limiting carbon sequestration in the Nili Fossae region to ~0.25–12 mbar of CO2 during the late Noachian/early Hesperian, before or concurrent with valley network formation. While large compared to modern-day CO2 reservoirs, the lack of additional, comparable-sized post-Late Noachian carbonate-bearing deposits on Mars indicates ineffective carbon sequestration in rock units over the past ~3.7 Ga. This implies a thin atmosphere (≲500 mbar) during valley network formation, extensive post-Noachian atmospheric loss to space or diffuse, and deep sequestration by a yet-to-be understood process. In stark contrast to Earth’s biologically mediated crust:atmosphere carbon reservoir ratio of ~104–105, Mars’ ratio is a mere 10–103, even if buried pre-Noachian crust holds multiple bars.",

The riser drilling operations produced one good conditions borehole even this drilling operation was applied right after 311 Tohoku earthquake. Based on the high-resolutions Formation Micro Imager (FMI) images, both breakout and tensile fractures along the borehole wall indicating the in-situ stress orientation are detected in the unwrapped resistivity images. In this research, a reasonable geomechanical model based on the breakout width and physical properties is constructed to estimate the stress magnitude profile in this borehole. Besides, the openhole leak-off test revealed the information of Shmin magnitude. In general, stress direction along the borehole is slight rotated to east with drilling to the bottom of the borehole. Geomechanical model constarined the principal stresses in Strike-slip stress regime to satisfy the occurrences of borehole enlargements and tensile fractures. Some blank zones with no borehole wall failure and vertical fractures indicated the stress anomaly might be controlled by local lithological facies.

Systematic photo surveys using AUV Sentry were conducted at 4 methane seeps at the Blake Ridge Diapir and a seep at Cape Fear Diapir. Distributions of dominant seep features (bivalves, carbonates, bacterial mats) were used to define the active seep site. Geospatial mapping indicates that non-seep-endemic taxa (those not hosting chemoautotrophic endosymbionts) either avoid (e.g., sea urchins, certain sea cucumbers), are attracted to (e.g., squat lobsters, cake urchins) or show no distributional bias to (e.g., sea stars, certain fish) the presence of a seep.

            "abstract": "Planetary atmospheres are made primarily of molecules, and their optical properties are well known. They scatter sunlight across the spectrum, but far more potently at shorter wavelengths. Consequently, they redden the Sun as it sets and, at the same time, endow the daytime sky with its characteristic blue hue. There are also microscopic atmospheric particulates that are equally omnipresent because small enough (up to ~10s of microns) to remain lofted for long periods of time. However, in contrast with molecules of the major gases, their concentrations are highly variable in space and time. Their optical properties are also far more interesting.\nThese airborne particles are either solid---hence the word \"aerosols\"---or liquid, most notably in the form of cloud droplets. Needless to say that both aerosols and clouds have major impacts on the balance of the Earth's climate system. Harder to understand, but nonetheless true, is that their climate impacts are much harder to assess by Earth system modelers than those of greenhouse gases such as CO$_2$. That makes them prime targets of study by multiple approaches, including ground- and space-based remote sensing.\nTo characterize aerosols and clouds quantitatively by optical remote sensing methods, either passive (sunlight-based) or active (laser-based), we need predictive capability for the signals recorded by sensors, whether ground-based, airborne, or carried by satellites. This in turn draws on the physical theory of \"radiative transfer\" that describes how the light propagates and scatters in the molecular-and-particulate atmosphere. This is a challenge for remote sensing scientists. I will show why by simulating with simple means the point spread function or \"PSF\" of scattering particulate atmospheres with varying opacity, thus covering tabletop analogs of the pristine air, the background aerosol, all the way to optically thick cloudy airmasses.\nI will also show PSF measurements of real clouds over New Mexico and Oklahoma. These were used as a piece of the Multiple Scattering Cloud Lidar (MuSCL) observations from which cloud properties where derived and compared against independent determinations. For the STEM-hungry, I will show how to derive the dependence of the cloud PSF on cloud geometry and opacity.",

Understanding the spatial pattern of these internal catchments is critical, which can provide key information about how supraglacial meltwater is transported and released on the ice surface. This study proposed an automatic approach to detect supraglacial hydrologic features (rivers, lakes, moulins, and internal catchments) located at southwest GrIS from Landsat-8 OLI panchromatic imagery. A total of 800 internal catchments are delineated and the average catchment size (river network length) is found to increase with elevations. In addition, moulins are the prime way to drain internal catchments and the average moulin densities decrease with elevations. Adaptive depression area thresholds are calculated to achieve optimal match between DEM-modeled and image-detected internal catchment patterns. The pattern of these image-detected internal catchments also indicates that: 1) not all the DEM-modeled topographic depressions act as meltwater sinks; 2) moulin distribution greatly impacts the internal catchment patterns; and 3) topographic depressions can be connected downstream without being fully filled, changing the fragmentary of the internal catchments.",

Global simulation modeling has determined that the quasi-trapped electrons are energized in Mercury’s magnetotail via a combination non-adiabatic particle acceleration near magnetic reconnection regions and betatron/Fermi acceleration. Precipitating 1–10 keV electrons cause X-rays to be generated and emitted from the surface, and also can result in the ejection of sodium ions into the magnetosphere through the process of electron-stimulated desorption. Long-term electron precipitation may result in space weathering of the surface regolith.",

            "abstract": "Although Taiwan is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth, two areas on the island are notable for their lack of earthquakes, the coastal plain of central western Taiwan and an elongate area centered on the eastern flank of the southern Central Range. I focus on the latter area and suggest that pre-collision processes may have contributed to its development. Seismogenic strain offshore southeastern Taiwan reveals that the west side of the Luzon arc hosts a forearc sliver that was initially uplifted during basin inversion then tectonically thinned by pull-apart basin formation as collision initiated. This pre-collision history favors the tectonic insertion of a sliver of oceanic crust at depth in the orogenic suture zone. The presence of oceanic crust in this region is consistent with high seismic velocity observations as well as existing analog models. Strain inversions spanning the aseismic zone broadly show crustal thickening and NW-directed shortening to the east, and crustal thinning and SW-directed stretching to the west. Oceanic crust at depth could contribute to the aseismic zone by acting as a relatively strong body sandwiched between the accreted arc and weaker transitional continental crust to the west. In this scenario the aseismic zone is largely composed of forearc rocks that are not internally deforming by elastic deformation mechanisms. Alternatively the sliver may act as a west-pointing wedge (in profile view) that is promoting weaker transitional continental material to detach, imbricate or delaminate in front of the colliding continental promontory (i.e., the Peikang high) that appears to contribute to the low rates of seismicity in western Taiwan. In any of these latter scenarios it would be reasonable to expect changes in crustal architecture that might promote shallowing of the brittle-plastic transition as is observed around the aseismic zone. The specific mechanism for this shallowing remains unresolved and clearly the presence of a forearc sliver in this region should be considered.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of the oil and natural gas production across the United States in recent decade has been associated with significant amounts of methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released to the atmosphere. It is challenging for the existing emission inventories to adequately represent the rapidly evolving oil and natural gas production sector emissions. Hence, their contribution on air quality, especially summertime ozone and particulate matter pollution is not well characterized.\nWe present methane and air quality simulations for summer of 2013 over the continental US by using a coupled meteorology-chemistry model WRF-Chem on 12km resolution grid over the CONUS domain. In the model we used VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission estimates constrained by the in-situ measurements for a number of the shale basins obtained by NOAA’s multiple fields campaigns. Also, a bottom-up emission dataset for the oil/gas sector, based on EPA’s National Emission Inventory 2011 version 2 release was used in this modeling study.\nHere, we discuss the differences in the NOx and VOC emissions for the oil/gas sector in the top-down and bottom-up emission estimates. We modeled the contribution of the oil/gas sector emissions in the US to ozone, several oxidants, PM2.5 mass and composition. For the model evaluations, detailed observations of meteorology, gaseous and aerosol species within several oil/gas producing basins obtained during NOAA sponsored aircraft SENEX-2013 field study were utilized. In addition, continuous ozone and PM2.5 measurements from hundreds of surface stations within the US EPA AQS data archive were used to evaluate the model simulations during summer of 2013.",

            "abstract": "Glacier mass-balance (i.e., accumulation vs. ablation) provides a direct indicator of a glacier’s relationship with climate. However, mass-balance records contain noise due to internal climate variability (i.e., from stochastic fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric circulation), which can obscure or bias trends in these relatively short timeseries. This presents a challenge in correctly identifying the signature of anthropogenic change. “Dynamical adjustment” is a technique that identifies patterns of variance shared between a climate timeseries of interest (e.g., mass-balance) and independent “predictor” variables associated with large-scale circulation (e.g., Sea Level Pressure, SLP, or Sea Surface Temperature, SST). Extracting the component of variance due to internal variability leaves a residual timeseries for which trends can more confidently be attributed to external forcing. We apply dynamical adjustments based on Partial Least Squares Regression to mass-balance records from South Cascade Glacier in Washington State and Wolverine and Gulkana Glaciers in Alaska, independently analyzing seasonal balance records to assess the dynamical influences on winter accumulation and summer ablation. Seasonally averaged North Pacific SLP and SST fields perform comparably as predictor variables, explaining 50-60% of the variance in winter balance and 30-40% of variance in summer balance for South Cascade and Wolverine Glaciers. Gulkana glacier, located further inland than the other two glaciers, is less closely linked to North Pacific climate variability, with the predictors explaining roughly one-third of variance in its winter and summer balance. We analyze the significance of linear trends in the raw and adjusted mass-balance records, and find that for all three glaciers, a) summer balance shows a statistically significant downward trend that is not substantially altered when dynamically induced variability is removed, and b) winter balance shows no statistically significant trends before or after adjustment, though much of the variance is dynamically induced.",

            "abstract": "The possibility that the Moon-Sun gravitational force can affect terrestrial volcanoes and trigger eruptions is a controversial issue that has been proposed since ancient times, and that has been widely debated during the last century. The controversy arises mainly from two reasons. First, the days of initiation of eruptions are not well known for many volcanoes, and thus a robust statistical comparison with tidal cycles cannot be performed for many of them. Second, the stress changes induced by tides in the upper crust are very small (10-3 MPa) compared to the tensile strength of rocks (~ 10-1-10 MPa), and hence the mechanism by which tidal stresses might trigger eruptions is unclear. In this study, we address these issues for persistently degassing volcanoes, as they erupt frequently and thus the initiation time of a significant number of eruptions (>30) is well known in several cases (9). In particular, we find that the occurrence of eruptions within ±2 days from neap tides (first and third quarter moon) is lower than 34% (e.g., 29% for Etna, Italy; 28% for Merapi, Indonesia), which is the value expected if eruptions occur randomly with no external influence. To understand this preference for erupting far away from neap tides, we have developed a new lumped-parameter model that accounts for the deformation of magma reservoirs, a partially open conduit, and a gas layer where bubbles accumulate beneath volcanic craters before being released. We demonstrate that this system reservoir-conduit-gas layer acts as an amplifier of the tidal stresses, such that, when a volcano approaches to a critical state, the gas overpressure beneath the crater can reach up to several MPa more during a spring tide (full and new moon) than during a neap tide. This amplification mechanism can explain why active volcanoes are sensitive to the moon cycles.",

            "abstract": "Routine monitoring stations on the West coast of North America serve to monitor baseline levels of criteria pollutants such as ozone (O3) arriving from the Pacific Ocean. In Canada, the Amphitrite Point Observatory (APO) in Ucluelet on the West coast of Vancouver Island has been added to this network to provide regional baseline measurements. Recently, McKendry and coworkers have reported frequent episodes of nocturnal O3 depletion events (ODEs) at APO (range: 5-20 ppbv) that generally correlate with alongshore winds, elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), and low vertical entrainment but whose cause(s) has (have) remained unclear.\nIn this work, results from the Ozone-depleting reactions in a coastal atmosphere (ORCA) campaign, which took place at APO from July 6 - 31, 2015, are presented. In addition to the long-term measurements that include aerosol size distribution and composition measurements, mixing ratios of speciated monoterpenes (e.g., α- and β-pinene, limonene), molecular halogens (i.e., Cl2, I2), halogen oxides (i.e., OIO), plus a full suite of nitrogen oxides (including N2O5, PAN, PPN, ΣPN, ΣAN, HNO3, HONO, and ClNO2) were quantified. Synoptic conditions at the site varied greatly between nights. During westerly flow of relatively clean marine air, O3 was generally conserved at night, indicating that deposition of O3 to the ocean surface is a minor loss pathway. When the air mass originated from other sectors, episodes of nocturnal ODEs were observed on several occasions, in which mixing ratios of biogenic VOCs were enhanced. These included air masses that originated from densely forested areas to the East, air masses polluted by marine traffic emissions from the southeast, and air masses from the NW that have traveled parallel to the coastline. In this sector, the air was likely in contact with terrestrial vegetation via land-sea breeze circulations. The results suggest that nocturnal ODEs at APO are mainly driven by local or regional processes involving near-shore vegetation.",

            "abstract": ".Stable isotope data from the Tibetan plateau may largely reflect the evolution of air masses sourced from the Pacific Ocean and crossing the eastern plateau margin rather than the Himalayas (Blisniuk and Stern, 2005). We present 30 hydrogen isotope values of leaf wax-derived n-alkanes (δDwax, the abundance-weighted average δD values of C29 and C31 n-alkanes) in surface soils and 23 δD of soil water (δDsw) along the Longmen Shan, eastern Tibetan Plateau (altitude range 780-4200m* above sea level, representing Southeast Asian Monsoon from the Pacific Ocean air mass). Altitude is the predominant factor in determining soil δDwax values, which varied from −160‰ to −223‰ with a lapse rate of −1.8‰/100m (R2= 0.81; n=30). We observed the same correlation for δDsw values with altitude (R2=0.79). These δDwax values were more enriched than the eastern slope of the Gongga Shan transect (−203‰ to −268‰ from 1230 to 4275 m; Bai et al., 2011). Additionally, our εwax/sw values of soil (the isotopic fractionation between the δDwax remain approximately constant at –100‰ (ranging between −99 and –101‰), which demonstrates that the isotopic altitude effects of soil water (precipitation) control the n-alkane δDwax altitudinal gradients for all of the sample localities in the Southern Himalaya (SH) and the southern TP (Bai et al., 2015). Additionally, there is a difference in εwax-rw with the increasing elevation, and which are smaller at low elevation (with εwax/rw of −107‰, average d=4.4) than those at high elevation (with larger εwax/rw of −137‰, average d=–0.3). Hence, it is likely that river water may not represent the actual source water on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, especially above ~3 km, and it is cautious when establish the modern isotope-elevation relationship using river water for any future paleoenvironmental and paleoelevation reconstructions.",

We determined ambient fluid pressures 8-10% above hydrostatic and a geothermal gradient of 130-150 °C/km in rocks above the fault. These unusual ambient conditions can be explained by a combination of: rock advection that transports heat from depth by uplift and oblique slip on the fault; and fluid advection through fractured rock, driven by topographic forcing, which concentrates heat and causes fluid over-pressure in the valley. Highly-anomalous ambient conditions can exist in the vicinity of active faults, and earthquake and mineralization processes occur within these zones.",

            "abstract": "We investigate CFMIP-2 AMIP and AMIP+4K experiments with ten climate models which have had their convective parametrizations turned off. Previous studies have suggested that parameterized convection may be a leading source of inter-model spread in cloud feedbacks and other aspects. We find that model biases in ‘ConvOff’ runs (those with the convective schemes switched off), for example in tropical lapse rate and relative humidity, are generally smaller than intermodel differences in these fields, in spite of the fact that these fields are widely thought to be controlled by convective processes. This suggests that, to a considerable extent, explicitly resolved convection is able to do most of the overall job of convection in modern climate models at least with respect to phenomena at large scales.\nWe find moreover that ‘ConvOff’ models have a similar overall range of cloud feedbacks compared to the standard configurations. Furthermore, applying a simple bias correction method to allow for differences in present day global cloud radiative effects substantially reduces the differences between the cloud feedbacks with and without parametrized convection in the individual models. We conclude that, while parametrized convection influences the strength of the cloud feedbacks substantially in some models, other processes must also contribute substantially to the overall inter-model spread.\nThe positive shortwave cloud feedbacks seen in the models in subtropical regimes associated with shallow clouds are still present in the ConvOff experiments. Inter-model spread in shortwave cloud feedback increases slightly in regimes associated with trade cumulus in the ConvOff experiments but is quite similar in the most stable sub-tropical regimes associated with stratocumulus clouds. Inter-model spread in longwave cloud feedbacks in strongly precipitating regions of the tropics is substantially reduced in the ConvOff experiments however, indicating a considerable local contribution from differences in the details of convective parametrizations.",

            "abstract": "We attempt to achieve the accuracy of full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method, as implemented in the WIEN2k code, at the favorable computational efﬁciency of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method for ab initio calculations of solids. For decades, PAW datasets have been generated by manually choosing its parameters and by visually inspecting its logarithmic derivatives, partial wave, and projector basis set. In addition to being tedious and error-prone, this procedure is inadequate because it is impractical to manually explore the full parameter space, as an infinite number of PAW parameter sets for a given augmentation radius can be generated maintaining all the constraints on logarithmic derivatives and basis sets. Performance verification of all plausible solutions against FLAPW is also impractical. Here we report the development of a hybrid algorithm to construct optimized PAW basis sets that can closely reproduce FLAPW results from zero to ultra-high pressures. The approach applies evolutionary computing (EC) to generate optimum PAW parameter sets using the ATOMPAW code. We have the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to generate equation of state (EOS) to be compared with WIEN2k EOSs set as target. Softer PAW potentials reproducing yet more closely FLAPW EOSs can be found with this method. We demonstrate its working principles and workability by optimizing PAW basis functions for carbon, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, and iron atoms. The algorithm requires minimal user intervention in a sense that there is no requirement of visual inspection of logarithmic derivatives or of projector functions.",

            "abstract": "The past decade of Martian orbital and surface exploration has made it clear that the planet could have supported life as we know it in many places throughout much of it’s history. The next step in exploration will be to find the evidence for and characterize any preserved Martian life. The jump from confirming habitability to finding life will be difficult and likely require a systemic surface exploration of multiple, specific sites. One site, the sinter mounds of the Nili Patera caldera, provides the ideal combination of hot, neutral to alkaline waters that can develop or support life and the sinter precipitation to preserve it. Nili Patera also provides deposits that are well mapped from orbit allowing a mission to pinpoint the target rocks.\nWith this target known, we can develop the mission, the payload and the science to fit the goals. Several sinter field sites in Iceland were selected for mission testing. They were selected to provide diversity in scale, chemistry and complexity. At each site, we asked the same questions that would drive a mission to Mars. Was there life? What are its preserved properties? What are the environmental history of the sinters and the volcanic history of the local terrain? These questions were investigated with spectral, compositional and morphological analysis. By investigating these questions in Iceland, we will determine which observations, in terms of terrain access and instrument selection are required for mission success on Mars.\nWe report the results from the August 2015 expedition, the first of two planned field seasons. This summer was focused on finalizing the field locations, acquiring mapping data and an initial sampling campaign to determine expected composition and calibrate instruments for year two. With this information, we will determine an investigation plan consistent with a range of mission types from robotic lander to sample return to human exploration. We will also determine the instruments required by the site diversity. By the end of the project we should know what mission types can provide the required results. Which instruments are required for basic mission success and the cost benefit of additional analysis and what basic science questions must be investigated before sending a focused mission to determine the past existence of life in the Nili Patera sinter mounds.",

            "abstract": "The seasonality of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the northern hemisphere (NH) has increased by up to 50% over the previous five decades. A significant portion of this increase may be explained by enhanced agricultural productivity. The impact that increased crop production has on CO­­2 seasonality is dependent on the fraction of the crop Gross Primary Product (GPP) that occurs during the natural carbon uptake period (CUP). Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF), an artifact of photosynthesis, can be used to assess GPP directly via remote sensing. New methods for measuring SIF from space provide tools for obtaining GPP data at regional and global levels. We use SIF data from the GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites to obtain observational estimates of the fraction of GPP occurring within the CUP in NH agricultural regions. We compare these fractions with estimates made using crop calendars and inventories and, where available, with CO2 flux data from eddy covariance towers. Our results offer insight into the impact that increased agricultural productivity has on the seasonal amplitude of NH CO2 concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Variations in the bimodality/monomodality of CCN spectra (Hudson et al. 2015) exert opposite effects on cloud microphysics in two aircraft field projects. The figure shows two examples, droplet concentration, Nc, and drizzle liquid water content, Ld, against classification of CCN spectral modality. Low ratings go to balanced separated bimodal spectra, high ratings go to single mode spectra, strictly monomodal 8. Intermediate ratings go merged modes, e.g., one mode a shoulder of another. Bimodality is caused by mass or hygroscopicity increases that go only to CCN that made activated cloud droplets. In the Ice in Clouds Experiment-Tropical (ICE-T) small cumuli with lower Nc, greater droplet mean diameters, MD, effective radii, re, spectral widths, σ, cloud liquid water contents, Lc, and Ld were closer to more bimodal (lower modal ratings) below cloud CCN spectra whereas clouds with higher Nc, smaller MD, re, σ, and Ld were closer to more monomodal CCN (higher modal ratings). In polluted stratus clouds of the MArine Stratus/Stratocumulus Experiment (MASE) clouds that had greater Nc, and smaller MD, re, σ, Lc, and Ld were closer to more bimodal CCN spectra whereas clouds with lower Nc, and greater MD, re, σ, Lc, and Ld were closer to more monomodal CCN. These relationships are opposite because the dominant ICE-T cloud processing was coalescence whereas chemical transformations (e.g., SO2 to SO4) were dominant in MASE. Coalescence reduces Nc and thus also CCN concentrations (NCCN) when droplets evaporate. In subsequent clouds the reduced competition increases MD and σ, which further enhance coalescence and drizzle. Chemical transformations do not change Nc but added sulfate enhances droplet and CCN solubility. Thus, lower critical supersaturation (S) CCN can produce more cloud droplets in subsequent cloud cycles, especially for the low W and effective S of stratus. The increased competition reduces MD, re, and σ, which inhibit coalescence and thus reduce drizzle. These observations are consistent with cloud droplet growth models for the higher vertical wind (W) of cumuli and lower W of stratus. Coalescence thus reduces the indirect aerosol effect (IAE) whereas chemical cloud processing enhances both aspects of IAE; 1st IAE by greater Nc, 2ndIAE by suppression of drizzle.\nHudson, Noble and Tabor: JGRA, 120.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake locations are a fundamental parameter necessary for reliable seismic monitoring and seismic event characterization. Within dense continental seismic networks, event locations can be accurately and precisely estimated. However, for many regions of interest, existing catalog data and traditional location methods provide neither accurate nor precise hypocenters. In particular, for isolated continental and offshore areas, seismic event locations are estimated primarily using distant observations, often resulting in inaccurate and imprecise locations. The use of larger, moderate-size events is critical to the construction of useful travel-time corrections in regions of strong geologic heterogeneity. Double difference methods applied to cross-correlation measured Rayleigh and Love wave time shifts are an effective tool at providing improved epicentroid locations and relative origin-time shifts in these regions. Previous studies have applied correlation of R1 and G1 waveforms to moderate-magnitude vertical strike-slip transform-fault and normal faulting earthquakes from nearby ridges. In this study, we explore the utility of phase-match filtering techniques applied to surface waves to improve cross-correlation measurements, particularly for smaller magnitude seismic events. We also investigate the challenges associated with applying surface-wave location methods to shallow earthquakes in tectonically active continental regions.",

MIGHTI consists of two identical units positioned to observe the Earth’s low latitude thermosphere from perpendicular viewing directions. The MIGHTI instrument is a spatial heterodyne spectrometer and requires a low noise, high QE, large format camera system to detect slight phase changes in the fringe patterns which reveal the neutral wind velocity.\n The MIGHTI camera system uses a single control electronics box to operate two identical CCD camera heads and communicate with the ICON payload electronics. The control electronics are carefully designed for a low noise implementation of CCD biases, clocking, and CCD output digitization. The camera heads consist of a 2k by 2K, back-illuminated, frame transfer CCD provided by e2v. The CCD’s are both TEC cooled and have butcher-block filters mounted in close proximity of the active area. The CCDs are nominally operated in binned mode, the control electronics register settings provide flexibility for binning and gain control. An engineering model of the camera system has been assembled and tested. The EM camera system characterization meets all performance requirements. Performance highlights include a measured read noise of 5.7 electrons and dark current of 0.01 electronics/pixel/second. The camera system design and characterization results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We present here a first step toward a model of the seismic velocity structure through stochastic full waveform tomography of East Asia. Such inversion typically requires exploring thousands of variations of each parameter that is inverted to ensure reliable probabilistic inferences. Here we explore regionalization in order to reduce the dimension of the parameter space and identify regions with similar seismic characteristics that can be treated as a common block in the subsequent stochastic inversion. We follow the approach of Lekic and Romanowicz (2011) in which regionalization is performed through a cluster analysis of tomographic velocity models. Our analysis is based on teleseismic P-wave Receiver Functions (RFTNs) instead. We apply a K-means algorithm minimizing a distance metrics defined in the vector space of RFTNs. Different metrics have been tested to optimize the clustering. Coherence and association with known tectonic and physiographic features and/or established geophysical information is also tested.\nWe first validate our clustering analysis with two different receiver functions datasets from USArray stations. A first set was built by stacking EARS receiver functions for each available station across all azimuths and with a Gaussian filter width of 2.5 Hz and small ray parameters (0.038 to 0.05 s/km). The second dataset was built by interpolation of the receiver function wavefield (Chai et al, 2015). The agreement with geological and tectonic regions of western US is better for the latter dataset.\nOur future inversion region is East Asia where remarkable instrumentation efforts open the door to high-resolution tomography studies at the continental scale. Our collaborators provided teleseismic P-wave receiver functions for 785 stations. Clustering results show agreement with known tectonic features of the area, and we will show our attempts of regionalization based on this information.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade there has been a remarkable growth in interest concerning the effects of anthropogenic emissions on extreme weather. However, research has been constrained by the lack of a public climate-model-based data product optimised for investigation of extreme weather in the context of climate change, relying instead on products designed for other purposes or on bespoke simulations designed for the particular study and not generally applicable to other extremes. The international Climate of the 20th Century Plus (C20C+) Detection and Attribution Project is filling this gap by producing the first large ensemble, multi-model, multi-year, and multi-scenario historical climate data product, specifically designed for resolving variations in the occurrence and characteristics of extreme weather from year to year and their differences from what might have been in the absence of anthropogenic emissions. Updates on project status and tens of terabytes of simulation output are available at http://portal.nersc.gov/c20c.\nHere we describe the experimental design of the first phase of the project, conducted with six atmospheric climate models, and discuss its various strengths and weaknesses with respect to various types of extreme weather. We also present analyses of the relative importance of climate model, estimate of anthropogenic ocean warming, spatial and temporal scale, and aspects of experimental design on estimates of how much emissions have affected extreme weather.",

            "abstract": "Newberry Volcano (NV) located E. of the Cascades arc axis is often interpreted as (1) a High Lava Plains (NW Basin & Range -- B&R) volcano hosting rhyolites generated by a traveling plume, (2) a shield volcano built of basalt, or (3) an enigma unrelated to the adjacent High Cascades. Recent work shows that these interpretations are incorrect. Petrologic, geochemical, isotopic, drill hole, & seismic data indicate that the NV magma system results from arc-related processes at the NW corner of the B&R, where this major extensional province impinges on the Cascades arc. NV rhyolites are geochemically distinct and lower in SiO2 than those to the east where a general NW-younging trend of rhyolite ages has suggested a traveling hotspot -- a consequence instead of propagation of B&R extension. NV lies ~90 km above the downgoing slab based on seismic evidence (McCrory et al. 2012), ~15 km deeper than under the Three Sisters (TS) volcanic complex 60 km to the NW on the arc axis. NV & TS exhibit a range of compositions and both have generated rhyodacite with unusually high Na2O contents (~7 wt. %; Mandler et al. 2014), exhibiting similar petrogenetic processes. Silicic lavas and tuffs of the caldera-centric NV make up a significant component (~20% of drill core) of its 600 km3, although basaltic andesite is the dominant composition. Basalts of calcalkaline affinity erupted on the edifice as recently as early Holocene time. These basalts contain petrologic evidence for high pre-eruptive H2O contents, have strong arc-like trace element signatures, and are isotopically Cascadian and distinct from basalts to the east in the B&R that have much higher 3/4He (Graham et al. 2009). NV is one variety of Cascades arc volcano among which are a range of stratovolcanoes including Mt. Baker (15 km3) and Mt. Shasta (500 km3), a Holocene caldera (Crater Lake), and the many basaltic andesite shield volcanoes that make up most of the Oregon High Cascades.",

We incorporate crustal thickness perturbations as model parameters in the inversions to properly consider crustal effects and suppress the leakage of crustal structure into mantle structure. This is possible since we utilize short-period group velocity data with a period range down to 16 s, which are strongly sensitive to the crust. The isotropic S-velocity model shares common features with previous global S-velocity models and shows excellent consistency with several high-resolution upper mantle models. Our anisotropic model also agrees well with previous regional studies. Nevertheless, our new model of 3-D radial anisotropy shows some features not seen in previous whole-mantle models, such as faster SV velocity anomalies along subduction zones at transition zone depths and faster SH velocity beneath slabs in the lower mantle. The derived crustal thickness perturbations also bring potentially important information about the crustal thickness beneath oceanic crusts, which has been difficult to constrain due to poor access compared with continental crusts. We interpret our results in terms of mineralogy and geodynamical processes in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes a monthly 2.5-by-2.5 lat-lon Tibetan Plateau (TP) region’s precipitation data product since January 1901, reconstructed by a multivariate regression method using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) expansion. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation data from 1981-2010 are used to calculate the EOFs. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) gridded data are used to calculate the regression coefficients for reconstructions. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are analyzed in detail for different number of EOF modes used in the reconstruction. The spatial average time series of the reconstructed TP precipitation from 1910-2001 has a small positive trend: 0.006 (mm/day)/100a. This positive trend is consistent with other studies based on the observed data from 71 TP stations from 1961-2001, in contrast to the negative trends in the reanalysis data from 1961-2001 from both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-40).\nThe validation of our reconstruction data with GPCP from 1979-present makes it reliable to use this reconstruction dataset as the benchmark data for TP precipitation models. Our reconstructed TP precipitation for over 100 years will help the climate modeling community to improve TP precipitation mechanisms, reduce the systematic difference between the data from observations and climate models, and analyze the interdecadal variations of the TP climate.\nOur TP precipitation product is publically available online, including digital data, precipitation animations, computer codes, readme files, and the user manual.

            "abstract": "Organic chlorinated solvents, such as perchloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), are toxic pollutants threatening ground water quality worldwide and present at many superfund sites. Bioremediation using microorganisms is a promising, green, efficient, and sustainable approach to remove PCE and TCE contamination from soil and groundwater. Under anaerobic conditions, specialized microorganisms (dechlorinators) can reduce these chlorinated ethenes to ethene, an innocuous product, and gain energy for growth by a process known as reductive dechlorination. Dechlorinators are most often present in the environment and in dechlorinating cultures alongside other microbes such as fermenters, methanogens, and acetogens. Fermenters, methanogens, and acetogens syntrophically provide essential nutrients and growth factors to dechlorinators, most specifically to the only members able to reduce TCE all the way to ethene: Dehalococcoides; unfortunately, they also compete with dechlorinators for electron donors. My laboratory devises reductive chlorination platforms to study competition and syntrophy among Dehalococcoides, and other microbes to optimize remediation reactions and transport in the subsurface. We look at competing processes present as part of the natural soil chemistry and microbiology and address these challenges through a combination of enrichment techniques, molecular microbial ecology (deep sequencing), water chemistry, and electron balances. We have applied knowledge gathered in my laboratory to: 1) enrich microbial dechlorinating cultures capable of some of the fastest rates of TCE to ethene dechlorination ever reported, and 2) successfully design and operate three different continuous dechlorinating reactor types. We attribute our successful reactor operations to our multidisciplinary approach which links microbiology and engineering. Our reactors produce robust dechlorinating cultures used for in-situ bioaugmentation of PCE and TCE at contaminated sites. The results gathered to date provide a fundamental understanding of the role of homoacetogens and methanogens in electron and carbon flow in dechlorinating consortia.",

            "abstract": "While SAR data have proven valuable for a wide range of geophysical research questions, so far, largely only the SAR-educated science communities have been able to fully exploit the information content of internationally available SAR archives. The main issues that have been preventing a more widespread utilization of SAR are related to (1) the diversity and complexity of SAR data formats, (2) the complexity of the processing flows needed to extract geophysical information from SAR, (3) the lack of standardization and automation of these processing flows, and (4) the often ignored geocoding procedures, leaving the data in image coordinate space.\nIn order to improve upon this situation, ASF’s radiometric terrain-correction (RTC) project is generating uniformly formatted and easily accessible value-added products from the ASF Distributed Active Archive Center’s (DAAC) five-year archive of JAXA’s ALOS PALSAR sensor. Specifically, the project applies geometric and radiometric corrections to SAR data to allow for an easy and direct combination of obliquely acquired SAR data with remote sensing imagery acquired in nadir observation geometries. Finally, the value-added data is provided to the user in the broadly accepted Geotiff format, in order to support the easy integration of SAR data into GIS environments. The goal of ASF’s RTC project is to make SAR data more accessible and more attractive to the broader SAR applications community, especially to those users that currently have limited SAR expertise. Production of RTC products commenced October 2014 and will conclude late in 2015. As of July 2015, processing of 71% of ASF’s ALOS PALSAR archive was completed. Adding to the utility of this dataset are recent changes to the data access policy that allow the full-resolution RTC products to be provided to the public, without restriction.\nIn this paper we will introduce the processing flow that was developed for the RTC project and summarize the calibration and validation procedures that were implemented to determine and monitor system performance. The paper will also show the current progress of RTC processing, provide examples of generated data sets, and demonstrate the benefit of the RTC archives for applications such as land-use classification and change detection.",

They can be driven by Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) and Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs). They play an active role in the acceleration of ions to suprathermal energies. Shock fronts evolve as they move from the Sun. Their surfaces can be far from uniform and be modulated by changes in the solar wind (magnetic field orientation, flow velocity), and perturbations upstream and downstream from the shocks, i.e., electromagnetic waves. In this work we use multispacecraft data (STEREO, WIND, ACE) to study shock characteristics at different helio-longitudes and determine the properties of the waves near them. We also determine shock longitudinal extensions and foreshock sizes. The variations of geometry along the shock surface can result in different extensions of the wave and ion foreshocks ahead of the shocks, and in different wave modes upstream and downtream of the shocks. Thus, the region with modified solar wind ahead of the shocks can be very asymmetric.",

Furthermore, we find that the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA) Interim product better agrees with the in situ data over Greenland and Antarctica. Relative to ERA, biases in atmospheric pressure mask additional trends over both ice sheets and a significant acceleration in mass loss over Antarctica.

            "abstract": "In the absence of direct turbulence measurements, the turbulence characteristics of the atmospheric surface layer are often derived from measurements of the surface layer mean properties based on Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST). This approach requires two levels of the ensemble mean wind, temperature, and water vapor, from which the fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, and water vapor can be obtained. When only one measurement level is available, the roughness heights and the assumed properties of the corresponding variables at the respective roughness heights are used. In practice, the temporal mean with large number of samples are used in place of the ensemble mean. However, in many situations the samples of data are taken from multiple levels. It is thus desirable to derive the boundary layer flux properties using all measurements.\nIn this study, we used an optimal estimation approach to derive surface layer properties based on all available measurements. This approach assumes that the samples are taken from a population whose ensemble mean profile follows the MOST. An optimized estimate is obtained when the results yield a minimum cost function defined as a weighted summation of all error variance at each sample altitude. The weights are based one sample data variance and the altitude of the measurements. This method was applied to measurements in the marine atmospheric surface layer from a small boat using radiosonde on a tethered balloon where temperature and relative humidity profiles in the lowest 50 m were made repeatedly in about 30 minutes. We will present the resultant fluxes and the derived MOST mean profiles using different sets of measurements. The advantage of this method over the ‘traditional’ methods will be illustrated. Some limitations of this optimization method will also be discussed. Its application to quantify the effects of marine surface layer environment on radar and communication signal propagation will be shown as well.",

The BAO, located 35 km north of Denver and on the southwestern side of the Denver-Julesburg Basin, affords the opportunity to sample a wide variety of air masses, including those impacted by emissions from oil and gas development, agriculture, and the urban Denver plume.\nHere we present an analysis of PAN measurements during FRAPPÉ. The PPN/PAN ratio observed (~20%) at BAO during FRAPPÉ is indicative of chemistry dominated by anthropogenic VOCs. We used the relationships between PAN, PPN, and MPAN to estimate the contribution of isoprene chemistry to local O3 production. We found that the estimated contribution of isoprene chemistry to O3 is less than 5 ppbv. We also investigated the meteorological conditions leading to the most extreme PAN abundances. We found that Denver Cyclones, mesoscale conditions that allow for potential recirculation of pollutants, were present on three out of the four days with PAN mixing ratios much greater than 1 ppbv. We plan to continue exploring specific days characterized by measurements of elevated PAN and O3 with a photochemical box model to attempt to understand the mix of VOC chemistry responsible for the extremely consistent observed PPN/PAN ratio.",

            "abstract": "Mid- and upper- tropospheric NOx (NO + NO2) is a trace gas important in atmospheric radiative forcing through its regulation of ozone concentrations. Changes in NOx and ozone result in indirect effects on other greenhouse gases such as methane. Lightning is the dominant source of NOx in the free troposphere, and most estimates of the concentration of lightning NOx (LNOx) require knowledge of the amount of this species produced per lightning flash. We present the largest spatial- and temporal-scale investigation of LNOx to date that combines satellite-based NOx estimates and lightning flash data. The data comprise five northern-hemisphere (NH) summers, including much of the mid-latitude regions in North America and Asia and adjacent waters. NO2 measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), selected from cloudy areas, are converted to LNOx and compared with flashes preceding OMI overpass by 1 – 4 hours. The flash counts are derived from ground-based World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data that are adjusted for detection efficiency by comparing them with Optical Transient Detector and Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite data. We find reasonable correlation between the number of lightning flashes and the amount of LNOx produced and estimate mean efficiencies for the production of LNOx in various NH regions. Overall results indicate mole/flash values near the low end of those reported in previous LNOx studies, as well as a possible dependence of production efficiency on flash rate. These findings have potential implications for upper tropospheric trace gases and the global NOx budget.",

A periodic pressure signal is generated by pumping and injecting water into the aquifer consecutively and the pressure response is recorded at many points around the source. We present and analyze the data from the field test after applying Fourier analysis. We then match the data with a recently derived analytical solution for homogeneous formations to estimate the equivalent aquifer properties: conductivity K, specific storage Ss and specific yield Sy. The estimated values are shown to be in agreement with previous estimates conducted at this site.\nWe observe variations in the estimated parameters with different oscillation periods of pumping. The trend of the parameters with changing period is discussed and compared to predictions by existing theory and laboratory experiments dealing with dynamic effective properties. It is shown that the results are qualitatively consistent with recent works on effective properties of formations of spatially variable properties in oscillatory flow. To grasp the impact of heterogeneity, a simple configuration is proposed, helping explain the observed increase in effective conductivity with decreasing period.",

            "abstract": "Ice-penetrating radar and GPS observations are used to reveal a perennial firn aquifer (PFA) on a high icefield in Svalbard. This PFA appears to be fully analogous to those found in Greenland. A bright, widespread radar reflector separates relatively dry and water-saturated firn. This surface, the phreatic firn water table, is deeper beneath local surface elevation maxima, shallower in surface lows, and steeper where the surface is steep. The PFA is recharged by downward percolation of near-surface meltwater, and drained by flow subparallel to ice flow and the glacier surface. The water table of the PFA rises with increasing meltwater supply during summer, especially during warm years, and drops during winter. The reflector cross-cuts snow stratigraphy; we use the apparent deflection of accumulation layers due to the higher dielectric permittivity below the water table to infer that the firn pore space becomes progressively more saturated as depth increases. Radar data collected over several years indicate that the PFA responds rapidly (sub-annually) to the surface melt forcing. We use a coupled surface energy-balance and firn model, forced with from regional climate model data for the years 1961-2012, to estimate the amount of retained surface melt available to recharge the PFA. Results suggest that the water amount flowing into and out of the PFA is substantial, such that the PFA is capable of providing significant input to the englacial hydrology system.",

            "abstract": "Temperate, broadleaved evergreen woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus species are adapted to a wide range of moisture conditions. However, these ecosystems can be susceptible to extremes of environmental stress, including droughts and heat waves. We evaluated climatic drivers of carbon and water exchange using eddy covariance techniques for over two years in a dry sclerophyll woodland near Sydney, Australia. We found that the strongest net C uptake by this ecosystem occurred during the winter months (June through August), and that precipitation and minimum air temperature were the most important environmental drivers of net uptake. Ecosystem respiration was highest during summer as soil drought was alleviated by frequent thunderstorm events, and lowest during winter due to drier soil and cooler temperatures. Gross primary production was independent of surface soil moisture but was constrained by high VPD during summer. Highest water and light use efficiencies for GPP were observed during winter. This study demonstrates the importance of strong stomatal regulation of dry Eucalyptus woodlands in limiting summer uptake, and warm-season rain in enhancing soil organic matter decomposition, leading to net C losses during summer. The temporal patterns of CO2 fluxes in this mild temperate forest are unusual in comparison to other temperate forests. By persisting through unfavourable conditions and growing in response to favourable conditions during any season, the phenology of C dynamics in temperate sclerophyll woodlands can resemble that of drier ecosystems. The climatic drivers of net C uptake by these woodlands should be considered for evaluating vulnerability to extreme climate events that might limit their productivity as well as ecosystem C storage.",

In this study 89 precipitation samples were collected at Lhasa, the largest city of southern Tibet, from March to December 2013. The average concentration and wet deposition fluxes of DOC was 1.10 mg C/L and 0.62 g C m-2.yr-1, respectively. Seasonally, low DOC concentration and high flux appeared during monsoon period, which were in line with heavy precipitation amount, reflecting dilution effect of precipitation for the DOC. Compared to other regions, the values of Lhasa were lower than those of large cites (e.g. Beijing and Seoul) mainly because of less air pollution of Lhasa. The relationship between DOC and ion analysis showed that DOC of Lhasa was derived mainly from the natural sources, followed by burning activities. Furthermore, △14C value of DOC indicated that fossil combustion contributed around 20% of the precipitation DOC of Lhasa, indicating that the atmosphere of Lhasa has been influenced by vehicle emissions. Therefore, although atmosphere of Lhasa is relatively clean, pollutants emitted from local sources cannot be ignored.",

            "abstract": "Fires from biomass burning are responsible for emitting large quantities of trace gases (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO)) and particulate matter, which are of great importance for air quality, climate forcing and biogeochemical cycles. On average wildfires emit about 290 Tg CO2 per year in the United States, equivalent to 4-6% of annual anthropogenic emissions. Characterization of wildfire emissions is crucial for understanding the atmospheric trace gas budget and variability, and the quality of these characterizations depends on accurate gas concentration measurements associated with fuel type, meteorological conditions and fire combustion phase. The 2013 Yosemite Rim Fire was sampled by the NASA Ames Alpha Jet Atmopsheric eXperiment (AJAX) during two fire burning stages: intensive burning phase on August 29 and smoldering phase on September 10. The AJAX trace gas measurements (CO2, CH4 and ozone (O3)) provide a unique opportunity to conduct an inverse analysis of the fire emissions of key trace gases and linkage with the dynamic nature of wildfires. This study proposes to use a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian atmospheric transport model, WRF-STILT, along with estimates of fossil fuel emissions and atmospheric CO2 background, and the latest wildfire emission inventories, to determine the contribution of the Rim Fire to atmospheric CO2. WRF-STILT is used to establish the source-receptor relationship of CO2 under different model configurations in order to bracket the transport model uncertainty. Observationally constrained CO2 emission rates will be obtained by improving the model fit to flight measurements, and the associated uncertainties with a priori and model errors will be evaluated. The model/measurement data setup and initial results of this study will be presented.",

The conventional stochastic collocation method serves as a promising non-intrusive approach and has drawn a great deal of interests. The collocation points are usually chosen to be Gauss-Hermite quadrature nodes, which are naturally unnested. The Kronrod-Patterson-Hermite nodes are shown to be more efficient than the Gauss-Hermite nodes due to nestedness.

            "abstract": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics, according to Clausius, states that entropy will always increase in the universe, meaning systems will break down and become simple and chaotic. However, this is seemingly contradicted by the existence of living organisms, which can have highly complex and organized systems. Furthermore, there is a greater contradiction in the theory of evolution, which sees organisms growing larger and becoming more complex over time. Our research project revolved around whether organisms actually became more complex over time, and correlating these findings with the body size of these organisms.\nWe analyzed the relationship between body size and cell types of five different marine phyla: arthropods, brachiopods, chordates, echinoderms, and mollusks. We attempted to find a relation between the biovolume of these different phyla and the number of specialized cell types that they had, which is a common measure of biocomplexity. In addition, we looked at the metabolic intensity, which is the mass-specific rate of energy processing applied to an organism’s size, because it is also correlated to genetic complexity. Using R programming, we tested for correlations between these factors.\nAfter applying a Pearson correlation test, we discovered a generally positive correlation between the body sizes, number of cell types, and metabolic intensities of these phyla. However, one exception is that there is a negative correlation between the body size and metabolic intensity of echinoderms. Overall, we can see that marine organisms tend to evolve larger and more complex over time, and that is a very interesting find. Our discovery yielded many research questions and problems that we would like to solve, such as how the environment is thermodynamically affected by these organisms.",

            "abstract": "Constraining water ice rheology is crucial for geodynamic modelling of terrestrial ice masses and to understand the mechanics of icy planets in the outer solar system. Creep experiments on homogenous laboratory-grown ice have been conducted for decades with the goal to link specific stress and temperature conditions to creep (strain) rates, which are governed by the operating microstructural deformation mechanism. As most of these experiments have been conducted under constant strain rate conditions and in the absence of a time-effective method to image fine-grained ice, the response of an ice microstructure to a constant stress experiment is fairly unknown. In this study, 25 mm diameter cylinders of polycrystalline ice with a starting average grain diameter of 400 µm were subjected to a confining pressure of 50 MPa and axial loads between 3 and 13 MPa at a temperature of 240 K. The samples were subsequently imaged with cryogenic electron backscatter diffraction (cryo-EBSD). Over the entire range of these tests, constantly accelerating strain rates were observed, which represent a significant rheological weakening. Microstructural maps of the deformed ice samples show stress localizations that are characterized by excessive kinking, leading to a “crushed” appearance of pre-existing grains. The localized kinking can produce grain diameters as small as 30 µm and yields a local grain size reduction that could provide an explanation for the rheological weakening, as observed in the accelerating strain rates. A detailed microstructural analysis aims to investigate the mechanism of kinking in these stress localizations with a microstructural misorientation analysis comprising both pre-existing and kinked grains. Grain size data collected from within the high-stress regions will be compared to pre-existing rheological data to assess if the localized grain size reduction could in fact result in the observed accelerations in strain rate.\n   ",

            "abstract": "Sinuous lava channels are a characteristic feature observed on the Moon. Their formation is assumed to be due to a combination of mechanical and thermal erosion of the lava into the substrate during emplacement as surface channels, or due to collapsed subsurface lava tubes after the lava has evacuated. The viscosity (η) of the lava plays an important role, because it controls the volume flux of the emplaced lava that governs the mechanical and thermal erosion potential of the lava flow. Thermal properties, such as heat capacity (Cp) and latent heat of crystallization (ΔHcryst) are important parameters in order for the substrate to melt and causing thermal buffering during crystallization of the flowing lava.\nWe experimentally studied the rheological evolution of analog lavas representing the KREEP terrain and high-Ti mare basalts during cooling and crystallization. We find that the two lavas behave very differently. High-Ti mare lava begins to crystallize around 1300 ºC with a viscosity of 8.6±0.6 Pa s and crystal content around 2 vol%. On cooling to 1169 ºC, the effective viscosity of the crystal-melt suspension is increased to only 538±33 Pa s (at a strain rate of 1 s-1) due to crystallization of 14±1 vol% blocky magnetite and acicular ulvöspinel-rich magnetite. The flow behavior of these suspensions depends on the strain rate, where flow curves below strain rates of 10 s-1show shear-thinning character, but resemble Bingham behavior at greater strain rates.\nIn contrast, the KREEP lava crystallizes rapidly over a narrow temperature interval of ~ 30 degrees. The first crystals detected were ulvospinel-rich magnetites at 1204 ºC with ~2 vol% and a viscosity of 90±2 Pa s. On cooling to 1178 ºC, anorthite and enstatite appears, so that the crystal-melt suspension has become strongly pseudoplastic at a crystal content of 22±2 vol% with a flow index (n) of 0.63 and an effective viscosity of 1600±222 Pa s at a strain rate of 1 s-1.\nWe are currently measuring the heat capacity of crystal-bearing glasses (representing erodible solid substrate) and the heat released during lava crystallization at different cooling rates measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The rheological and thermal properties will then be integrated into thermo-mechanical models of rille formation in non-Newtonian lavas on the lunar surface.",

            "abstract": "Intercropping bioenergy grasses within traditional pine silvicultural systems provides an opportunity for economic diversification and regional bioenergy production in a way that complements existing land use systems. Bioenergy intercropping in pine plantations does not compete with food production for land and it is thought will increase ecosystem resource-use efficiencies. As the frequency and intensity of drought is expected to increase with the changing climate, maximizing water use-efficiency of intercropped bioenergy systems will become increasingly important for long-term economic and environmental sustainability.\nThe presented study is focused on evapotranspiration (ET) of an experimental pine-switchgrass intercropping system in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina. We measured ET of two pure switchgrass fields, two pure pine stands and two pine-switchgrass intercropping systems using combined surface renewal (SR) and energy balance (EB) method throughout 2015. SR is based on high-frequency measurement of air temperature at or above canopy. As previously demonstrated, temperature time series are associated with identifiable, repeated patterns called “turbulent coherent structures”. These coherent structures are considered to be responsible for most of the turbulent transport. Statistical analysis of the coherent structures in temperature time series allows quantification of sensible heat flux density (H) from the investigated area. Information about H can be combined with measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux density to indirectly obtain ET estimates as a residual of the energy balance equation.\nDespite the recent progress in the SR method, there is no standard methodology and each method available includes assumptions which require more research. To validate our SR estimates of ET, we used an eddy covariance (EC) system placed temporarily next to the each SR station as a comparative measurement of H.\nThe conference contribution will include: i) evaluation of SR method compared to EC; ii) comparison of different SR calculation procedures including application of various thermocouples sizes and measurement heights; iii) quantification of ET of the three investigated ecosystems; iv) analysis of ET diurnal and seasonal variation with respect to weather conditions.",

Ambient fluid pressures in DFDP-2B at Whataroa River were 8-10% above hydrostatic and a geothermal gradient of >130°C/km was determined, the geothermal gradient being considerably higher than we had predicted previously.\n3D coupled thermal/fluid flow models have been generated of the Whataroa Valley and the DFDP-2 drill site. Modelling confirms that the following features, present in the Whataroa Valley, are a requirement for a geothermal gradient of >130°C/km at a depth of 1km beneath the valley; high topography, permeability on the order of 10-15 m2 in both the mountains and beneath the valleys to depths of > 1km below the valley floor, and abundant fluid. The high permeability and large topographic driving force leads to abundant meteoric water flowing downward through the mountains, hitting the permeability barrier of the Alpine Fault and being pushed upward into the valleys. The high geothermal gradient of the DFDP-2B borehole implies that the valleys also have a very high permeability which is likely a result of rock damage along the Alpine Fault.",

            "abstract": "We developed an inversion model for river bathymetry and discharge estimation based on measurements of surface currents, water surface elevation and shoreline coordinates. The model uses a simplification of the 2D depth-averaged steady shallow water equations based on a streamline following system of coordinates and assumes spatially uniform bed friction coefficient and eddy viscosity. The spatial resolution of the predicted bathymetry is related to the resolution of the surface currents measurements. The discharge is determined by minimizing the difference between the predicted and the measured streamwise variation of the total head. The inversion model was tested using in situ and remote sensing measurements of the Kootenai River east of Bonners Ferry, ID. The measurements were obtained in August 2010 when the discharge was about 223 m3/s and the maximum river depth was about 6.5 m. Surface currents covering a 10 km reach with 8 m spatial resolution were estimated from airborne infrared video and were converted to depth-averaged currents using acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements along eight cross-stream transects. The streamwise profile of the water surface elevation was measured using real-time kinematic GPS from a drifting platform. The value of the friction coefficient was obtained from forward calibration simulations that minimized the difference between the predicted and measured velocity and water level along the river thalweg. The predicted along/cross-channel water depth variation was compared to the depth measured with a multibeam echo sounder. The rms error between the measured and predicted depth along the thalweg was found to be about 60cm and the estimated discharge was 5% smaller than the discharge measured by the ADCP.",

            "abstract": "An estimated 150PBq of 131I was released from the FDNPP accident, partially deposited into rivers and affected the water treatment plants (WTPs) of Japan. Due to the elevated 131I concentration in tap water, a restriction on drinking water was placed in 15 of 47 prefectures; of those limited, the densely populated Kanto region was significantly affected during this period. In order to better understand the existence of and to investigate the pathways of 131I for future risk and water resource management in the Kanto region, the IsoMATTRIP land surface and river model was developed. Half-life considerations of radiotracers were implemented and a river map of the Kanto region was manually created. Few simulation studies on the pathways of 131I have been conducted due to its short half-life and limited validation data. The development of the IsoMATTRIP model serves as an initial step to address this gap in knowledge.\n\nPreliminary runs on the IsoMATTRIP showed that river discharge has a significant effect on 131I concentration found in WTPs. River discharge was underestimated (by average of 55 m3/s) while 131I concentration was overestimated (by 301 Bq/kg). However, the model was able to simulate varying response of 131I concentration for fallout according to basin size. The discrepancy between observed and simulated river discharge is potentially caused by the model’s usage of natural land parameters to simulate an urban environment. Effective river velocity, input precipitation, and discharge were calibrated to successfully identify optimized settings for the current model setup. The IsoMATTRIP simulated comparable values of 131I to that from the observed in WTPs of the Kanto region.",

            "abstract": "How atmosphere and sea ice interact depends on the prevailing weather. Synoptic activities transport energy and moisture into the Arctic and modify the structure of the atmosphere, cloud conditions, and the surface energy budget over sea ice. The structure of the atmosphere, such as temperature inversions and specific humidity inversions are critical for the life cycle of Arctic clouds. Cloud radiative heating is an important component of the Arctic surface energy budget. The differences in the structure of the atmosphere, clouds, and the radiation balance at the surface under different synoptic conditions will determine which processes will govern the interaction between the atmosphere and clouds.\nIn this study, dominant synoptic types over the Beaufort and Chukchi seasonal ice zone (BCSIZ) are identified using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data sets and a k-mean clustering synoptic classification algorithm. The synoptic classification algorithm categorizes individual weather events in the atmospheric reanalysis into four synoptic types with distinct signatures in baroclinicity and temperature advection. The typical structure of the atmosphere in ERA-Interim is determined for each synoptic type. In particular the structure of the summer atmosphere across the ice edge along 150°W and 140°W longitude will be the analyzed and evaluated with observations obtained from the Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Survey (SIZRS). Cloud conditions and cloud radiative forcings at the surface under different synoptic conditions are determined using satellite observations, from MODIS, CloudSat, and Calipso, and modeled clouds in reanalysis. The influence of synoptic conditions on the structure of atmosphere and cloud through heat and moisture transport is explored and the consequent effects on the surface energy budget in BCSIZ are assessed.",

            "abstract": " Energy redistribution in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system is largely controlled by a complex system of field-aligned, Hall, and Pedersen currents, and the electrodynamics underlying their distributions. Application of Ohm’s law to the auroral zone requires knowledge of the ionospheric conductivity, whose estimation has often been simplified by invoking Maxwellian behavior of the impacting particles and height independent conductance. Though these assumptions have allowed us to study height-integrated conductivities (conductances), they have also limited our ability to understand how the MIT system operates as a whole. We are now in a position to address conductivity variations, and thus energy redistribution, in three dimensions. \nWe present an objective analysis of the fully three-dimensional (3-D) ionospheric Hall and Pedersen auroral conductivities for the November 30, 2011 coronal mass ejection event. We show: 1) a fundamental picture of ionospheric conductivity variability organized into empirical orthogonal functions [McGranaghan et al., 2015; accepted] and 2) an event reconstruction of the ionospheric conductivities. Figure 1 provides a proof of concept for part 1 by showing the first primary mode of variability (EOF1) of the Hall conductivity at four altitudes through the E- and lower F-regions. Our reconstruction relies on a data assimilation scheme that optimally combines Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite observations with an error covariance model created from the conductivity EOFs. We find significant 3-D structure in the ionospheric conductivities that can drastically modify the E- and lower F-region behavior. We suggest an exciting opportunity to extend these analyses to other data sets, such as the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC).",

The track consisted of discussion panels, mixers, shows, interactive displays, and signature events (over 30 hours of programming each year). Topics ranged from planetary sciences to biotechnology to artificial intelligence and event staff were recruited from all levels of experience in academia, industry, and STEM outreach.\nThe PCC science programming track for both 2014 and 2015 received very positive feedback from the audience, PCC management, and even scientists who participated in the event. Panelists and staff received frequent unsolicited praise about the content and events, and surveys showed requests for more science content in future years. Demand for good science programming, especially the kind that links the audience to local scientists, is high.\nThe unique organizational structure of PCC, which draws heavily on the fan community rather than industry professionals, provides a rich test bed for public outreach activities generated by scientists themselves. In 2014, we tested science-based game shows, such as the bloody Exoplanet Survivor. In 2015, we ran a science interactivity booth and an interactive stage show about forensics based on the BBC series Sherlock.

Proper characterization of soil moisture variability is vital for understanding hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical processes. At watershed scale, root zone soil moisture variability could effectively be described by studying the spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs).\nIn this study, we analyzed the behavior of soil moisture variability within the Little Washita watershed, Oklahoma by using the multi-step outflow experimental data from soil cores collected during the Southern Great Plains (SGP) 1997 hydrology experiment [Mohanty et al. 2002]. SHPs were calculated using inverse modeling and these properties were used to calculate distributed soil moisture values across the watershed using forward modeling. In calculating SHPs we took into account effects of non-equilibrium and preferential flow in vadose zone and compared several conceptual water flow models in structured porous media.\nWe have demonstrated how soil moisture variability is dependent on different water flow processes and as a consequence varies with different models. The range of mean moisture contents observed in these samples was from moderately wet to dry conditions in different parts of the watershed and this soil variability is captured by different models. Soil moisture is correlated with soil properties and these observed spatial patterns affect the components of water balance.",

            "abstract": "The fast subduction (~60 mm/yr) of the Indo-Australia plate underneath the Sunda microplate in Southeast Asia causes major seismic and tsunami hazards to surrounding regions. Previous land-based GPS studies have revealed that the plate motion composes of ~45 mm/yr of subduction directed normal to the Sunda trench and ~23 mm/yr of right-lateral strike-slip along the 1000km long Sumatran fault. The decoupling of the forearc blocks from the overriding plate leads to slip partitioning at this highly oblique subduction zone. Geological and geodetic studies have suggested that the long-term fault slip rate along the Sumatran fault increases significantly from southern to northern Sumatra. We analyzed the SAR data from the L-band ALOS-1 satellite to image the interseismic deformation along the Sumatran fault.\nTo extract the deformation signal from the interferometric phase observations, we have improved the conventional SBAS methodology by including the decorrelation information of the interferograms into the inverse problem. Instead of discarding the noisy data present in a fraction of the interferograms, we keep all the pixels in the processing chain and weight the observed phase data based on the correlation using the covariance matrix. This new InSAR technique is less prone to the unwrapping errors and it results in a spatially coherent signal with dense coverage and high precision.\nThe InSAR time-series analysis has detected up to ~20 mm/yr of fault creep on the Aceh segment along the Northern Sumatran fault. The spatial extent of the aseismic creep reaches at least 100 km, measured from N5.2, E95.7 to N4.5, E96.5. The along-strike variation of the aseismic creep has an inverse “U” shape. We will present new line-of-sight interseismic velocity and along-strike variation of fault creep rate along the Northern Sumatran fault in Southeast Asia.",

            "abstract": "Many processes in Earth science are difficult to observe or visualize due to the large timescales and lengthscales over which they operate. The dynamics of planetary mantles are particularly challenging as we cannot even look at the rocks involved. As a result, much teaching material on mantle dynamics relies on static images and cartoons, many of which are decades old. Recent improvements in computing power and technology (largely driven by game and web development) have allowed for advances in real-time physics simulations and visualizations, but these have been slow to affect Earth science education.\nHere I demonstrate a teaching tool for mantle convection and seismology which solves the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in real time, allowing users make changes to the simulation and immediately see the effects. The user can ask and answer questions about what happens when they add heat in one place, or take it away from another place, or increase the temperature at the base of the mantle. They can also pause the simulation, and while it is paused, create and visualize seismic waves traveling through the mantle. These allow for investigations into and discussions about plate tectonics, earthquakes, hot spot volcanism, and planetary cooling.\nThe simulation is rendered to the screen using OpenGL, and is cross-platform. It can be run as a native application for maximum performance, but it can also be embedded in a web browser for easy deployment and portability.",

            "abstract": "Samples of atmospheric dust from Qatar have been collected and analyzed for major and trace elemental composition. Twenty-one samples were collected in 2014 and 2015 from Doha, Al Khor, Katara, Sealine, and Al Waab by a variety of techniques. Some samples were collected during the megastorms that occurred in April 2015. Back trajectories were determined for each sample using the NOAA HYSPLIT model over a 50 hour time interval. Our samples were about equally divided between northerly (n=12; northern Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Iraq) and southerly (n=8; SE Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Oman) sources. One sample originated directly westward, in Saudi Arabia. Samples were microwave-assisted total acid digested (HF+HCl+HNO3) and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). There are only 12 out of 23 elements for which the Qatari dust was enriched relative to upper continental crust (UCC). Calcium was especially enriched at 400% relative to UCC. About 33% of the total sample mass was CaCO3, reflecting the composition of surface rocks in the source areas. Of the elements typically associated with anthropogenic activity, Ag, Ni and Zn were the most enriched relative to UCC, with enrichment factors of 182%, 233% and 209%, respectively. Others like Pb and V were not significantly enriched, with enrichment factors of 25% and 3%, respectively. The major elements Al, Mn and Fe were depleted relative to UCC because of the strong enrichment in CaCO3, with enrichment factors of -58%, -35% and -45% respectively. We separately averaged the samples with northern and southern origins to see if composition could be used to identify source. Only three elements had a statistical difference. Pb and Na were higher in the samples from the Se while Cr was higher in those from the north.",

As time step decreases, deep tropical convection becomes more bottom-heavy, with an associated decrease in gross moist stability. These changes in convective organization are associated with intensified tropical rainfall extremes and weakened shortwave and longwave cloud forcing in the model, showing that global model time step provides a useful tuning knob in superparameterized GCMs with effects that are distinct from normal GCMs. Interestingly, the weak temperature gradient approximation is more rigorously satisfied with a smaller time step. Although it is unknown what underlying physical processes ultimately orchestrate this shift in the nature of convective organization, circumstantial evidence is presented that may implicate a planetary scale wave – convection interaction mechanism.",

            "abstract": "There is a compelling need to develop the geoscience workforce of the future to address the “grand challenges” that face humanity. This workforce must have a strong understanding of Earth history, processes and materials and be able to communicate effectively and responsibly to inform public policy and personal and societal actions, particularly with regard to geohazards and natural resources. Curricula to train future geoscientists must be designed to help students develop critical thinking skills across the curriculum, from introductory to senior capstone courses. Students will be challenged in their pre-professional training as geoscientists as they encounter an incomplete geologic record, ambiguity and uncertainty in observed and experimental results, temporal reasoning (“deep time”, frequency, recurrence intervals), spatial reasoning (from microns to mountains), and complex system behavior. Four instructional approaches can be combined to address these challenges and help students develop critical thinking skills: 1) Geoethics and ethical decision making includes review and integration of the context/facts of the situation, stakeholders, decision-makers, and possible alternative actions and expected outcomes; 2) The affective domain which encompasses factors such as student motivation to learn, curiosity, fear, attitudes, perceptions, social barriers and values; 3) Metacognition which encourages students to be aware about their own thinking processes, and to develop self-monitoring and self-regulating behaviors; and 4) Systems thinking which requires integrative thinking about the interactions between physical, chemical, biological and human processes, feedback mechanisms and emergent phenomena. Guided inquiry and scaffolded exercises can be used to present increasingly complex situations that require a thorough understanding of geologic principles and processes as applied to issues of societal concern. These approaches are not “owned” by any single course or instructor, and we encourage all teaching faculty to commit a part of their coursework to develop these critical-thinking skills. A collection of geologic case studies is available at the Teaching Geoethics Across the Geoscience Curriculum website\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/74990\n.",

            "abstract": "Recent increases in air temperature and disturbance activity have led to amplified rates of permafrost degradation and carbon remobilization across portions of Alaska. Further warming, coupled with increases in disturbance frequency and severity (i.e. wildfire, thermokarst), may exacerbate permafrost thaw and disappearance, which would have a profound effect on high-latitude ecological and socio-economic systems. Here we present research aimed at characterizing the sensitivity of different permafrost landscapes to climate and disturbance-induced change through a compilation of in-situ observations, remote sensing and geophysical data, time series analyses, and spatio-temporal modeling. Our data-driven approach allowed for the development of a quantitative assessment of permafrost’s potential response to climate change. This analysis also identified indicators of permafrost’s susceptibility to disturbances in Alaska. Initial results suggest that further climate-induced permafrost degradation is most likely to occur in regions characterized by discontinuous permafrost and transition zones between tundra, boreal, and temperate forest ecosystems. Permafrost-affected soils, underlying upland ecosystems, are typically more prone to climate and fire-induced change than lowland ecosystems with relatively thicker organic soil layers. However, field and geophysical data indicate that carbon rich silty lowlands are also prone to deep permafrost thaw (> 5 m) following severe disturbance. Because a substantial amount of frozen soil carbon will become susceptible to decomposition upon permafrost thaw, we combined recently developed permafrost carbon maps and future projections of permafrost distribution to highlight areas that may become potential emission hotspots under warmer temperatures. Despite advances in understanding of the drivers of ecological change, more work is needed to integrate studies that link observations of permafrost dynamics to factors that drive those dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Geodynamic simulations increasingly rely on simulations with a true free surface to investigate questions of dynamic topography, tectonic deformation, gravity perturbations, and global mantle convection. However, implementations of free surface boundary conditions have proven challenging from a standpoint of accuracy, robustness, and stability. In particular, free surfaces tend to suffer from sloshing instabilities, also known as the \"drunken sailor\" instability, which severely limit time step sizes. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to deal with these instabilities.\nHere we analyze the problem of creeping viscous flow with a free surface and discuss the origin of these instabilities. We demonstrate their cause and how existing stabilization schemes work to damp them out. Our analysis is based on formulating a generalized eigenvalue problem for the relaxation spectra of the linearized free surface problem.\nWe also propose a new scheme for removing instabilites from free surface calculations. It does not require modifications to the system matrix, nor additional variables, but is instead an explicit scheme based on nonstandard finite differences. It relies on a single stabilization parameter which may be identified with the smallest relaxation timescale of the free surface.\nWe analyze the stability and accuracy of the nonstandard finite difference scheme, and describe its implementation in the open source mantle convection software Aspect. We also provide comparisons between the nonstandard finite difference scheme and the quasi-implicit scheme proposed by Kaus, Muhlhaus, and May (2010).",

Both these aspects are evaluated using climate forcings available from both historical climate simulations and CMIP5 hindcasts over the entire US. The analytical solution basically relates the univariate regression parameters, co-efficient of determination of regression and the co-variance ratio between GCM and downscaled values. The analytical solutions are compared with the downscaled univariate forcings by choosing the desired p-value (Type-1 error) in preserving the observed cross-correlation. . For quantifying the impacts of biases on cross-correlation on estimating streamflow and groundwater, we corrupt the downscaled climate forcings with different cross-correlation structure.",

            "abstract": "California’s Central Valley (CV) water crisis has increased in severity due to a prolonged drought. The drought is directly contributing to the overexploitation of groundwater, along with deficiency in agricultural, recreational and aesthetic water services. The population of the CV, home to about 6.5 million people, is projected to be 12 million by 2040. Balancing water demand between municipal use, agricultural supply, and other ecosystem services, will be challenging for this region in perpetuity. In the heart of CV lies the San Joaquin River (SJR) where Friant Dam is the main low-elevation reservoir regulating water release. The Friant Dam’s reservoir fulfills agricultural, municipal and industrial water needs through the Friant-Kern and Madera canals, as well as through the mainstem SJR. The SJR restoration project (SJRRP) is a recent development that is imposing additional demands on water releases in order to restore sustainable aquatic habitat for Chinook salmon and other species on the mainstem below the Friant Dam. The Chinook require adequate flow to moderate river temperature, particularly during hot summer and fall months. Temperatures on CV rivers exhibit strong diurnal and seasonal patterns, and can rise to harmful levels when flows are inadequate. In this study, we developed a framework that allows for assessing the effectiveness and implied costs of ecosystem services provided by a restored SJR in a semi-arid agriculture-dominant area. This is done by explicitly linking economics-based farmers’ model with a reduced-form hydrological model that is loosely coupled to a physical-based stream-temperature model, specifically CE-QUAL-W2. The farmers’ model is based on positive mathematical program approach calibrated with twenty proxy crops for year 2005. The river-hydrology is simulated by a vector autoregression model that incorporates daily flow variability. We study the mandated release policies by the SJR restoration project, along with hypothetical policies aimed at moderating river temperatures while enhancing groundwater recharge along the river corridor. We hypothesize that agricultural losses in terms of flow diverted to the SJR restoration can be offset by gains in groundwater resources in a long run, which is important to reduce pumping costs and insure against future.",

            "abstract": "Tropical rivers are responsible for two thirds of global fluxes of terrigenous organic matter to the oceans, yet because of their remote locations relative to most industrialized countries, they are poorly studied compared to temperate and even Arctic rivers. This study measured lignin biomarkers on weekly samples from two Puerto Rican rivers, the Mameyes and the Rio Icacos, over the course of ~9 months in order to investigate watershed controls on organic matter export via rivers. In both rivers, carbon-normalized yields of lignin increased with discharge, indicating higher organic matter contributions from vascular plants and lower contributions from microbial sources. Lignin biomarkers can be used to distinguish between conifer and deciduous trees as well as woody and nonwoody tissues, and the source signatures of the two rivers were essentially the same, indicating similar vegetation and sources of organic materials to both rivers. Thus, differences in diagenetic lignin parameters can be attributed to differences in processing within the two watersheds. For example, the Rio Icacos is a much flashier system with much higher sediment loads during storm events, which can lead to significant exchange of organic matter between the dissolved and particulate phase. Acid to aldehyde ratios for vanillyl and syringyl lignin phenols, (Ad:Al)v and (Ad:Al)s, are commonly used indicators of degradation. Plots of (Ad:Al)s vs. (Ad:Al)v for the two rivers reveal a significantly steeper slope for the Mameyes, which could reflect differences in the mineralogy between the systems, as the Mameyes watershed is underlain by volcaniclastic materials while the Rio Icacos is underlain by granodiorite. It is a commonly held assumption that base materials and soils should exert a strong influence on riverine organic matter compositions, but paired watershed studies are comparatively rare even in temperate climates. Hence, measureable differences between the two systems studied here demonstrate significant potential for future studies of landscape controls on river biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayan ranges of South Asia form one of the world’s most impressive rain shadows. Data from the NASA – Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) suggest that precipitation in the central Himalaya drops from more than four meters per year along the southern flanks of the Higher Himalaya (falling mostly as rain during the summer monsoon) to about half a meter per year north of the range crest on the southern Tibetan Plateau. While a correlation between modern precipitation and erosion seems intuitive, important questions remain regarding how far backward in time the correlation might extend. Previous investigations of the relationships between precipitation patterns and thermochronologic cooling dates south of the Himalayan range crest have yielded discrepant results, partly due to the fact that many were conducted along deep trans-Himalayan gorges that serve to channel monsoon storms locally northward, sometimes obscuring broader trends. We are addressing this problem through the comparative studies of bedrock exhumation on million-year timescales north and south of the range crest in transects that are not along major trans-Himalayan gorges. Our low-temperature thermochronology dataset from Greater Himalayan Sequence leucogranites and sillimanite gneisses north of the range crest indicate cooling through the white mica 40Ar/39Ar closure isotherm between 15.5 – 14.5 Ma with zircon (U-Th)/He ages ranging from 14.5 – 11 Ma. Though (U-Th)/He systematics of apatites from these samples is complex, our data point to 9 – 8 Ma cooling through the ~70°C isotherm. Our developing dataset from the Khumbu Himal region south of the range crest thus far indicates cooling through ApHe closure occurred more recently at 3 – 2 Ma, about 5 – 6 million years later those from southern Tibet. We will be investigating this dataset further using the 1-D thermal model QTQt as well as the 1-D thermal-kinematic model Pecube.",

Humphrey Fellowship 2015-16\nIntroduction\nLandslides lead to human and economic losses across the country, mainly in the winter season. On the other hand, satellite radar data has cost-effective benefits due to open-source software and free availability of data. With the purpose of establishing an early warning system of landslide-related surface deformation, three case studies were designed in the Coast, Sierra (Andean), and Oriente (jungle) regions.\nThe objective of this work was to assess the capability of L-band InSAR to get phase information. For the calculation of the interferograms in Repeat Orbit Interferometry PACkage, the displacement was detected as the error and was corrected.\nThe coherence images (Figure 1) determined that L-band is suitable for InSAR processing. Under this frame, as a first approach, the stacking DInSAR technique [1] was applied in the case studies [2]; however, due to lush vegetation and steep topography, it is necessary to apply advanced InSAR techniques [3].\nThe purpose of the research is to determine a pattern of data acquisition and successful results to understand the spatial and temporal ground movements associated with landslides.\nThe further work consists of establishing landslide inventories to combine phases of SAR images to generate maps of surface deformation in Tumba-San Francisco and Guarumales to compare the results with ground-based measurements to determine the maps’ accuracy.\n",

            "abstract": "Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) emitted from vegetation can be used as a constraint for photosynthetic activity and is now observable on a global scale from space. However, many issues on a leaf-to-canopy scale remain poorly understood, such as influences on the SIF signal of environmental conditions, water stress, or radiation.\nHere, we report on the development and characterization of a novel ground-based spectrometer system for measuring SIF from natural ecosystems (http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/study/photosynthesis/technology.html). The instrumental set-up, requirements, and measurement technique are based on decades of experience using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS), an established method to measure atmospheric trace gases. The instrument consists of three thermally stabilized commercial spectrometers that are linked to a 2D scanning telescope unit via optical fiber bundles. The spectrometers cover an SIF retrieval wavelength range at high spectral resolution (670 - 780 nm, 0.1 nm FWHM), but also provide moderate resolution spectra (400 - 800 nm, 1.5 nm FWHM) in order to retrieve vegetation indices and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI).\nIn addition to the instrumental set-up, we will show initial results of test and field measurements with the new instrument that examine the diurnal cycle of the SIF signal of different California native and non-native plants and its correlation with CO2 fluxes. Observations were made under different environmental conditions, variable water and nutrient stress, and with different viewing geometries. We also used concurrent observations by a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor and a portable chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM) to link the SIF signal to plant metabolism and carbon cycling under a range of environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is widely used to sample a probability density function (pdf) generated by a stochastic model conditioned by noisy data. This pdf can be either a joint posterior that describes the evolution of the state of the system in time, conditioned on all the data up to the present, or a particular marginal of this posterior that describes the state at the current time conditioned on all past data. We show that the EnKF collapses in the same way and under even broader conditions as a particle filter when it samples the joint posterior. However, this does not imply that EnKF collapses when it samples the marginal posterior. We we show that a localized and inflated EnKF can efficiently sample this marginal, and argue that the marginal posterior is often the more useful pdf in geophysics. This explains the wide applicability of EnKF in this field. We further investigate the typical tuning of EnKF, in which one attempts to match the mean square error (MSE) to the marginal posterior variance, and show that sampling error may be huge, even if the MSE is moderate.

            "abstract": "Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is an area dominated by a strike-slip tectonic regime and is therefore expected to have very low Quaternary uplift rates. We tested this hypothesis by study of an unusually well preserved emergent reef terrace around the bay. Up to 12 m of unaltered, growth-position reef corals are exposed at about 40 sections examined around ̃40 km of coastline. Maximum reef elevations in the protected, inner part of the bay are ̃11-12 m, whereas outer-coast shoreline angles of wave-cut benches are as high as ̃14 m. Fifty uranium-series analyses of unrecrystallized corals from six localities yield ages ranging from ̃134 ka to ̃115 ka, when adjusted for small biases due to slightly elevated initial 234U/238U values. Thus, ages of corals correlate this reef to the peak of the last interglacial period, marine isotope stage (MIS) 5.5. Previously, we dated the Key Largo Limestone to the same high-sea stand in the tectonically stable Florida Keys. Estimates of paleo-sea level during MIS 5.5 in the Florida Keys are ~6.6 to 8.3 m above present. Assuming a similar paleo-sea level in Cuba, this yields a long-term tectonic uplift rate of 0.04-0.06 m/ka over the past ~120 ka. This estimate supports the hypothesis that the tectonic uplift rate should be low in this strike-slip regime. Nevertheless, on the southeast coast of Cuba, east of our study area, we have observed flights of multiple marine terraces, suggesting either (1) a higher uplift rate or (2) an unusually well-preserved record of pre-MIS 5.5 terraces not observed at Guantanamo Bay.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering is a critical process to global CO2 consumption, river/ocean chemistry, and nutrient import to biosphere. Weathering rinds experience minimal physical erosion and provide a well-constrained system to study the chemical weathering process. Here, we applied U-series disequilibrium dating method to study weathering advance rates on the wet side of Basse-Terre Island, French Guadeloupe, aiming to understand the role of the precipitation in controlling weathering rates and elucidate the behavior and immobilization mechanisms of U-series isotopes during rind formation.\nSix weathering clasts from 5 watersheds with mean annual precipitation varying from 2000 to 3000 mm/yr were measured for U-series isotope ratios and major element compositions on linear core-to-rind transects. One sample experienced complete core-to-rind transformation, while the rest clasts contain both rinds and unweathered cores. Our results show that the unweathered cores are under U-series secular equilibrium, while all the rind materials show significant U-series disequilibrium. For most rinds, linear core-to-rind increases of (230Th/232Th) activity ratios suggest a simple continuous U addition history. However, (234U/238U) and (238U/232Th) trends in several clasts show evidences of remobilization of Uranium besides the U addition, complicating the use of U-series dating method. The similarity between U/Th ratios and major elements trends like Fe, Al, P in some transects and the ongoing leaching experiments suggest that redox and organic colloids could control the mobilization of U-series isotopes in the rinds.\nRind formation ages and weathering advance rate (0.07-0.29mm/kyr) were calculated for those rinds with a simple U-addition history. Our preliminary results show that local precipitation gradient significantly influenced the weathering advance rate, revealing the potential of estimating weathering advance rates at a large spatial scale using the U-series dating method.",

In preparation for this the NMASS is calibrated for the expected flight conditions and compatibility studies are made with ground-based instrumentation.\nThe NMASS is comprised of 5 parallel condensation particle counters (CPCs) using perfluoro-tributylamine as a working fluid. Understanding the variation of CPC counting efficiencies with respect to the chemical composition of the sample is important for accurate data analysis and can be used to give indirect information about sample chemical composition. This variation is strongly dependent on the working fluid. The absolute responses and associated variations of the NMASS to ammonium sulfate and limonene ozonolysis products, compounds pertinent to the composition of particles nucleated in the free troposphere and boundary later, are compared to those of butanol, diethylene-glycol and water based CPCs, which are more commonly used in ground-based measurements.\nWhile fast time-response is key to measuring aerosol size distributions on flights, high size-resolution is often prioritized for ground-based measurements, and so a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) is commonly used. Inter-comparison between NMASS and SMPS data is non-trivial because of the different working principles and resolutions of the instruments and yet it is vital, for example, for understanding the sources of particles observed during flights and the global relevance of phenomena observed from field stations and in chambers. We report compatibility studies on inversions of data from the SMPS and NMASS, evaluating temporal and spatial resolution and sources of uncertainty.",

During the program the authors performed repeated microstructure\nmeasurements to reveal the temporal evolution of the surface mixed layer and mixing processes in the upper\nwater column. The shelf region was initially characterized by a distinct two-layer system comprising a warmer/\nfresher top layer and a colder/saltier bottom layer. During the two-week observation period, the top-layer\nwater showed two types of mixing processes: near-surface turbulence due to strong wind forcing and subsurface\nmixing due to internal gravity waves. In the first week, when the top layer was stratified with fresh sea\nice meltwater, turbulent energy related to internal waves propagated through the subsurface stratification,\nresulting in a mechanical overturning near the pycnocline, followed by enhanced mixing there. In the second\nweek, gale winds directly stirred up the upper water and then established a deeper homogenous layer. The\ncombination of internal wave mixing and wind-driven turbulence may contribute to releasing the oceanic heat\ninto the atmosphere, consequently promoting the preconditioning of surface water freezing.",

            "abstract": "Both sliding and meltwater drainage processes of glaciers are expected to generate seismic signals. The confluence of the North and Central arms of the Kaskawulsh glacier in the Yukon Territory is an especially attractive place to study such phenomena not only because of the confluence but also because a nearby ice-dammed lake fills and drains rapidly every summer.\nWe analyzed geophone data from nine stations at the Kaskawulsh glacier during the summer of 2014 to detect and locate icequakes and ambient noise sources. We first detected icequakes automatically by picking arrivals. Then we located events using differential arrival times between stations obtained precisely by cross-correlations, and also applied a double-difference relocation technique. During the 1-month observation period, we found 183 events that clustered near the medial moraine. More icequakes are observed from midnight to noon, potentially due to lower noise levels. These events are distributed on a dipping plane sub-parallel to the glacier flow direction. The depths below the surface range from 200m on the shallower side to 500m on the deeper side. This structure may correspond to the basal slope of the medial moraine and implies that these icequake signals come from either shear basal sliding or an englacial splay fault.\nWe also determined ambient noise source locations for each 1-hour record sequence using the same process as for the icequakes. We located 31 sequences, among which more sequences were observed in the afternoon, possibly related to melting of the glacier. Most of the ambient noise sequences were located in two vertical clusters, with each cluster potentially corresponding to a crevasse or a moulin. We interpret this ambient noise as being produced by meltwater drainage. In both analyses, we find that inter-station differential arrival times obtained by cross-correlations provide effective information to locate sliding or meltwater drainage processes.",

            "abstract": "We present results from conjugate observations between the Radiation Belt Storms Probe (RBSP) and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) of energetic radiation belt precipitation. A key objective of the RBSP mission is to understand loss mechanisms of energetic particles from the radiation belt. The relative contribution from plasma waves (e.g., EMIC, hiss, chorus, and etc.) that pitch angle scatter particles into the loss cone remains an open scientific question. Rigorous experimental validation of these mechanisms is difficult to achieve because nearly simultaneous conjugate observations of in-situ pitch angle scattering and precipitation into the atmosphere are required. One ground-based signature of energetic precipitation is enhanced ionization and electron density at D-region altitudes. Incoherent scatter radar is a powerful remote sensing technique that is sensitive to electron density enhancements. By measuring the altitude profiles of ionization we infer the flux of particles precipitating into the atmosphere. PFISR observations show frequent occurrence of D-region ionization during both quiet-time and storm-time conditions. We present results from two events when the foot-points of the RBSP satellite were within 500 km of PFISR: a quiet-time event on January 13, 2015, and a storm-time event on April 16, 2015. PFISR observations of the D-region ionization signatures are presented, along with simultaneous conjugate RBSP observations of the magnetic field, electric field, and electron flux. Plasma waves are identified using the electric and magnetic field data, and evaluated as possible pitch angle scattering mechanisms. A direct comparison between the measured fluxes and loss cone fluxes predicted by theoretical wave-particle diffusion rates into the loss cone is used to test the validity of particle loss mechanisms predicted by the different theories. Preliminary results are presented of PFISR inversions of the D-region ionization to quantify the loss cone flux distribution at the geomagnetic equator. Additional ground- and space-based data are used to provide context for these events. In-situ RBSP data and ground-based PFISR observations are combined to obtain new insights into wave-particle mechanisms that can cause radiation belt loss to the atmosphere.",

Although many records of the MPT exist, particularly at high latitudes, our understanding of how this transition affected the tropics, and the east-Asian monsoon in particular, is limited. The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 354 drilled 7 sites in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, which contain hemipelagic calcareous clay, sand, and turbidite deposits. All sites have a ~1 Ma hemipelagic Mid-Pleistocene layer, providing a unique opportunity to gain insight into how the strength of the east-Asian monsoon was affected by the MPT.\nThe 1 Ma layer contains the Cobb Mountain (1.173-1.185 Ma) and Jaramillo (0.988-1.072 Ma) subchrons of the Matuyama Chron (2.58-0.78 Ma). This, along with biostratigraphic datums, indicates that the layer is Mid-Pleistocene in age and likely contains the MPT. We will present δ18O and Mg/Ca analyses on surface planktonic foraminifera from this Mid-Pleistocene layer at IODP site U1452B (8.0°N, 87.2°E, 3670 mbsl). We will present data from ~185 -186 mbsf at 2 cm resolution (~1kyr age resolution). The δ18O in foraminifera shells reflects the temperature and δ18O of the seawater from which the foraminifera formed their shells, while Mg/Ca is a proxy for sea surface temperature (SST). Therefore paired foraminifera δ18O and Mg/Ca measurements will allow us to reconstruct SST and δ18O of seawater. This preliminary work aims to assess the feasibility of these paleoceanographic proxies in this hemipelagic layer found in the complex depositional environment of the Bay of Bengal. Future work aims to reconstruct the full MPT, and along with other proxies generated by collaborators, will improve our understanding of response of the monsoon of the MPT.",

The flow cell was packed homogeneously with 359 μm diameter natural sand. Dyed TCE DNAPL was naturally distributed in the flow cell. Fe2+-activated persulfate (5 mM) was used for ISCO. Interfacial partitioning tracer tests (IPTT) were conducted before and after ISCO to measure NAPL-water interfacial area, using sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS, 35mg/L) as the tracer. The change in interfacial area was examined as influenced by ISCO remediation. The interfacial areas measured for this two-dimensional system are compared to previously reported values obtained from one-dimensional column experiments.",

            "abstract": "The pressure induced spin crossover of Fe3+ in (Mg1-xFex)(Si1-xFex)O3 bridgmanite (br) , the most abundant mineral of the Earth’s lower mantle, is by now a well-established phenomenon, though several aspects of this phenomenon still remain unclear. Here we investigate effects of disorder, iron concentration, and temperature on this crossover using ab initio LDA+U calculations. The effect of concentration and disorder are addressed using complete statistical samplings of coupled substituted ([Fe3+]Mg and [Fe3+]Si in nearest neighbor sites) configurations in 80-, 40-, and 20-atom supercells, respectively, for iron concentration of x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50. Vibrational/thermal effects on the crossover are also addressed within the quasi-harmonic approximation for x = 0.125. [Fe3+]Si in the perovskite octahedral site undergoes high (S=5/2) to low-spin (S=1/2) state change in the pressure range ~40-50 GPa at 300 K, consistent with experiments, while [Fe3+]Mg remains in the high-spin state up to core-mantle boundary conditions. The effect of disorder on the crossover seems very small, while increase in the iron concentration (x) results in considerable increase in transition pressure. As in the spin crossover in ferropericlase, this crossover in bridgmanite is accompanied by clear volume reduction and anomalous softening of the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure range. These effects reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though the concentration of [Fe3+]Si in bridgmanite may be small, related elastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral velocity structures of Earth’s lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Incoherent scatter radars (ISRs) measure the frequency spectrum of the scattered signal from random thermal fluctuations in the ionospheric plasma. Once fitted to a theoretical model, the shape of the spectrum provides estimates to a number of plasma parameters including the ion temperature. The theoretical models of the frequency spectrum of the scattered signal have been often developed based on a set of assumptions on the state of the plasma. One of the most common assumptions is that the plasma is in thermal equilibrium consisting of electron and ion populations that can be described by Maxwellian distributions. Such an assumption, however, is commonly violated at high latitudes where the interactions between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere result in a very dynamic plasma environment. One example of such violations occurs on the edge of auroral arcs when the presence of strong electric fields (<100 mV/m) may cause the ion velocity distribution to deviate from Maxwellian. In such cases, the assumption of thermal equilibrium in the standard ISR fitting procedure results in significant errors in derivation of the plasma parameters. In this study we investigate an event in which the ion temperature measured by the Resolute Bay incoherent scatter radar (RISR) reaches to values as high as 8000 (K). Based on RISR measurements of the electric fields we calculate the expected Joule heating and investigate the possible role of ISR misfitting (caused by deviation of the ion distribution from Maxwellian) in over estimating the ion temperature.",

            "abstract": "Detailed pollen analysis has been carried out on several sediment cores taken from high-elevation alpine lakes and bog areas located in Sierra Nevada and coastal and offshore environments from southern Spain. The earliest part of the record, from 8200 to about 7000 cal yr BP, is characterized by the highest abundance of arboreal pollen and Pediastrum, indicating the warmest and wettest conditions in the area at that time. The pollen records show a progressive aridification trend since 7000 cal yr BP through a decrease in forest species and the increase in xerophytes. The progressive aridification is punctuated by millennial-scale periodically enhanced droughts that coincide in timing and duration with well-known arid events in the Mediterranean and other areas. A relatively humid period occurred during the Roman Humid Period. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (900-1300 AD) was characterized by a wet phase at first, coinciding with a solar minimum, and a later arid phase, coinciding with the Medieval solar Maximum and a positive NAO. The Little Ice Age (1300-1850 AD) was markedly wetter than earlier, as shown by the increase in tree pollen, coinciding with a phase of negative NAO and the Maunder solar minimum. This study shows that vegetation and climate in Western Mediterranean are modulated by solar and atmospheric factors. Several vegetation changes are observed in the last centuries, which probably indicate the high-impact of humans in the Sierra Nevada, with pasturing leading to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the wetlands, Olea cultivation at lower elevations and Pinus reforestation.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of snow accumulation and melt in forested environments is a key component of the hydrological cycle in mountainous regions, yet is often over-simplified in hydroecological watershed modeling due to computational limits and paucity of input data. A key first step in addressing this deficiency is to assess potential improvements in predicting snow water equivalent using a land surface model (full energy and mass balance of snow pack) over a sufficiently large geographic area to address societal questions centered on forest change and water yield of river basins. The snow energy and mass balance model ISNOBAL was applied over a 14,300 km2 region encompassing the Merced and Tuolumne River watersheds in the Sierra Nevada at a 1-hour time step and 100-meter spatial resolution for water years 2010-2014. Results show a bias toward a slight over-estimation of snow water equivalent when compared to manual snow course measurements, though cumulative melt was consistent with summed river gage data and independent estimates of evapotranspiration. Ratios of gaged runoff to water available for runoff from the base of the snowpack ranged from 0.45 to 0.59 for three different gages. Modeled results were compared to independently-derived estimates of snow water equivalent from MODIS Snow Covered Area reconstruction and airborne LiDAR estimates of snow depth, highlighting potential deficiency in SCA reconstructions, and the use of LiDAR derived snow surface maps providing snow distribution patterns in physically based models. Further, ISNOBAL highlighted trends in snow distribution patterns and snowmelt timing in an average (2010), above average (2011), and below average (2014) year.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen isotopic composition of Neoproterozoic magmas from the northern Yangtze Block holds a key for the origin of large-scale 18O depletion in the HP and UHP metamorphic rocks in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, northern margin of the South China Block. We report here the integrated in situ U-Pb dating and O-Hf isotope analyses of zircon grains from sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the late Neoproterozoic Suixian Group (SG) from the northern Yangtze Block. Detrital zircon grains display age peaks of 0.73-0.74 Ga, 0.79 Ga, and 2.0 Ga. Zircon U-Pb ages together with Hf-O isotopic composition indicate provenance of SG dominantly from proximal Neoproterozoic igneous rock and likely hidden Paleoproterozoic basement along the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. The zircon δ18O values from SG range from 10.5‰ to 1.3‰. Zircon grains with negative δ18O value, typical result of magma-ice interaction, were not identified in this study. The major phase of low-δ18O (< 4‰) magmas initiated at ca. 780 Ma, long before the first glaciation event (< 715 Ma) in the South China Block. Thus caution should be taken when using low-δ18O zircon grains to infer cold climate. Low-δ18O zircon grains have large ranges of εHf(t) values, varying from -15.5 to 10.7, concentrating on negative εHf(t). This strongly argues against the possibility that the low-δ18O magma was produced by partial melting of high-temperature hydrothermally altered oceanic crust because this model predicted MORB-like Hf isotopes for the resultant low-δ18O magmas. This study emphasizes that high-T water-rock interaction and continental rifting tectonic setting are essential to generate abundant low-δ18O magmas. The important application of our study is to confirm that most of negative-δ18O zircons identified in HP and UHP metamorphic rocks may not have been inherited from their Neoproterozoic protoliths.",

            "abstract": "Paleoenvironmental change is commonly invoked as a factor in the development of modern human behaviors and the successful expansion of H. sapiens out of Africa, and paleoenvironmental information from archaeological sequences is central to addressing such questions. Ostrich eggshell (OES) are common in many African archaeological sequences and may be dated by 14C and U-series methods. In modern ratite eggshells (large flightless birds including the ostrich and emu), the δ13C in eggshell calcite and the δ13C and δ15N in eggshell organic fractions have been shown to vary systematically across climate gradients in South Africa and Australia with δ15N varying inversely with mean annual precipitation, and δ13C varying with the C isotopes of vegetation (1,2). Thus, if primary C and N isotopic signatures are preserved, assemblages of OES can provide dated records of paleovegetation and paleoprecipitation at archaeological sites. Since the C isotopic fractionation between calcite and eggshell organics is constant in modern OES (Δ13Ccalcite-organic = 14.7 ± 1.3‰) (3), evaluating that offset in ancient OES provides a test for preservation of primary isotopic signatures. Johnson et al. (3) showed that OES from Equus Cave (South Africa) retained the expected fractionation for up to 17 ka. We present a new protocol to extract C and N of OES organics for online analysis that preserves pristine δ13C and δ15N values and C and N contents. We find that using sodium hydroxide (NaOH), common to many bone collagen extraction procedures, destroys and degrades the organic component of OES, resulting in low C and N and altered δ13C and δ15N values. Analysis of a series of OES samples directly dated by 14C and U-series from the GvJm-22 rockshelter (Lukenya Hill, Kenya) (4,5) will demonstrate the first application of this protocol to OES from the last ~50,000 yr.\n1.

            "abstract": "This work focuses on improving current 2D numerical approaches to modeling the boundary conditions associated with computing accurate deformation and melting associated with continental rifting. Recent models primarily use far-field boundary conditions that have been used for decades with little assessment of their effects on asthenospheric flow beneath the rifting region. All are clearly extremely oversimplified — Huismans and Buiter assume there is no vertical flow into the rifting region, with the asthenosphere flowing uniformly into the rifting region from the sides beneath lithosphere moving in the opposing direction, Armitage et al. and van Wijk use divergent velocities on the upper boundary to impose break-up within a Cartesian box, while other studies generally assume there is uniform horizontal flow away from the center of rifting, with uniform vertical flow replenishing the material pulled out of the sides of the computational region. All are likely to significantly shape the pattern of asthenospheric flow beneath the stretching lithosphere that is associated with pressure-release melting and rift volcanism. Thus while ALL may lead to similar predictions of the effects of crustal stretching and thinning, NONE may lead to accurate determination of the the asthenospheric flow and melting associated with lithospheric stretching and breakup.\nHere we discuss a suite of numerical experiments that compare these choices to likely more realistic boundary condition choices like the analytical solution for flow associated with two diverging plates stretching over a finite-width region, and a high-resolution 2-D region embedded within a cylindrical annulus ‘whole mantle cross-section’ at 5% extra numerical problem size. Our initial results imply that the choice of far-field boundary conditions does indeed significantly influence predicted melting distributions and melt volumes associated with continental breakup. For calculations including asthenospheric melting, the ‘finite width plate spreading’ and embedded subregion boundary condition treatments lead to significantly smaller BC-influenced signals when using high-resolution calculation regions of order ~1000km x 400km. We recommend their use when models are attempting to resolve the effects of asthenosphere flow and melting.",

Photoclinomeetry is applicable over ice sheet areas with highly uniform albedo such as regions covered by recent snowfall. OLI imagery is available from both ascending and descending passes near the summer solstice period for both ice sheets. This provides two views of the surface features from two distinct solar azimuth illumination directions. Airborne laser altimetry data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) instrument (flying on the Operation Ice Bridge program) are used to quantitatively convert the image brightness variations of surface undulations to surface slope. To validate the new DEM products, we use additional laser altimetry profiles collected over independent sites from Ice Bridge and ICESat, and high-resolution WorldView-2 DEMs. The photoclinometry-derived DEM products will be useful for studying surface elevation changes, enhancing bedrock elevation maps through inversion of surface topography, and inferring local variations in snow accumulation rates.",

Thus, understanding the climatic changes that occurred during the Pliocene might be useful for predicting how climate will involve in the future. In pursuit of this goal, reconstructions based on ocean sediments have proven useful, but also highlighted inconsistencies and gaps in our understanding of the climate mechanisms important during the Pliocene. For example, the conditions that drove ice growth and decay in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, especially during a period known as the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation, are debated. A major obstacle to refining our knowledge of such phenomena is the lack of paleoclimate records from terrestrial sites.\nTo address this shortcoming, we develop a record of climatic changes across the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, spanning 2.82-2.41 million years ago (Ma), in a lacustrine record from Arctic Russia. Here we use branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf waxes (n-alkane δD) to reconstruct temperature and hydrology during this interval. We find close coupling between the proxies from 2.55 – 2.41 Ma, suggesting glacial-interglacial temperature changes of 5-10ºC during this time in the Arctic. Prior to this, the proxies do not agree on the character of climate changes, suggesting a decoupling of temperature and the hydrologic cycle in the Arctic from 2.7-2.55 Ma. Shifts in the leaf wax hydrogen isotope record at 2.69 and 2.73 Ma, independent of changes in temperature, point to potentially dramatic changes in the high-latitude hydrological cycle at these times.\nThis record allows us, for the first time, to put discontinuous and time-uncertain records into regional perspective and better constrain the evolution of multiple independent Arctic feedback systems during the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene.",

Additionally, we compared LWRF time series data, injection rates, and treatment history with submarine spring time series data to assess correlation between input and output variables. We found that heterotrophic denitrification is the primary mechanism of N attenuation within the effluent plume and that chlorination of injected effluent for disinfection purposes may suppress microbial activity responsible for this N attenuation, resulting in increased N loading to the coastal ocean. The replacement of chlorination with UV disinfection may restore the biogeochemical reactions responsible for the N loss in the aquifer and return of N-attenuating conditions in the effluent plume, reducing N flux to coastal waters.",

It has begun to be used in the Planetary Division by the ARTEMIS and MAVEN missions, as well as by a number of international missions. As NASA planetary missions are required to archive data with the Planetary Data System (PDS) there was a desire that PDS begin to accept CDF formatted data into the archive. While this was difficult under the PDS3 Information Model (IM), the new PDS4 IM is flexible enough to allow properly constrained CDF formatted data to be described by using PDS4 metadata. The approach taken has been to capture as much of the CDF metadata in the PDS metadata as possible, while describing both the physical and logical data structures by using a combination of the PDS4 common data dictionary and a series of local data dictionaries. This method has been realized in the PDS MAVEN archive. There is also an ongoing effort to archive Cassini high order data in CDF.",

            "abstract": "Field observations have documented dramatic changes over the past decade in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica: extreme river incisions, significant glacier loss, and the appearance of numerous thermokarst slumps. To date these observations have been sporadic and localized, and have not been able to capture change on a valley-wide scale. During the 2014-2015 Antarctic summer season, specifically between December 4th, 2014 and January 19th, 2015, we undertook a widescale airborne laser mapping campaign to collect a baseline digital elevation model for 3500 km2 area of the Dry Valleys and other areas of interest. The airborne LiDAR observations were acquired with a novel multi-spectral LiDAR sensor with active laser observations at three light wavelengths (532 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm) simultaneously; which not only allowed the generation of a high resolution elevation model of the area, but also provides multispectral signatures for observed terrain features. In addition to the LiDAR data, high resolution (5-15 cm pixels) digital color images were collected. During the six week survey campaign of the Dry Valleys a total of 30 flights were performed, in which about 20 billion LiDAR returns and 21,000 60-Mpixels images were collected. The primary objective of this project is to perform a topographic change detection analysis by comparing the recently acquired dataset to a lower resolution dataset collected by NASA in the 2001-2002 season. This presentation will describe the processing and analysis of this significant mapping dataset and will provide some initial observations from the high resolution topography acquired.",

            "abstract": "We report strong, wide-angle, seismic reflections from the mantle beneath the Taranaki Fault zone, southwest North Island, New Zealand. We attribute these reflections to a serpentinised fault zone that accommodated large amounts (~100km) of shortening during the Miocene. Other manifestations of the collision zone are a fold and thrust belt in the overriding Australian plate, a 3-4 km deep foreland basin and fragments of serpentine outcropping at the surface. The 2011 SAHKE experiment carried out multi-component, active-source seismic surveys along a length of about 300 km. The middle 100 km of the line is on land. Twelve large explosions (500 kg weight) were detonated onshore into an array of ~ 900 vertical component and 300 horizontal component seismographs in the on land section. Deep reflections are evident on both the land and marine seismic data. At 30 s two way travel time (twtt) are ~ 100 km deep reflections that have been interpreted to be due to arise from the base of the subducting Pacific plate*. But at 20 s twtt there are back-dipping reflections that when migrated are located in the mantle wedge of the overriding Australian plate. These reflections are in the depth range of 40-70 km and dip ~45 degrees to the southeast. Coincident S-S reflections are also seen on the horizontal geophones of the land array coming in at ~ 34 s twtt. This timing implies a Vp/Vs ratio = 34/20= 1.7 for the time averaged reflection path. Zoeprittz equation solutions show that if both P-P and S-S arrivals are generated from a common reflector a negative impedance contrast is required. We suggest serpentinite is the most likely cause of the reflectivity. Marine reflection data also show low-frequency reflections around the Moho depths that we also associate with both serpentinite, and recently documented slow-slip events on the subducted plate interface. * Stern T.A. et al (2015).

            "abstract": "The Deccan Traps (DT) have been strongly implicated over the past thirty years as a potential cause of the mass extinctions at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (KPB). While a broad coincidence between the DT eruptions and the KPB is increasingly clear, variables such as tempo, volume of eruptions, and amount of associated climate-modifying volatiles, are too poorly constrained to properly assess causality. In order to appropriately test whether the DT played a role in the mass extinctions a high-precision geochronologic framework defining the timing and tempo of volcanic eruptions is needed. Recent high-precision U/Pb dating of zircons from inferred paleosols (red boles) and melt segregation horizons is the only available geochronology of the DT that is sufficiently precise to resolve age differences of less than 100 ka (Schoene et al., 2015). While this technique can achieve high-precision dates for individual zircon crystals, protracted age distributions may not include the actual eruption age. Moreover, the applicability of U/Pb dating in the DT is limited as suitable material is only sporadically present and therefore the technique is unlikely to achieve the resolution necessary to assess the tempo of DT eruptions. To mediate these limitations, we present new high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages for plagioclase separated from the lava flows sampled from each of ten chemostratigraphically-defined formations within the Western Ghats. Multiple (N = 1-4) plateau ages from each sample and detailed neutron fluence monitoring during irradiation yield ages with precision commonly better than 100 ka (1 sigma). Results provide the first precise location of the KPB within the DT eruption sequence, which approximately coincides with major changes in eruption frequency, flow-field volumes, extent of crustal contamination, and degree of fractionation. Collectively, these results suggest that a state shift occurred in the DT magma system within ~50 ka of the Chicxulub impact, consistent with transient effects of seismic energy associated with the impact. Further, our new data invalidate the concept of three discrete eruption pulses in the Western Ghats (Chenet et al., 2007, 2009; Keller et al., 2008) and rather indicate only a sharp increase in mean volumetric eruption rates near the KPB.",

The highest albedos on Pluto are similar to those of the bright icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter. The range of albedos on Pluto is surprisingly large, surpassed only by Saturn’s moon Iapetus. Charon has a more limited range, with a bifurcated distribution. The disk-integrated phase function of Pluto is similar to those of the icy moons of Saturn.

            "abstract": "Turbulent motions within the solar convection zone play a central role in the generation and maintenance of the Sun's magnetic field. This magnetic field reverses its polarity every 11 years and serves as the source of powerful space weather events, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can affect artificial satellites and power grids. The structure and inductive properties are linked to the amplitude (i.e. speed) of convective motion. Using the NASA Pleiades supercomputer, a 3D fluids code simulates these processes by evolving the Navier-Stokes equations in time and under an anelastic constraint. This code simulates the fluxes describing heat transport in the sun in a global spherical-shell geometry. Such global models can explicitly capture the large-scale motions in the deep convection zone but heat transport from unresolved small-scale convection in the surface layers must be parameterized. Here we consider two models for heat transport by surface convection, including a conventional turbulent thermal diffusion as well as an imposed flux that carries heat through the surface in a manner that is independent of the deep convection and the entropy stratification it establishes. For both models, we investigate the scaling of convective amplitude with decreasing diffusion (increasing Rayleigh number). If the Prandtl number is fixed, we find that the amplitude of convective motions increases with decreasing diffusion, possibly reaching an asymptotic value in the low diffusion limit. However, if only the thermal diffusion is decreased (keeping the viscosity fixed), we find that the amplitude of convection decreases with decreasing diffusion. Such a high-Prandtl-number, high-Peclet-number limit may be relevant for the Sun if magnetic fields mix momentum, effectively acting as an enhanced viscosity. In this case, our results suggest that the amplitude of large-scale convection in the Sun may be substantially less than in current models that employ an effective turbulent Prandtl number of order unity. These results are found to be insensitive to the nature of the surface convection model.",

The highest resolution images that have yet been returned are seven lossy 400 m/pixel frames that cover the majority of the prominent Plutonian feature informally named Sputnik Planum (all feature names are currently informal), and its surroundings. This resolution is sufficient to allow detailed geomorphological mapping of this area to commence. Lossless versions of all 15 frames that make up the mosaic will be returned in September 2015, and the map presented at AGU will incorporate the total area covered by these frames.\nSputnik Planum, with an area of ~650,000 km2, is notable for its smooth appearance and apparent total lack of impact craters at 400 m/pixel resolution. The Planum actually displays a wide variety of textures across its expanse, which includes smooth and pitted plains to the south, polygonal terrain at its center (the polygons can reach tens of kilometers in size and are bounded by troughs that sometimes feature central ridges), and, to the north, darker polygonal terrain displaying patterns indicative of glacial flow. Within these plains there exist several well-defined outcrops of a mottled, light/dark unit that reach from several to tens of kilometers across. Separating Sputnik Planum from the dark, cratered equatorial terrain of Cthulhu Regio on its south-western margin is a unit of chaotically arranged mountains; similar mountainous units exist on the south and western margins. The northern margin is bounded by rugged, hilly, cratered terrain into which ice of Sputnik Planum appears to be intruding in places. Terrain of similar relief exists to the east, but is much brighter than that to the north. The southernmost extent of the mosaic features a unit of rough, undulating terrain that displays very few impact craters at 400 m/pixel resolution.",

We have measured high-resolution gamma-ray spectrum using an unmanned helicopter equipped with LaBr3(Ce) detector in a 3-km range from the power station which was near to the release source of the radioactive cesium.

            "abstract": "We show the results from the LASSIE seismic experiment, which consists of a dense (1-km spacing) linear array of broadband stations deployed across the LA basin for approximately two months. Two common methods – ambient noise and receiver function (RF) – are applied to determine the velocity and structure of the basin.\nThe basin RFs are complicated, however, the dense array enhances the lateral coherence of the signals and allows the structure to be imaged. The basement shape is clearly shown in the migrated image of the PpPs phase. The Ps conversion at the basement is the largest signal (including the direct wave) in the first 3 s. However, the Ps phase does not form as clear an image compared with the PpPs phase, possibly due to a requirement of more accurate velocity model.\nThe surface wave signals from the ambient noise cross-correlations between LASSIE and surrounding SCSN stations are used for velocity inversion. A linear Dix-type inversion (Haney and Tsai, 2015, Geophysics) is applied to the extracted dispersion curves. The 1-10 s period Rayleigh wave and the 1-8 s period Love wave dispersion curves provide excellent constraints on top 5 km SV and top 3 km SH velocity structures respectively. Strong anisotropy (SV > SH) is observed for the top 1 km, and we plan to use this result to infer the fracture orientation and density of the shallow sedimentary rocks.",

            "abstract": "Information Quality (IQ) is an important characteristic of a data repository. Being recognized for providing “good” or “high” quality information enables trust to be built between the data repository and its communities, and therefore, fosters collaborations and potentially improves the utility of its data holdings. However, currently, a common standard or framework does not exist to allow IQ to be assessed consistently across different data repositories.\nThere are several aspects that need to be considered when evaluating IQ. In particular, the data stewardship practices applied to datasets during the curation process can have significant impact on the accessibility, usability, understandability, and integrity of the datasets over time. The Data Stewardship Maturity Matrix (DSMM) provides a framework for the evaluation of a dataset’s quality based on nine distinct categories. For each of the categories, the DSMM provides criteria that can be used to apply a 5-level rating to an individual dataset, ranging from Ad Hoc to Optimal.\nThis presentation introduces the overview of the DSMM and the recommended process for using DSMM to evaluate the quality of a dataset. The presentation will also provide the key findings after applying the DSMM to several datasets, including those from the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the Long Term Ecological Research’s Santa Barbara Coastal site. The presentation concludes by summarizing the crucial lessons learned and the potential benefits when a data repository uses the DSMM to assess and convey the quality of its datasets.",

            "abstract": "Interest in the influence of mineral chemistry on soil organic matter cycling has been steadily growing, with the role of iron specifically garnering a great deal of attention. Empirical evidence from both lab and field based studies suggest that the interactions of Fe-bearing minerals and colloidal Fe species are unique from the interactions of the soil mineral matrix as a whole and may have a disproportionate influence on soil organic matter. We present results from a suite of studies examining Fe-organic matter interactions which utilize a broad range of technical approaches and highlight the use of radiocarbon analysis in terrestrial carbon cycle studies. Data suggests that interaction of organics with Fe-bearing moieties induces consistent partitioning of organics between dissolved and surface bound organic matter pools, including significant consequences for N and P availability and biodegradability of soil organic matter. Selective dissolution techniques have revealed that Fe-humus complexes comprise a significant pool of soil organic matter which cycles on a shorter-term basis across a variety of ecosystems types, while sequential density separation combined with x-ray diffraction imply concentration and long-term preservation of N-rich organics on Fe-bearing crystalline mineral surfaces. Our results explore the unique and multifaceted roles of Fe in regulating organic matter transformation and preservation in a range of soil types.",

            "abstract": "<span\" roman\"=\"Roman\"\" new=\"New\">Throughout the range of L-shells important for GPS and GEO spacecraft (4.2<L<7.2) the energy dependence of the electron distribution function derived from model AE8 is represented very well by a sum of 3 exponential components, soft, hard, and tail, each parameterized by a temperature and a density. Furthermore, the 3 temperatures vary only slightly over this range of L-shells suggesting an almost isothermal electron population. Indeed, for AE8, the temperatures of the soft and hard populations actually decrease with decreasing L. The event-dominated and non-event-dominated natures of time variations on L-shells observed by GPS and GEO, respectively, underlie this paradox.1 At one end of the L range, and consistent with AE8, in situ measurements (averaged for several minutes or more) from GEO spacecraft are represented well by sums of 3 exponential components, and individual spectra resemble their average. At the lower end of the L range, however, individual CXD spectra exhibit characteristic non-equilibrium leakage features,2and they bear little resemblance to their average. Local-time asymmetries develop at L=4.2 during event decay phases that follow electron injections; 0.3 MeV electrons exhibit the largest asymmetries on these L-shells. When a 14-day-long averaging interval (sets of 14 individual CXD spectra with similar magnetic-equator-crossing coordinates) includes one or more electron injections, the energy dependence of the average spectra often resemble sums of 3 exponential components, consistent with the model based on average fluxes, AE8.\n<span\" roman\"=\"Roman\"\" new=\"New\">1.)

            "abstract": "The Yamato Basin is the second largest basin of the Japan Sea. This basin is important to clarify its formation process. Some studies of crustal structure had been carried out in the Yamato Basin (e.g. Ludwig et al., 1975; Katao, 1988; Hirata et al., 1989; Sato et al., 2006). However, the relationship between formation process and crustal structure is not very clear, because the amount of seismic exploration data is very limited. In addition, since there is ODP Leg 127 site 797 (Tamaki et al., 1990) directly beneath our seismic survey line, we contributed to the study on the formation of the Yamato Basin by examining the relation between the ODP results and our results. During July–August 2014, we conducted a multi-channel seismic (MCS) survey and ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) survey to study the crustal structure of the western Yamato Basin.\nWe present an outline of the data acquisition and results of the data processing and preliminary interpretations from this study. As a result of our study, the crust, which is about 12 km thick, is thicker than standard oceanic crust (e.g., Spudich and Orcutt, 1980; White et al., 1992) revealed from P-wave velocity structure by OBS survey. A clear reflector estimated to be the Moho can be identified by MCS profiles. The characteristics of the sedimentary layer are common within the survey area. For example, a strong coherent reflector that is estimated to be an opal-A/opal-CT BSR (bottom simulating reflector) (Kuramoto et al., 1992) was confirmed in the sediment of all survey lines. On the other hand, a coherent reflector in the crust was confirmed in some lines. It is identified as this reflector corresponding with the deformation structure in the sediment and basement.",

Completed in 2014, on time and under budget, this network enables real-time, high-bandwidth, 2-way communication with seafloor/water-column sensor arrays across: 1. the Cascadia accretionary prism, 2. the JdF spreading center, and, 3. portions of the overlying NE Pacific. Oceanographic processes in coastal environments, the California Current, and 400 km offshore, are captured by six remote-controlled, profiling moorings covering full-ocean depths. In August, 2015, all sections of cable, all six operational primary nodes, all 17 junction boxes, and 97% of all 146 instruments are transmitting data ashore to the Internet via the Pacific Northwest Gigapop (\nhttp://www.pnwgp.net/\n). All data are archived at the U of Washington, pending completion of the OOI CyberInfrastructure System in October 2015. \nIn 2014, community requests to access seismic and seafloor deformational information for assessment of progressive inflation at Axial Seamount (Chadwick et al, 2012), resulted in NSF releasing, through IRIS (http://www.iris.edu/hq/), real-time data from 7 seismometers and 3 pressure sensors. At a community-initiated meeting on April 20-22, 90 participants covering the spectrum of Ocean Sciences, met in Seattle to explore scientific responses in the event Axial actually erupted (http://novae.ocean.washington.edu). On April 24, Axial did erupt; seismic event counts rose dramatically to many hundreds/hour (Wilcock, AGU-2015), the Axial caldera floor dropped 2.2 m in ~20 hours (Nooner et al, AGU-2015), and water temperatures in the caldera rose slowly by ~0.7°C, then declined in 3 weeks to normal values. Unusual water-bourn acoustic signals indicated ongoing seafloor activity along the rift zone extending north from Axial. Seafloor mapping indicates new lava in that area (Kelley, AGU-2015). Additional in situ observations in August are planned. \nThese events signal a new era in Ocean Sciences as instantaneous Internet access to events far offshore begin allowing interactive responses to complex processes unfolding within our ocean.

The magnitude of BC impacts on a global scale remains poorly constrained and is intimately related to its particle-scale physical and chemical properties. Using particle-resolved modeling informed by novel quantitative measurements from an Aerodyne soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), we show that initial mixing state (or the distribution of co-emitted components amongst fresh BC-containing particles) significantly affects BC-aerosol optical properties even after a day of atmospheric processing. Both single particle and ensemble observations indicate that BC near emission co-exists with hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) in two distinct particle types: HOA-rich and BC-rich particles. The average mass fraction of black carbon (mfBC) in HOA- and BC-rich particle types was 0.02-0.08 and 0.72-0.93, respectively. Notably, positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of ensemble SP-AMS measurements indicates that BC-rich particles contribute the majority of BC mass (> 90%) in freshly emitted particles. This new measurement capability provides quantitative insight into the physical and chemical nature of BC-containing particles and is used to drive a particle-resolved aerosol box model. Significant differences in calculated single scattering albedo (an increase of 0.1) arise from accurate treatment of initial particle mixing state as compared to the assumption of uniform aerosol composition at the point of BC injection to the atmosphere.",

In this approach we first run a global MHD simulation driven by upstream solar wind observations. Then we use the results from the MHD simulation to set the initial and boundary conditions for the large scale 3D PIC simulation. The evolution of the system is constrained by the initial MHD state but evolves fully kinetically. The electrons and ions are followed in fields determined by using Maxwell’s equations. This approach combines both macro-MHD and small-kinetic scales in a single numerical simulation.\n For many studies the magnetotail can be thought of as invariant in the dawn dusk or Y direction. However, in many other situations the tail is kinked and/or flaps in time and one cannot assume invariance in the Y direction. We report an investigation of a case where the structure of the tail varies significantly in the Y-direction and a PIC simulation in a realistic configuration is necessary. We have found that the reconnection electric field and the ion outflow jet regions expand in Y. But the reconnection region remains localized and is accompanied by a narrow electron jet with a Y-extent comparable to an ion skin depth. This narrow jet does not show any sign of expanding in Y, but remains narrow despite the wider ion scale. Implications for the MMS mission will be discussed.",

Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main component of a plant’s water requirement. A better understanding of the ET of urban vegetation is essential for sustainable urbanisation. Increased implementation of green infrastructure will be informed by this work. Despite promising technologies and sophisticated facilities, ET estimation of urban vegetation remains insufficiently characterized.\nWe reviewed the common field, laboratory and modelling techniques for ET estimation, mostly agriculture and forestry applications. We opted for 3 approaches of ET estimation: 1) an observational-based method using adjustment factors applied to reference ET, 2) a field-based method of Soil Water Balance (SWB) and 3) a Remote Sensing (RS)-based method. These approaches were applied to an experimental site to evaluate the most suitable ET estimation approach for an urban parkland.\nTo determine in-situ ET, 2 lysimeters and 4 Neutron Moisture Meter probes were installed. Based on SWB principles, all input water (irrigation, precipitation and upward groundwater movements) and output water (ET, drainage, soil moisture and runoff) were measured monthly for 14 months. The observation based approach and the ground-based approach (SWB) were compared. Our predictions were compared to the actual irrigation rates (data provided by the City Council). Results suggest the observational-based method is the most appropriate urban ET estimation.\nWe examined the capability of RS to estimate ET for urban vegetation. Image processing of 5 WorldView2 satellite images enabled modelling of the relationship between urban vegetation and vegetation indices derived from high resolution images. Our results indicate that an ETobservational-based -NDVI modelling approach is a reliable method of ET estimation for mixed urban vegetation. It also has the advantage of not depending on extensive field data collection.",

Glacial-interglacial cycles represent the largest natural climate changes over the last 800 kyr with each cycle terminated by rapid global warming and sea level rise. Our understanding of the role and response of tropical atmospheric convection during these periods of dramatic warming is limited.\nWe present the first speleothem paleomonsoon record for southwest Sulawesi (5ºS, 119ºE), spanning two glacial-interglacial cycles, including glacial termination IV (~340 kyr BP) and both phases of termination III (~248 and ~220 kyr BP). This unique record is constructed from multiple stalagmites from two separate caves and is based on a multi-proxy approach (δ18O, δ13C, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) that provides insight into the mechanisms controlling Australian-Indonesian summer monsoon variability.\nSpeleothem δ18O and trace element data indicate a rapid increase in rainfall at glacial terminations and wet interglacials. Terminations IV, III, and I are each characterized by an abrupt 3‰ decrease in δ18O. Variability in δ18O leading-in to glacial terminations is also similar, and corresponds to October insolation. Prior to deglaciation, there is a distinct shift to higher δ18O that is synchronized with weak monsoon intervals in Chinese speleothem records. The remarkably consistent pattern among terminations implies that the response of tropical convection to changing background climates is well regulated.\nFurthermore, we find that speleothem δ13C leads δ18O by ~5 kyr during glacial terminations. The early decrease in speleothem δ13C may reflect the response of tropical vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 and temperature, rather than regional changes in rainfall.",

The meridional wind at 850 hPa shows significant QBWO over East Asian winter monsoon region. Both the first two empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) patterns exhibit two centers in (90°-180°E, 10°-60°N), one in the west and the other in the east. The first two principal components (PCs) have significant lag correlation with each other. The first two EOF modes work together to reveal the evolution of QBWO of EAWM. Based on the EOF analysis, we define an QBWO_EAWM index and divide each cycle of QBWO into eight phases. The evolution of winds and geopotential height at 850 hPa have obvious eastward propagation. During Phase 1, there are two pairs of cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations over Europe-Pacific region at mid-latitudes. Corresponding with the winds, there are also two pairs of negative and positive centers in the map of geopotential height, showing an Eurasian teleconnection pattern. During Phase 3, East Asia is mainly subjected to southerly wind. While during Phase 7, the distribution is almost opposite with that during Phase 3, indicating the active phase of EAWM. The QBWO of 300-hPa winds, geopotential height, and sea level pressure also have eastward propagation. The QBWO of EAWM has great impact on East Asian winter climate, including temperature and precipitation. During Phase 3 and Phase 4, there are warm anomaly over East Asia and cold anomaly over Siberia. The precipitation over East Asia shows positive anomaly with the center over central China. While during Phase 7 and Phase 8, most part of East Asia is featured by negative temperature and precipitation anomaly.",

            "abstract": "The Central Rocky Mountains (CRM), located in southern Wyoming, Colorado, and northern New Mexico, are characterized by the highest elevation basins (up to 2500 m) and mountains (over 4000 m) in the North American Cordillera. The timing and drivers for surface uplift of the CRM have not been conclusively determined. The goal of this study is to constrain the timing of surface uplift of the CRM by comparing hydrogen isotope ratios of hydration waters (δDglass) in late Paleogene volcanic glasses preserved in felsic tuffs deposited in CRM basins to δDglass values from glasses of similar age (34.9 to 32.2 Ma) preserved in tuffs from the surrounding Great Plains. The tuffs deposited in the Great Plains, to the north and east of the CRM, are currently at elevations of 1100-1600 m. Volcanic glass hydrates shortly after deposition, preserving the δD of ancient meteoric water on geologic timescales, and can thus be used as a proxy for ancient precipitation δD values. \nVolcanic glasses from the CRM have δDglass values that are an average of ~31‰ higher than δDglass values from the Great Plains, while modern day precipitation δD values in the CRM are ~25‰ lower than δD values in the Great Plains.  These results suggest that the uplift of the CRM relative to the surrounding Great Plains occurred after ~32 Ma. This requires a mechanism such as mantle upwelling or differential crustal hydration, not solely Laramide tectonism, to uplift the CRM to current elevations. Elevation, however, may not have been the only control on the spatial distribution of precipitation δD values across the western US. Similar to the modern, mixing of Pacific and Gulf coast air masses likely occurred during the latest Paleogene, driving regional variability in δD values of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "It has been demonstrated in a number of modeling studies that the tropical circulation of the atmosphere is sensitive to changes in the inter-hemispheric energy budget. Examples of perturbations to the inter-hemispheric energy budget include changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or spatially heterogeneous changes in the distribution of radiatively active aerosols. Whether aspects of the response of the circulation to the forcing are dependent on the forcing’s latitudinal position is the subject of this study. Here we investigate the impact of the location of the asymmetric perturbation on the tropical circulation in the context of the gross moist stability framework using simulations from both an idealized moist model and a comprehensive GCM. In each model we artificially impose a negative radiative forcing between 0 and 30 degrees North and 30 and 90 degrees North, and discuss changes in precipitation patterns, meridional moist static energy transport, zonal mean mass streamfunction, and gross moist stability. In the idealized moist model, for a given asymmetric negative radiative forcing, the ITCZ shift is greater when the forcing is placed in the tropics instead of the extratropics. This difference in behavior can partially be explained by the fact that in the tropical case we decrease the net shortwave radiation at the equator, while in the extratropical case it is left unchanged. From Bischoff and Schneider (2014), decreasing the shortwave radiation at the equator increases the sensitivity of the ITCZ position to the moist static energy flux there. However we show that this increase in sensitivity cannot fully explain the differences seen between the idealized tropical and extratropical cases. In the full GCM, due to zonal asymmetries, the response in the tropical and extratropical cases is more complicated; an interesting result from those cases in the full GCM is that over the Sahel and Maritime Continent we see opposing precipitation responses. Further investigation is required to determine how these differing rainfall patterns can be traced back to the location of the forcing.",

            "abstract": "Apollinaris Patera is one of the largest volcanos on Mars outside of the Tharsis volcanic province (summit relief 5.4 km, volume 7.3x1013 m3). The mapped crater densities on Apollinaris indicate that volcanic activity ended 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. Apollinaris is located on the northern (lowland) side of the martian hemispheric dichotomy. Because it is an isolated, relatively point-like source of volcanism, it is plausibly interpreted as an early example of a martian mantle plume. Plume structure and conditions in the mantle can be constrained using finite element mantle convection simulations combined with a variety of petrological, geophysical, and geologic observations. (1) Basalts studied by the MER Spirit rover in nearby Gusev crater are similar in age and possibly physically connected to Apollinaris Patera. Petrologic modeling of the Gusev crater basalt compositions indicates that the thermal lithosphere was about 100 km thick with a mantle potential temperature of 1480-1530 °C. This requires a mantle thermal Rayleigh number of about 2x108 at the time of volcanism, based on the volume-averaged mantle viscosity. (2) Pyroclastic deposits at Apollinaris indicate that at least a portion of the volcanism occurred in the presence of a high concentration of water or other volatiles. This lowers the solidus temperature and increases the magma production rate but has only a limited effect on the minimum depth of melting. (3) There is a localized magnetic anomaly beneath Apollinaris that indicates that the martian core dynamo persisted until at least the earliest stage of Apollinaris volcanism, which in turn sets a lower bound on the core heat flux of 5-10 mW m-2. Preservation of the magnetic field may be the result of formation of magnetic minerals such as magnetite due to volcanically-driven hydrothermal alteration of crustal rocks beneath Apollinaris.",

            "abstract": "The Japanese Alps region is known to experience some of the heaviest snowfall in the world. In this region, precipitation brought by snowfall is more important as a water resource than rainfall. This region experiences exceptionally heavy snowfall that is extreme even by world standard, and in spring, the melting snow becomes a valuable water resource for the region. Snow plays the role of a natural white dam by accumulating in watersheds during winter.\nRecent studies have reported that the amount of snowfall in Japan will decrease as a result of global warming. However, these studies used data observed at low altitudes. The question arises whether the same theory can be applied to high-altitude mountain areas. Observations of the amount of snow have not been carried out in high-altitude mountain in Japan where the temperature is colder than the threshold temperature of snow/rain even with the temperature rise observed in recent years. Therefore, we cannot discuss the effect of global warming on the change in the amount of snow in the mountainous region of Japan based on observation data. Therefore, in this study, we discuss the relationship between snowmelt runoff and the amount of snow using observation data for the Japanese Alps catchment and present the results of some meteorological observations we carried out at high-altitude sites in the Japanese Alps region.",

            "abstract": "Excess pore pressure can be generated along or near interfaces of plate boundary at subduction zones, which is predicted by seismic velocities, and it is a key to understand coseismic slip behaviors during large earthquakes. Evolution of permeability within fault zones and upper sediments during burial and subduction is one of possible mechanisms that generate excess fluid pressure. This evolution process for sediment materials has been reported in previous studies, though the permeability evolution for oceanic crust, which also controls the pore pressure distribution around plate boundary, is not known well. Basalt brocks in the Cretaceous Shimanto accretionary complex of Japan preserve paleo Nankai Subduction structure, and based on vitrinite reflectance, Ro, for neighbor sedimentary rocks, basalt brocks at different areas show different degree of alteration. Therefore, the evolution of fluid transport properties for oceanic basalt at Nankai Subduction zone is estimated by comparing transport properties for various basaltic rocks from the on shore Shimanto belt, South-western Japan.\nWe measured the rock physical properties from Okitsu-Kozurutsu, Kure, Mugi, and Makimine sites in the southeast Japan. Permeability and porosity was measured at room temperature and under confining pressure from 1 to 160 MPa. The steady state gas flow method was applied to evaluate permeability by using nitrogen gas as a pore fluid. Permeability decreases from 10-18 to 10-22 m2 with an increase in the degree of alteration from 1 to 4.5 of Ro (Maximum paleo-temperatures are 80 and 320 oC, respectively). Porosity was also decreased from 5 to 0.5 % with alteration. The relationship between permeability and porosity is described by power law. Our results suggest that based on the evolution curves of permeability and porosity and dehydration rate, porosity reduction in oceanic basalt will contribute to pore pressure generation at shallower subduction zone. On the other hand, clay dehydration will influence more on the pore pressure rise at greater depth. Excess pore pressure can be formed more easily at greater depth.",

This year the focus was on Aizawl, the capital of India's Mizoram state, situated on a ridge in the Burma Ranges. Nearby sources have the potential for large (M > 7) earthquakes that would be devastating to the approximately 300,000 people living in the city. Earthquake induced landslides also threaten the population as well as the city’s lifelines. Fieldwork conducted in June 2015 identified hazards to vital water system components. The focus of this abstract is a review of the seismic hazards that affect Aizawl, with special attention paid to water system locations. To motivate action to reduce risk, GHI created an earthquake scenario describing effects of a M7 right-lateral strike-slip intraplate earthquake occurring 30 km below the city. We extended this analysis by exploring additional mapped faults as well as hypothetical blind reverse faults in terms of PGA, PGV, and PSA. Ground motions with hanging wall and directivity effects were also examined. Several attenuation relationships were used in order to assess the uncertainty in the ground motion parameters. Results were used to determine the likely seismic performance of water system components, and will be applied in future PSHA studies.",

            "abstract": "Planetary science is naturally focussed on the issues of the origin and history of solar systems, especially our own. The implications of an early turbulent history of our solar system reach into many areas including the origin of Earth's oceans, of ores in the Earth's crust and possibly the seeding of life. There are however other areas of science that stand to be developed greatly by planetary missions, primarily to small solar system bodies.\nThe physics of granular materials has been well-studied in Earth's gravity, but lacks a general theory. Because of the compacting effects of gravity, some experiments desired for testing these theories remain impossible on Earth. Studying the behavior of a micro-gravity rubble pile -- such as many asteroids are believed to be -- could provide a new route towards exploring general principles of granular physics. These same studies would also prove valuable for planning missions to sample these same bodies, as techniques for anchoring and deep sampling are difficult to plan in the absence of such knowledge.\nIn materials physics, first-principles total-energy calculations for compounds of a given stoichiometry have identified metastable, or even stable, structures distinct from known structures obtained by synthesis under laboratory conditions. The conditions in the proto-planetary nebula, in the slowly cooling cores of planetesimals, and in the high speed collisions of planetesimals and their derivatives, are all conditions that cannot be achieved in the laboratory. Large samples from comets and asteroids offer the chance to find crystals with these as-yet unobserved structures as well as more exotic materials. Some of these could have unusual properties important for materials science. Meteorites give us a glimpse of these exotic materials, several dozen of which are known that are unique to meteorites. But samples retrieved directly from small bodies in space will not have been affected by atmospheric entry, warmth or weathering. We give examples from both of these fields of enquiry.",

The system was evaluated through data assimilation cycle experiments over a one-month period from July to August 2014, during which a tropical cyclone as well as severe rainfall events occurred. The results showed that the data assimilation cycle with the coupled model could reproduce SST distributions realistically even without updating SST and salinity during the data assimilation cycle. Therefore, atmospheric variables and radiation applied as a forcing to ocean models can control oceanic variables to some extent in the current data assimilation configuration. However, investigations of the forecast error covariance estimated in EnKF revealed that the correlation between atmospheric and oceanic variables could possibly lead to less flow-dependent error covariance for atmospheric variables owing to the difference in the time scales between atmospheric and oceanic variables. A verification of the analyses showed positive impacts of applying the ocean model to EnKF on precipitation forecasts. The use of EnKF with the coupled model system captured intensity changes of a tropical cyclone better than it did with an uncoupled atmosphere model, even though the impact on the track forecast was negligibly small.",

Each sample contained a lime-to-pozzolana ratio of 1:2 by weight and a water-to-binder (pozzolana plus lime) ratio of 0.4 by weight. Neapolitan Yellow tuff made up 20% of the weight of the mixture. To mimic the conditions of the caldera, we used mineral seawater from a well in the Campi Flegrei region rich in sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium, potassium, and magnesium ions. The samples were cured under steam conditions as well. We measured baseline properties of porosity, permeability, and the acoustic velocity through the samples in order to calculate the bulk, shear, and Young’s modulus. Subsequently, half of the samples were injected with CO2- rich aqueous solution and the changes in their microstructure and physical properties measured.\nOur findings show how a steam- and sulfur-alkaline- rich environment affects both transport and elastic properties of the samples and how they may change in response to microstructural changes due to potential chemical instabilities such as possible new flux of CO2 into a volcanic-hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of soil temperature are of particular importance in describing many hydrological and biological processes. Soil temperature predictions in the popular hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), are largely incorrect when applied to regions with significant snow cover in winter. In this study, a new physically-based formulation of soil temperature is developed as an alternative to the empirical soil temperature module currently used in SWAT. The physically-based formulation simulates soil temperature in different soil layers as a result of energy transfer amongst the atmosphere, snow, and soil layers. With the new soil temperature formulation, the only additional inputs for the modified SWAT are three new parameters, which need to be calibrated. Both the original and modified versions of SWAT are tested against field data collected from the Black Brook Watershed, a small watershed in Atlantic Canada. The results indicate that both versions of SWAT are able to provide acceptable predictions of temperature in different soil layers during the non-winter period of the year. However, the original SWAT severely underestimates soil temperatures in winter (within a range of -10 to -20˚C), while the new version produces results that are more consistent with field-based temperatures (within a range of -2 to 2˚C). Furthermore, water discharges, sediment and nutrient loadings estimated using the modified SWAT was compared against the original SWAT and field measurements for the same watershed. The results demonstrates that modified SWAT enhances the modelling accuracies on baseflow discharge, sediment, NO3-N and Sol-P loadings in the watershed because the new soil temperature module improves soil temperature simulation accuracy in winter. Moreover, this study also investigates the differences between the original and modified SWAT in determining water flow paths and nutrients fates in the watershed. Compared with the original SWAT, the modified SWAT predicts less surface runoff, lower soil moisture content but more percolation and lateral flow, especially for the winter period. Similarly, the modified SWAT predicts less nitrate loading with surface runoff while more nitrate loading with lateral flow and percolation in winter but less in other seasons.",

Mafic dyke swarms associated with LIPs are therefore important for testing plume and non-plume related models for their formation as well as for understanding global tectonics and geodynamics. The Archean Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia and the Archean and Proterozoic Vestfold Hills and Bunger Hills cratonic blocks in East Antarctica are intruded by a large number of mafic and ultramafic dykes of different ages, orientations and magnetic signatures. Only a small fraction of these dykes have precise isotopic ages or systematic geochemical and paleomagnetic data. In the Yilgarn, previous studies have identified several dyke generations with two major suites at ca. 2.4 Ga and 1.2 Ga. At Vestfold Hills, geochronology and geochemical data have shown presence of at least five different dyke generations. No precise isotope ages for mafic dykes at Bunger Hills exist but previous work suggest that five compositionally distinctive dyke suites exist. We present new in situ SHRIMP U-Pb data for two previously unreported dyke suites in the southern Yilgarn and provide first high precision isotope ages for two dykes at Bunger Hills. Petrography and Ar/Ar ages from mafic dykes at Vestfold Hills reveal metamorphic and metasomatic events with implications for interpretation of paleomagnetic data.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes a stand-alone runoff routing tool, mizuRoute, which post-processes runoff outputs from any distributed hydrologic model or land surface model to produce spatially distributed streamflow at various spatial scales from headwater basins to continental-wide river systems. The tool utilizes vector-based river network data, which includes river segment lines and the associated drainage basin polygons. Streamflow estimates at any desired location in the river network can be easily extracted from the output of mizuRoute. The first step of the routing tool is hillslope routing, which uses a gamma distribution to construct a unit-hydrograph that represents the transport of runoff from a hillslope to an outlet of the catchment. The second step is river channel routing, which is performed with one of two routing scheme options: a) the kinematic wave tracking (KWT) routing procedure; and 2) the impulse response function - unit hydrograph (IRF-UH) routing procedure.\nThis presentation demonstrate mizuRoute’s capabilities to produce spatially distributed streamflow simulations based on the river network data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geospatial Fabric (GF) dataset, which contains over 54000 river segments across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We routed ensemble of 150 years runoff simulated with Variable Infiltration Capacity Model forced by climate data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. A brief analysis of the routing model parameter sensitivity is also presented.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and LCROSS have provided an avalanche of new data regarding the lunar poles: LCROSS directly detected water vapor and other volatiles in its impact plume; LRO LAMP has detected surface frost using UV ratios; LEND has refined understanding of the distribution of hydrogen; LOLA and LAMP have showed that the spectral properties of permanently shadowed regions (PSR) are anomalous and may be due to unusual surface texture or altered space weathering; Diviner shows both where the coldest portions of the poles exist, and its quantitative results show where temperatures are low enough to preserve water ice at depth, well outside the PSRs. Yet while we are data rich, our understanding of the lunar poles is maddeningly poor. Our poverty of understanding is made even more baffling by the MESSENGER results from Mercury. At Mercury's poles the distribution of volatiles is dictated by temperature: where subsurface temperatures inferred from topography are consistent with long term preservation of water ice, radar anomalies indicating thick ice are present; where surface temperatures are consistent with preservation of surface frost, high reflectance anomalies indicating surface frost are revealed by laser reflectance. The distribution of water ice on Mercury is well understood.\nIn contrast, temperature is only a weak indicator of the presence of volatiles at the lunar poles; there is little ability to predict the location and abundance of hydrogen or water. The difference may in the age of the volatile deposits on the two planets. Turn the clock forward a few billion years on Mercury and the deposits may appear more lunar. Surface lag deposits may have long ago succumbed to impact gardening, as has much of the shallow buried ice. Ice retained could be patchy, and confined to the coldest places that may tend to preserve it more effectively, even when finely comminuted. Lunar polar volatiles, a possible relic of an ancient, Mercury-like deposit, may retain evidence of that state, modified by several billion years of impact gardening and space weathering.",

            "abstract": "We previously investigated Saturn’s sub-corotating mass-loaded spiraling magnetosphere using observations of Bφ (the azimuthal magnetic field component) in14 identical Cassini orbits near midnight in the Southern hemisphere from 0° to -80 °latitude . The basic equation representing the Magnetospheric- Ionospheric- Interaction (M-I-A), developed by Hill (1979) for Jupiter and modified by Cowley and Bunce (2002) for Saturn, is: Ip = Σp (1- ω/Ωs). Ip is the Ionospheric Pedersen Current; G is obtained from ionospheric radius, Ri, colatitude, θi, and the planetary magnetic field, Bs; Σp is altitude-integrated Pedersen conductivity; ω and Ωs are the angular rotation rates of the magnetospheric field and of Saturn Kilometric Radiation, a proxy for the planetary field rotation. The relation should hold irrespective of how the mass originates an important consideration since plasma injections are frequently imposed on radial outflow from the inner magnetosphere and used to obtain ω. Ampere’s law relates Ip (Ri, θi) to Bφ (r, θ, radial distance and colatitude). It has been found that I/G = A exp(-Bθi), an exponential dependence that was not predicted, and implies that A= Σp while the exponential yields (1- ω/Ωs) so ω(θi) is determined. The derived values of ω yield a quasi-linear function of equatorial distance or L. (This dependence and an alternative expression for Ip/G also imply that ionospheric neutrals rotate at the same rate as Bs). Σp varies between 7.5 and 1.1 mho and ω(L) also varies significantly orbit-to-orbit. These are temporal variations since the orbits are spatially identical. ω(L) has been compared with ω(L) in publications based on azimuthal rotation velocity, Vφ. Hill(1979) is used to study M*, the rate of mass outflow. The general approach above has now been applied to the Northern hemisphere and the same 14 orbits. We report on the important issue of North-South symmetries and asymmetries.\n.",

Loss by relativistic electron microbursts has been considered as an important loss mechanism of radiation belt electrons. Here we report relationship between relativistic electron microbursts and flux variation of trapped MeV electrons during the 9 October 2012 storm, based on the SAMPEX and Van Allen Probes observations. Observations by the satellites show that relativistic electron microbursts are associated well with rapid enhancement of trapped MeV electron fluxes, indicating that acceleration by chorus is much more efficient than the microburst loss. The observations also show a lack of both strong microburst activities and significant MeV electron flux variations in association with strong chorus wave activities. These results suggest that the microburst loss does not always contribute to relativistic electron flux dropout during the main phase of geomagnetic storms. We also suggest that relativistic electron microbursts can be a proxy of efficient acceleration of MeV electrons by chorus.",

They are a significant source of dissolved Fe, a critical micronutrient in the ocean, and they are a primary source of CO2 from the mantle, Earth’s largest carbon reservoir. Although more than a hundred modern hydrothermal systems have been discovered, few records of their variation through geological time have been obtained. Sediments near ocean ridges hold the potential to provide such records, and here we investigate sediments near the Juan de Fuca Ridge through continuous XRF scans coupled with oxygen isotope temporal constraints to explore hydrothermal activity over the past 600,000 years. These are the first records over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles and permit investigation of potential feedbacks between glacial-interglacial climate change and hydrothermal activity.\nToday, hydrothermal activity on the Juan de Fuca Ridge is characterized by hydrothermal particles with high concentrations of Fe, Cu, and Zn (Feely et. al., 1987). Over longer time scales, Fe concentrations are positively correlated with Ti (r2≥0.75), so that the dominant variability in Fe is due to the input of lithogenic material. Additional Fe inputs from hydrothermal activity increase the Fe/Ti ratio above the lithogenic value of 11.7 wt%/wt%. Intense hydrothermal activity (Fe/Ti > 25 wt%/wt%) is observed on the Juan de Fuca Ridge from ~375-430ka, and less intense but still elevated hydrothermal activity (Fe/Ti > 17 wt%/wt%) recurs at near 100kyr cyclicity, from 80-120ka, 180-220ka, 290-330ka, and 470-520ka.

One of the main difficulties is that it requires following both the evolution of the large-scale interaction, and the details of the kinetic processes that enable transport of energy and mass in localized regions of the magnetospheric boundary. To approach this multiscale problem, we have carried out 2½ dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the dayside magnetopause using simulation domains that are large enough to include large-scale features of the solar wind interaction with the geomagnetic field (e.g., field curvature and plasma asymmetries). The computational challenge is addressed by using the results of global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to provide initial and boundary conditions for a two-dimensional version of the implicit iPic3d simulation code. We discuss the PIC simulation results in the context of the initial steady MHD state and spacecraft observations to highlight the effects of kinetic processes. In particular, we analyze the wave activity and follow the evolution of particle distributions in different regions of the simulations to assess plasma transport at the magnetospheric boundary.",

Especially, biochar is effective for removal of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) due to high surface area and porosity. In this study, the sorption characteristic of biochar-amended soil was evaluated by sorption kinetic experiment of phenanthrene (PHE). For PHE sorption test, the effect of biochar feedstock (sludge waste char (SWC), municipal waste char (MWC) and wood char (WC), Giant Miscanthus (GM)), pyrolysis temperature (400°C, 500°C and 700°C,), and duration of amending period (0, 3, 6, and 12 months) was assessed. Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques were used to detect pore structure and the surface functional group of biochar amended soils. \nFor all kinetic tests, apparent sorption equilibrium was attained in 24 hr. The result showed that sorption capacity of biochar amended soils was greatly influenced by biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. For all samples, the sorption capacity of PHE by biochar amended soils decreased with aging period. This observation is due to the fact that the aromatic characters of biochar are different by feedstock and pyrolysis temperature and the amount of O-containing hydrophilic functional groups increased surfaces of biochar by natural oxidation (e.g. carboxyl groups) as confirmed by the result of FT-IR and FE-SEM. In addition, biochar pore blockage by inorganic minerals, which tended to increase with aging period, might attenuate the sorption capacity of samples. In conclusion, biochar derived from various feed stocks are all effective for PHE sorption. But the sorption capacity of biochar amended soils decreased with increasing aging duration most likely due to increasing hydrophilic functional groups of biochar surfaces and pore blockage by inorganic minerals in the weathering processes. Therefore, for the design of biochar amendment to attenuate environmental risk of hydrophobic chemicals (e.g., PHE) in soil system, the effect of weathering on its sorption capacity must be considered.",

Synthetic precipitation experiments provide an opportunity to study boron systematics without biological interference, and recent studies (e.g., Uchikawa et al., 2015, GCA v150, 171-191) suggest that boron incorporation (measured as B/Ca ratios) into synthetic carbonates varies both with the elemental composition of experimental seawater and precipitation rate. Here we extend the geochemical characterization of synthetic calcite by investigating the influences of changing solution chemistry (pH, [Ca2+], [DIC] and [B]) and precipitation rate on their boron isotopic composition. Our results will be evaluated in the context of carbonate precipitation rates, modes of boron incorporation, and changing seawater chemistry through geologic time.",

            "abstract": "Spectral unmixing is the process of decomposing the measured spectrum of a mixed pixel into a set of pure spectral signatures called endmembers and their corresponding abundances indicating the fractional area coverage of each endmember present in the pixel. A substantial number of spectral unmixing studies rely on a spectral mixture model which assumes that spectral mixing only occurs within the extent of a pixel. However, due to adjacency effect, the spectral measurement of the pixel may be contaminated by spatial interactions from materials that are present in its spatial neighborhood. In this paper, a linear spatial spectral mixture model is developed to improve the accuracy of the estimated abundance of invasive saltcedar along the Forgotten River reach of the Rio Grande. A spatial weights matrix which specifies for each pixel the locations and the weights of its neighborhood set is used to summarize the spatial relationships among pixels in the Landsat data. A spatial lag operator, defined as a weighted average of the values at neighboring locations, is adopted as an expression of spectral contribution from nearby pixels and added to the classic linear mixture model. The fractional abundances are iteratively estimated using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. With the incorporation of adjacency effect, RMSEs of the fractional cover of ground classes were reduced. The derived sub-pixel abundances of saltcedar are beneficial for ecological management.",

            "abstract": "Species do not live in isolation, but adapt and ultimately, evolve, in relationship with other species as well as with their chemical and physical environment. In the marine environment, this interaction is intimately two-way – the surface biogeochemical environment modulates the makeup of the pelagic ecosystem, yet at the same time, the ecosystem assemblage, by setting the strength of the biological pump and ultimately, in regulating the carbon and nutrient inventory of the ocean and atmospheric pCO2, influences the surface geochemical environment. Feedbacks, both negative and positive, must therefore exist between plankton ecology and global biogeochemical cycles. This has implications for understanding the geological record and particularly the response and recovery of marine ecosystems following major environmental perturbation, but also complicates making projections of future ocean changes.\nTo address a coupled system such as this, new numerical tools are needed as traditional ‘functional type’ marine ecosystem models are generally incapable of accounting for short-term adaptation, let alone long-term evolution. What is needed is the combination of a plankton model able to simulate a highly diverse ecology plus ‘genetic’ mutation (changes in trait value(s)) and extinction, *and* an Earth system model capable of simulating long-term evolution of the climatology and geochemistry of the ocean. The Earth system model ‘cGENIE’ – http://mycgenie.seao2.org generally fills the second criteria, so for this presentation I will focus on the structure of the ecosystem model, the associated methodology, and numerical techniques for dealing with what will turn out to be an exceptionally large number of ocean tracers.

            "abstract": "In the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS), the failure of both passive and active models of decompression melting to explain unusually voluminous Cenozoic volcanism has prompted debate about the roles of thermal plume-related melting and ancient subduction-related flux melting. The latter is supported by ~500 Ma of subduction along the paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana[1], a process capable of generating easily fusible, volatile-rich lithologies and producing the broad seismic low-velocity anomaly imaged beneath the Southern Ocean[2]. We present new geochemical information from submarine lavas in the Ross Sea and subaerial lavas from Franklin Island, Beaufort Island, and Mt. Melbourne in Northern Victoria Land (NVL) supportive of an evolving fluxed mantle source. Lavas exhibit ocean island basalt (OIB)-like trace element signatures and isotopic affinities for the C/FOZO mantle endmember consistent with subduction processing of recycled ocean lithosphere. Lava major-oxide compositions suggest multiple recycled source components, including pyroxenite (associated with older lavas), amphibole-rich metasomes, and volatilized peridotite (associated with the youngest lavas). In-situ analyses of olivine-hosted melt inclusions (MIs) from a subset of host lavas confirm high H2O and CO2 ranging up to 2.94 wt % and 4657 ppm, respectively. MIs exhibit OIB-like trace element compositions and Ba/Rb and Rb/Sr consistent with melting in the presence of hydrated, amphibole-bearing lithosphere[3,4]. We interpret these observations as evidence that ongoing tectonomagmatic activity in the WARS is facilitated by melting of subduction-modified mantle generated by 550 – 100 Ma Gondwana subduction. Following radiogenic ingrowth in high-µ (U/Pb) domains, Cenozoic extension triggered decompression melting of easily fusible, hydrated metasomes and volatilized mantle. This multistage magma model attempts to reconcile geochemical observations with increasing geophysical evidence that the seismic anomaly imaged beneath West Antarctica and the Southern Ocean may be in part a compositional structure related to previous active margin tectonics.\n[1] Mukasa & Dalziel, 2000, GSA Bulletin, 112(4)\n[2] Finn et al., 2005, G3, 6(2)\n[3] Furman & Graham, 1999, Lithos, 48\n[4] Pilet et al., 2008, Science, 320(5878)",

            "abstract": "Soils contain the largest terrestrial carbon pool on Earth, and approximately one-third of soil carbon is stored in the tropics. Gas exchange between soil and the atmosphere occurs largely as a result of microbial degradation (mineralization) of organic carbon. The rate of soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization is determined by a combination of climatic factors and soil ecosystem properties, which dictate the dominant metabolic pathway(s) within soil at a given time; major changes in metabolic rate are particularly pronounced between aerobic and anaerobic mineralization. Here we assessed the impact of soil moisture, a major factor determining soil anaerobiosis, on greenhouse gas fluxes in a tropical, seasonally flooded wetland in the Mekong Delta. We monitored CO2, CH4, and N2O gas fluxes, porewater chemistry, and soil moisture content in a seasonal wetland. Additionally, we collected wetland soil cores (10 cm diameter) and manipulated them in the laboratory, allowing us to control soil moisture and drying rates, and to simulate multiple periods of wetting and drying.\nDuring drying, CH4 fluxes within the wetland initially increase to a maximum before decreasing as soil moisture decreases and oxygen diffusion into the soil increases. Maximum CH4 fluxes vary with moisture content, but the wettest sites produced fluxes >1000 mg C m-2 d-1 for short periods of time. As drying continues, CH4 fluxes decrease to nearly zero, and N2O fluxes begin to increase to ~3 mg N m-2 d-1 but do not appear to have reached a maximum before sampling ceased.\nGas flux from soil core incubations (n=5) exhibit trends and values similar to field measurements. CH4 fluxes initially increase and reach >1000 mg C m-2 d-1 in cores while N2O fluxes reach up to 10 mg N m-2 d-1 and decrease with continued drying. CO2 fluxes in both field and laboratory are sustained until near desiccated conditions.\nSeasonal wetlands are characteristic of large tropical deltas. Our findings provide a means to assess the effects of changing moisture regimes, which are being altered by upstream dam installation and local land use change, on greenhouse gas emissions.",

            "abstract": "Venus has nearly the same diameter and bulk composition as Earth, yet lacks a dynamo and evidence for plate tectonics. Its dense CO2 greenhouse creates a surface T of 460°C. Orbital and landed spectroscopy indicate a basaltic crust, with possible analogs to terrestrial continents. Radar images and altimetry reveal a volcanic surface, with regions of intense tectonic deformation, including rifts, mountain belts and large, intensely deformed plateaus. The sparse impact craters give a resurfacing age of 0.3-1 b.y. Their distribution cannot be distinguished from a random one, and fit models with either a single, rapid resurfacing pulse or ongoing resurfacing. Incorporating geologic constraints favors ongoing resurfacing. Ar isotope data indicate less interior outgassing than Earth, assuming a similar volatile inventory. Gravity and topography data, along with geologic features, provide evidence for ~10 large mantle plumes, similar to the number on Earth. The gravity/topography data at these hotspots suggests no low viscosity zone, perhaps implying a dry interior. Positive thermal emissivity from the Venus Express mission correlate with volcanic flows at several hotspots and can be interpreted as unweathered basalt, implying geologically recent activity. In addition, there are ~500 coronae, which are unique to Venus and likely form via small-scale upwelling, downwelling, or a combination. Many of the larger coronae may be sites of plume-induced subduction (see Davaille abstract), although subduction does not appear to create plates. I will discuss possible reasons Venus and Earth may have evolved differently and supporting evidence from surface observations. Did early impact or magma ocean history modify interior volatile or radiogenic content? Does high surface T and its effect on rheology and mineralogy inhibit plate tectonics? What is the evidence for a wet or dry interior? What could new missions tell us about these questions?",

            "abstract": "The gravity field and topography of Mercury measured by the MESSENGER spacecraft have provided insights into the thickness of the planet’s elastic lithosphere, Te. We localized the HgM006 free-air gravity anomaly and gtmes_125v03 shape datasets to search for theoretical elastic thickness solutions that best fit a variety of localized coherence spectra between Bouguer gravity anomaly and topography. We adopted a crustal density of ρcrust =2700 kg m-3 for the Bouguer gravity correction, but density uncertainty did not markedly affect the elastic thickness estimates. A best-fit solution in the northern smooth plains (NSP) gives an elastic thickness of Te =30–60 km at the time of formation of topography for a range of ratios of top to bottom loading from 1 to 5. For a mechanical lithosphere with a thickness of ~2Te and a temperature of 1600 °C at the base, this solution is consistent with a geothermal gradient of 9–18 K km-1. A similar coherence analysis exterior to the NSP produces an elastic thickness estimate of Te =20–50 km, albeit with a poorer fit. Coherence in the northern hemisphere as a whole does not approach zero at any wavelength, because of the presence of variations in crustal thickness that are unassociated with elastic loading.\nThe ratios and correlations of gravity and topography at intermediate wavelengths (harmonic degree l between 30 and 50) also constrain regional crustal densities. We localized gravity and topography with a moving Slepian taper and calculated regionally averaged crustal densities with the approximation ρcrust=Zl/(2πG), where Zl is the localized admittance and G is the gravitational constant. The only regional density estimates greater than 2000 kg m-3 for l=30 correspond to the NSP. Density estimates outside of the NSP were unreasonably low, even for highly porous crust. We attribute these low densities to the confounding effects of crustal thickness variations and Kaula filtering of the gravity dataset at the highest harmonic degrees, both of which tend to introduce a downward bias to crustal density estimation. An alternative analysis—which corrected for crustal thickness variability and was restricted to regions with gravity/topography coherence greater than 0.6—yielded an aggregate crustal density of ρcrust=2602 ± 470 kg m-3 for Mercury’s high northern latitudes.",

We have performed receiver function (RF) analyses using the waveform data, for detecting velocity discontinuities in the upper mantle, and have understood that it is essential to reveal shallower structure (especially structure of sediment) for elucidating the upper mantle structure using RFs (Abe et al., 2014, SSJ meeting; 2015, JpGU meeting). Therefore, we attempted to estimate the shallower structure by using power spectrum and auto correlation function (ACF) of ambient noise in addition to RFs.\nPower spectrum of horizontal seismogram of a BBOBS has several peaks due to resonances of S wave in the sediment. Godin & Chapman (1999, J. Acoust. Soc. Am.) introduced a method to estimate a 1-D velocity distribution in the sediment from the resonance frequencies. From the location of spectral peaks of a station (NM14), we estimated the velocity distribution to be Vs(z) = 0.519z0.473 (Vs: S wave velocity (km/s), z: depth (km)), assuming a sediment layer thickness of 0.3 km. Two way S wave travel time in this sediment corresponds to the arrival time of a prominent negative ACF peak of horizontal seismogram of the station. On the other hand, for P-wave RFs (0.4-2.0 Hz) of the station, the arrival time of the first positive peak is not explained only by the estimated sediment structure, and another discontinuity located a few hundred meters deeper than the bottom of the sediment is necessary to explain it.\nWe attempt to constrain the structure of the sediment and shallow portion of the oceanic crust by analyzing RF waveforms in more detail that also explains power spectrum and ACF of ambient noise.",

For high-temperature thermogenic methane, which typically achieves internal equilibrium, an excess of 13CH3D is expected and the amount of excess can serve as a thermometer. In contrast, biogenic methane often – though not always – has a smaller excess of clumped isotopologues, and sometimes even a deficit of clumped species (“anti-clumped”). The effect presumably arises from kinetic isotope effects accompanying enzymatic reactions in the methanogenic pathway, though the particular reaction(s) has not yet been positively identified. The decrease in clumping is also known to correlate with both the reversibility of the pathway and the methane flux.\nIn this talk, we will present recent data bearing on the origin and utility of biologic fractionations of clumped isotopologues in methane. Preliminary data suggest that methane deriving from the fermentative pathway is enriched in D-bearing isotopologues, at the same level of clumping, relative to that derived from the CO2-reductive pathway. This property offers another potential means to distinguish biogenic methane sources in the environment. Recently, we have also begun to measure the 12CH2D2 isotopologue, for which equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects are predicted to be distinct from 13CH3D. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of both doubly-substituted isotopologues will be especially useful for disentangling mixtures containing biogenic gas.",

            "abstract": "The fate of solutes, nutrients and contaminants are regulated by the time that precipitation takes to travel through landscapes to reach surface waters and aquifers. Water samples collected from a stream or a groundwater well are a mixture of younger and older precipitation inputs. However, the global 3D distribution of younger versus older water flowing in rivers or stored in groundwater aquifers is not known, in part due to a longstanding focus on average age rather than age distributions. Here we analyze global rain, snow, groundwater and streamflow isotope contents, compiled from primary literature sources or specialist databases. Instead of calculating average water ages, we use the isotope data to partition fractions of younger versus older water in 260 rivers and 202 aquifers. For global rivers, we show that precipitation reaching the stream in less than 1.5-3 months generates a substantial fraction (~35%) of global runoff and constitutes an important component (>5%) of streamflow draining the great majority (90%) of watersheds. We also show that ~35% of global runoff is generated by a microscopic fraction (<0.01%) of global groundwater storage, meaning that biogeochemical processes taking place in these aquifer-stream connectivity hotspots will have disproportionately large impacts on stream water quality. By contrast, radiocarbon dating shows that most (>50%) groundwaters are relicts of ancient climates, having recharged their aquifers prior to the current Holocene epoch. Our study, that partitions both surface- and ground-water ages, shows that much of global streamflow is at least four orders of magnitude younger than most of global groundwater storage, highlighting that most stream water is far younger than most groundwater stored in their catchments.",

            "abstract": "The ecological and social values of forests have recently been highlighted. Assessments of the biodiversity of forests, as well as their other ecological values, play an important role in regional and national conservation planning. The preservation of habitats is linked to the protection of biodiversity. For mapping habitats, species distribution model (SDM) is used for predicting suitable habitat of significant species, and such distribution modeling is increasingly being used in conservation science. However, the pixel-based analysis does not contain contextual or topological information. In order to provide more accurate habitats predictions, a continuous field view that assumes the real world is required. Here we analyze and compare at different scales, habitats of the Yellow Marten’s(Martes Flavigula), which is a top predator and also an umbrella species in South Korea. The object-scale, which is a group of pixels that have similar spatial and spectral characteristics, and pixel-scale were used for SDM. Our analysis using the SDM at different scales suggests that object-scale analysis provides a superior representation of continuous habitat, and thus will be useful in forest conservation planning as well as for species habitat monitoring.",

The first phase during the fall of 2015 will include retrofitting eight Grade 5 classrooms. This new program will show the daily energy usage data from these classrooms. The Grade 5 students receive feedback on their energy use in real time as they compete over two months in their homeroom classes to lower their electrical use, and subsequently their carbon footprint. This competition style initiative will teach the 180 Grade 5 students about their energy usage in a fun and informative manner. ISF Academy has over 400 air-conditioners and we have already determined that the air conditioners are the largest single use of energy in the school.\nThe energy tracking system installed and maintained by from Global Design Corporation utilizes uniquely identified current detectors attached to circuit breakers, to monitor electrical use of individual circuits. These detectors will also monitor the energy used for classroom lighting, fans and plugs, as well as the air conditioners. The system has been installed and the Grade 5 classrooms averaged between 40 kWh and 120 kWh of usage in May 2015. This data will be used as the baseline for the competition.\nFurther analysis can also be done with the data, such as calculating the carbon emissions reduction throughout the school year, providing possible class learning activities and also aiding in future energy use and carbon footprint predictions. The data collected will help refine phase 2 and 3 of the installation, expanding the system to more buildings and also giving insight to the rollout of the system to the whole school when the systems are fully in place.",

            "abstract": "Basal friction and ice viscosity are both essential controls on glacier motion that cannot be measured by remote sensing. In order to initialize models, it is common practice to use inverse methods to determine the basal shear stress over grounded ice and the viscosity of floating ice. It is difficult to quantify the uncertainty in the inferred parameters due to the computational expense of the procedure, the choice of regularization parameter, and the errors in the various measurements used as input, as well as differences in inversion method. Various methods can be used to perform the inversion, and these differing procedures cause discrepancies in the inferred properties of the ice streams. Additionally, the inferred parameters depend on the sophistication of the approximation for ice flow that is used, e.g. full-Stokes or the shallow-shelf approximation.\nWe analyze the impact the choices of modeling procedure and inversion method have on inferred ice properties. To do this we perform a number of inversions for basal shear stress and for ice shelf viscosity over Smith, Pope, and Kohler Glaciers in West Antarctica and assess the sensitivity to modelers' choices. We use both a three dimensional full-Stokes model and a two dimensional shallow-shelf model, with both Robin and adjoint type inversion procedures, to infer basal shear stress and ice viscosity. We compare the results of these different methods and evaluate their implication on uncertainty in the unknown parameters.",

            "abstract": "In the past, lightning interferometric mapping systems assumed that a source is very far from the measurement location. The assumption greatly simplifies the mathematics needed to locate the source, but the resulting source positions are limited to two spatial dimensions (azimuth and elevation). For short baseline systems, this assumption is very good because the source is almost always much farther away than the diameter of the array, making three-dimensional location all but impossible. By removing the far-field assumption, if the array is large enough it is possible to locate the source in three spatial dimensions using purely interferometric techniques. The purely interferometric method is quite different from the more typical time-of-arrival method. Instead of measuring arrival times or time differences of the radiation arriving at each station, a volume is imaged over a some integration period and then searched for a source. It is not necessary to know that a source exists in the integration period for the interferometric imaging technique to produce a well defined solution. Interferometric imaging can locate sources buried in noise, can locate both continuous and impulsive emission, and is capable of locating multiple simultaneously radiating sources. If the waveforms are corrected for propagation delay to the search volume, the integration period can be made arbitrarily small (limited only by the frequencies being observed), allowing the progression of lightning to be examined in detail. Near-field interferometry works equally well on a wide range of different signal types, from the LF to VHF bands in radio, or even on acoustic emissions from lightning. Near-field imaging can be used to correct the angular locations of short baseline systems when a source is very close to the array, or to produce full three-dimensional maps of lightning with long baseline arrays. Presented here are preliminary results of applying near-field interferometric imaging to the Broadband Observation network for Lightning and Thunderstorms (BOLT), a low frequency, long baseline network deployed around Osaka, Japan. Since the baselines are comparable to the distance between a sensor and a source, BOLT represents a very extreme example of near-field interferometry.",

Correlation of the data, including anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), magnetic susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization in different DC fields to saturation, and hysteresis properties, from three continuously exposed sections of the full Greenhorn Limestone provides detailed spatial distribution for the depositional processes and magnetic mineral climate encoding. The Greenhorn Limestone includes the Lincoln Limestone, Hartland Shale, and the Bridge Creek Limestone members and consists of calcareous shales and limestones representing near maximum depths in the Cretaceous interior seaway. The sections, each about 30 m thick, extend from the upper Graneros Shale, through the Greenhorn Formation, to the lower Carlisle Shale, with samples collected at a two to five cm interval and are located at Badito, CO; north of Redwing, CO; and at the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at Lake Pueblo, CO. Our over 1000 samples were hand crushed to granule size pieces and packed into 7cc IODP boxes. Bulk magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) intensity at different peak AF levels, and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) intensity record variations in magnetic mineral concentration and are proxies to determine orbital scale cycles and precise stratigraphic correlation between sections. ARM intensities in a peak field of 100 mT at both sites range between 1.2 x 10-3 and 1.3 x 10-4 A/m and better define periodic variation within the Greenhorn Limestone displaying differences in ferromagnetic mineral content of detrital origin. Magnetic susceptibility, which ranges from 3.5 x 10-2 to 2.86 x 10-3, also shows periodic variation with a strong correlation among the three sections. Saturation IRM at 100 mT ranges from 3.2 x 10-1 to 1.1x 10-2 A/m shows periodic variation with the greatest variability in the Bridge Creek Member. Preliminary spectral analysis of each data set indicates a dominant cyclicity that is of considerably lower frequency than the limestone/shale couplets characteristic of Greenhorn Limestone.",

            "abstract": "Initial large-scale sediment yield caused by heavy rainfall or major storms have made a strong impression on us. Previous studies focusing on landslide management investigated the initial sediment movement and its mechanism. However, integrated management of catchment-scale sediment movements requires estimating the sediment yield, which is produced by the subsequent expanded landslides due to rainfall, in addition to the initial landslide movement. This study presents a quantitative analysis of expanded landslides by surveying the Shukushubetsu River basin, at the foot of the Hidaka mountain range in central Hokkaido, Japan. This area recorded heavy rainfall in 2003, reaching a maximum daily precipitation of 388 mm. We extracted the expanded landslides from 2003 to 2008 using aerial photographs taken over the river area. In particular, we calculated the probability of expansion for each landslide, the ratio of the landslide area in 2008 as compared with that in 2003, and the amount of the expanded landslide area corresponding to the initial landslide area. As a result, it is estimated 24% about probability of expansion for each landslide. In addition, each expanded landslide area is smaller than the initial landslide area. Furthermore, the amount of each expanded landslide area in 2008 is approximately 7% of their landslide area in 2003. Therefore, the sediment yield from subsequent expanded landslides is equal to or slightly greater than the sediment yield in a typical base flow. Thus, we concluded that the amount of sediment yield from subsequent expanded landslides is lower than that of initial large-scale sediment yield caused by a heavy rainfall in terms of effect on management of catchment-scale sediment movement.",

The relationship between glacier area and volume is difficult to define however which is important to monitor glaciers especially those are remote or inaccessible. Water resources in La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia, strongly depend on the runoff from glacierized headwater catchments in the Cordillera Real, Andes, which is therefore selected as our study region.\nTo predict annual glacier mass balances, PWRI-Distributed Hydrological Model (PWRI-DHM) was applied to simulate runoff from the partially glacierized catchments in high mountains (i.e. Condoriri–Huayna West headwater catchment located in the Cordillera Real, Bolivian Andes). PWRI-DHM is based on tank model concept in a distributed and 4-tank configuration including surface, unsaturated, aquifer, and river course tanks. The model was calibrated and validated with observed meteorological and hydrological data from 2011 to 2014 by considering different phases of precipitation, various runoff components from glacierized and non-glacierized areas, and the retarding effect by glacial lakes and wetlands. The model is then applied with MRI-AGCM outputs from 1987 to 2003 considering the shrinkage of glacier outlines since 1980s derived from Landsat data. Annual glacier mass balance in each 100m-grid was reproduced, with which the glacier area-volume relationship was generated with reasonable initial volume setting.\nOut study established a method to define the relationship between glacier area and volume by remote sensing information and glacier mass balances simulated by distributed hydrological model. Our results demonstrated that the changing trend of local glacier had a consistency the previous observed glacier area-volume relationship in the Cordillera Real.",

Particularly, the stability and properties of iron oxides are essential information to understand the structure and chemistry of the mantle. Here we report new high-pressure polymorphs of iron oxide Fe7O9 (Fe3+/Fe2+ = 4/3) and its Fe2+-Mg solid solution (Mg,Fe2+)3Fe3+4O9 that can be recovered at ambient conditions. We synthesized single crystals of the both compounds at about 24-26 GPa using a multi-anvil press. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed that the crystal structures of both Fe7O9 and (Mg,Fe2+)3Fe3+4O9 have monoclinic C2/m space groups, that differ from any other known lattices of iron oxides. Mössbauer spectra are in agreement with the crystal structure refined from single crystal XRD. This newly found Fe7O9 polymorph suggests that iron oxides may have more variable mixed valence state under high-pressure condition than previously thought. Based on analogy with Fe2+1+nFe3+2O4+n group, a Fe2+3±nFe3+4O9±n group might be also stable at certain high pressures and temperatures and oxygen fugacity.",

            "abstract": "For high-precision simulations of the trans-pacific tsunamis, we would have to include additional effects on the conventional long-wave theory. Water waves with different wavelengths travel at different speeds so that frequency dispersion is not negligible in the far-field tsunamis. It can be modelled with Boussinesq equations. Baba et al. (2015) developed a high-speed code solving the Boussinesq equations. Recently, importance of effects of small elastic deformation of the Earth loaded by tsunami and seawater density vertical stratification were shown in many studies for the 2010 Chile and 2011 Tohoku far-field tsunamis. Allgeyer and Cummins (2014) successfully suggested a practical method to add these effects in the conventional numerical scheme. However, we don’t have yet a simulation code the all effects incorporated simultaneously. This study combined the module of Allgeyer and Cummins (2014) with the Baba’s (2015) code. Also here the elastic loading model was improved by considering the gravitational potential change during the tsunami propagation. Calculation with these all effects incur a huge computational cost, so we used a high performance vector computer, Earth Simulator 3, installed in JAMSTEC this year. With the new code on the new computer, we simulated the trans-pacific tsunami by giving a time-dependent sea surface development during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake estimated by the multi-time window tsunami inversion method that used dispersive Green’s functions. Our calculation provided a good agreement with the deep-ocean observations at the whole Pacific Ocean. We also found that the three effects, Boussinesq, elastic loading and sea water stratification are equally important simulating the tsunami waveforms in far-field.",

            "abstract": "Shipping contributes significantly to the anthropogenic burden of particulate matter (PM), and is among the world’s highest polluting combustion sources per fuel consumed. Moreover, ships are a highly concentrated source of pollutants which are emitted into clean marine environments (e.g., Artic region). Shipping utilizes heavy fuel oil (HFO) which is less distilled compared to fuels used on land and few investigations on shipping related PM properties are available. BC is one of the dominant combustion products of ship diesel engines and its chemical and microphysical properties have a significant impact on climate by influencing the amount of albedo reduction on bright surfaces such as in polar regions.\nWe have carried out a campaign to characterize the PM emissions from medium-sized marine engines in Gunsan, Jeonbuk Institute of Automotive Technology. The properties of ship-diesel PM have characterized depending on (1) fuel sulfur content (HFO vs. ULSD) and (2) engine conditions (Running state vs. Idling state). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) equipped with HRTEM and Raman spectroscopy were used for physicochemical analysis. Optical properties, which are ultimately linked to the snow/ice albedo decrease impacting climate, were assessed as well. PM generated under high engine temperature conditions had typical features of soot, e.g., concentric circles comprised of closely packed graphene layers, however PM generated by the idling state at low combustion temperature was characterized by amorphous and droplet-like carbonaceous particles with no crystalline structure. Significant differences in optical properties depending on the combustion conditions were also observed. Particles from running conditions showed wavelength-independent absorbing properties, whereas the particles from idling conditions showed enhanced absorption at shorter wavelengths, which is characteristic of brown carbon. Regarding different fuel types, distinctive structure differences were not observed, but EDX results showed that PM generated by HFO combustion has sulfur content in PM whereas ULSD generated 100% carbon composed PM.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface fluid flow is strongly influenced by faults and fractures, yet the transmissivity of faults and fractures changes through time due to deformation and cement precipitation, making flow paths difficult to predict. Here we assess past fracture connectivity in an active hydrothermal system in the Basin and Range, Nevada, USA, using clumped isotope geochemistry and cold cathodoluminescence (CL) analysis of fracture filling cements from the Blue Mountain geothermal field. Calcite cements were sampled from drill cuttings and two cores at varying distances from faults. CL microscopy of some of the cements shows banding parallel to the fracture walls as well as brecciation, indicating that the cements record variations in the composition and source of fluids that moved through the fractures as they opened episodically. CL microscopy, δ13C and δ18O values were used to screen homogeneous samples for clumped isotope analysis. Clumped isotope thermometry of most samples indicates paleofluid temperatures of around 150°C, with several wells peaking at above 200°C. We suggest that the consistency of these temperatures is related to upwelling of fluids in the convective hydrothermal system, and interpret the similarity of the clumped isotope temperatures to modern geothermal fluid temperatures of ~160-180°C as evidence that average reservoir temperatures have changed little since precipitation of the calcite cements. In contrast, two samples, one of which was associated with fault gauge observed in drill logs, record significantly cooler temperatures of 19 and 73°C and anomalous δ13C and δ18Owater values, which point to fault-controlled pathways for downwelling meteoric fluid. Finally, we interpret correspondence of paleofluid temperatures and δ18Owater values constrained by clumped isotope thermometry of calcite from different wells to suggest past connectivity of fractures among wells within the geothermal field. Results show the ability of clumped isotope geothermometry to assess fracture connectivity and geothermal reservoir characteristics in the past—with the potential to help optimize resource production and injection programs and better understand structural controls on mass and heat transfer in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Holocene climate variability in the Indo-Pacific has largely been inferred from sediment cores primarily from the central and eastern Warm Pool region. A limited number of speleothem oxygen-isotope records have provided decadally-resolved time-series of past rainfall variability over the central Indo-Pacific Warm Pool region, however no records currently exist for the Indian Ocean sector of the IPWP.  Here we present the first continuous, high-resolution (~15year) speleothem record from the eastern tropical Indian Ocean, collected from central western Sumatra, Indonesia.\nPetrographic and geochemical analysis reveals that the sample is primarily composed of aragonite but is punctuated by intervals of primary calcite growth. In addition to Raman spectroscopy, trace element analysis by laser ablation ICP-MS reveals strongly antiphased behaviour between magnesium and strontium, attributed to the strong preference of those elements for the calcite and aragonite lattices, respectively. This relationship is utilized to develop a quantitative correction for the stable isotope fractionation offset between the two calcium carbonate polymorphs identified in the speleothem.   \nThe corrected oxygen isotope record shows a rapid transition from drier conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD) into a wetter Holocene, similar in timing and pattern to that recorded in Dongge Cave, China. This is strikingly different from other IPWP speleothem records, which show no YD or a wetter YD, suggesting that different mechanisms may be controlling rainfall amount in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. These disparate responses are further explored through proxy-model comparison.",

            "abstract": "Coal combustion products (coal ash) represent one of the largest industrial waste streams in the United States. Coal ash contains elevated levels of toxic, bioaccumulative elements such as mercury (Hg), yet the majority of coal ash waste is stored in unlined impoundments and landfills. These impoundments have a long history of environmental degradation, including: groundwater contamination, surface water contamination through impoundment effluent discharge, and impoundment failures resulting in catastrophic ash release events. The fate of toxic elements associated with coal ash is greatly influenced by environmental parameters, such as redox potential and microbial activity, which induce transformations and leaching of contaminants.\nHere we used anaerobic sediment-ash microcosms to determine how coal ash impacts methyl mercury (MeHg) production in a simulated benthic aquatic environment. We used two coal ash types in the microcosms: a weathered ash with low sulfate/Hg content and a fresh fly ash that was relatively enriched in sulfate/Hg compared to the weathered ash. Two different sediments were used in the microcosms: one was a pristine sediment (containing 0.03 mg/kg Hg) and the other was a relatively Hg-contaminated sediment (containing 0.29 mg/kg Hg).\nResults showed that microcosms amended with the low sulfate/low Hg ash had no net MeHg production. In contrast, microcosms amended with high sulfate/high Hg ash showed increases in MeHg concentrations that were 2 to 3 times greater than control microcosms without ash, indicating that coal ash can stimulate MeHg production by providing spikes of Hg and labile sulfate to the aquatic system. MeHg production in ash-amended microcosms containing contaminated sediment was no greater than in the ash-amended pristine sediment microcosms. This may indicate that Hg associated with coal ash is more bioavailable than the Hg present in historically contaminated sediments. Illumina sequencing is underway to investigate the impact of coal ash on both the contaminated and pristine sediment microbial populations.\nOverall our work highlights the need to incorporate environmental parameters into the risk assessments that guide coal ash waste management.",

How p affects τ in the transitional regime is not fully understood, although it is a key to understanding many important geological problems such as role of fluids in deformation mechanism, stress and strength profile of the crust, seismogenic depth range, and so on.\nThe effective normal stress σe is often given by σe = σn – α p (α: a constant around 1 in the brittle regime), and frictional resistance, by τ = f σe (f: friction coefficient). Recently, Hirth and Beeler [2015] proposed a model of the effective stress law in the transitional regime. Because of increasing ratio of real area of contact to nominal area of frictional interface, α may decrease to zero towards fully plastic regime, causing a sharper peak in the strength profile than a conventional Brace-Goetze strength profile which is sometimes referred to as “Christmas tree”. We investigated this idea by means of friction experiments at high temperature and pore pressure.\nWe used halite as an analogue material which undergoes a transition from brittle to fully plastic regime under convenient conditions [Shimamoto, 1986]. We conducted friction experiments of a pre-cut sliding interface filled with halite gouge with gas-medium triaxial apparatus in Hiroshima University, at 150 MPa confining pressure, from room temperature to 210 °C, and from atmospheric pressure to more than 100 MPa fluid (argon gas) pressure in a reservoir. Our preliminary result shows that the sharp peak in the flow stress is probably absent. A phenomenological smooth connection proposed by Shimamoto and Noda [2014] based on friction experiments without a jacket (i.e. atmospheric pore pressure) may work in explaining the obtained flow stresses.",

            "abstract": "Rupture patterns of a long fault system are controlled by spatial heterogeneity of fault strength and stress associated with geometrical characteristics and stress perturbation history. Mechanical process for sequential ruptures and multiple simultaneous ruptures, one of the characteristics of a long fault such as the North Anatolian fault, governs the size and frequency of large earthquakes. Here we introduce one of the cases in southwest Japan and explore what controls rupture initiation, sequential ruptures and fault branching on a long fault system.\nThe Median Tectonic Line active fault zone　(hereinafter MTL) is the longest and most active fault in Japan. Based on historical accounts, a series of M ≥ 7 earthquakes occurred on at least a 300-km-long portion of the MTL in 1596. On September 1, the first event occurred on the Kawakami fault segment, in Central Shikoku, and the subsequent events occurred further west. Then on September 5, another rupture initiated from the Central to East Shikoku and then propagated toward the Rokko-Awaji fault zone to Kobe, a northern branch of the MTL, instead of the eastern main extent of the MTL. Another rupture eventually extended to near Kyoto. To reproduce this progressive failure, we applied two numerical models: one is a coulomb stress transfer; the other is a slip-tendency analysis under the tectonic stress. We found that Coulomb stress imparted from historical ruptures have triggered the subsequent ruptures nearby. However, stress transfer does not explain beginning of the sequence and rupture directivities. Instead, calculated slip-tendency values show highly variable along the MTL: high and low seismic potential in West and East Shikoku. The initiation point of the 1596 progressive failure locates near the boundary in the slip-tendency values. Furthermore, the slip-tendency on the Rokko-Awaji fault zone is far higher than that of the MTL in Wakayama, which may explain the rupture directivity toward Kobe-Kyoto.",

The closure temperature and age of helium are important parameters for the zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometry. In this paper, the zircon He closure temperature and its influence factors were studied by establishing the evolutionary pattern between zircon He ages and zircon burial depth based on examined zircon He ages of natural borehole samples obtained from the Cenozoic strara in the sedimentary basin. The results show that the zircon He closure temperature of natural samples in the sedimentary basin is approcimately 195℃, higher than the result (183℃) obtain from the thermal simulation experiments. The high He closure temperature resulted from long term radiation damage accumulation and high effective uranium. We also point out that grain radius, He corrected parameter, effective uranium concentration, radiation damage and radiogenic 4He concentration have apparent influence on the zircon He ages. This study is a revaluation of the conventional zircon He closure temperature. Thus, properly understanding the zircon He ages, closure temperature, and its influence factors, zircon (U-Th)/He dating can provide the true explanation of the testing zircon He ages, and has a great guiding significance in the studying of the evolution of source rocks and the process of hydrocarbon accumulation in the deep sedimentary basin.",

            "abstract": "More than 140 million people in South and Southeast Asia drink groundwater contaminated with toxic levels of arsenic. Arsenic release from sediment is controlled by oxidation of reduced organic carbon coupled to iron and arsenic reduction; this process occurs principally under anaerobic conditions and is constrained to surficial (<1 m depth) sediments in the Mekong Delta. However, there is limited knowledge of water level changes in seasonal wetlands that control carbon oxidation pathways and subsequently arsenic release from sediments to groundwater. During drained periods, soils undergo aerobic carbon oxidation, diverting electron flow away from iron and arsenic reduction, decreasing arsenic release from sediments to groundwater. Additionally, draining may lead to fresh Fe-oxide precipitation that sequesters As. We monitored soil moisture and porewater chemistry of a seasonal wetland in the Mekong Delta through a wetting and drying cycle. We examined temporal trends in arsenic release from the solid phase over the flooding and drying cycles. Based on frequent field measurements we determine the timing and magnitude of arsenic release in surficial sediments of seasonal wetlands typical of the Mekong Delta. These results show the importance of surface processes on arsenic release and aid in developing mechanistic and predictive models of arsenic concentrations in the subsurface throughout Asia.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of spatially distributed parameters is one of the biggest challenges in hydrologic modeling, especially over a large spatial domain. This problem arises both from methodological challenges such as the transfer of calibrated parameters to ungauged locations as well as computational demand. Consequently, many current large scale hydrologic assessments rely on spatially inconsistent parameter fields, e.g., showing patchwork patterns resulting from individual basin calibration or spatially constant parameters resulting from the adoption of default or a-priori estimates.\nIn this study we apply the Multi-scale Parameter Regionalization (MPR) framework to generate spatially continuous and optimized parameter fields for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The MPR method uses transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes (e.g., soil) to model parameters (e.g., parameters that describe the storage and transmission of water) at the native resolution of the geophysical attribute data and then scale to the spatial resolution of the model simulation with several scaling functions, e.g. arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean. Model parameter adjustments are made by calibrating the parameters of the transfer function rather than the model parameters themselves.\nThis presentation discusses conceptual and computational challenges in a “model agnostic” continental-domain application of the MPR approach. First, we describe development of new transfer functions for the VIC model, and discuss challenges associated with extending MPR to multiple models. Second, we describe the “computational shortcut” of headwater basin calibration where we estimate the parameters for only 600 headwater basins rather than conducting simulations for every grid box across the entire domain. We calibrated the transfer function parameters using different spatial groups; a single CONUS-wide group and several climatic-based clusters. In addition, we performed individual basin calibration, which provides a benchmark of the maximum achievable performance in each basin. Lastly, we discuss how estimated parameters for each spatial group can be used in ungauged locations to generate spatially consistent parameter fields over the CONUS.",

            "abstract": "Mediterranean-type shublands are subject to periodic fire and high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Little is known how N inputs interact with post-fire secondary succession to affect ecosystem carbon (C) and N storage and cycling. Thus, a field experiment was conducted in a chaparral stand located in NE San Diego County, USA that burned during a wildfire in July 2003 to test the hypotheses that rates of C and N storage would significantly increase in response to experimental N addition. The experimental layout consists of a randomized design where four-10 x 10 m plots received 5 gN m-2 (added N) in the fall of each year since 2003 and four-10 x 10 m plots served as un-manipulated controls. Aboveground biomass C and N pools and fluxes, including biomass and litter C and N pool size, litter production, net primary production (NPP), N uptake, and litter C and N mineralization were measured seasonally (every 3 months) for a period of 10 years. Belowground surface (0-10 cm) soil extractable N, pH, and total soil N and C pools and surface root biomass C and N pools were also measured seasonally for a period of 10 years, while N losses from leaching were measured over a shorted (8 year) period of time. Added N led to a rapid increase in soil extractable N and a decline in soil pH; however, total soil C and N storage have yet to be affected by N input. Added N plots initially had significantly lower C and N storage than control plots; however, rates of aboveground N and C storage became significantly higher added N plots after 4-5 years of exposure. N losses from leaching continue to be significantly higher in added N plots even with an increase in aboveground C and N storage. The impact of N enrichment on ecosystem C and N storage varied depending on the stage of succession, but the eventual N-induced increase in NPP has implications for fuel buildup and future fire intensity. While N enrichment acted to increase aboveground C and N storage, plots exposed to high N inputs lost substantially more N from leaching than control plots. These results indicate that post-fire chaparral shrublands tend to be “leaky” even though they are not yet “N-saturated.” Recovering stands in high-N deposition areas will likely be large sources of N to groundwater and/or streams regardless of whether NPP is stimulated by N input.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms by which inward core solidification may drive dynamo activity, and the properties of any fields that may result from this process, are highly uncertain. The fast cooling rates of the IVA iron meteorites suggest that their parent core had its silicate mantle removed by planetary collisions during the early solar system. Due to the resulting rapid radiative surface cooling, the IVA parent core solidified from the top-down, permitting a cold metallic crust that feasibly experienced fields generated by the hot interior liquid as it inwardly solidified. The IVA meteorites therefore potentially contain unique paleomagnetic information regarding top-down solidification. Through x-ray microscopy of the cloudy zone in the Steinbach and Chinautla meteorites and traditional paleomagnetic measurements on silicates extracted from the Steinbach, Bishop Canyon and São João Nepomuceno meteorites, we argue that the IVA parent core generated an intense (>100 µT) and secularly varying (time-scale <100 kyr) field during top-down solidification. These results show that certain iron meteorites are capable of having experienced dynamo fields, and that asteroids can generate directionally varying magnetic activity, strengthening claims that the fundamentals of dynamo activity are consistent across small and large bodies. Models of the thermochemical evolution and solidification of an unmantled core suggest that this field resulted from liquid motion induced by the repeated delamination and sinking of material from the base of the inwardly solidifying crust. This efficient dynamo generation mechanism was likely capable of readily creating magnetic activity at the slow cooling rates expected within mantled, inwardly solidifying cores (e.g., Mercury, Ganymede, many asteroids). Combining this observation with that of efficient solidification-driven dynamos during bottom-up asteroid core solidification, it is likely that magnetic activity was widespread in the early solar system.",

From separations of ~12-28 thousand km the two spacecraft measure electric and magnetic fields from DC up to 8 kHz, and electrons and ions between3 eV and 1 MeV at spin resolution (4s). Their close separation and the rapid temporal sampling of the field and plasma, allow us to analyze interplanetary shock structures at the shock front and compare shock signatures at the two locations to understand the magnetic field and electron behavior inside the shock thickness and the shock spatial and temporal stationarity. Using burst data triggered on shock crossings we can resolve the kinetic structure of the shock including the magnetic field rotation and electron motion therein. When the connection line of the two probes is roughly perpendicular to the shock normal, the shock spatial variation can be determined; when the connection line is near the shock normal, the shock temporal stationarity can be explored. Our analysis reveals the shock’s 3D-structure and stationarity on kinetic scales for comparison with theoretical models.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash clouds are a serious hazard to aviation, and mitigation requires a robust system of volcano monitoring, eruption detection, characterization of cloud properties, forecast of cloud movement, and communication of warnings. Several research groups have developed quantitative satellite-based volcanic ash products and some of these are in operational use by Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers around the world to aid in characterizing cloud properties and forecasting regions of ash hazard. The algorithms applied to the satellite data utilize a variety of techniques, and thus produce results that differ. The World Meteorological Organization has recently sponsored an intercomparison study of satellite-based retrievals with four goals: 1) to establish a validation protocol for satellite-based volcanic ash products, 2) to quantify and understand differences in products, 3) to develop best practices, and 4) to standardize volcanic cloud geophysical parameters. Six volcanic eruption cases were considered in the intercomparison: Eyjafallajökull, Grimsvötn, Kelut, Kirishimayama, Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, and Sarychev Peak. Twenty-four algorithms were utilized, which retrieved parameters including: ash cloud top height, ash column mass loading, ash effective radius, and ash optical depth at visible and thermal-infrared wavelengths. Results were compared to space-based, airborne, and ground-based lidars; complementary satellite retrievals; and manual “expert evaluation” of ash extent. The intercomparison results will feed into the International Civil Aviation Organization “Roadmap for International Airways Volcano Watch”, which integrates volcanic meteorological information into decision support systems for aircraft operations.",

The 1985 test, conducted in tuff at a depth of approximately 600 m did not collapse to the surface or produce a crater. The purpose of the geophysical measurements is to characterize the subsurface above and around the presumed explosion cavity. The magnetic data are used to locate steel borehole casings and pipes and are correlated with surface observations. The EM data show variation in lithology at depth and clear signatures from borehole casings and surface cables. The gravity survey detects a clear gravity low in the area of the explosion. The seismic data indicates shallow low velocity zone and indications of a deeper low velocity zones. In this study, we conduct 2D inversion of EM data for better characterization of site geology and use a common 3D density model to jointly interpret both the seismic and gravity data along with constraints on lithology boundaries from the EM.

            "abstract": "Land use management is one of the key contributors to the global environmental change. Considerable changes in landscapes have been experienced in Southwestern Victoria, Australia in the past two decades. Eucalyptus globulus (blue gum) plantations have expanded, resulting in possible changes in the water and carbon balances of catchments. The shift from pastures to plantations could have a significant impact on the local carbon balance with possible effects on atmospheric CO2 concentration and vegetation productivity. We present preliminary measurements from a field study comparing soil respiration in a plantation and a pasture. Adjacent catchments in Southwestern Victoria, near Gatum, were used as study areas; the prominent difference between the two catchments is the land use, with one catchment being used as a pasture for livestock grazing and the other catchment being mainly planted with blue gums. The variability of soil respiration in the pasture is governed by differences in soil moisture and substrate content due to local features of the topography and livestock grazing. Soil respiration measurements in the plantation were taken on mounds, access tracks, and open spaces. Most observations on mounds had higher soil respiration possibly due to root and mycorrhizal respiration. The measurements in open spaces had comparable values with mound measurements; this might be due to a less limited radiation. The soil respiration between trees had lower values, possibly because of radiation limitation due to the canopy cover. These preliminary measurements allow us to compare soil respiration variability across catchments with different land uses. This is important to estimate CO2 fluxes from soil to the atmosphere in large areas and will be valuable in estimating gross primary production from measurements of net ecosystem exchange.",

Transit times are an important characteristic of catchments in that they reflect the time available for interaction between water, soil, and biota within the system. Thus, they exert a strong influence on hydrologic resilience to drought and climate change, and on the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to atmospheric pollutants. Transit times may vary spatially due to variations in basin characteristics, such as slope, size, and amount and type of soil and vegetation; however, the relative influence of these factors on TTs is poorly known. In this study, we estimate mean transit times (MTTs) for 11 snowmelt-dominated, headwater catchments in the western U.S. using the convolution integral approach, which relies on differences in the magnitude of seasonal variability in δ18O in precipitation and stream water to estimate MTTs. Seasonal variability in δ18O was calculated based on analyses of precipitation and stream water samples collected at weekly to monthly intervals. Results indicate that MTTs ranged from 0.6 to 2.1 years, and were positively influenced by percent of the catchment covered by forest (r2 = 0.56; p = 0.008), and negatively influenced by barren terrain (e.g., bedrock; r2 = 0.48; p = 0.019). MTTs showed a weak negative relation to mean basin slope (r2 = 0.31; p = 0.076) and no relation to basin size or elevation. These results illustrate the importance of soil as a key factor influencing MTTs, with basin slope acting as a secondary influence. Heavily forested basins tend to have deep, well-developed soils with substantial water storage capacity; these soils help maintain baseflow during drought conditions, providing hydrologic resilience to the system, and they are an important location for geochemical and biological processes that neutralize acidity and assimilate atmospherically deposited nitrogen. In contrast, basins with abundant exposed bedrock and steep slopes, and that lack substantial forest, tend to have little soil or water storage capacity; these basins will be less resilient to drought, and atmospherically deposited pollutants will pass quickly through the terrestrial landscape and into streams and lakes where they may impact aquatic biota.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic ice sheet has varied substantially in shape and volume in the past, with evidence for strong regional differences in evolution history. Recent observations of change in the Antarctic environment indicate that different regions respond differently to ongoing changes in global climate -- over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet strong increases in sub-shelf melt rates indicate a sensitivity to changes in ocean temperature and circulation, while in East Antarctica the mass balance is increasingly positive due to an increase in accumulation in response to rising temperatures. Modeling the long term evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet can help address questions about its regional sensitivity to external forcing.\nWe have conducted experiments with an established ice sheet model over the last eight glacial cycles using spatially and temporally varying climate forcing from an EMIC. These simulations indicate a glacial-interglacial amplitude of ~11m SLE. Using a series of sensitivity experiments we address the dominant climatic forcing of this evolution. While sea level changes are the main driver of grounding line movement, they alone are not sufficient to explain the full glacial amplitude. Local insolation changes contribute to the initiation of terminations, while accumulation and sub-shelf melt changes feed back positively and negatively respectively onto the ice sheet evolution. This implies that climatic drivers add nonlinearly and the full spectrum of climate forcing needs to be considered when evaluating the sensitivity of the Antarctic ice sheet to past and future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has suggested a relationship between mid-latitude weather and Arctic amplification (AA) of global climate change via a slower and wavier extratropical circulation inducing more extreme events. To test this hypothesis and to quantify the waviness of the extratropical flow, we apply a novel application of the geomorphological concept of sinuosity (SIN) over greater North America. SIN is defined as the ratio of the curvilinear length of a geopotential height contour to the perimeter of its equivalent latitude, where the contour and the equivalent latitude enclose the same area. We use 500 hPa daily heights from reanalysis and model simulations to calculate past and future SIN. The circulation exhibits a distinct annual cycle of maximum SIN (waviness) in summer and a minimum in winter, inversely related to the annual cycle of zonal wind speed. Positive trends in SIN have emerged in recent decades during winter and summer at several latitude bands, generally collocated with negative trends in zonal wind speeds. High values of SIN coincide with many prominent extreme-weather events, including Superstorm Sandy. RCP8.5 simulations (2006-2100) project a dipole pattern of zonal wind changes that varies seasonally. In winter, AA causes inflated heights over the Arctic relative to mid-latitudes and an associated weakening (strengthening) of the westerlies north (south) of 40N. The AA signal in summer is strongest over upper-latitude land, promoting localized atmospheric ridging aloft with lighter westerlies to the south and stronger zonal winds to the north. The changes in wind speeds in both seasons are inversely correlated with SIN, indicating a wavier circulation where the flow weakens. In summer the lighter winds over much of the U. S. resemble circulation anomalies observed during extreme summer heat and drought. Such changes may be linked to enhanced heating of upper-latitude land surfaces caused by earlier snow melt during spring-summer.",

Analysis of QTN spectra in the solar wind yields accurate measurements of local electron density and core temperature, as well as somewhat less accurate measurements of wind speed and suprathermal electron properties. The thermal noise receiver (TNR) on board the WIND spacecraft provides high cadence spectra (4.5 sec in normal mode) with clear signatures of QTN. However, at frequencies between the ion and electron plasma frequencies, the measured TNR spectra at this high-time resolution often deviates from the theoretical spectra calculated with plasma parameters directly measured by the WIND/3DP instrument. We report result of a careful study of two possible sources of the deviation, namely, the spacecraft spin which modifies the proton noise, and coherent electrostatic waves. We discuss implications for applying the QTN technique for plasma diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Golgotha Cave is located in a forested catchment in SW Australia where evapotranspiration losses from the vadose-zone are high and forest biomass has been disturbed by fire. The cave has been continuously monitored since 2005 and this extensive dataset has been used to quantify key processes determining dripwater hydrology and chemistry (Mahmud et al., 2015; Treble et al., 2013; 2015). In this paper we present a synthesis of these findings and derive a conceptual model to illustrate the main hydrochemical processes that will impact cave dripwater in similar environments.\nWe applied mass-balance techniques to quantify sources (water/rock interactions and aerosol) and sinks (prior calcite precipitation and biomass uptake). Mass-balance results suggest that transpiration and elemental sequestration into biomass modifies dripwater ion concentrations. The vegetation uptake impacts dripwater Mg, K and SO4, with the largest impact on SO4, estimated to be up to 60% at some drip sites. Overall, our findings suggest that varying amounts of transpiration by deeply-rooted trees contribute significantly to spatial and temporal variability in dripwater solute concentrations. This is in addition to the partitioning of infiltrating water between characteristic flow pathways. Applying principal components analysis, we identify a common long-term rising trend in dripwater Cl, Mg, K, Ca, Sr and Si. We assess whether the long-term trends in dripwater solutes are driven by post-fire biomass recovery and/or the impacts of a drying climate in SW Australia.\n",

            "abstract": "A number of models for observation metadata have been developed in the earth and environmental science communities, including OGC’s Observations and Measurements (O&M), the ecosystems community’s Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE), the W3C’s Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSNO), and the CUAHSI/NSF Observations Data Model v2 (ODM2). In order to combine data formalized in the various models, mappings between these must be developed. In some cases this is straightforward: since ODM2 took O&M as its starting point, their terminology is almost completely aligned. In the eco-informatics world observations are almost never made in isolation of other observations, so OBOE pays particular attention to groupings, with multiple atomic ‘Measurements’ in each oboe:Observation which does not have a result of its own and thus plays a different role to an om:Observation. And while SSN also adopted terminology from O&M, mapping is confounded by the fact that SSN uses DOLCE as its foundation and places ssn:Observations as ‘Social Objects’ which are explicitly disjoint from ‘Events’, while O&M is formalized as part of the ISO/TC 211 harmonised (UML) model and sees om:Observations as value assignment activities.\nFoundational ontologies (such as BFO, GFO, UFO or DOLCE) can provide a framework for alignment, but different upper ontologies can be based in profoundly different worldviews and use of incommensurate frameworks can confound rather than help. A potential resolution is provided by comparing recent studies that align SSN and O&M, respectively, with the PROV-O ontology. PROV-O provides just three base classes: Entity, Activity and Agent. om:Observation is sub-classed from prov:Activity, while ssn:Observation is sub-classed from prov:Entity. This confirms that, despite the same name, om:Observation and ssn:Observation denote different aspects of the observation process: the observation event, and the record of the observation event, respectively.\nAlignment with the simple PROV-O classes has clarified this issue in a way that had previously proved difficult to resolve. The simple 3-class base model from PROV appears to provide just enough logic to serve as a lightweight upper ontology, particularly for workflow or process-based information.",

This counterintuitive observation has generated substantial interest in the role of low-frequency variation over the Pacific Ocean such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately separate low-frequency variability and global warming from SST records. Here we present three primary modes of global SST as a secular warming trend, a low-frequency variability, and a biennial oscillation through the use of novel statistical method. By analyzing temporal behavior of the three-mode, it is found that the opposite contributions of secular warming trend and cold phase of low-frequency variability since 1999 account for the warming hiatus in the tropical eastern Pacific. This result implies that the low-frequency variability modulates the manifestation of global warming signal in the tropical Pacific SST. Furthermore, if the low-frequency variability turns to a positive phase, warming in the tropical eastern Pacific will be amplified and also strong El Niño events will occur more frequently in the near future.",

Science output from Cluster is a leap forward in our knowledge of space plasma physics: the science behind space weather. It has been key in improving the modeling of the magnetosphere and understanding its various physical processes. Cluster data have enabled the publication of more than 2000 refereed papers and counting.\nThis substantial scientific return is often attributed to the online availability of the Cluster data archive, now called the Cluster Science Archive (CSA). It is being developed by the ESAC Science Data Center (ESDC) team and maintained alongside other science ESA archives at ESAC (ESA Space Astronomy Center, Madrid, Spain).\nCSA is a public archive, which contains the entire set of Cluster high-resolution data, and other related products in a standard format and with a complete set of metadata. Since May 2015, it also contains data from the CNSA/ESA Double Star mission (2003-2008), a mission operated in conjunction with Cluster. The total amount of data format now exceeds 100 TB. Accessing CSA requires to be registered to enable user profiles and CSA accounts more than 1,500 users.\nCSA provides unique tools for visualizing its data including\n- on-demand particle distribution functions visualization\n- fast data browsing with more than 15TB of pre-generated plots\n- inventory plots\nIt also offers command line capabilities (e.g. data access via Matlab or IDL softwares, data streaming). Despite its reliability, users can only request data for a specific time period while scientists often focus on specific regions or data signatures.\nFor these reasons, a data-mining tool is being developed to do just that. It offers an interface to select data based not only on a time period but on various criteria including: key physical parameters, regions of space and spacecraft constellation geometry. The output of this tool is a list of time periods that fits the criteria imposed by the user. Such a list enables to download any bunch of datasets for all these time periods in one go. We propose to present the state of development of this tool and interact with the scientific community to better fit its needs.",

Our research examines the potential application of nanoparticles as a means of EOR by studying the influence of silicon oxide nanoparticles on the wettability and IFT of oil-nanofluids-surface systems. Batch studies were conducted to assess the stability of the nanoparticle suspensions of different concentrations (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 wt. %) in different reservoir conditions with and without the addition of surfactants (i.e. 5% brine, and Tween 20 at 0.5 and 2 cmc). Testing of oil-nanofluids and oil-nanofluids-minerals interactions was performed using crude oils from West Texas (light, API 40), Prudhoe Bay (medium, API 28), and Lloydminster (heavy, API 20). The dynamic behavior of IFT was measured using a pendant drop method. Results for 5% brine-nanoparticle systems indicated that 0.001 and 0.01 wt.% of nanoparticles contributed to a significant decrease of IFT for West Texas and Prudhoe Bay oils, while the highest decrease of IFT for Lloydminster was reported with 0.1 wt.% nanoparticles. IFT decrease was also enhanced by surfactant, and the addition of nanoparticles at 0.001 wt.% to surfactant resulted in significant decrease of IFT in most of the tested oil-nanofluid systems. The sessile drop method was used to measure the dynamic behavior of the contact angle of these oil droplets on minerals surface made of thin sections from Berea and Boise sandstone cores through a wetting test. Different nanofluid and surfactant concentrations were tested for the optimization of changes in wettability, which is a critical phase in assessing the behavior of nanofluids for optimal EOR with the selected crude oils.",

An anomalous volume (∼50 km3) of low P and low S wave velocities is imaged beneath Mammoth Mountain, extending from near the surface to a depth of ∼2 km below sea level. We infer that the reduction in seismic wave velocities is primarily due to the presence of CO2 distributed in oblate-spheroid pores with mean aspect ratio α ∼8 x 10−4 (crack-like pores) and gas volume fraction φ ∼4 x 10−4. The pore density parameter κ = 3φ / (4πα) = na3 = 0.12, where n is the number of pores per cubic meter and a is the mean pore equatorial radius. The total mass of CO2 is estimated to range up to ∼1.6 x 1010 kg if the pores exclusively contain CO2, although he presence of an aqueous phase may lower this estimate by up to one order of magnitude. The local geological structure indicates that the CO2 contained in the pores is delivered to the surface through fractures controlled by faults and remnant foliation of the bedrock beneath Mammoth Mountain. The total volume of CO2 contained in the reservoir suggests that given an emission rate of 5 x 105 kg day−1, the reservoir could supply the emission of CO2 for ∼8 to ∼90 years before depletion. Continued supply of CO2 from an underlying magmatic system would significantly prolong the existence of the reservoir.",

            "abstract": "VLF waves are a useful diagnostic for D-region ionospheric disturbances due to their efficient global propagation. The D-region is too high for balloons, too low for satellites, and not ionized enough for radar reflections. Traditionally, ionosphere disturbances have been sensed using dedicated VLF transmitters allowing for only single propagation path analysis since there are only a handful of transmitters.\nA lightning stroke, however, releases an intense amount of VLF radio energy known as a Radio Atmospheric, or ‘sferic’ which propagates through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Lightning is globally spread and very frequent, so a sferic is therefore also a useful diagnostic of the D-region when ionized by solar flare x-ray bursts.\nWe present observations of lightning-generated sferics during strong solar flares. The advantage to using sferics is that many individual thunderstorms effectively act as separate VLF transmitting sources. During the solar flare there is a significant change in magnitude and frequency content of sferics. This disturbance varies with distance from the source. The difference in magnitude and arrival time of these sferics have local maximums and minimums, and appears to oscillate with distance. We investigate the effect of solar x-ray flares on the observed sferics as a function of angle of arrival to the receiver. We utilize modeling of the Earth-ionosphere system to compare to the experimental data.",

            "abstract": "Over the past two centuries, humans have been modifying the planet at an accelerating rate and, in some cases, ecosystems have been observed to experience critical transitions. For example, shallow lakes and ponds may change abruptly from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid state when exposed to minor increases in stress (e.g., nutrient loading). Yet, abrupt changes in shallow lakes and ponds are not consistently observed and considerable uncertainty remains regarding the ecological and environmental conditions that render these systems susceptible to sudden changes. To address this knowledge gap, we are conducting a mesocosm experiment to quantify how different community configurations and environmental pressures influence the susceptibility of ponds to critical transitions. This research tests the hypothesis that macrophyte density and the rate of external nutrient loading alter the trajectory of phytoplankton dynamics, thus influencing the transition to a turbid state. We supplied 18 mesocosms with field-collected sediment, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish, and exposed them to three levels of macrophyte densities and two external nutrient loading regimes. Based on daily measurements of phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a), we will apply early warning metrics for identifying critical transitions (e.g.,\nhttp://www.early-warning-signals.org\n). Our preliminary results indicate that ponds with no macrophytes and the faster nutrient loading rate yield the greatest rate of increase in chlorophyll a. Key goals of this experiment are to enhance the mechanistic understanding of shallow lake and pond dynamics, and aid in the interpretation of lake sediment records as archives of historical critical transitions.",

            "abstract": "The productivity of geothermal reservoir, which is function of pore-space and fluid-flow path of the reservoir, varies since the properties of reservoir changes with geothermal electricity generation. The variation in the reservoir properties causes changes in electrical resistivity, time-lapse (TL) three-dimensional (3D) magnetotelluric (MT) methods can be applied to monitor the productivity variation of geothermal reservoir thanks to its sensitive to the electrical resistivity of deep subsurface. For an accurate interpretation of TL 3D MT data, a 4D MT inversion algorithm has been developed to simultaneously invert all vintage data in a time-coupled way. However, the changes in electrical resistivity of deep geothermal reservoirs are usually small generating minimum variation in TL MT responses. In order to reduce TL inversion artifacts emphasizing the TL changes, we upgrade the TL coupling of the original 4D inversion algorithm with active time constraint (ATC), which has been verified to be efficient for resistivity monitoring based on TL electrical resistivity surveys. In order to maximize the sensitivity to reservoir-region resistivity changes, we further developed a focused 4D MT inversion method by considering the distribution of reservoir fractures. To analyze the validity of the 4D algorithms, we make 4D MT inversion of synthetic TL data sets applying ATC and focusing methods, respectively, and compare their results those from the original 4D algorithm. The numerical tests find that ATC 4D inversion can be useful for conventional geothermal reservoirs, while the focused inversion algorithm can be better for monitoring engineering geothermal system (EGS) reservoir, within which new fracture can be actively developed by fluid circulation during production.

Inherently linked to sustainability, urban quality of life, resilience, and other such topics, GI also represents a unique opportunity to highlight the social relevance of practical STEM research to undergraduate students. The nature of research on urban GI, in fact, as well as the accessibility of the GI sites, allows students to combine hands-on experience with theoretical work. Furthermore, the range of scales of the projects is such that they can be managed within a single term, but does not preclude longer engagement.\nThe Sustainable Water Resource Engineering lab at Drexel University is engaged in two types of GI research outside the classroom. One type is a research co-op research internship. The second is a selective university-wide faculty-mentored summer scholarship STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) specifically designed for freshmen. The research projects we developed for those curricula can be accomplished by undergraduate students, but also address a larger research need in this emerging field.\nThe research tasks have included identifying and calibrating affordable instruments, designing and building experimental setups, and monitoring and evaluating performance of GI sites. The work also promoted deeper understanding of the hydrological processes and initiated learning beyond the students' current curricula.\nThe practice of the Lab's research being embedded into the educational process receives positive feedback from the students and achieves meaningful and long-lasting learning objectives. The experience helps students to students acquire hands-on experience, improves their metacognition and evidence-based inquiring into real-world problems, and further advances decision-making and communication skills.",

            "abstract": "Earth system exhibits strong interannual variability (IAV) in the global carbon cycle as reflected in the year-to-year anomalies of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Although various analyses suggested that land ecosystems contribute mostly to the IAV of atmospheric CO2 concentration, processes leading to the IAV in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear and hinder our effort in predicting the IAV of global C cycle. Previous studies on IAV of global C cycle have focused on the regulation of climatic variables in tropical or semiarid areas, but generated inconsistent conclusions. Using long-term eddy-flux measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP), atmospheric CO2 inversion NEP, and the MODIS-derived gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that seasonal carbon uptake amplitude (CUA) and period (CUP) are two key processes that control the IAV in the terrestrial C cycle. The two processes together explain 78% of the variations in the IAV in eddy covariance NEP, 70% in global atmospheric inversed NEP, and 53% in the IAV of GPP. Moreover, the three lines of evidence consistently show that variability in CUA is much more important than that of CUP in determining the variation of NEP at most eddy-flux sites, and most grids of global NEP and GPP. Our results suggest that the maximum carbon uptake potential in the peak-growing season is a determinant process of global C cycle internnual variability and carbon uptake period may play less important role than previous expectations. This study uncovers the most parsimonious, proximate processes underlying the IAV in global C cycle of the Earth system. Future research is needed to identify how climate factors affect the IAV in terrestrial C cycle through their influence on CUA and CUP.",

Tsurugi, central Japan, which had been previously regarded as perenial snowy gorges. While their discovery was brought out by the modern geodetic techniques, there used to be a wrong idea that the equilibrium line altitude in central Japanese Alps is about 4000 meter, causing the actual glaciers to be overlooked; the elevation of Mt Tsurugi is 2999 meter. The presence of glaciers in central Japan is due to the very high seasonal accmulation; the snow fall in the mountainous regions can reach several tens of meters or more. There are, however, few snow-depth measurement data due to the logistic problems. The equilibrium line altitude also remains uncertain.\nWe have performed airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements near the two glaciers in August, October 2013, August 2014, and March 2015. The Pi-SAR2 system used in this study consists of X-band SAR antennas, and allows us to perform single-pass interferometry and full polarimetry with the maximum spatial resolution of 0.3 m. Taking advantage of the single-pass interferometry, we have generated digital elevation models (DEM) at each measurement epoch to derive the temporal changes in the thickness by differecing the DEMs of multiple epochs.\nSnow melt season starts in May at the analyzed area, and the first snow fall usually occurs in late October. As such, the minimum thickness is expected in October, when the glacier ice appears on the surface. Preliminary analyses indicate that the differences between August and October 2013 reaches ~10 to 20 meters with errors of 5-10 meters.",

Recent studies have showed that streamflow recession analysis can be quite sensitive to the combination of different models, extraction techniques and parameter estimation methods. In order to better characterize streamflow recession curves, new methodologies combining multiple approaches have been recommended. The HYDRORECESSION toolbox, presented here, is a Matlab graphical user interface developed to analyse streamflow recession time series with the support of different tools allowing to parameterize linear and nonlinear storage-outflow relationships through four of the most useful recession models (Maillet, Boussinesq, Coutagne and Wittenberg). The toolbox includes four parameter-fitting techniques (linear regression, lower envelope, data binning and mean squared error) and three different methods to extract hydrograph recessions segments (Vogel, Brutsaert and Aksoy). In addition, the toolbox has a module that separates the baseflow component from the observed hydrograph using the inverse reservoir algorithm. Potential applications provided by HYDRORECESSION include model parameter analysis, hydrological regionalization and classification, baseflow index estimates, catchment-scale recharge and low-flows modelling, among others.

Flow braking occurs at the earthward approach of BBF events that lead to Oscillatory Flow Braking (OFB). We interpret OFB as interchange oscillations of a localized magnetic filament displaced from equilibrium. We adopt a model that uses the thin filament approximation to describe the motion of an isolated flux tube in a static background environment. This 1D code can be run with high accuracy and low numerical dissipation compared to 3D MHD codes. The static background is a force balanced 2D configuration that represents the magnetotail with dipole tilt. Previous simulation output shows that motion in the interchange direction is coupled to flapping motion in tilted field line geometries. This suggests that observational signatures of OFB may have many spectral components that will depend on the degree of coupling. In this study, the effect of dissipation due to ionospheric electric fields for the coupled interchange-flapping oscillations will be described and analyzed.",

A warming climate can inevitably accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of carbon dioxide especially in frozen soils (permafrost) within Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. In addition, high hydraulic conductivity and low sorption capacity of the shallow soil active layer overlying impermeable permafrost together lead to quick DOM transport to streams. In different regions, the response of dissolved carbon to climate warming is different due to the differences in hydrology, climatic conditions, soil types, vegetation conditions, permafrost distribution, catchment size, flow paths. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), of which a significant portion is underlain by permafrost, is considered to be more sensitive to climatic warming than other regions. However, the knowledge of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon transport in the QTP is very limited. We compared the yields and fluxes of DIC/DOC in a small tropical permafrost catchment. Our results showed that: (1) the concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 30.9 mg L-1 for the DIC and ranged from 2.3 to 6.4 mg L-1 for the DOC, the ratio of DIC/DOC concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 5.7 with a mean value of 4.3; (2) the annual export approximately 3.56 t km-2 year-1 for the DIC and 0.73 t km-2 year-1 for the DOC, indicating that the dissolved carbon transported in majority under the inorganic form; (3) the seasonal variations in DIC/DOC export are strongly regulated by variability in runoff, meanwhile the concentration of DIC/DOC showed significant positive correlation with the thawing depth of the active layer and vegetation coverage. Our results provided an understanding about the characteristics of riverine dissolved carbons transport at a permafrost catchment scale on the QTP.",

            "abstract": "Large-eddy simulation (LES) has proven to be a valuable tool in producing high-fidelity simulations of environmental and geophysical turbulent flows. For simulations of the ocean mixed layer (OML), a grid size of a few meters is required and the typical horizontal domain sizes of LES are restricted to hundreds meters or a few kilometers at most. Oil plumes being transported in the OML experience the action of Langmuir turbulence, Ekman transport and submesoscale quasi-geostrophic eddies. As a consequence, oil plumes display complex features on scales from a few meters to tens kilometers. Therefore, accurately reproducing all the relevant scales in computer simulations is a challenging task. In this study, the Extended Nonperiodic Domain LES for Scalar transport (ENDLESS) is proposed as an economic multi-scale approach to tackle this problem with current computing power. The basic idea is to simulate the Langmuir turbulence on a small horizontal domain while simulating the oil plume over an effectively large extended domain. In particular, scalar fields are adaptively added and removed to efficiently enclose the oil plume with minimum computational cost for tracking the evolution of nonhomogeneous plumes. This approach also permits the superposition of larger-scale quasi two-dimensional motions on the oil advection, allowing for coupling with regional circulation models. Validation cases and sample applications are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "A massive open online course, or MOOC, is an noncredit education activity that delivers learning content to anyone with access to the Internet. Individual courses are generally free of charge, while a certificate can have small costs. The University of Wisconsin-Madison has exploring the use of MOOC as part of its Wisconsin Idea. In the 2015, a series of MOOCs focusing on the environment were offered via Coursera. One of those MOOCS was “Changing Weather and Climate of the Great Lakes Region.”\nThis 4-week course features a new season each week through short lectures and activities covering Great Lakes weather, observed changes in the climate, and societal impacts of climate change. (https://www.coursera.org/course/greatlakesclimate) The MOOC conveyed information from NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) Weather-Ready Nation initiative as well as findings from the recent National Climate Assessment and the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI). The course was organized by members of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies; material included discussion, videos for lectures as well as guest lecturers. There were also weekly visits by the course team to 21 public libraries throughout the state of WI. The library collaboration as facilitated by WiLS (Wisconsin Library Services – wils.org), who organized the application and selection process. The public libraries hosted local residents and course instructors in discussions of course content in the context of their communities as well as strategies to mitigate the climate change impacts.\nThis presentation will discuss the public library discussions experience and the our evaluation of the impact of including a face-to-face component in the MOOC activity on engagement and learning.",

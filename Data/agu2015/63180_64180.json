            "abstract": "The Solfatara and Pisciarelli fumaroles are the main surface manifestations of the vigorous hydrothermal activity within the Campi Flegrei caldera system. The existing fault system appears to have a major control on outgassing and leads to a strong alteration of the volcanic products in both areas. Consistent with the volcanic history of the area, Solfatara and Pisciarelli are posited as having the highest probability for the opening of new vents, and in particular for possible phreatic activity within the Campi Flegrei system.\nHydrothermal alteration deeply affects all the rocks exposed within Solfatara sector, including lava domes, breccias, as well as pyroclastic fallout ash beds and pyroclastic density current deposits. This results in changes of the volcanic rock’s original microstructure and of their physical and mechanical properties, which in turn control both the outgassing and their fragmentation behaviors.\nHere, samples from the wall rocks in the vicinity of the Solfatara and Pisciarelli fumaroles have been subjected to geochemical, physical and mechanical properties characterization. In addition, surficial Solfatara crater floor deposits were characterized and their properties, in particular permeability, were mapped.\nResults show that hydrothermal alteration increases porosity and permeability of the crater wall samples favoring outgassing, while decreasing the rock strength. At the crater floor the outgassing occurs mainly along the crack system, which has also generated crusted hummocks. Elsewhere the fluid circulation in the subsoil is favored by the presence of coarse and sulfur-hardened levels, whereas their surfacing is hindered by compacted fine-grained, low permeability layers.\nDecompression experiments were performed to simulate a phreatic eruption at shallow depth. We used crater-wall samples representing the rocks in the proximity of high degassing areas. Changes in the fragmentation behavior and ejection dynamics, depending on the alteration degree of the sample, have been investigated and will be reported.",

            "abstract": "The incessant use of water due to rapid growth of population, enhanced agricultural and industrial activities, degraded environment and ecology will in the coming decades constrain the socioeconomic development of humans. To add on to the precarious situation, political boundaries rarely embrace hydrological boundaries of lakes, rivers, aquifers etc. Hydropolitics relate to the ability of geopolitical institutions to manage shared water resources in a politically sustainable manner, i.e., without tensions or conflict between political entities. Riparian hydropolitics caters to differing objectives, needs and requirements of states making it difficult to administer the catchment. The diverse riparian objectives can be merged to form a holistic catchment objective of sustainable water resources development and management.\nIt can be proposed to make a paradigm shift in the present–day transboundary water policy from riparian hydropolitics (in which the focal point of water resources use is hinged on state's need) to catchment hydropolitics (in which the interest of the basin inhabitants are accorded primacy holistically over state interests) and specifically wherein the water, environment, energy and food (WEEF) demands of the catchment are a priority and not of the states in particular. The demands of the basin pertaining to water, food and energy have to be fulfilled, keeping the environment and ecology healthy in a cooperative political framework; the need for which is overwhelming. In the present scenario, the policy for water resources development of a basin is segmented into independent uncoordinated parts controlled by various riparians; whereas in catchment hydropolitics the whole basin should be considered as a unit. The riparians should compromise a part of national interest and work in collaboration on a joint objective which works on the principle of the whole as against the part. Catchment hydropolitics may find greater interest in the more than 250 international transboundary river basins. The technical and financial capabilities of the states can be utilized for the socio-economic development as well as ecological conservation of the catchment. This proposed approach has the potential to help in generating cooperation along as well as beyond water, thereby promote benefit sharing by all.",

            "abstract": "Dragon Flag hydrothermal field located at 49°39′E on the Southwest Indian Ridge contains the active hydrothermal vents firstly discovered on the ultraslow spreading ridge (Tao et al, 2012). Anisotropic study in this area will provide important information tectonic activities. 65634 traveltime residuals from the three-dimensional isotropic inversion (Zhao et al., 2013), were divided into three groups, which correspond to quasi ocean crustal Layer 2 (qL2), quasi ocean crustal Layer 3 (qL3) and quasi uppermost mantle (qUM), respectively. Traveltime residuals at different depths show that there are obvious cosine relationships between traveltime residuals and azimuth of qL2, qL3 and qUM, indicating anisotropy existed in both crust and mantle beneath Dragon Flag hydrothermal field. The best fitted cosine curves indicate that the fast directions (negative traveltime residuals) corresponding to the general trend of ridge axis of N104°E. According to these results, we propose that there may be prevalent cracks penetrating into lower crust or even uppermost mantle. We argue that the hydrothermal convection of Dragon Flag hydrothermal field not only occurs perpendicular to ridge axis, but also occurs parallel to ridge axis. We reveal for the first time anisotropic characteristics of the ultraslow spreading ridge, which has profound scientific significance for the future research on global ocean lithospheric anisotropy.

The current structure, composition and distribution of Australian savannas have co-evolved with fire, yet remain driven by the dynamic constraints of their bioclimatic niche. Fire in Australian savannas influences both the biophysical and biogeochemical processes at multiple scales from leaf to landscape. Here we present the latest emission estimates from Australian savanna biomass burning and their contribution to global greenhouse gas budgets. We then review our understanding of the impacts of fire on ecosystem function and local surface water and heat balances, which in turn influence regional climate. We show how savanna fires are coupled to the global climate through the carbon cycle and fire regimes. We present new research that climate change is likely to alter the structure and function of savannas through shifts in moisture availability and increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), in turn altering fire regimes with further feedbacks to climate. We explore opportunities to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from savanna ecosystems through changes in savanna fire management.",

            "abstract": "Validations of the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) are necessary due to the strong sensitivity of temperature as an input parameter for many models. LST products with large errors may lead to significant uncertainties in subsequent applications. Most of the current validation methods rely on direct LST comparisons between the ground measurements at a single site and its corresponding pixel. However, due to the scale-mismatch, it is inappropriate to use the single-site data to evaluate the whole pixel value, especially over sparsely vegetated pixels or other heterogeneous pixels. Based on the geometric optical model, a ground-based realistic three-dimensional scene model (RTDS) is developed by taking into account the sun-ground target-sensor geometry, to calculate the surface temperature for a mixed pixel. In this model, the ground-based realistic three-dimensional scene is reconstructed, and the surface of the scene is divided into little surface elements. The sun light is treated as parallel rays in order to calculate the Boolean value of each surface element observed by the remote sensor to judge shadow or illumination, and thus we get the fraction of each component of the scene using face-factor. The RTDS modeled LST has the same extent as the field-of-view of the remote sensor. Therefore, it is comparable with the estimates of remotely sensed LST. The measurements over a sparsely vegetated surface in the downstream area of Heihe River basin are used to test the RTDS model. The results show that the calculated LST with the RTDS model agree well with the ground measurements. When the size of element is less than 0.1 m2, the modeled surface temperatures have negligible differences. The influences of different distributions of ground scene on the results are analyzed and the results indicate that the distribution of ground scene has a great impact on the calculated surface temperature. The proposed RTDS model provides a bridge to solve the problem of scale-mismatch between the ground measurement and the pixel value for heterogeneous surfaces. It is helpful to the validation of remotely sensed land surface temperature products.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 130 Ma, the India plate migration varied in velocity and direction. The oceanic magnetic anomalies indicates that the India-Asia convergence rate increase at ~ 90 Ma and at ~ 67 Ma. These episodes of acceleration correspond to the emplacement of Morondava and Deccan large igneous provinces, respectively. They therefore may be generated by the arrival of a mantle plume in the vicinity of India. We carried out laboratory experiments to examine and quantify the possible links between plume head impact and the acceleration of a continental plate. The latter is modelled by a buoyant raft, floating on the surface of a plexiglas tank containing Sugar Syrup, a temperature-dependent viscosity fluid. Plumes are generated by heating from below. The initial distance between the plume impact and the raft, as well as the raft size and density were systematically varied. The latter allows to evaluate the influence of a cratonic keel on the plate migration. Experimental results suggest that: (1) a continent can migrate under the influence of a plume head only if the thickness ratio between the keel and the plume head impact is greater than a critical value; (2) the maximum velocity achieved by the raft depends on the distance between the raft and the plume centre and (3) the direction taken by the raft is directly related to the position of the plume impact compared to the keel’s. Given the Deccan Traps plume characteristics, the scaling laws derived from the experiments suggest that India could migrate after the plume impact with a velocity ranging between 61 and 125 mm/yr. This estimated range is fully coherent with the India plate velocity calculated from the oceanic magnetic anomalies, but it put strong constraints on the existence and position of cratonic keels under India. Moreover, India migration during the last 130 Ma can be quantitavely related to the successive impacts of three mantle plumes.",

            "abstract": "Post-collisional high-K calc-alkaline volcanic rocks are widely distributed in Tengchong in the southeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau. Previous considerable petrological and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic researches undoubtedly indicate that the mantle beneath Tengchong is heterogeneous and enriched. However, the genesis of such a kind of mantle is still poor understood and needs more constrains. One of the key points lead to the answer to this question is that, is there any recycled carbonate involved? Therefore, Magnesium and calcium isotopic compositions of mantle-derived volcanics should be investigated because they are good candidates to be potentially used to trace recycling of ancient marine carbonates into the mantle.\nIn this study, we report high-precision Mg and Ca isotopic compositions for calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in Tengchong. These volcanic rocks show significantly lighter δ26Mg values (-0.44 to -0.36‰) than the mantle value (-0.25±0.07‰). Similarly, they display lighter δ44Ca values (0.65-0.80‰) than the mantle value (1.05±0.04‰). Because neither δ26Mg nor δ44Ca are correlated with SiO2 (50.8-61.6 wt.%) contents, and there is no relationships between δ26Mg or δ44Ca and typical trace element abundance ratios (e.g. Sm/Yb, Ba/Y), we conclude that magma differentiation or partial melting would lead to limited Mg and Ca isotopes fractionation. Thus, low δ26Mg and δ44Ca signatures of Tengchong volcanic rocks probably reflect that the δ26Mg and δ44Ca characteristics of the underneath mantle source, and are resulted from adding ancient marine carbonates into the primitive mantle which has low Mg and Ca isotopic compositions. Our model simulation using a two end-member mixing between Mg-Ca isotopic compositions of primitive mantle and ancient marine carbonate indicates that carbonates involved in the mantle source is mainly dolostone with minor limestone. Combined with the geotectonic evolution history in Tengchong, we propose that the enriched mantle is caused by sediments delivered by the subducted Tethyan oceanic crust. Our results also provides a good case study of using Mg-Ca isotopic characteristics as a useful tool to trace carbonates recycled into the mantle.\nThis work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41373007, No. 41490632 and 91328204).",

            "abstract": "The Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field includes an unusually large and recent concentration of silicic eruptions across a 23x17 km lake basin atop the southern Andes. We present findings that allow us to link currently observed deformation with a geological record of surface change spanning the Holocene. Since 2007 the crust here has been inflating at more than 20 cm/y. Geological, petrological, and geophysical findings have led to the hypothesis that the silicic vents have tapped an extensive, but ephemeral, layer of crystal-poor rhyolitic melt that began to form atop a mush zone that was established by ~20 ka, with a renewed phase of rhyolite eruptions concentrated around the southern flank of the basin during the Holocene (Singer et al., 2014). One of the earliest rhyolites, the 1 km3 Espejos coulée, 40Ar/39Ar-dated at 19 ka, dammed the northern outlet of Laguna del Maule raising the lake level ~200 m to form a prominent basin-wide shoreline. This shoreline was abandoned during an outbreak flood in the earliest Holocene. Surface exposure and 14C dating underway aims to refine the timing of the drop in lake level. Using an initial series of 40 short static GPS measurements around the basin, referenced to a set of 5 continuous GPS receivers, the elevation of this paleo-shoreline was determined to be 67 m higher at the southern end of the lake compared to the north. Interpretations of current surface deformation (Le Mével et al., in press), magnetotelluric data, earthquake distribution, and gravity changes suggest that magma is currently intruding at about 0.03 km3/yr at ~5 km depth. The amount of magma required to raise the surface 2 m during 8 yr is ~0.25 km3. If similar episodes of intrusion raised the roof of the magma reservoir by >60 m during the Holocene, it implies: (1) rapid accumulation of ~6 km3 of magma within the shallow crust, and (2) the locus of magma intrusion has shifted northward several km during the last 10 ky. It remains unclear whether any of the Holocene uplift was accommodated by faulting that may influence the distribution of silicic vents.\nLe Mével, et al., Evolution of unrest at Laguna del Maule volcanic field (Chile) from InSAR and GPS measurements, 2003 to 2014.

            "abstract": "Lake sediments are excellent climate archives and can be used for reconstructions of past precipitation and flood events. However, until now, there is no continous flood record for the entire last 60 000 years for Central Europe.\nThis study reconstructs the history of the main flood events in central Europe from event layers in sediment cores from Holocene Eifel maar lakes and Pleistocene dry maar structures. The cores were drilled in the Eifel region of western Germany. All maars have an inflow by a local stream and the largest flood events and associated suspension injections are nicely visible in the sediment. The specific sedimentation conditions explain the unique possibility to detect all 18 Greenland Interstadials in the total carbon concentration of the analysed maars. The allocation of the core material to all Greenland Interstadials and Stadials enables the exact climatic interpretation of the flood frequency. The stratigraphical concept leads to a classification of Landscape Evolution Zones in the Eifel region, which reconstruct the vegetation and the climate change. This classification is used to discuss the flood event succession concerning environmental changes.\nTo study the past flood events in detail, 10 cm long thin sections were sedimentological and geochemical analysed to distinguish flood layers from turbidites and slumps.Turbidites have a continuous grain size gradation; the grain size profile of flood events is in contrast characterized by several grain size maxima over the entire layer thickness. A flood event over several days shows numerous peaks of intense discharge, which lead to a discontinuous grain size gradient. As a consequence, 233 flood layers over 7.5 mm thickness were detected. The main flood stages are from: 0 – 4000, 11 500 – 17 500, 23 000 – 24 000, 29 000 – 35 000 and 44 000 – 44 500 b2k.\nOur time-series from the Eifel represents the first highly-resolved chronology for flood events from 60 000 years until present times and indicates variable periodicities of flood activity linked to predominant climatic and anthropogenic development. It turns out that low vegetation coverage related to Greenland Stadial phases or anthropogenic impact is the main cause for the development of flood layers in maar sediments, while precipitation plays only a secondary role.",

Both sites were under a Sudanian climate and located in Benin. All data was computed following the standard procedure. Flux responses to the main environmental factors were studied and discussed during the year within four periods. Water was found to be the main factor controlling the ecosystem dynamic. During dry season, while the CO2 assimilation was limited for the Savannah, it was reduced for the Forest. The respiration was always constantly higher for the Forest than Savannah sites. No clear relationships were found between nighttime fluxes and soil temperature, but the soil moisture appeared to be the main factor controlling the respiration at the two sites. At the seasonal scale, both CO2 assimilation and quantum efficiency were higher within each period at the Forest than Savannah sites. During the dry periods, the Forest acted as a carbon sink while the Savannah was clearly a carbon source. Annually, Forest and Savannah sequestered 0.64 ± 0.05 and 0.19 ± 0.04 kg C m-2, respectively. Besides, the difference of the two sites in land-use strategies and species, the drought could have a big impact on the carbon fluxes dynamics in West Africa.",

            "abstract": "Attributing the differences between models in the calculated concentrations and production rate of tropospheric ozone to differences in model processes has historically been difficult. We suggest that a new model diagnostic approach based on the conservation of quantum mechanical spin may allow a more informed comparison between models. This approach considers the allowed processing of the spin-paired electrons, which are emitted into the atmosphere through VOC emissions, the impact of spin-conservation rules on radical generation and then the fraction of radicals that react to give ozone. This accounting readily links large-scale model processes (emissions, chemical scheme, deposition) to the model ozone production. We discuss this new diagnostic in terms of the GEOS-Chem model and its response to changes in NOx and VOC emissions. This new diagnostic methodology may enable more informative model-model comparisons of tropospheric ozone production.",

A collaborative program between GSI/MoM and CSIR-NIO was formulated to explore the Cauvery-Mannar offshore basin for gas hydrate deposits (Fig. 1a). High quality multi-channel reflection seismics (MCS) data were acquired with 3,000 cu. in airgun source array and 3 km long hydrophone streamer (240 channels) onboard R/V Samudra Ratnakar for gas hydrate studies. Other geophysical data such as gravity, magnetic and multibeam data were also acquired along with seismic data.\nAfter routine processing of seismic data, the bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) are observed in the central and north-eastern part of the survey area. The BSRs are identified based on its characteristic features such as mimicking the seafloor, opposite polarity with respect to the seafloor and crosscutting the existing geological layers (Fig. 1b). At several locations, seismic signatures associated with free gas such as drop in interval velocity, pull-down structures, amplitude variation with offset (AVO) and attenuation are observed below the BSRs which confirm the presence of free gas in the study area. Acoustic chimneys are observed at some locations indicating vertical migration of the free gas. The observed seismic signatures established the presence of gas hydrates/free gas deposits in Cauvery-Mannar basin. Interestingly, BSRs appear to be distributed along the flanks of submarine canyon indicating the influence of geomorphology on the formation and distribution of gas hydrates.",

            "abstract": "The contourite depositional systems (CDS) along the southwestern Iberian Margin (SIM) bear the unmistakable signal of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) exiting the Strait of Gibraltar. This locality records key information concerning the effects of tectonic activity on margin sedimentation, the effects of MOW dynamics on Atlantic circulation, and how these factors may have influenced global climate. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 339 recently drilled five sites in the Gulf of Cadiz and two sites on the western Iberian margin. The integration of core and borehole data with other geophysical databases leads us to propose a new stratigraphic framework. Interpretation of IODP Exp. 339 data along with that from industry sources and onshore outcrop analysis helps refine our understanding of the SIM’s sedimentary evolution. We identify significant changes in sedimentary style and dominant sedimentary processes, coupled with widespread depositional hiatuses along the SIM. Following the 4.5 Ma cessation of a previous phase of tectonic activity related to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, tectonics continued to influence margin development, downslope sediment transport and CDS evolution. Sedimentary features indicate tectonic pulses of about 0.8 Ma duration with a pronounced overprint of ~2 -2.5 Ma cycles. Two major compressional events affecting to the Neogene basins at 3.2-3 Ma and 2-2.3 Ma help constrain the three main stages of CDS evolution. The stages include: 1) the initial-drift stage (5.33-3.2 Ma) with a weak MOW, 2) a transitional-drift stage (3.2-2 Ma) and 3) a growth-drift stage (2 Ma-present time) with enhanced MOW circulation and attendant contourite development due to greater bottom-current velocity. Two minor Pleistocene discontinuities at 0.7-0.9 Ma and 0.3-0.6 Ma record the effects of renewed tectonic activity on basin evolution. This research identifies time scales of tectonic controls on deep-marine sedimentation, specifically over periods of 2.5->0.4 Ma Shorter term climatic (orbital) mechanisms control sedimentation at time scales of ≤0.4 Ma. The role of bottom water circulation in shaping the seafloor and controlling the sedimentary stacking pattern on continental margins has to be seriously reconsidered in future studies.",

            "abstract": "Active-source 3D seismic migration and migration velocity analysis (MVA) are robust and highly used methods for imaging Earth structure. One class of migration methods uses extended images constructed by incorporating spatial and/or temporal wavefield correlation lags to the imaging conditions. These extended images allow users to directly assess whether images focus better with different parameters, which leads to MVA techniques that are based on the tenets of adjoint-state theory. Under certain conditions (e.g., geographical, cultural or financial), however, active-source methods can prove impractical. Utilizing ambient seismic energy that naturally propagates through the Earth is an alternate method currently used in the scientific community. Thus, an open question is whether extended images are similarly useful for ambient seismic migration processing and verifying subsurface velocity models, and whether one can similarly apply adjoint-state methods to perform ambient migration velocity analysis (AMVA).\nHerein, we conduct a number of numerical experiments that construct extended images from ambient seismic recordings. We demonstrate that, similar to active-source methods, there is a sensitivity to velocity in ambient seismic recordings in the migrated extended image domain. In synthetic ambient imaging tests with varying degrees of error introduced to the velocity model, the extended images are sensitive to velocity model errors. To determine the extent of this sensitivity, we utilize acoustic wave-equation propagation and cross-correlation-based migration methods to image weak body-wave signals present in the recordings. Importantly, we have also observed scenarios where non-zero correlation lags show signal while zero-lags show none. This may be a valuable missing piece for ambient migration techniques that have yielded largely inconclusive results, and might be an important piece of information for performing AMVA from ambient seismic recordings.",

            "abstract": "Grain size distribution (GSD) data are a widely used tool in Earth sciences, particularly in understanding sediment transportation and sourcing. Although large data sets are regularly generated, detailed numerical analyses, such as grain size unmixing, are not routinely performed.\nUnmixing of GSD data involves approximating a given data set by a small number of GSDs, known as end members. These end members, along with their relative abundances, can be used to fully characterize the variability of the data. End member analysis (EMA), which fits one set of end members to a single data set, is one the most robust ways to do this. This approach estimates the form of the end members from the data set itself; hence it is a non-parametric approach. Available algorithms, however, either produce sub-optimal solutions, or are time consuming.\nTo aid investigators in exploring the full potential of their data, we introduce AnalySize, which is a GUI based tool that allows for comprehensive processing and unmixing of grain size data obtained from laser diffraction particle grain size analyzers. AnalySize brings together methods from other disciplines in Earth sciences as well as introducing new techniques and improvements to provide a complete software package for unmixing GSD data. The software utilizes the rapid HALS-NMF algorithm from hyperspectral image analysis to perform non-parametric EMA, which is demonstrated to yield results that are an improvement over algorithms currently used in GSD analysis.\nNon-parametric EMA, however, is often unable to clearly identify discrete unimodal grain size sub-populations, which can more detailed information about sediment sources. To alleviate this, we introduce a new algorithm to perform parametric EMA, whereby an entire GSD data set can be unmixed into unimodal parametric end members (e.g., lognormal or Weibull end members). This allows individual grain size sub-populations to be more readily identifiable in highly mixed data set. This new approach overcomes the shortcomings of techniques used to unmix single specimen data, which are widely used, but inherently flawed. These new tools, along with a suite of standard analysis statistics and plots, are packaged in a user friendly GUI, which is capable of processing and wide range of data formats.",

With current climate projections indicating a general increase in air temperatures, as well as more frequent and intense heat waves, cooling energy demand will increase with time and should therefore be considered by industry and policy makers. Cooling degree days (CDD) are a standard approach used by energy industry to estimate cooling demand. The methodology compares ambient temperatures with a base value for air temperature considered representative of the city being analysed. However, due to the Urban Heat Island effect, temperature and energy consumption will vary considerably across a city. Hence, for CDD to be estimated across an urban area, air temperature data from dense urban networks are required. This study analysed air temperature data available from a dense urban meteorological network to estimate CDD and cooling needs across Birmingham-UK for summer 2013. From the results, it was possible to identify the potential role and limitations of urban meteorological networks in forecasting electricity demand within a city for future climate scenarios.",

Groundwater samples were taken on a weekly basis from September 2008 to June 2015 from a 100 m deep borehole at Hafralækur which is situated in the seismically-active Tjörnes Fracture Zone (TFZ), a transform plate boundary in northern Iceland. Chemical analyses of groundwater samples revealed significant increases in the concentrations of Na, Si, Ca and Al before consecutive M>5 earthquakes in October 2012 and April 2013 (Skelton et al. 2014) and an ongoing decrease in their concentrations after these earthquakes. Chemical analyses of drill cuttings from an adjacent borehole revealed that (1) water inlets are located at the boundaries between lava flows, and (2) Na concentrations in drill cuttings are elevated alongside these water inlets. Further, mineralogical studies of drill cuttings reveal that zeolites are abundant around water inlets and that they occur both filling vesicles and as pseudomorphs of labradorite. Plagioclase is perfectly pseudomorphed by sodic analcime based on which we interpret replacement by an interface-coupled dissolution/precipitation mechanism. Vesicles are filled with calcic chabazite. From these replacement textures, we infer that chemical changes in groundwater before and after the M>5 earthquakes were caused by cation release during constant volume replacement of plagioclase by zeolites coupled with cation uptake during zeolite formation in vesicles.\nSkelton, A., M.

These can be explained by the slip behavior changes in conditionally stable regions due to high loading rates.\nWe examined temporal changes in interplate repeater activities following the Tohoku EQ in a small area off Iwate, Japan (~39.75°N, 142.35°E) where large afterslip was estimated to have been occurring (e.g., Sun & Wang, 2015). We performed hypocenter relocations by the double-difference method (Waldhauser & Ellsworth, 2000) using arrival-time differences estimated from waveform cross-spectra.\nBefore the Tohoku EQ, M2.5-2.9 events (Group A) repeatedly occurred at almost the same location in the area with quasi-periodic recurrence intervals (9-12 months). There were no M≥2.0 events within 5km from the Group A.\nAfter the Tohoku EQ, three significant changes were observed.\n(1) At the location of the Group A, larger earthquakes (M≥3.0) than before started to repeat with much shorter recurrence intervals, similar to the previous report (Uchida et al., 2015).\n(2) Two repeating sequences emerged to the ~600m NNW (Group B; M3.2-3.9) and ~700m NNE (Group C; M2.2-4.4) of the Group A, where there had been no events before the Tohoku EQ. This can be interpreted as the aseismic-to-seismic transitions in conditionally stable patches due to the fast loading rate.\n(3) Magnitudes tended to become smaller as time passed in each sequence. The Group C-events disappeared after the M2.2 event in January 2012. This suggests the seismic-slip areas gradually shrunk over time due to the decay of the afterslip.\nThese observations show that temporal changes in the loading rate play an important role in the diversity of interplate earthquakes as well as the spatial heterogeneity of frictional properties along the plate boundary.",

We present a systematic study of their long-term relationship in convective numerical simulations of the geodynamo. All models comprise gravitational coupling between the inner core and the mantle, in addition to electromagnetic coupling at the inner core and core-mantle boundaries. We show that the strength of these couplings has no influence on the global shear available in the fluid shell, whose amount is entirely governed by the vigor of convection. This shear is distributed between the long-term westward drift and the long-term differential rotation of the inner core, in proportions controlled by the magnitudes of the electromagnetic and gravitational couplings. Present-day estimate of this available shear matches the westward drift observed on average during the last 400 years, which implies a non-existent long-term inner core differential rotation. Assuming a lower mantle conductance of order 108 S, this in turns sets a constraint on the minimum stiffness of the inner core, the viscosity of which should be larger than 2×1017 Pa.s for the westward drift to dominate.",

In this study, the first glacial lake inventories for the Third Pole were conducted for ~1990, 2000, and 2010 using Landsat TM/ETM+ data. Glacial lake spatial distributions, corresponding areas and temporal changes were examined. The significant results are as follows. (1) There were 4602, 4981, and 5701 glacial lakes (> 0.003 km2) covering areas of 553.9 ± 90, 581.2 ± 97, and 682.4 ± 110 km2 in ~1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively; these lakes are primarily located in the Brahmaputra (39%), Indus (28%), and Amu Darya (10%) basins. (2) Small lakes (< 0.2 km2) are more sensitive to climate changes. (3) Lakes closer to glaciers and at higher altitudes, particularly those connected to glacier termini, have undergone larger area changes. (4) Glacier-fed lakes are dominant in both quantity and area (> 70%) and exhibit faster expansion trends overall compared to non-glacier-fed lakes. We conclude that glacier meltwater may play a dominant role in the areal expansion of most glacial lakes in the Third Pole. In addition, the patterns of the glacier-fed lakes correspond well with warming temperature trends and negative glacier mass balance patterns. This paper presents an important database of glacial lakes and provides a basis for long-term monitoring and evaluation of outburst flood disasters primarily caused by glacial lakes in the Third Pole.",

            "abstract": "The Moon is thought to have formed by re-accretion of material ejected by a giant impact on Earth [e.g., 1]. This model, at least in its classical form, predicts an isotopic difference between the Earth and Moon, because the Moon would largely consist of impactor material. Yet Earth and Moon show an unexpected isotopic similarity for many elements [e.g., 2]. Here we use variations in 182W—the decay-product of short-lived 182Hf (t1/2~9 Myr)—between the Moon and the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) to shed new light on this issue. We precisely determined the lunar 182W value by analysing KREEP-rich samples with MC-ICPMS and a new approach for quantifying cosmogenic 182W variations using Hf isotopes [6].\nWe find that the Moon shows a 27±4 ppm 182W excess over the modern BSE, in excellent agreement with [7]. This excess agrees with the predicted 182W change resulting from disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon after Earth’s core had fully formed [6,7]. Thus, the pre-late-veneer BSE and the Moon were indistinguishable in 182W. However, the giant impact itself should have caused a notable Earth–Moon 182W difference by (1) changing the ε182W of the proto-Earth mantle by adding impactor mantle and core material, both carrying distinct 182W anomalies, and (2) by supplying W-rich but 182W-depleted impactor core material into the lunar accretion disk [6]. Thus, the Earth–Moon 182W homogeneity is an unexpected outcome of the giant impact. Unlike for Ti and O isotopes, the 182W homogeneity cannot be explained by accretion of impactor and proto-Earth from a homogeneous inner disk reservoir [3] or by making the Moon fully from proto-Earth mantle [4,5]. Thus, the 182W results require an efficient post-impact isotopic equilibration of the BSE and the Moon, but the mechanism for this has yet to be explored. One option is that Earth’s mantle and its vapour atmosphere remained connected with the lunar accretion disk just after the giant impact [8].\n[1] Canup R.M. & Asphaug E. (2001) Nature 412, 708-712.

            "abstract": "Mg isotope holds promise to decipher the evaporative environment of evaporites. High-precision Mg isotope compositions of the late Permian langbeinites have been measured by using MC-ICPMS. The equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation factor between langbeinite and aqueous Mg2+ solutions has been determined using quantum chemistry calculations. All computations are employed at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level and solvation effects are treated by solvent model (“water-droplet” approach), mineral structures are constructed using volume variable cluster models (VVCM). The Mg isotope compositions of the langbeinite samples, whose total formation thickness ranges up to 100 meters, are extremely isotopically lighter than that of modern seawater and relatively homogeneous (δ26MgDSM3 is from -4.12±0.03‰ to -3.81±0.07‰ v.s. -0.83‰ of modern seawater). The computed equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation factors between langbeinite and aqueous Mg2+ solutions are -2.73‰, -2.66‰ and -2.53‰ at 25, 30 and 40 ℃, respectively. These significant equilibrium fractionation factors indicate that a huge equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation between langbeinite and its parent brine can happen during langbeinite depositions, and langbeinites are enriched in isotopically light 24Mg comparing to the brine. Using the computed fractionation factors to simulate a Rayleigh fractionation process of langbeinite Mg precipitation, we find that a significant Mg isotope difference between langbeinite and its growing brine (seawater) is indeed present but the Mg isotope composition of langbeinite merely increase monotonically in a closed system. Because of that, the homogenous Mg isotope compositions of such a thick evaporite sequence suggest a disequlibrium effect rather than an equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation behavior during its formation. Combined with its prevailing Mg-bearing character, the homogenous Mg isotope compositions reveal that this the late Permian langbeinite sequence has experienced a rapid depositional process and a relatively closed hydrological environment.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes in diffuse plate boundaries occur in spatially and temporally complex patterns. The region east of the Sierra Nevada that encompasses the northern Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ), Walker Lane (WL), and the westernmost part of the Basin and Range province (B&R) is such a kind of plate boundary. In order to better understand the relationship between moderate-to major earthquakes in this area, we modeled the evolution of coseismic, postseismic and interseismic Coulomb stress changes (∆CFS) in this region at two different spatio-temporal scales. In the first example we examined seven historical and instrumental Mw ≥ 6 earthquakes that struck the region around Owens Valley (northern ECSZ) in the last 150 years. In the second example we expanded our study area to all of the northern ECSZ, WL and western B&R, examining seventeen paleoseismological and historical major surface-rupturing earthquakes (Mw ≥ 6.5) that occurred in the last 1400 years. We show that in both cases the majority of the studied events (100% in the first case and 80% in the second) are located in areas of combined coseismic and postseismic positive ∆CFS. This relationship is robust, as shown by control tests with random earthquake sequences. We also show that the White Mountain fault has accumulated up to 30 bars of total ∆CFS (coseismic + postseismic + interseismic) in the last 150 years, and the Hunter Mountain, Fish Lake Valley, Black Mountain, and Pyramid Lake faults have accumulated 40, 45, 54 and 37 bars respectively in the last 1400 years. Such values are comparable to the average stress drop in a major earthquake, and all these faults may be therefore close to failure.",

            "abstract": "Compilations of worldwide benthic δ18O records (Zachos et al. 2001, 2008; Cramer et al. 2009) led to a significant improvement of our understanding of changing ocean circulation characteristics in the Cenozoic. However, in these compilations, different isotopic records are accumulated and individual astronomical cycles are not always clearly recognizable. Here, we present a benthic δ18O megasplice for the last 35 Ma that results from the splicing of 11 globally distributed high-resolution isotope records (>11000 measurements). We carefully correlated these isotope records in their overlapping parts, and slightly revised the original astronomical age models when necessary. The result is a megasplice in which individual astronomical cycles are clearly delineated throughout the last 35 Ma. The main disadvantage is that data from single sites do not reflect whole ocean conditions. Nevertheless, benthic δ18O records from the deep ocean can be regarded as resembling globally averaged temperature and ice-volume conditions.\nSubsequently, the imprint of astronomical climate forcing in the megasplice is displayed in a novel way. We display the response of benthic δ18O to obliquity and eccentricity-modulated precession for 800-kyr wide time-windows. The δ18O response in function of obliquity and e·sin(w) allows for an assessment of the relative strength of obliquity and precession. The benthic δ18O response plot as a function of e·sin(w) and e·cos(w) can be viewed as polar plots of which the azimuth represents the longitude of the perihelion and the distance from the pole represents eccentricity. The month during which the Earth reaches perihelion is indicated at the corresponding azimuth. This novel way of visualizing the astronomical imprint allows us to visualise non-trivial dependencies of climate on the phase and amplitude of astronomical parameters. The supplemented figure displays the differences in δ18O response between the 100-kyr and the 41-kyr world. However, the constructed megasplice allows for an endless amount of such comparisons. For example, a comparison of the response before and after the Oligocene–Miocene transition shows that it was predominantly the northern hemisphere that drove global climate during the Oligocene, and the southern hemisphere during the Miocene.",

            "abstract": "The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is widely employed in soil hydrology but is challenged by the characteristics of the processes there. These are highly nonlinear and state variables occasionally show sharp fronts and discontinuities across layer boundaries. This leads to sometimes strongly non-gaussian probability distributions, which is at odds with the EnFK's basic assumption. Therefore, we explore particle filters, which are able to handle such situations. However, standard particle filters with resampling suffer from the curse of dimensionality. They are thus not applicable to high-dimensional systems as they are encountered with soil water dynamics. A particle filter that may be able to lift this curse was proposed by van Leeuwen (2010). He introduced a nudging term based on the freedom of the proposal density. This particle filter has been applied in oceanography and showed promising results.\nWhile oceanography focuses on state estimation, soil hydrology in addition aims at parameter estimation. Therefore, we test the applicability of this filter for a one-dimensional test case, where we estimate states and parameters simultaneously. We generate synthetic data that correspond to water content measurements as they would be available from time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. The results are compared with the true parameters and water contents. Finally, the performance of this filter (with different nudging terms) is compared with an EnKF and a particle filter without nudging.",

            "abstract": "The coniferous forest (largely composed of Abies mariesii) is presently the typical vegetation of the subalpine zone in Japan. Pollen analysis revealed that few A. mariesii were present during the last glacial period, and the species began to expand to the subalpine zone during the Holocene (Morita, 1992). However, on Mt. Akita-Komagatake in northern Japan, the expected predominance of A. mariesii is not extensively observed, and the predominant vegetation is instead the dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis). It is unknown why the area under coniferous forest is small in this region. Therefore, I examined this issue from the perspectives of (1) distribution of vegetation, (2) geomorphology, (3) soil moisture, and (4) vegetation history. (1) Precise digital elevation model data and photographic interpretation showed that this coniferous forest was densely distributed in a flat segment considered to be formed by a landslide; (2) this landslide is thought to have occurred up to 3,699 ± 26 yr BP because a boring-core specimen from the landslide included the AK-3 tephra layer (2,300–2,800 yr BP: Wachi et al, 1997) and the radiocarbon date of the lowermost humic soil layer was 3,699 ± 26 yr BP; (3) the soil in the forest area had higher volumetric water content than that in the non-forest area; and (4) phytolith analysis revealed that the main species in the study site was initially dwarf bamboo, but coniferous forest replaced it after the Towada-a tephra (1035 cal. BP, Machida and Arai, 1992) layer fell. These results suggest that soil water conditions changed because of the formation of the flat segment by the landslide, and the coniferous forest was consequently established. However, the landslide only indirectly affected the formation of the coniferous forest, because the forest developed over several thousand years after the landslide occurred. In other words, more direct reasons for the establishment of the coniferous forest may involve changes in soil moisture. This unresolved issue warrants further investigation of the vegetation on the subalpine zone.",

            "abstract": "Spatial precipitation model which is capable of deriving climate change scenarios at a finer spatial resolution has been playing crucial role in many hydrological applications. Regional climate models (RCMs) are promising tools which can provide projected precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study investigates asymmetrical spatial dependence of precipitation obtained from historical and future RCM simulations on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas.\nThe study regions are located on the south part of Germany namely the states of Bavaria, Baden Württemberg, and Rhine Pfalz using 890 observation stations. RCM grid points are then selected based on nearest grid point to each observation site. Empirical bivariate copulas are constructed by adopting the concept of regionalized of variables in spatial random process assuming that for every selected time interval, precipitation over the region of interest is assumed to be a realization of spatial random process. To get reasonable this assumption, investigation regions are divided into several sub-regions and selected based on homogeneity areas with little topography variation. In order to study behavior of the precipitation fields at different time scales, the data are aggregated into the higher time scales for instance at 5, 10, 15 days, monthly, and quarterly in each different seasons. The asymmetrical dependence is calculated using the deviation between the joint probability of exceeding a quantile 1-u and not exceeding the quantile u for each realization using different values of u (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4). Positive asymmetric indicates that the high values have a stronger dependence than the low values and vice versa. Gaussian simulation based testing is then applied for counting its degree of uncertainty.\nEmpirical evidences prove that both observations and RCM simulations show an interesting systematic pattern relating to the domination of positive non-symmetrical dependence in short distance and small time steps especially for extreme events in most of different sub-regions and seasons. Precipitations with high intensity tend to exhibit a high spatial clustering behaviour. However, RCM simulations have slight less degree of domination and smaller coverage areas of positive asymmetrical dependence than observations.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial core formation occurred by gravitational segregation of immiscible metal and silicate melts in an extensively molten proto-Earth. This stripped the bulk silicate Earth of most of its siderophile elements, which were concentrated in the core. The process occurs by virtue of partitioning through a redox reaction (e.g. [1]) whereby iron in the metal exchanges for a bonded siderophile element in the mantle. By performing metal-silicate equilibration experiments at extreme pressures and temperatures using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell, we find that the major lithophile component of the silicate Earth, namely MgO, can also become soluble in the metal. At close to 5000 K, our experiments show that up to 1.2 % MgO can be incorporated in the metal. We show that Mg incorporation in the metal isn’t a redox reaction as with siderophile element partitioning, but rather a direct solubility of the MgO component as temperatures approach the metal-silicate solvus; in that respect, our results are fully consistent with the recently calculated Fe-MgO solvus [2]. This confirms that significant amounts of magnesium could have been added to the early core, provided that a giant impact had generated the necessary temperature increase. The subsequent exsolution of MgO driven by core cooling would have provided a significant buoyancy source, likely sufficient to drive core convection and producing an ancient magnetic field [3].\n[1] J.

Most of the observatory is in a badland area characterized by steep gullies and high erosion rates (up to 1cm/year). Within the observatory, the study focuses on the Moulin, which is an 8ha catchment located at an elevation of 850-925m, with 54% of badland area.\nAvailable data includes DEM, meteorological data, high-frequency records of discharge and suspended sediment concentration during the floods, cumulative values of bedload transport for each flood, high-frequency records of bedload transport for a few events from a Birkbeck sampler.\nModeling sediment delivery in such a catchment is challenging because 1) most available models have been designed for low-relief regions and do not account for steep slope processes such as debris flow and landslides; 2) hydrology (especially flashfloods) in mountainous regions is not well understood; 3) soil properties are very heterogeneous ; 4) multiple time scales are involved: seasonal sediment production on the slopes, storage in the bed and exportation requires to work on yearly times scales, while summer floods and most sediment delivery events occur over a few minutes only.\nWe evaluate the ability of the SHETRAN model to reproduce sediment delivery patterns from the catchment. First, we calibrate the hydrological model using one year of meteorological and hydrological data. We then apply the sediment transport module over several flood events, using in-situ measurements of bed and slope grain-size distributions. Finally we investigate how sediment available on the slopes moves through the catchment over a year.\nEvent-scale volumes of sediment simulated by the model are comparable to observed values within an order of 2. Sediment delivery rates are very sensitive to the slope grain-size distribution. Depending on sediment availability on the slopes and on soil erodibility, the catchment is running either in a supply-limited or transport-limited mode. Finally, when feeding the model with frost-induced loose sediment on the slopes at the end of winter, as suggested by field observations, the model is able to reproduce a seasonal pattern of slope erosion, temporary storage in the upper catchment then bed scouring.",

This paper presents a tentative study in upscaling of z0m in North Tibetan Plateau, based on ground measurement data of different spatial scales from eddy covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS) and NDVI products from MODIS with 250m and 2km spatial resolutions. The comparison of z0m calculated from EC and LAS data indicates that the z0m values at both scales have apparent seasonal variations, and are in good agreement with that of NDVI. However, z0m_LAS is higher than z0m_EC, which is attributed to the differences of roughness elements in their footprints. An upscaling relationship about z0m was established with z0m observations and NDVI products of MODIS.In addition, an altitude correction factor was introduced into vegetation height estimation with NDVI, because the low temperature environment in North Tibetan Plateau due to its high altitude has strong influence on vegetation heights.The z0m retrievals with NDVI products with 250m spatial resolutions from June to September are validated with ground z0m results of Naqu/Amdo, Naqu/MS3478 and Naqu/NewD66 and the agreement is acceptable. The spatial distribution of z0m at 250m spatial resolutions in North Tibetan Plateau from June to September shows that z0m values are below 0.015m in most area, except the area in the southeast part where z0m values reach 0.025m due to lower altitudes. The z0m retrievals at 2km spatial resolutions of the same period range from 0.015 to 0.065m, and high values appear in the area with lower altitudes.The z0m retrievals at both spatial scales are affected by altitude, indicating the uniqueness of Tibetan Plateau. Frequency statistics on z0m retrievals at both spatial resolutions from June to September, 2012 shows obvious typical monthly changes in monsoon season.",

            "abstract": "The quality of ash dispersion prediction is limited by the lack of high quality information on eruption source parameters. One of the most important one is the ash cloud top height (ACTH). Because of well-known uncertainties of currently operational methods, photogrammetric methods can be used to improve height estimates. Some satellites have on board multiangular instruments that can be used for photogrammetrical observations. Volcanic ash clouds, however, can move with velocities over several m/s making these instruments inappropriate for accurate ACTH estimation. Thus we propose here two novel methods tested on different case studies (Etna 2013/11/23, Zhupanovsky 2014/09/10).\nThe first method is based on NASA program Crew Earth observations from International Space Station (ISS). ISS has a lower orbit than most operational satellites, resulting in a shorter minimal time between two images required to produce a suitable parallax. In addition, images made by the ISS crew are taken by a full frame sensor and not a line scanner that most operational satellites use. Such data make possible to observe also short time evolution of clouds.\nThe second method is based on the parallax between data retrieved from two geostationary instruments. We implemented a combination of MSG SEVIRI (HRV band; 1000 m nadir spatial resolution, 5 min temporal resolution) and METEOSAT7 MVIRI (VIS band, 2500 m nadir spatial resolution, 30 min temporal resolution). The procedure works well if the data from both satellites are retrieved nearly simultaneously. However, MVIRI does not retrieve the data at exactly the same time as SEVIRI. To compensate for advection in the atmosphere we use two sequential SEVIRI images (one before and one after the MVIRI retrieval) and interpolate the cloud position from SEVIRI data to the time of MVIRI retrieval.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning (BB) is a large source of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols. During the burning, several organic and inorganic gases and particles are emitted into the atmosphere. Here, we present seasonal variations of specific BB tracers such as levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, which are produced by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses. We collected TSP aerosol samples (n= 32) from Fairbanks, Alaska in June 2008 to June 2009. Levoglucosan was detected as the dominant anhydrosugar followed by its isomers, mannosan and galactosan. The result of levoglucosan showed clear seasonal trends with winter maximum (ave.145 ng m-3) and spring minimum (12.3 ng m-3). The analyses of air mass back trajectories and fire spots demonstrated that anhydrosugars may be associated from residential heating and cooking in local region and Siberia in winter time. Levoglucosan showed significant positive correlation with EC (r= 0.67, p= 0.001) and OC (r= 0.51, p= 0.002) but there was no correlation with nss-K+ (r= -0.16, p= 0.37). The emission of K+ from biomass burning depends on burning condition and types of material burned. There are two possible reasons, which can be explained for the lack of correlation between levoglucosan and K+. First, specific burning materials may be used for residential heating, which can’t produce K+. Secondly, K+ could be deposit on the surface of chimney breast and it can’t emit into the atmosphere. Anhydrosugars contributed 4.4% to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and 2.4% to organic carbon (OC). Their highest values of WSOC (8.1%) and OC (4.9%) in wintertime indicate that contribution of BB to Alaskan aerosols is important in winter period. The current study presents for the first time one-year observation on BB tracers in the subarctic region, which provide useful information to better understand the effect of biomass burning on subarctic atmosphere. It will also be helpful for further long-term climate studies in this region.",

            "abstract": "Hotspots are thermal instabilities coming from various depths in the mantle. Their activity is often revealed by surface and sub-surface phenomena such as volcanic trapps or oceanic plateaus, and volcanic island tracks on the seafloor. The two first are often linked to the eruption of a hotspot head, while the third is due to the volcanic material fed by the subsequent tail. Consequences of a hotspot tail on the oceanic lithosphere are well known, while its effect on the continental lithosphere is most often masked by the thickness of the lithosphere. The aim of our study is to try and link hotspot tracks with geological events in the continental lithosphere. Hotspot tracks are first built using a modified version of the hybrid reference frame of Seton et al. (2012), and their effect on the continental lithosphere is then evaluated using geological markers issued from petroleum wells, in particular the sedimentary record, backstripping, heat flux anomaly and temperature data. A case study is performed on the Arabian Plate, potentially crossed by two hotspots (Afar and Comores). Several W-E heat flux profiles display a large thermal anomaly close to the Red Sea, while a smaller N-S elongated heat flow anomaly more to the E suggests that a hotspot track could impact the thermal history of the Arabian plate.",

            "abstract": "There is growing concern about increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts globally in recent years. Improving knowledge on the complexity of hydrological systems and their interactions with climate is essential to be able to determine drivers of these extreme events and to predict changes in these drivers under altered climate conditions. This is particularly true in cold regions such as the Swedish Sub-Arctic where independent shifts in both precipitation and temperature can have significant influence on extremes. This study explores changes in the magnitude and timing of the annual maximum daily flows in 18 Swedish sub-arctic catchments. The Mann-Kendall trend test was used to estimate changes in selected hydrological signatures. Further, a flood frequency analysis was conducted by fitting a Gumbel (Extreme Value type I) distribution whereby selected flood percentiles were tested for stationarity using a generalized least squares regression approach.\nOur results showed that hydrological systems in cold climates have complex, heterogeneous interactions with climate. Shifts from a snowmelt-dominated to a rainfall-dominated flow regime were evident with all significant trends pointing towards (1) lower flood magnitudes in the spring flood; (2) earlier flood occurrence; (3) earlier snowmelt onset; and (4) decreasing mean summer flows. Decreasing trends in flood magnitude and mean summer flows suggest permafrost thawing and are in agreement with the increasing trends in annual minimum flows. Trends in the selected flood percentiles showed an increase in extreme events over the entire period of record, while trends were variable under shorter periods. A thorough uncertainty analysis emphasized that the applied trend test is highly sensitive to the period of record considered. As such, no clear overall regional pattern could be determined suggesting that how catchments are responding to changes in climatic drivers is strongly influenced by their physical characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The 1300 Ma Grønnedal-Íka igneous complex in southwest Greenland comprises nepheline syenites and carbonatites. It belongs to a suite of intrusions formed 1300-1100 Ma ago referred to as the Gardar period. In modern time (the last ca. 8000 years), fluid-rock interactions involving the nepheline syenites and carbonatites gives rise to about one thousand submarine columns made of the rare low-T mineral ikaite (CaCO3x6H2O). The columns are found in a shallow, narrow fjord named Ikka Fjord and their distribution clearly follows the outcrop of the Grønnedal-Íka complex. When meteoric water percolates through the highly fractured complex, a sodium carbonate solution of pH 10 is formed through hitherto unknown fluid-rock reactions. This basic solution seeps up through fractures at the bottom of Ikka Fjord and when mixed with seawater, the mineral ikaite is formed. As the seepage water has a lower density than seawater, there is an upwards flow that creates columns. What is peculiar about ikaite is its limited stability making it unstable above +6 °C. Isotopic studies of ikaite reveal a seawater origin for the Ca2+ ions, and the carbonatite being the most likely source for the CO32- ions. The carbonatite is mainly of søvite composition (CaCO3) with high contents of siderite and ankerite in certain areas. The nepheline syenites contain Na,K-rich minerals like nepheline, alkali-feldspar, aegirine-augite, katophorite and biotite. Nepheline is mainly replaced by muscovite, and aegirine-augite partly by chlorite, which could release sodium into solution. A dolerite dyke of unknown age prompted extensive mineralization of magnetite by activating hydrothermal fluid convection. The fluid interacted with the carbonatite, replacing siderite and ankerite by magnetite and later hematite. In a newly launched project at Stockholm University, we are trying to unravel the chemical reactions taking place inside the Grønnedal-Íka igneous complex leading to the formation of the sodium carbonate solution issuing in Ikka Fjord.",

            "abstract": "Dilla is a socio-economically important town in Ethiopia, established on the international highway joining capital cities of Ethiopia and Kenya. It serves as an administrative center of the Gedeo Zone in SNNPR region of Ethiopia accommodating around 65000 inhabitants and also as an important trade centre for coffee. Due to the recent developments and urbanization in town and surrounding area, waste and sewage discharge has been raised significantly into the water resources. Also frequent rainfall in the region worsens the problem of water quality.\nIn this view, present study aims to analyze water quality profile of Dilla town using 12 physico-chemical parameters. 15 Sampling stations are identified amongst the open wells, bore wells and from surface water, which are being extensively used for drinking and other domestic purposes. Spectrophotometer is used to analyze data and Gaussian process regression is used to interpolate the same in GIS environment to represent spatial distribution of parameters. Based on observed and desirable values of parameters, water quality index (WQI); an indicator of weighted estimate of the quantities of various parameters ranging from 1 to 100, is developed in GIS. Higher value of WQI indicates better while low value indicates poor water quality. This geospatial analysis is carried out before and after rainfall to understand temporal variation with reference to rainfall which facilitates in identifying the potential zones of drinking water. WQI indicated that 8 out of 15 locations come under acceptable category indicating the suitability of water for human use, however remaining locations are unfit. For example: the water sample at main_campus_ustream_1 (site name) site has very low WQI after rainfall, making it unfit for human usage. This suggests undertaking of certain measures in town to enhance the water quality. These results are useful for town authorities to take corrective measures and ameliorate the water quality for human use.",

At the altitude of the satellite, the instruments will measure X and gamma rays produced from sources at lower altitude, and filtered by the atmosphere, together with secondary produced relativistic electrons and positrons. Such measurements only give an indirect access to the source of the TGF, and we need a numerical model of the transport of these burst emissions through the atmosphere, and their interactions with the satellite, including the response of the detectors. This theoretical-experimental approach provides a way to relate the source region to the observations which will be used to better constrain the TGF production mechanism.\nA first stage has already been accomplished by developing the MC-PEPTITA Monte Carlo model (see Sarria et al. 2015, JGRA) which is able to model the transport of X/gamma-rays and relativistic electrons/positrons through the atmosphere, from the source region up to the altitude of the satellite. The next step is to extend this model to take into account the detection of the energetic particles by the three XGRE sensors by making a full GEANT4 model, validating it by comparison with laboratory experiments, and building its response matrix (for photons and electrons). In this presentation, we will present this strategy in detail, and discuss some preliminary results.",

Total seventy fog water samples were collected at two different sites in Delhi during December 2014 to March 2015. Selected parameters such as pH, major anions (Cl-, F-, NO3- and SO42-) and major cations (NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) were determined in the samples. The pH of the fog water collected during the monitoring period at Site I (traffic intersection) varied from 4.68 to 5.58 indicating the acidic nature of fog water while at the site II (green cover area), it ranged from 6.11 to 6.88 having slightly lower acidity. At the Site I, the average concentration of Cl-, Na+, SO42-, NH4+ was recorded as 1.5 X 10-2, 8 X 10-3, 4 X 10-3 and 1 X 10-2 µEqu/L respectively. Such values of ionic species may be attributed to the local sources, including factories, motor vehicle emissions and civil construction etc. However, non-local sources such as moderate- and long-range transport of sea salt also had significant influence on ionic content of fog water. In general the Na+ ratio values were found to be higher side suggesting the influence of non-marine sources. Extremely high values of Cl-/ Na+ ratios indicated the contribution from combustion of organochlorine compounds. Hence, the higher ratios of inorganic ions and acidic pH revealed that fog is an effective mechanism for the scavenging of various pollutants emitted by different sources in the city.",

            "abstract": "Are there any effective methods to reveal paleoearthquakes on normal faults except traditional trenching technique? In this paper, we study Holocene paleoearthquakes of the Daqingshan fault which is a normal fault along the Daqingshan piedmont of Inner Mongolia in China. We identify knickpoints from stream profiles and study alluvial soil profiles to reconstruct the Holocene paleoearthquakes of the fault. From the fault’s footwall we extract 25 gullies from IRS-P5 DEM data, and identify knickpoints in the profile that result from fault motion disturbing each channel. We combine the retreat distances and the knickpoint retreat rates to determine each knickpoint’s forming time. We study alluvial fan outcrops that contain various paleosol sequences. As three distinct Holocene paleosols developed in the Daqingshan piedmont alluvial fans, we assume that the soil profile development was interrupted by fault activity preserved by interbedded gravel between the paleosols. The gravel layer between two adjacent paleosol layers represents material transported there after a paleoseismic event. Thus we date paleosol layers which are above and below the gravel layer to constrain paleoseismic events. Since trenches had been made by our predecessors along the fault to reveal the Holocene paleoearthquakes, we identify the Holocene paleoearthquake records from both sides of the fault, and then compare the results with the results from the trenches. The final result demonstrates that the knickpoints’ sequence in the footwall and the paleosols’ ages in the hanging wall correspond very closely with the Holocene paleoearthquakes along the Daqingshan piedmont fault. Methods in this paper have future application value to study paleoearthquakes on other normal faults with similar structure to the Daqingshan fault.",

            "abstract": "According to the IPCC fifth assessment report (2013), clouds and aerosols still contribute to the largest uncertainty when estimating and interpreting changes to the Earth's energy budget. Therefore, understanding the interaction between radiation and aerosols is both crucial for remote sensing observations and modelling the climate forcing arising from aerosols.\nCarbon particles are the largest contributor to the aerosol absorption of solar radiation, thereby enhancing the warming of the planet. Modelling the radiative properties of carbon particles is a hard task and involves many uncertainties arising from the difficulties of accounting for the morphologies and heterogeneous chemical composition of the particles. This study aims to compare two ways of modelling the optical properties of aerosols simulated by a chemical transport model. The first method models particle optical properties as homogeneous spheres and are externally mixed. This is a simple model that is particularly easy to use in data assimilation methods, since the optics model is linear. The second method involves a core-shell internal mixture of soot, where sulphate, nitrate, ammonia, organic carbon, sea salt, and water are contained in the shell. However, by contrast to previously used core-shell models, only part of the carbon is concentrated in the core, while the remaining part is homogeneously mixed with the shell.\nThe chemical transport model (CTM) simulations are done regionally over Europe with the Multiple-scale Atmospheric Transport and CHemistry (MATCH) model, developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The MATCH model was run with both an aerosol dynamics module, called SALSA, and with a regular \"bulk\" approach, i.e., a mass transport model without aerosol dynamics. Two events from 2007 are used in the analysis, one with high (22/12-2007) and one with low (22/6-2007) levels of elemental carbon (EC) over Europe.\nThe results of the study help to assess the significance of aerosol morphology for modelling radiative forcing and aerosol optical properties relevant to interpreting remote sensing observations. The uncertainties introduced by the optics model are gauged by comparing them to model uncertainties related to the inclusion or omission of aerosol dynamic processes.",

            "abstract": "The land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in studying the global and regional climate change. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing is less influenced by the atmosphere and has a unique advantage in cloudy regions compared to satellite thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. However, the accuracy of LST estimation of many PMW remote sensing models, especially in barren land, is unsatisfactory due to the neglected discrepancy of thermal sampling depth between PMW and TIR. Here, a physical method for PMW remote sensing is proposed to generate the surface temperature, which has the same physically meaning as the TIR surface temperature, by addressing the thermal sampling depth over barren land surface. The method was applied to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data. Validation with the synchronous Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSTs demonstrates that the method has better performances in estimating LSTs than another two methods that neglect the thermal sampling depth. In Northwest China and a part of Mongolia, the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) the physical method were 3.9 K and 3.7K for daytime and nighttime cases, respectively. In the region of western Namibia, the corresponding RMSEs were 3.8 K and 4.5 K. Further comparison with the in-situ measured LST temperatures at a ground station confirmed the better performance of the proposed method, compared with another two methods. The proposed method will be beneficial for improving the accuracies of the LSTs estimated from PMW observations and integrating the LST products generated from both the TIR and PMW remote sensing.",

            "abstract": "North Khetri Copper Belt (NKCB), located in the northern part of Western Indian shield, is one of most important copper repositories in India. Mineralization is hosted by quartzite containing abundant amphibole in the form of alternation of amphibole ± albite and quartz ± albite bands. In a succession near Chandmari mine of NKCB, this thick banded unit is laterally extended over few hundreds of meters. Band thickness varies from few millimetres to tens of centimetres. Such banding (commonly appearing as gneissic banding) of amphibole ± albite is unlikely to be generated in a quartzo-feldspathic rock metamorphosed at lower amphibolite facies. Amphibole, under microscope, shows pleochroism in shades of green. Their grains are inclusion free and do not show any orientation. From major oxide analysis, their average composition is found to be Ca2Mg2.5Fe2+1.5Fe3+0.5Al1.5Si7O22(OH)2. Forming Fe-Mg rich amphibole in a quartzo-feldspathic unit is again challenging its metamorphic origin. Also, amphibole of same composition found in the form of veins within the host rock. All these observations inferring that the amphibole is probably of hydrothermal origin.\nAlbite in host rock can supply Si, Al and O. If a fluid containing Fe, Mg and Ca intrudes into the host rock, the amphibole of desirable composition may form. However, such alternating banding of amphibole ± albite and quartz ± albite is enigmatic. It is possible that the banded nature is inherited from an existing banded rock with different mineralogy and mineral solubility, e.g. alternation of impure/siliceous carbonate and siliciclastic rocks. Presence of carbonate, mainly dolomite, has been reported early and also observed in field. When a hydrothermal fluid, containing some Fe, had invaded this unit, it reacted with carbonate units and replaced the carbonate by amphibole. This will result in amphibole of expected composition and will also mimic the inherited banded nature in original succession. Reaction will form new carbonate minerals which are also common in this area in the form of ankerite/dolomite veins. The probable reaction will be\n[(1.5+x)Fe2+ + 0.5Fe3+ + 2OH-]fluid + [(3.5-x)Mg2+ +3Ca2++ 2CO32-]cb + [7Si4+ + 2Al3+ + 22O2-]qz-ab unit = [Ca2Mg2.5Fe2+1.5Fe3+0.5Al1.5Si7O22(OH)2]amp + [Ca(Mg1-x, Fe2+x)(CO3)2]ank/dol veins ",

            "abstract": "The three-dimensional physical dynamic kinetic model of the plasmasphere is a physics-based model partially constrained by empirical observations and available for running on the space weather portal. The position of the plasmapause is determined by the interchange instability mechanism. The level of geomagnetic activity driven by the Kp index determines the convection electric field which dominates at large radial distances. During storm and substorm events, the convection rate increases, especially in the postmidnight MLT sector. This leads to an inward motion of the plasmapause in this MLT sector during the storms and a depletion of the outer flux tubes. The combination with the corotation electric field leads later to the formation of a plume in the afternoon sector which then rotates with the Earth. After geomagnetic storms, progressive refilling process takes several days to increase the density in the depleted flux tubes located in regions between the vestigial plasmapause and the new plasmapause situated at larger radial distance. The model is coupled with an empirical model of the ionosphere which determines the boundary conditions at low altitudes. Like in other kinetic models of planetary and stellar atmospheres, the density, flux, velocity and temperatures of the particles are obtained by solving the kinetic evolution equation to determine the velocity distribution function of the particles. Additional new results are related to the consideration of the plasmaspheric wind appearing during low activity periods. Comparisons with IMAGE and CLUSTER observations show good agreement with the results of the model, including during periods when a plume is visible during several successive days.",

            "abstract": "Several alpine caves in Austria preserve evidences related to active faulting, such as broken and scratched speleothems. Here, in order to better understand fault slip behavior and related potential earthquake hazards, microstructures of experimentally deformed speleothems are presented and compared with naturally deformed ones.\nSpeleothems are monomineralitic rocks precipitated in caves, composed of columnar centimeter-scale calcite crystals with strong growth orientation. In order to better study the origin and evolution of deformation in faulted speleothems we performed sliding experiments using a rock deformation biaxial apparatus. In order to recreate the faulting conditions observed in Austrian caves, speleothems were cut into rectangular blocks and sheared against each other, with long growth axes of calcite perpendicular to the shearing direction. The experiments were performed under room conditions, sliding velocity in the range of 0.001-0.01 mm/s, and constant effective normal stress of 3 MPa.\nThe mechanical data show fairly high friction coefficient (0.7-0.95) accompanied by the production of calcite-rich fault gouge which displays Riedel shears within a foliated cataclasite and drastic grain size reduction (nano-scale). The transition from the fault gouge towards the undeformed crystals is characterized first by a series of in situ jigsaw puzzle fracturing, then dense mechanical twin network, which is decreasing in its intensity away from the gouge (i.e. principal slip surface).\nThe similarity between laboratory induced and naturally formed microstructures reinforce the tectonic interpretation of the damaged speleothems. Detailed microstructure investigations, including electron backscattered diffraction technique combined with electron microprobe and cathodoluminescence, are on the way to help distinguishing between seismic slip and/or aseismic creep.",

In North Korea (NK) forest fire occurred frequently in the entire region with the exception of the western plains and massive forest fires broke out throughout NK in May 2004. Furthermore, few researches focused on NK forest fire because of data unavailability and inaccessibility to the region. Operational fire monitoring over large areas can be approached through satellite remote sensing (RS). Thus, it is necessary to investigate the area damaged by forest fire and get information of damaged area for restoration of forest in NK after reunification. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the location of forest fire and to estimate the damaged area by forest fire and finally to detect the landscape change after forest fire in Gangwon and South Hamgyong Province, NK using satellite RS data.\nIn this study, we will investigate the area damaged by forest fire and investigate the spatial characteristics of forest fire in Gangwon and South Hamgyong Province using RS. Landsat data from USGS Were preprocessed (band composition), NBR and dNBR are calculated for figuring out the burned area and investigating the burn severity (BS) in burned area. NBR and dNBR (differenced NBR) are mostly useful to estimate BS by forest fires damage from RS data. The dNBR was then calculated by subtracting the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR:\nThe burned area from Landsat data processing were stored in GIS database to be retrieved and analyzed to figure out the chronological change pattern of forest fire damaged area. Finally, the spatiotemporal characteristics of forest fire in NK were analyzed and discussed to provide the information for restoring forest fire damaged area after reunification.",

            "abstract": "For the first time, a multidisciplinary approach for evaluating the influence of bottom currents in the Uruguayan continental margin is presented. Bathymetric data and multichannel 2D and 3D seismic reflection profiles were used to construct a morphosedimentary map to interpret and decode sedimentary and oceanographic processes along the Uruguayan continental margin. Based on these results a significant contourite depositional system on the margin is described, which contains a spectacular array of large erosive, depositional (drifts) and mixed (terrace) features, which have been generated primarily by water masses of Antarctic and subantarctic origin. From the Eocene-Oligocene boundary up to present time, the long-term influence of water masses from higher southern latitudes, in combination with down-slope sedimentary processes have strongly controlled the overall margin morphology. Most of the features described here, were formed during the middle/late Miocene epoch due to paleoceanographic shifts that include the arrival of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) along the margin, which in combination with deeper Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) are fundamental in the margin evolution. In combination with Quaternary climatic and eustatic changes in sea level, fluctuations of the Brazil–Malvinas Confluence influenced subsequently glacial and interglacial stages that appear in sedimentary features defined here. These paleoceanographic changes controlled the sedimentary stacking pattern and the locations of high amplitude reflections (HAR) along the contourite terraces, which could be associated to sandier deposits. Fundamental understanding of the above described margin morphologies and the development of associated bedforms in deep marine environments are essential to fully leverage their conceptual implications for hydrocarbon exploration efforts. Futhermore, a more detailed understanding of the margin and its ancient to modern day current dynamics will improve interpretations of variations in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre and further constrain general climatic and more regional / global ocean circulation models.",

Specifically, we are interested in lake evaporation changes in a warming climate, deforestation effects on surface climate, and enhanced temperatures in urban land. Common to these processes is that they occur at local scales that are too small to be resolved by climate models. In NCAR’s earth system model, each grid consists of up to five land units (vegetated, lake, urban, glacier, crop). These land units share the same atmospheric forcing at the first grid height but have their own land surface parameterizations and surface energy balance calculations. So far, attention has focused on grid-mean quantities but subgrid outputs have not been fully utilized. In this paper, we will discuss strategies for evaluating validity of the subgrid surface variables and develop analytical frameworks for interpreting the results in relation to land use changes and radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Since the equatorial regions of Titan have been fully observed by the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) [1], the analysis of false-color composite allows distinguishing three mains units: bright, bluish and brownish units [2-4]. This distinction can be enhanced by using ratios of VIMS channels that allow emphasizing subtle difference of spectral behavior of the units, especially at short wavelengths (below 2 µm). The VIMS – bluish unit is mostly enriched in water-ice particles, which consist of particles exposition derived from the high standing water-ice substrate and deposited on the lowlands after fluvial/pluvial processes [5] and impact [6]. This spectral unit is mainly located at the frontier of the large bright plateaus, and hence considered as a transition zone to the VIMS – brownish unit corresponding to the Radar dune-fields [7]. Whereas these brownish dunes consist on atmospheric aerosols, named tholins [4] contaminated with particles of water ice. High resolution observations of VIMS (less than 1 km per pixel), show local transition zones between the bright material and the brownish dunes, suggesting weathering and erosional processes (e.g. Bohai Sinus and the Huygens Landing site). The reason of these spectral variations in this bluish unit might be due to physical properties variations related to erosional processes occurring on the bright plateaus [5,8], such as particles sizes and the degree of mixture with tholins. Our approach enables a better understanding of the distribution of the water-ice grains in terms of particles-size and mixtures with tholins at local and global scale.\n",

            "abstract": "An uplift of the ocean bottom caused by a submarine earthquake can generate Acoustic-Gravity Waves (AGW), progressive compression-type waves that travel at near the speed of sound in water. Recent studies indicate that as AGW travel they leave measurable bottom pressure signatures, which can act as tsunami precursors. In this regard, it is anticipated that such utilization of AGW would enhance current early tsunami detection systems. To this end, there is an increasing need to characterize the spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure field induced by AGW in more realistic scenarios.\nWe analyze and simulate the fundamental AGW modes generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. We consider the first five AGW modes and show that they may all induce comparable temporal variations in pressure at different water depths in regions far from the epicenter. An example for the dynamic pressure induced by AGW is given in Figure 1.\nWe show that the pressure field depends on the presence of the leading AGW modes. Each AGW mode becomes evanescent at a critical time, at which energy is transferred to the next higher modes. Consequently, the frequency associated with the most energetic mode changes as the leading mode varnishes. Correspondingly, the main pattern of the pressure field changes as the leading mode change. As an example, for a reference point located at 1000 Km from the epicenter, and 4km deep, the first five AGW become evanescent after 1.6, 4.6, 7.7, 10.8 and 13.8 hours, respectively.\nOur analysis and simulations shed light on the spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure field induced by AGW that radiate during submarine earthquakes. Practically, this can assist in the implementation of an AGW early tsunami detection system, starting from applying the appropriate earthquake models, to identifying the relevant measurement equipment and their optimal locations.",

            "abstract": "The large cratons of today are made of younger terranes that wrap around older cores. Deformation due to accretion did not proceed in homogeneous fashion and was concentrated in the younger belts. This is illustrated clearly in the Archean Superior Province, Canada. In this area, one observes little imbrication of accreted crust and craton core, in contrast to the laterally extensive thrusting that has affected the younger terranes to the South. The boundary between the craton core and accreted belts is a nearly vertical interface delineated by steeply dipping electrical and seismic anomalies extending to the base of the lithosphere. These steeply dipping structures have been interpreted as relicts of the subduction that drove accretion. By contrast, the sub-crustal subduction remnant that is imaged beneath younger terranes to the south shows up as a moderately dipping (\n≈\n30\no\n) structure. These observations suggest a stiff craton surrounded by weaker belts. This strength contrast may have affected later events, such as the Keweenawan rifing, which propagated northward through the accreted terranes but stopped short of impinging the craton core. In the Superior Province, crustal heat production is much higher in the accreted terranes than in the craton core, implying higher temperatures and lower mechanical strength. Such a remarkable dichotomy also exists in South Africa, where the Limpopo and Namaqua belts are characterized by higher heat flux and crustal heat production than the adjacent Archean Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe cratons. The generality of this cannot be assessed on the basis of heat flow and heat production data which are scarce in most other cratons. These cratons, however, are characterized by post-orogenic high temperature metamorphism which is best explained by high crustal heat production. This is true, for example, for the Jimperding metamorphic belt at the edge of the Yilgarn craton, Western Australia. Thus, cratons appear to be surrounded, and protected, by belts with more radiogenic crust, which are weaker and focus deformation.

            "abstract": "Abstract: Response of soil seasonal freeze depth to climate change may result in changes in surface energy and water balance, ecosystem, carbon cycle, and soil nutrient changes. In this study, we used data from about 800 meteorological stations to investigate the response of soil freeze depth to climate change across China. Data used for this study include daily air temperature, daily soil temperatures at various depths, mean monthly gridded air temperature, daily snow depth, and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI). The primary results show that soil freeze depth decreased with a rate of about -1.75cm/decade and a net change of 8.05 cm over the period from 1967 to 2012 across China. In region-scale, decreasing rate of soil freeze depth varied between 0.0 and -0.4 cm/year in most parts of China from 1950 to 2009. Combined the climate and non-climate factors with soil freeze depth, we conclude that warming climate is responsible for decrease in soil seasonal freeze depth during this period across China. Changes in vegetation condition were negatively correlated with soil freeze depth. These results are important to understand the soil freeze/thaw dynamics and impacts of soil freeze depth to ecosystem and hydrological process.\nKey words: freeze depth; climate change; climate factor; non-climate factor",

            "abstract": "Continental rifting and breakup frequently occurs through multiple phases of extension in which margin architecture is governed by distinct modes of brittle and viscous deformation, as well as surface processes. Transitions between such phases of extension may in some cases reflect plate-scale changes in extension obliquity and velocity. For example, recent studies indicate that localization of transtensional deformation onto a narrow shear zone in the Gulf of California Rift corresponds temporally with an increase in rift obliquity. Here, we use high-resolution 3-D models (run with pTatin3D) to examine how transtensional deformation patterns evolve with such increases in extension obliquity.\nOur models build on previous crustal-scale analogue and numerical studies examining oblique reactivation of normal faults. These studies show that the orientation and strength of inherited normal faults strongly control the style of slip and deformation partitioning between new and reactivated faults. While highly insightful, these studies examine deformation over limited spatial extents and do not account for key processes such as isostasy and temperature-dependent rock strength.\nHere, we model the thermal-mechanical evolution of the lithosphere and asthenosphere to a depth of 200 km. Deformation occurs through an initial phase of orthogonal, Basin and Range style extension, followed by 1-2 phases of extension at different obliquities. The initial lithospheric structure and time-dependent boundary conditions follow geologic observations and plate-reconstructions within the Gulf of California. Our experiments highlight the strong control of inheritance on transtensional crustal deformation. By comparing fault development, crustal thickness evolution and block rotations directly with observations from the Gulf of California and other extensional and transtensional regions, we can better evaluate the relative control of structural inheritance on passive margin architecture.",

Detailed analysis on the kinetics of the preceding jet reveals its blowout-jet nature, which resembles the study by Liu et al. 2014. However the erupting process and kinetics of the twin jets appear to be different from the preceding one. To address the triggering mechanism of the twins, we continue the 3D MHD numerical simulation work in Fang et al. 2014 after the eruption of a blowout jet. Numerical simulation shows that the resulting sigmoidal magnetic fields after the blowout jet keep reconnecting with the ambient fields, producing the observed twin jets. Combining our observation and simulation, we suggest that with the continuous energy transport from the subsurface convection zone into the corona, solar coronal twin jets could be generated by reconnection between a sigmoidal magnetic structure and the open ambient fields.",

The economic losses during the construction procedures in the permafrost area are linked also with the other geological processes that have the specific character in cold regions. These processes are swamping, desertification, deflation, flooding, mudflows and landslides.\nLinear transport structures are most vulnerable component of regional and national economy. Because the high length the transport structures have to cross the landscapes with different permafrost conditions that have the different reaction to climate change. The climate warming is favorable for thermokarst and the frost heaving is linked with climate cooling. In result the structure falls in the circumstances that are not predicted in the construction project. Local engineering problems of structure exploitation lead to global risks of sustainable development of regions.\nAuthors developed the database of geocryological damage cases for the last twelve years at the Russian territory. Spatial data have the attributive table that was filled by the published information from various permafrost conference proceedings. The preliminary GIS-analysis of gathered data showed the widespread territorial distribution of the cases of negative consequences of geocryological processes activity.\nThe information about maximum effect from geocryological processes was validated by detailed field investigation along the railways in Yamal and Transbaicalia Regions. Authors expect the expanding of database by similar data from other sectors of Arctic. It is important for analyzing the regional, time and industrial tendencies of geocryological risk evolution. Obtained information could be used in insurance procedures and in information systems of decisions support in different management levels.\nThe investigation was completed with financial support by Russian Foundation of Basic Research (Project #13-05-00462).",

This activity was realized as a joint initiative of the IAG (International Association of Geodesy) Sub-Commissions 2.3 and 2.6, the GGOS (Global Geodetic Observing System) Working Group on Satellite Missions, and the IUGG (International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics). After about one year of preparation, in a user workshop that was held in September 2014 consensus among the user communities of hydrology, ocean, cryosphere, solid Earth and atmosphere on consolidated science requirements could be achieved.\nThe consolidation of the user requirements became necessary, because several future gravity field studies have resulted in quite different performance numbers as a target for a future gravity mission (2025+). Based on limited number of mission scenarios which took also technical feasibility into account, a consolidated view on the science requirements among the international user communities was derived, research fields that could not be tackled by current gravity missions have been identified, and the added value (qualitatively and quantitatively) of these scenarios with respect to science return has been evaluated. The resulting document shall form the basis for further programmatic and technological developments.\nIn this contribution, the main results of this initiative will be presented. An overview of the specific requirements of the individual user groups, the consensus on consolidated science and user needs as well as the new research fields that have been identified during this process will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "If an eruption sequence is protracted and episodic, continuing for many months, or even a number of years, it can be very difficult for authorities to decide when an evacuated population might be allowed to return. A precautionary approach may be appropriate as a general principle, especially if the societal implications are deemed to be manageable. However, where the livelihoods of the evacuees are critically at stake, such as with farmers, and the economic costs of continuing evacuation are high, a risk-informed approach to supporting decision-making might be warranted. Such an approach has been developed, based on concepts drawn from cost-benefit analysis.\nOn any given day during an extended volcanic crisis, a decision-maker may wish to consider whether to allow then for the return of evacuees. A delay of a decision by one day will increase the evacuation cost by one day’s worth of accommodation and economic disruption. On the other hand, there is a small chance that there might be an onset to another eruption on this given day, so there would be a safety benefit in the delay.\nThe task of quantifying this safety benefit requires a coherent synthesis of all the volcano monitoring data time series, together with an assessment of the medium and long-term historical and geological data, so that the probability of each of the alternative eruptive scenarios can be scientifically estimated. Bayesian belief networks provide a convenient framework for this synthesis. For each scenario, the potential casualty implications for returned evacuees need to be assessed.\nThe application of this end of eruption methodology is illustrated and compared with the equivalent decision-making procedure at the start of an eruption.",

            "abstract": "Large part of global population has been dependent on groundwater as a source of fresh water. The demand would further increase with increasing population and stress associated with climate change. We tried to provide regional-scale groundwater recharge estimates in a large part of Indian Sub-Continent. A combination of ground-based, satellite-based and numerical model simulated recharge estimates were presented in the densely populated region. Three different methods: an intense network of observational wells (n>13,000 wells), a satellite (TRMM) and global land-surface model (CLM) outputs, and a global-scale hydrological model (PCR GLOBWB) were employed to calculate recharge estimates. Groundwater recharge values exhibit large spatial variations over the entire region on the basis of aquifer hydrogeology, precipitation and groundwater withdrawal patterns. Groundwater recharge estimates from all three estimation techniques were found to be higher (>300 mm/year) in fertile planes of Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra (IGB) river basins. A combination of favorable hydrogeologic conditions (porosity, permeability etc.), comparatively higher rates of precipitation, and return flow from rapidly withdrawn irrigation water might influence occurrence of high recharge rates. However, central and southern study area experiences lower recharge rates (<200 mm/year), might be associated with unfavorable hydrogeologic conditions associated with cratonic provinces. Statistical analysis of inter-comparison between the three different recharge estimates show good matches in some of the areas. Recharge estimates indicate dynamic nature of groundwater recharge as a function of precipitation, land use pattern, and hydrogeologic parameters. On a first hand basis, the estimates will help policy makers to understand groundwater recharge process over the densely populated region and finally would facilitate to implement sustainable policy for securing water security.",

However, the storm occurrence and strength are not yet fully explained. The magnetic clouds’ orientation, the presence of events/structures on their leading or trailing edges are presently discussed in the literature. In complement to these effects, we investigate here the interaction of magnetic clouds with the bow shock, the structure and propagation of the modified clouds downstream of it in the magnetosheath and the consequences for their interaction with the magnetosphere. This question is first tackled from observations. Correlated observations upstream (ACE) and downstream (CLUSTER) of the bow shock show that the interaction of magnetic clouds with the bow shock can strongly modify their downstream structure and lead to inexpected interactions with the magnetosphere. We also discuss this question from hybrid simulations of the interaction of magnetic clouds with the bow shock. We show that this interaction may produce in the magnetosheath very asymmetric distributions of magnetic field, density, temperature, velocity and that they depend on the shock configuration (quasi-perpendicular, quasi-parallel). We investigate the effects this asymmetric magnetosheath on key parameters for the interaction with the magnetopause, responsible for the development of geomagnetic activity in the magnetosphere.",

Numerical models of fluid flow and heat transfer provide a quantitative basis for understanding the thermo-hydrological structure and transient behavior of volcano-hydrothermal systems. At the brittle-ductile transition around a magma body, the rate of conductive heat transfer from the impermeable intrusion is balanced by the rate of advective heat transfer by the fluid. Using the Complex Systems Modeling Platform (CSMP++) to model fluid flow up to near-magmatic conditions, we examine the effect of geologic factors such as host rock permeability, magma emplacement depth, the temperature conditions of the brittle-ductile transition, and rock/magma thermal conductivity on the rates of heat and mass transfer around magma bodies. Additionally, we investigate the role of these factors on the thermo-hydrological structure of the hydrothermal system, including patterns of phase separation, gravity-driven phase segregation, and fluid mixing. Passive tracers are included in the fluid flow models to simulate the input of magmatic volatiles into hydrothermal fluids and their fractionation between the liquid and vapor phases. Ultimately, we compare our model results against measured heat and gas fluxes from volcano-hydrothermal systems to help inform the interpreation of these measurements.",

This event has been widely studied using coupled climate models by adding freshwater forcing into the subpolar North Atlantic. However, results from the coarse resolution coupled models differ from that of a high resolution forced standalone ocean model simulation. Here we use a state-of-art fully coupled high-resolution climate model with 1/10 degree horizontal resolution for the ocean and sea ice, and ¼ degree for the atmosphere and land components to study the influence of the freshwater forcing to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In this simulation, 2 Sv freshwater is added into the North Atlantic along a narrow band of west Baffin Bay to North of Labrador Sea for two years, then the freshwater forcing is switched off. Our preliminary results show that AMOC weakens by over 30% within the first 10 years, and recovers afterwards. The added freshwater were partly transported into the subpolar North Atlantic and partly into the subtropical gyre. The latter part was carried by Gulf Stream into the subpolar North Atlantic about 25 years later.",

            "abstract": "Long-term flood risk in urban areas is expected to increase as a result of a number of factors, such as an increase in the severity of flood events due to the impact of climate change and the exposure of a larger number of people to flooding as a result of population growth. In order to facilitate the development of long-term flood mitigation plans, a framework for a decision-support system (DSS) is presented in this paper. The framework consists of an integrated model (see Figure) consisting of dynamic, spatially distributed land-use and flood inundation models. It also enables the impact of various flood mitigation strategies to be assessed, such as spatial planning, land management, structural measures (e.g. levees, changes in building codes), and community education. The framework considers a number of external drivers that are represented in the form of long-term planning scenarios. These include the impact of climate drivers on the extent of flooding via the flood inundation model and the impact of population and economic drivers on the size and distribution of the population via the land use allocation model.\nUsing this framework, a DSS is being developed and applied to the Greater Adelaide region of South Australia. This DSS includes an intuitive, user-friendly interface for enabling different planning scenarios and mitigation portfolios to be selected, as well as temporal changes in flood risk maps under each of these scenarios to be observed. Changes in flood risk maps are investigated over a 30-year period with climate drivers represented by different representative concentration pathways, population drivers represented by different population projections and economic drivers represented by different employment rates. The impact of different combinations of mitigation measures is also investigated. The results indicate that climate, population and economic drivers have a significant impact on the temporal evolution of flood risk for the case study area and that the mitigation options investigated can result in a substantial decrease in flood risk.",

            "abstract": "Magma movement and emplacement within the crust is an important aspect to understanding crustal formation and deformation. The 19-km deep Socorro Magma Body, the second largest mid-crustal continental magma body known worldwide, produces measurable crustal deformation and seismicity within the Rio Grande Rift region in central New Mexico. There have been a variety of studies to estimate the location and size of this feature as well as possible changes related to magma or fluid migration. The extent of the feature has been previously estimated by observation of reflected phases arising from earthquakes located above the feature recorded by a sparse local seismic network. To improve our understanding of the spatial extent of the Socorro Magma Body, we deployed a mixed mode seismic array for 2 weeks over the northern portion of the magma body consisting of 7 3-component broadband seismometers and over 800 Fairfield vertical-component autonomous node seismographs with integral 10 Hz seismometers. This array will allow for us to improve our estimates of spatial extent of the body and possible heterogeneities resulting from fluid or magma migration at shallower depths. Here we focus on initial steps to analyze this large volume of data, in conjunction with other local and regional seismic stations, to determine a local and teleseismic earthquake catalog during the deployment time period. These earthquakes will then be used to probe the structure of the Socorro Magma Body and its surroundings. We employ multiple strategies for building this catalog, including standard amplitude-based detection tools with the broadband data, triggering algorithms with the node data, and back-projection of the node data over limited sections of the array. Initial results suggest a number of previously undetected earthquakes located beneath the array, as well as regional events from an earthquake sequence in Arizona.",

            "abstract": "The Deccan Traps consist of ~1,000,000 km3 of predominantly tholeiitic basaltic lava flows, which cover the western Indian subcontinent. Their eruption occurred over a ~1-3 million year period overlapping with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and, hence, has been implicated in one of the most significant extinction events in the history of the planet. The extent of environmental impacts caused by flood basalt eruptions is thought to be related, in part, to the amount, species, and timescales of volcanic gases released. Therefore, constraining the effusion rate of Deccan Traps lava flows is fundamental to understanding the K-Pg extinction event. Previous field and experimental work with polyethylene glycol (PEG) wax has shown that effusion rate is a primary factor controlling flow morphology. While sinuous flows and lava domes have been successfully recreated with PEG wax, the two most common morphologies seen in the Deccan Traps (compound and inflated sheet lobes) have not. We used heated PEG-400 wax injected into a tank of chilled water with a peristaltic pump to form experimental eruptions with high flow rate and low viscosity to replicate inflated flow lobes, and low flow rate with higher viscosity for compound flows. Unlike previous experiments, flow rate was varied during a single experiment to examine the effect on flow morphology. The Psi value is used as a scaling parameter to estimate effusion rates for compound and ‘simple’ inflated flows in the Deccan Traps. When combined with field work for volume estimates of the two flow types, these experiments will provide the best constraint on eruption rates to date.",

Field studies and numerical simulations were imported to evaluate the water and vapor movement processes under non isothermal and lower water content conditions. The soil profiles (12 layers) in Gobi desert and riparian sites of Ejina were installed with sensors to monitor soil moisture and temperature for 1 year. The meteorological conditions and water table were measured by micro weather stations and mini-Divers respectively in the two sites. Soil properties, including particles composition, moisture, bulk density, water retention curve, and saturated hydraulic conductivity of two site soil profiles, was measured. The observations showed that soil temperatures for the two sites displayed large diurnal and seasonal fluctuations. Temperature gradients with depth resulted in a downward in summer and upward in winter and became driving force for thermal vapor movement. Soil moistures in Gobi desert site were very low and varied slowly with time. While the soil moistures in riparian site were complicated due to root distribution but water potentials remained uniform with time. The hydrus-1D was employed to simulate evapotranspiration processes. The simulation results showed the significant difference of evaporation rate in the Gobi desert and riparian sites.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering of rocks involves consumption of CO2, a greenhouse gas with a strong influence on climate. Among rocks exposed to weathering, basalt plays a major role in the carbon cycle as it is more easily weathered than other crystalline silicate rocks. This means that basalt weathering acts as a major atmospheric CO2 sink. The present study investigated the lead isotopes in rock, soil and sediment for constraining the life cycle of a catchment, covering source rocks, erosion processes and products, and anthropogenic activities. For this, we investigated the Allanche river drainage basin in the Massif Central, the largest volcanic areas in France, that offers opportunities for selected geochemical studies since it drains a single type of virtually unpolluted volcanic rock, with agricultural activity increasing downstream. Soil and sediment are derived exclusively from basalt weathering, and their chemistry, coupled to isotope tracing, should shed light on the behavior of chemical species during weathering from parental bedrock. Bedrock samples of the basin, compared to regional bedrock of the volcanic province, resulted from a complex history and multiple mantle reservoir sources and mixing. Regarding soils and sediments, comparison of Pb and Zr normalized to mobile K shows a linear evolution of weathering processes, whereby lead enrichment from atmospheric deposition is the other major contributor. Lead-isotope ratios showed that most of the lead budget in sediment and soil results from bedrock weathering with an influence of past mining and mineral processing of ores in the Massif Central, and deposition of lead-rich particles from gasoline combustion, but no lead input from agricultural activity. A classic box model was used to investigate the dynamics of sediment transfer at the catchment scale, the lead behavior in the continuum bedrock-soil-sediment and the historical evolution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions.",

            "abstract": "Drought monitoring and planning requires spatially and temporally continuous information and its impacts on production and on society can easily be quantified when long-term (both crop production and climate) information is available. Such historical information is scanty and at best qualitative for Karamoja in Northeastern Uganda, a region considered to be most vulnerable to drought. To demonstrate the capabilities of currently available satellite data in filling this data gap in smallholder agricultural regions; this study first characterized agricultural drought at multiple temporal and spatial scales using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (1999-2011) and monthly rainfall data (1960-2011). Correlation analyses of the NDVI based drought indicators, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and a global product of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Spatial information is derived for the 1999-2000 period using MODIS 250m resolution data. The 12 month SPI (SPI-12) had the highest correlation with the MODIS NDVI record from (1999-2011) derived indices reaffirming the cumulative effect of rainfall on vegetation during the growing season and the utility of NDVI as an indicator of drought. Time-series plots were generated, the droughts were ranked and spatial maps derived for the most severe droughts between 2000- 2011. Temporal drought information is correlated with proxy indicators such as food aid supplies, available historical production data, market prices from within and in neighbouring regions and with to primary data collected through interviews with farmers in Moroto district. This study demonstrates that operationalizing drought monitoring can be realized with remote sensing and further affirms the importance of drought and agriculture monitoring for food security.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of Mercury’s magnetospheric magnetic field is required to characterize the planet’s internal field and the structure of the magnetosphere. We present the first model of Mercury’s magnetospheric magnetic field that includes a dependence on magnetic activity. The model consists of individual modules for magnetic fields of internal origin, approximated by a dipole of magnitude 190 nT RM3, where RM is Mercury’s radius, offset northward by 479 km along the spin axis, and of external origin resulting from currents flowing on the magnetopause boundary and in the cross-tail current sheet. The magnetic field is confined within a magnetopause shape derived from Magnetometer observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft and dependent on magnetic activity. The cross-tail current is prescribed having a disk shape near the planet and extending into a sheet at larger distances. The magnitude of the tail current, which also depends on magnetic activity, is fit to minimize the root-mean-square residual between the model magnetic field and the field within the magnetosphere observed by MESSENGER. The model was fit separately for magnetic field observations within distinct levels of magnetic activity. Linear fits of model parameters versus magnetic activity allows continuous scaling of the model to magnetic activity. The magnetic field contribution from each module is shielded individually by a scalar potential function, which was fit to minimize the root-mean-square normal magnetic field component at the magnetopause. The resulting model reproduces the dependence of the magnetospheric size and tail current intensity on magnetic activity, and allows more accurate characterization of the internal field.",

            "abstract": "Karst aquifers are characterized as a dual-flow system comprised of a highly conductive conduit network embedded in a low porosity matrix. The conduits are hydraulically connected to the matrix and behave either as a drain or a source depending on the recharge conditions. Simulation of flow in such systems using distributed karst models faces several challenges primarily due to the high data requirements to achieve robust prediction. A simplified process-based model is herein employed to simulate the spring outflow from a karstic aquifer using a one-dimensional conduit system embedded in a two-dimensional matrix domain. The flow system is driven by the diffuse aquifer recharge that interacts with the conduit along its length as well as by a concentrated recharge at the conduit entrance. The flow is described by a coupled system of partial differential equations: the kinematic wave equation for the open-channel flow in the conduit and the Boussinesq equation for the groundwater flow in the matrix. The analytical model simulates the typical shape of a spring hydrograph using physical parameters rather than empirical ones, and requires less data than two- and three-dimensional dual-hydraulic models. An application of the model to a real karst aquifer system demonstrates its effectiveness in simulating the observed spring hydrograph using physically meaningful parameters.",

All the products are cross-evaluated at gridded, regional, and national scales. Results show that: (1) the Day-1 IMERG shows appreciably better performance than 3B42V7 at both sub-daily and daily timescales among the gridded, regional, and national scales. However, the gaps between the two products are narrow in terms of all metrics; (2) Out of the six sub-regions, IMERG especially performs better than 3B42V7 at the mid- and low-latitudes, as well as relatively mild and wet climate regions; (3) IMERG can better reproduce structures of probability density functions (PDFs) as function of precipitation intensities, particularly during no rain or drizzle events; and (4) although IMERG better captures the rainfall diurnal variability, both IMERG and 3B42V7 have room to further improve the capability of reproducing the diurnal cycle, particularly over the dry climate and high-latitude regions. This study is among the early satellite precipitation estimation studies focusing on evaluation and comparison of IEMRG and 3B42V7 products, which could be valuable in providing reference for the improvement of IMERG algorithms and associated products.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the amount of magma available to supply any given eruption is useful for determining the potential eruption magnitude and duration. Geodetic measurements and inversion techniques are often used to constrain volume changes within magma chambers, as well as constrain location and depth, but such models are incapable of calculating total magma storage. For example, during the 2012 unrest period at Santorini volcano, approximately 0.021 km3 of new magma entered a shallow chamber residing at around 4 km below the surface. This type of event is not unusual, and is in fact a necessary condition for the formation of a long-lived shallow chamber, of which Santorini must possess. The period of unrest ended without culminating in eruption, i.e the amount of magma which entered the chamber was insufficient to break the chamber and force magma further towards the surface. We combine previously published data on the volume of recent eruptions at Santorini together with geodetic measurements. Measurements of dykes within the caldera wall provide an estimate of the volume of magma transported during eruptions, assuming the dyke does not become arrested. When the combined volume of a dyke and eruption are known (Ve) they can be used to estimate using fracture mechanics principles and poro-elastic constraints the size of an underlying shallow magma chamber. We present field measurements of dykes within Santorini caldera and provide an analytical method to estimate the volume of magma contained underneath Santorini caldera. In addition we postulate the potential volume of magma required as input from deeper sources to switch the shallow magma chamber from an equilibrium setting to one where the pressure inside the chamber exceeds the surrounding host rocks tensile strength, a condition necessary to form a dyke and a possible eruption.",

However Post-Normal Science is better described as Pre-Normal Science, the stage at which something has been observed, but no one quite knows where it came from, what it means (science) or what to do about it (policy). The initial flailing about to reach a useful understanding is later used by those who oppose action to obfuscate by insisting that still nothing is known, what is known is wrong, or at best that more research is needed. Consider AIDS/HIV, stratospheric ozone, tobacco, acid rain, climate change, etc. As these issues gained attention, we entered the Pre-Normal Science stage. What was the cause? How could they be dealt with? Every idea could be proposed and was. Normal science sorted through them. Many proposers of the discarded theories still clutched them strongly, but mostly they are dismissed within the scientific community. Post-Normal Policy ensues when normal science has reached a consensus and it is clear that action is needed but it is economically or philosophically impossible for some to accept that. The response is to deny the utility of science and scientific judgment, thus the attacks on scientists and scientific panels that provide policy makers with their best scientific advice. Recognizing the division between Pre-Normal Science and Post-Normal Policy and the uses of the former to block action by the later is useful for understanding the course of controversies that require normal science to influence policy.",

            "abstract": "Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in a river bed geometry produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, hence in its slope. Conversely, observation of these changes is a goal of the SWOT mission with the determination of the discharge as a final objective. In this study, we analyse the relationship between river bed undulations and water surface for an ungauged reach of the Xingu river, a first order tributary of the Amazon river. It is crosscut more than 10 times by a single ENVISAT track over a hundred of km. We have determined time series of water levelsat each of these crossings, called virtual stations (VS), hence slopes of the flow line. Using the discharge series computed by Paiva et al. (2013)\nbetween 1998 and 2009, Paris et al. (submitted) determined at each VS a rating curve relating these simulated discharge with the ENVISAT height series. One parameter of these rating curves is the zero-flow depth Z 0 . We show that it is possible to explain the spatial and temporal variations of the water surface slope in terms of hydrodynamical response of the longitudinal changes of the river bed geometry given by the successive values of Z 0 . Our experiment is based on an effective, single thread representation of a braided river, realistic values for the Manning coefficient and river widths picked up on JERS images. This study confirms that simulated flow lines are consistent with water surface elevations (WSE) and slopes gained by satellite altimetry. Hydrodynamical signatures are more visible where the river bed geometry varies significantly, and for reaches with a strong downstream control. Therefore, this study suggests that the longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the question of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the SWOT mission which will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevation, the slope and the reach width.",

            "abstract": "Landscape evolution is fundamentally coupled with processes of river channel networks, thus understanding the changes in river systems would provide important constraints on geomorphic and tectonic developments. In the western part of the Taiwan orogen, we observed a major flow direction transition of the main trunks at the southern drainage divide of the Chuoshui River. South of this transition, river systems are sub-parallel and flow to the south, but to the north all main trunks flow to the west. This is consistent with the southwestward propagation of the collision in Taiwan, and implies that the landscapes in the northern part are more “matured” than in the southern part. Therefore, the river systems in Taiwan appear to have the tendency to develop from south-flowing to west-flowing from south to north. Based on such hypothesis, we hope to reconstruct the evolution patterns of river basins and their mechanisms of western Taiwan in this study.\nWe used a new method, the fluvial geomorphic index χ, to analyze the river networks in western Taiwan. By comparing the χ values of river tributaries on both sides of the drainage divide, we can obtain the information of the divide stability. In the southern part of western Taiwan, most of the main water divides are unstable. The results from the Zengwun River basin show that some parts of the drainage area had been captured by another river, thus the rivers change the flow direction from southward to westward probably due to river captures. From south to north in western Taiwan, the χ values of river basins gradually reach an equilibrium. This suggests changing the flow direction would make the channels more stable. Moreover, this development is likely produced by the general tectonic evolution processes of the fold and thrust belt in western Taiwan. We hope this study would provide more information for reconstructing river basins in the past and understanding their developments in the future.",

            "abstract": "The Earthscope TA deployment across the continental United-State (US) has reached its eastern part, providing the opportunity for high-resolution 3D seismic velocity imaging of both lithosphere and asthenosphere across the entire north-American continent (NA). Previously (Yuan et al., 2014), we presented a 3D radially anisotropic shear wave (Vs) model of North America (NA) lithospheric mantle based on full waveform tomography, combining teleseismic and regional distance data sampling the NA. Regional wavefield computations were performed numerically, using a regional Spectral Element code (RegSEM, Cupillard et al., 2012), while teleseismic computations were performed approximately, using non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT, Li and Romanowicz, 1995). For both datasets, the inversion was performed iteratively, using a Gauss-Newton scheme, with kernels computed using either NACT or the surface wave, path average approximation (PAVA), depending on the source-station distance.\nWe here present a new radially anisotropic lithospheric/asthenospheric model of Vs for NA based entirely on SEM-based numerical waveforms from an augmented dataset of 155 regional events and 70 teleseismic events. The forward wavefield computations are performed using RegSEM down to 40s, starting from our most recent whole mantle 3D radially anisotropic Vs model (SEMUCB-wm1, French and Romanowicz, 2014). To model teleseismic wavefields within our regional computational domain, we developed a new modeling technique which allows us to replace a distant source by virtual sources at the boundary of the computational domain (Masson et al., 2014). Computing virtual sources requires one global simulation per teleseismic events.\nWe then compare two models obtained: one using NACT/PAVA kernels as in our previous work, and another using hybrid kernels, where the Hessian is computed using NACT/PAVA, but the gradient is computed numerically from the adjoint wavefield, providing more accurate kernels while preserving the fast convergence properties of the Gauss-Newton inversion scheme. We also present an update to our azimuthally anisotropic Vs model under NA (Yuan and Romanowicz, 2010), obtained starting from the final radial anisotropy model and including a large dataset of station-averaged SKS splitting data over NA.",

Based on the elastic dislocation theory and global finite element method, an equivalent volume force of layered co-seismic crustal computation model is set up. And based on the USGS and CEA fault slip models, we calculate the co-seismic displacement, stress field and ΔCFS caused by Nepal Ms8.1 earthquake. The calculation result shows that: (1) Nepal Ms8.1 earthquake is a typical low-angle thrust earthquake and co-seismic displacement caused by the earthquake is mainly concentrated in the horizontal plane and centered in the surrounding area of Katmandu, the capital of Nepal. The maximum co-seismic horizontal slippage under USGS slip model and CEA slip model is about 4m and 2m respectively; compared with the east-west and vertical displacement caused by the earthquake, the horizontal displacement in south-north direction is larger, which is reflected as the handing wall diving southward; the computed result based on CEA model and USGS models show that the maximum displacement of southward hanging wall is 1.2m and 3.47m respectively; (2) Nepal is located in the collision and compression fault zone of Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate, with well-developed tectonic fault. The seismogenic fault of Ms8.1 earthquake may belongs to the MHT fault zone. The ΔCFS induced by the earthquake is positive in the seismic source area and the maximum of ΔCFS can reach 0.1MPa, showing there still more dangerous; (3) Nepal Ms8.1 earthquake has a certain impact on the Tibet region of China. According to the seismogenic fault of Ms8.1 earthquake, the stress change of 1kPa in Yaruzampbo region and Lhasa block can be calculated, which may even reach 10kPa; Shigatse and Lhasa are located in the area in where the ΔCFS increases. Close attention shall be paid to the possibility of induced earthquake in Lhasa and Shigatse.",

            "abstract": "first co-author Jonathan O. Thurgood (QMUL)\nThe simulation of three-wave interaction based plasma emission, an underlying mechanism for type III solar radio bursts, is a challenging task requiring fully-kinetic, multi-dimensional models. This paper aims to resolve a contradiction in past attempts, whereby some authors report that no such processes occur and others draw conflicting conclusions, by using 2D, fully kinetic, particle-in-cell simulations of relaxing electron beams. Here we present the results of particle-in-cell simulations which for different physical parameters permit or prohibit the plasma emission. We show that the possibility of plasma emission is contingent upon the frequency of the initial electrostatic waves generated by the bump-in-tail instability, and that these waves may be prohibited from participating in the necessary three-wave interactions due to the frequency beat requirements. We caution against simulating astrophysical radio bursts using unrealistically dense beams (a common approach which reduces run time), as the resulting non-Langmuir characteristics of the initial wave modes significantly suppresses the emission. Comparison of our results indicates that, contrary to the suggestions of previous authors, a plasma emission mechanism based on two counter-propagating beams is unnecessary in astrophysical context. Finally, we also consider the action of the Weibel instability, which generates an electromagnetic beam mode. As this provides a stronger contribution to electromagnetic energy than the emission, we stress that evidence of plasma emission in simulations must disentangle the two contributions and not simply interpret changes in total electromagnetic energy as the evidence of plasma emission.\nIn summary, we present the first self-consistent demonstration of fundamental and harmonic plasma emission from a single-beam system via fully kinetic numerical simulation.\nPre-print can be found at http://astro.qmul.ac.uk/~tsiklauri/jtdt1.pdf",

            "abstract": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) has operated and maintained the full 39-station array of open ocean tsunameters since 2008 using the second generation Deep-ocean Reporting and Assessment of Tsunamis technology. The array provides real-time, ocean bottom measurements to Tsunami Warning Centers (TWC) located in Hawai’i and Alaska. These measurements aid them in detecting the presence or absence of tsunamis in the open ocean and in determining the essential characteristics of a tsunami to support the TWC. Thirty-two of the stations span the Pacific Ocean, while seven are located in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The sensors are located on the ocean floor to depths of 6000 m and the system must deliver measurements from that depth to the TWCs in 3 minutes or less. These vast horizontal and vertical distances and the often extreme conditions of the open ocean raise considerable challenges in maintaining necessary and sufficient measurements to support the TWCs. To support this effort, NDBC aims to maintain and generally achieves a goal of 80% real-time data availability. Data availability is the percentage of measurements received versus the number of expected measurements.\nUsing seven years of data we examine operational performance parameters such as real-time and retrospective data availability and tsunami detection for trends, patterns, and the factors affecting performance and reliability of the array. We will also discuss the initial results of the Field Evaluation of the 4th Generation technology.",

            "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) within geological reservoirs is recognised as an important solution to combat the observed changes in the Earth’s climate attributed to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Such storage must be long-term and secure thus the ability to model the fate of CO2 and CO2-charged brines as they migrate within through geological carbon storage reservoirs is critical to obtaining regulatory approval. However, the complexities of flow in natural heterogeneous reservoirs make it essential to test model results against observations of real systems; this can be difficult due to their inaccessibility and the expense of gathering adequate data. At Green River, CO2 and CO2-charged brines leak into overlying aquifers during migration to the surface through the Little Grand Fault. As the CO2-charged brine leaks it forms a series of gravity currents and mixes with the formation fluids. Downhole fluid samples from the upper aquifer of the Navajo Sandstone suggest that regional aquifer flow and sedimentological heterogeneities have a large impact on the evolution and mixing of the CO2-charged plume1. Theoretical studies show that by imposing a regional background flow we alter the dynamics and evolution of a dense plume. To test the theory, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted; a constant flux of a denser brine solution was released from a point source at the base of a porous medium filled with flowing fresh water. We present here the theory and laboratory experiments and compare these findings to the vertical variation of conservative tracers, i.e. Na and Cl, within the formation fluids of the Navajo Sandstone.\n1) Kampman, N., Maskell, A. and others, 2014.

            "abstract": "The consensus around the need for a shift in river management approaches to include more natural processes is steadily growing amongst scientists, practitioners and governmental agencies. Not only is this a sound way to increase resilience of fluvial systems and adapt to climate change, but it will likely result in improved water quality and better aquatic habitat. This paper presents the freedom space for rivers approach which we have developed recently in Quebec (Canada) to combine natural processes related to mobility, flooding and riparian wetland connectivity into a single index. The approach was applied to 3 contrasted rivers (de la Roche, Yamaska Sud-Est and Matane) to produce two main levels of freedom space, operating at two time scales: “short” (in geomorphic terms, i.e. < 50 years) and long (floodplain renewal, ranging from several decades to centuries). For each river, a cost-benefit analysis revealed economic benefits over a 50-year period when taking into account ecosystem services. There is now a growing interest within ministries and watershed agencies to implement such a management approach, but also strong inertia and resistance to change, particularly in agricultural watersheds. Our observations reveal that for such a shift in paradigm to operate, hydrogeomorphogical concepts must be better understood by those in charge of managing rivers, which is currently not the case in Quebec. The role of integrating scientific knowledge in the implementation of a freedom space for rivers management scheme will be discussed based on case studies in 3 watersheds: rivière du Nord, Coaticook and Mitis/Neigette. The original approach was applied only to the main branches, however the second phase of the project is also aiming to determine whether the impact of leaving more space for natural rivers to operate would be more beneficial in headwater tributaries than in higher-order reaches.",

These data constitute the first archaeomagnetic intensity variation curve for southern Africa for the past few centuries. The ages of the sites are tightly constrained by historical and archaeological considerations. Archaeointensity data obtained by the Thellier and Thellier method (modified by Coe), are corrected for both TRM anisotropy and cooling rate dependence of TRM acquisition. Analysis of magnetic mineralogy was performed to aid selection of fragments. Reliable archaeointensity determinations were obtained for 48 of 80 specimens, and 45 were retained in the final analysis. Intensity results vary from 24.3 ± 0.6 µT (modern brick) to 40.7 ± 0.8 µT (1660 AD), corresponding to Virtual Axial Dipole Moments (VADMs) between 6.1 ± 0.2 and 10.2 ± 0.2 נ1022 Am2.

            "abstract": "We have examined seismic anisotropy within the mantle lithosphere of Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic provinces of Europe by means of shear-wave splitting and P-wave travel-time deviations of teleseismic waves observed at dense arrays of seismic stations (e.g., Vecsey et al., Tectonophys. 2007). Lateral variations of seismic-wave anisotropy delimit domains of the mantle lithosphere, each of them having a consistent fabric. The domains, modeled in 3D by olivine aggregates with dipping lineation a, or foliation (a,c), represent microplates or their fragments that preserved their pre-assembly fossil fabrics in the mantle lithosphere. Evaluating seismic anisotropy in 3D, as well as mapping boundaries of the domains helps to decipher processes of the lithosphere formation.\nSystematically dipping mantle fabrics and other seismological findings seem to support a model of continental lithosphere built from systems of paleosubductions of plates of ancient oceanic lithosphere (Babuska and Plomerova, AGU Geoph. Monograph 1989), or by stacking of the plates (Helmstaedt and Schulze, Geol. Soc. Spec. Publ. 1989). Seismic anisotropy in the oceanic mantle lithosphere, explained mainly by the olivine A- or D-type fabric (Karato et al., Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 2008), was discovered a half century ago (Hess, Nature 1964). Field observations and laboratory experiments indicate the oceanic olivine fabric might be preserved in the subducting lithosphere to a depth of at least 200-300 km. We thus interpret the dipping anisotropic fabrics in domains of the European mantle lithosphere as systems of “frozen” paleosubductions (Babuska and Plomerova, PEPI 2006), and the lithosphere base as a boundary between a fossil anisotropy in the lithospheric mantle and an underlying seismic anisotropy related to present-day flow in the asthenosphere (Plomerova and Babuska, Lithos 2010).",

            "abstract": "Methane acts as both a greenhouse gas and a driver of atmospheric chemistry. There is a lack of consensus for the explanation behind the atmospheric methane trend in recent years (1980-2010). High uncertainties are associated with the magnitudes of individual methane source and sink processes. Methane isotopes have the potential to distinguish between the different methane fluxes, as each flux is characterized by an isotopic signature. Methane emissions from each source category are expressed explicitly in a chemistry climate model SOCOL, including wetlands, rice paddies, biomass burning, industry, etc. The model includes 48 methane tracers based on source type and geographical origin in order to track methane after it has been emitted. SOCOL simulations for the years 1980-2010 are performed in “nudged mode”, so that model dynamics reflect observed meteorology. Available database estimates of the various surface emission fluxes are inputted into SOCOL. The model diagnostic methane tracers are compared to methane isotope observations from measurement networks. Inconsistencies between the model results and observations point to deficiencies in the available emission estimates or model sink processes. Because of their dependence on the OH sink, deuterated methane observations and methyl chloroform tracers are used to investigate the variability of OH mixing ratios in the model and the real world. The analysis examines the validity of the methane source and sink category estimates over the last 30 years.",

            "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is a greenhouse gas and toxic pollutant which plays a major role in air quality and atmospheric chemistry. The understanding and ability to model the horizontal and vertical structure of O3 mixing ratios is difficult due to the complex formation/destruction processes and transport pathways that cause large variability of O3. The Environmental Protection Agency has National Ambient Air Quality Standards for O3 set at 75 ppb with future standards proposed to be as low as 65 ppb. These lower values emphasize the need to better understand/simulate the transport processes, emission sources, and chemical processes controlling precursor species (e.g., NOx, VOCs, and CO) which influence O3 mixing ratios. The uncertainty of these controlling variables is particularly large in the southeast United States (US) which is a region impacted by multiple different emission sources of precursor species (anthropogenic and biogenic) and transport processes resulting in complex spatio-temporal O3 patterns.\nDuring this work we will evaluate O3 and precursor species in the southeast US applying models, ground-based and airborne in situ data, and lidar observations. In the summer of 2013, the UAH O3 Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) (part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet)) measured vertical O3 profiles from the surface up to ~12 km. During this period, the lidar observed numerous periods of dynamic temporal and vertical O3 structures. In order to determine the sources/processes impacting these O3 mixing ratios we will apply the CTM GEOS-Chem (v9-02) at a 0.25° × 0.3125° resolution. Using in situ ground-based (e.g., SEARCH Network, CASTNET), airborne (e.g., NOAA WP-3D – SENEX 2013, DC-8 – SEAC4RS), and TOLNet lidar data we will first evaluate the model to determine the capability of GEOS-Chem to simulate the spatio-temporal variability of O3 in the southeast US. Secondly, we will perform model sensitivity studies in order to quantify which emission sources (e.g., anthropogenic, biogenic, lighting, wildfire) and transport processes (e.g., stratospheric, long-range, local scale) are contributing to these TOLNet-observed dynamic O3 patterns. Results from the evaluation of the model and the study of sources/processes impacting observed O3 mixing ratios will be presented.",

SIF is intrinsically linked to photosynthesis, so the new data sets allow to link remotely-sensed vegetation parameters and the actual photosynthetic activity of plants. In this study, we used space measurements of SIF together with the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) balance model in order to simulate regional photosynthetic uptake of croplands in the US corn belt. SCOPE couples fluorescence and photosynthesis at leaf and canopy levels.\nTo do this, we first retrieved a key parameter of photosynthesis model, the maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax), from field measurements of CO2 and water flux during 2007-2012 at some crop eddy covariance flux sites in the Midwestern US. Then we empirically calibrated Vcmax with apparent fluorescence yield which is SIF divided by PAR. SIF retrievals are from the European GOME-2 instrument onboard the MetOp-A platform. The resulting apparent fluorescence yield shows a stronger relationship with Vcmax during the growing season than widely-used vegetation index, EVI and NDVI. New seasonal and regional Vcmax maps were derived based on the calibration model for the cropland of the corn belt. The uncertainties of Vcmax were also estimated through Gaussian error propagation. With the newly derived Vcmax maps, we modeled regional cropland GPP during the growing season for the Midwestern USA, with meteorological data from MERRA reanalysis data and LAI from MODIS product (MCD15A2). The results show the improvement in the seasonal and spatial patterns of cropland productivity in comparisons with both flux tower and agricultural inventory data.",

            "abstract": "A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of a stage is chosen such that it can be accurately correlated with widely separated sections. To make such correlation, one can use the primary marker (usually the first appearance of a species). However, more often than not, secondary markers of chemo-, magneto-, cyclo- or biostratigraphic nature prove useful in establishing accurate and precise correlations. The GSSP for the Emsian - Eifelian stage boundary is exposed in the Wetteldorf Richtschnitt, in the Eifel Hill in Germany. The Emsian-Eifelian boundary is defined by the first occurrence of the conodont Polygnathus costatus partitus (Ziegler and Klapper, 1985). However, no secondary markers are currently available for this GSSP section. Our aim is to construct a cyclostratigraphic framework for this GSSP section, and thus to facilitate future correlations. Therefore, we collected 4-cm spaced elemental data of an 8.65 m thick interval, using a Bruker Tracer handheld XRF. We complemented our data with previously-published magnetic susceptibility (MS) data (Ellwood et al., 2006).\nA strong anti-correlation exists between the calcium-iron ratio (Ca/Fe) and the MS data. These variations mainly reflect the lithological variability between carbonate-poor mud- and siltstones and argillaceous limestone beds or calcareous sandstones. These proxies, as well as Ti/Al and K/Al, reflect strong 0.5 - 1 m periodicity. However, the orbital calibration of this dominant periodicity is challenged by the few time constraints available for the studied section. To circumvent this problem, we apply the evolutive average spectral misfit method (eASM; Meyers and Sageman, 2007) to the 4 different proxy records. This method tests the null hypothesis of no orbital signal and provides an estimate of sedimentation rate throughout the section. For all proxies, the eASM method provides similar results and we use the obtained sedimentation rates to convert stratigraphic height into time. We observe a mixed forcing of obliquity and eccentricity-modulated precession. Moreover, the Emsian – Eifelian boundary clearly occurs shortly after a 100-kyr eccentricity maximum. This cyclostratigraphic observation can be used as an additional mean in future long-distance correlations between Emsian – Eifelian boundary sections.",

Both fossil anisotropy in the mantle lithosphere and anisotropy due to the present-day flow in the asthenosphere may significantly influence propagation of seismic waves. We present a novel code for anisotropic teleseismic tomography (AniTomo) that allows to invert relative P-wave travel time residuals simultaneously for coupled isotropic-anisotropic P-wave velocity models of the upper mantle. We have modified frequently-used isotropic teleseismic tomography code Telinv by assuming weak hexagonal anisotropy with symmetry axis oriented generally in 3D to be, together with heterogeneities, a source of the observed P-wave travel-time residuals. Careful testing of the new code with synthetics, concentrating on strengths and limitations of the inversion method, is a necessary step before AniTomo is applied to real datasets. We examine various aspects of anisotropic tomography and particularly influence of ray coverage on resolvability of individual model parameters and of initial models on the result. Synthetic models are designed to schematically represent heterogeneous and anisotropic structures in the upper mantle. Several synthetic tests mimicking a real tectonic setting, e.g. the lithosphere subduction in the Northern Apennines in Italy (Munzarova et al., G-Cubed, 2013), allow us to make quantitative assessments of the well-known trade-off between effects of seismic anisotropy and heterogeneities. Our results clearly document that significant distortions of imaged velocity heterogeneities may result from neglecting anisotropy.",

They have also been observed to lie near or within a zone of low shear-wave velocity, which is modelled as fluid-rich upper oceanic crust. Due to relatively large depth uncertainties in absolute hypocenters of most LFE families, their location relative to an independently imaged subucting plate and, consequently, the nature of the plate boundary at depths between 30-45 km have not been precisely determined. For a selection of LFE families in northern Washington, we measure variations in arrival time of individual LFE detections using multi-channel cross-correlation incorporating both arrivals at the same station and different events (cross-detection data), and the same event but different stations (cross-station data). Employing HypoDD, these times are used to generate relative locations for individual LFE detections. After creating templates from spatial subgroups of detections, network cross-correlation techniques will be used to search for new detections in neighbouring areas, thereby expanding the local catalogue and enabling further subdivision.

We evaluate the large-scale anisotropy in the upper mantle from (1) splitting of SKS waves (Vecsey et al., 2008), (2) directional terms of relative P-wave travel time residuals, (3) teleseismic tomography and (4) jointly interpreted body-wave anisotropic parameters (Plomerova et al., 2011).\nThe domains of mantle lithosphere are sharply bounded both in the Proterozoic and Archean provinces and can be modelled in 3D by peridotite aggregates with dipping lineation a or foliation (a,c). The domains represent lithosphere fragments retaining fossil olivine preferred orientation created before the micro-plates assembled. Wedge-like penetration of the Archean domain into the Proterozoic province in the south-central Finland, supported by alternating ages of mantle xenoliths, seems to continue towards the north, where a westward shift of a boundary between regions with positive and negative velocity perturbations in teleseismic P-wave tomography can indicate an inclination of the Baltic-Bothnia Megashear Zone. We search for a mechanism which could create the observed inclined fabrics within continental assemblages. Such mechanism should differ from simple cooling processes which would lead to a horizontal stratification of the lithosphere without creating domains exhibiting different fabrics.",

The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument has been, and continues giving us chemical information of the coma of 67P in unprecedented detail. One of ROSINA’s first findings was a strongly heterogeneous coma observed in the major and various minor volatile species depending on the location of the spacecraft with respect to the comet. In this work, we argue that the time variation of volatile species observed by ROSINA, which correlates with 67P’s rotational phase, has implications for the ice structure of the nucleus. The data indicate that the near-surface layers of the nucleus of 67P are composed of a mixture of crystalline water ice, clathrate hydrates, and pure volatile ices. We argue that the coma profiles of all volatile species observed in the September-October 2014 time period would be difficult to explain by gas release from a porous amorphous ice phase. However, at this point, we cannot conclude on the ice structure in the deep layers of the nucleus. Analysis of data obtained after the equinox and near perihelion will provide further clues about the ice structure, hence the origin of 67P.",

Climate modeling studies, as well as theory and observations suggest that such extreme precipitation events will intensify with global warming. Current projections of extreme precipitation events are based on conventional global and regional climate models, which due to the coarse resolution need to parameterize convective precipitation. The use of convection parameterization leads to a poor representation of extreme precipitation especially on the sub-daily time scale.\nHere we present an analysis of extreme precipitation events in convection-resolving climate simulations. The simulations are performed with the COSMO-CLM model at a convection-resolving resolution of 2.2 km across an extended region covering the Alps and its larger-scale surrounding from northern Italy to northern Germany. Ten-year long control and scenario simulations (1991-2000 and 2081-2090) are conducted, driven by a CMIP5 coupled climate model (MPI-ESM-LR) under an RCP8.5 greenhouse gas scenario. Previous work on validation has shown a dramatic improvement in the representation of sub-daily precipitation statistics (Ban et al. 2014).\nHere we apply generalized extreme value theory to address projections of 5-day mean, daily and hourly extreme precipitation events in all seasons. We present a detailed intercomparison of the convection-resolving model against a conventional (12 km grid spacing) climate model in terms of model performance and differences between climate change signals. Analysis shows negligible differences between the two simulations for winter precipitation on all time scales, while in other seasons and especially for hourly precipitation the 2km model shows smaller changes and is more confident than the 12km model. The results are generally consistent with a previous analysis using percentile indices (Ban et al. 2015) and indicate that changes in extreme summer precipitation qualitatively scale with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. In other seasons, when large-scale precipitation becomes more dominant type of precipitation, the change in extreme precipitation exceeds the Clausius-Clapeyron rate.",

However, it is challenging to measure ice depth continuously from a remote location, as existing methods are too large, expensive, and/or time-intensive. Therefore, we present a novel application that reduces the size and cost issues by using soil water content reflectometer sensors. Analysis of sensors deployed in an environmental chamber using a scale model of a lake demonstrated their value as accurate measures of the change in ice depth over any time period, through measurement of the liquid-to-solid phase change. A robust correlation exists between volumetric water content in time as a function of environmental temperature. This relationship allows us to convert volumetric water content into ice depth. An array of these sensors will be placed in Lake Mendota, Madison, Wisconsin in winter 2015-2016, to create a temporally high-resolution ice depth record, which will be used for ecological or climatological studies while also being transmitted to the public to increase recreational safety.",

            "abstract": "Direct spacecraft measurements of the solar wind and heliospheric magnetic field have been performed near-continuously for the over 60 years. The solar wind is seen to vary over all observed time scales, from sub-seconds to decades, with strong evidence of secular trends. In order to fully assess the longer-term variations, it is necessary to use proxy data. Approximately 170 years of geomagnetic data can be used to provide extremely accurate reconstructions of the near-Earth solar wind speed and the heliospheric magnetic field intensity on annual time scales, and consequently the open solar flux. Prior to 1845, it is necessary to go to more indirect proxies for solar wind conditions. Sunspot number can be used with simple empirical relations and open solar flux modelling to provide estimates of the near-Earth conditions back to ~1610. Of course, such reconstructions are only as accurate as the sunspot records which underpin them, but by taking an ensemble approach, the uncertainties can be both reduced and quantified. Extending further back in time is possible through the use of cosmogenic isotope records in natural reservoirs such as tree trunks and ice cores. Teasing out the solar wind signal requires detailed modelling of the Earth system and hence the time resolution is generally sub-annual and the uncertainties greater than with geomagnetic and sunspot methods. Nevertheless, the long-term evolution of the solar magnetic field can be inferred over nearly 10,000 years.",

            "abstract": "Topography of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and structure of the continental lithosphere record geodynamic development of the outer parts of the Earth. Studying the architecture of plates and mapping the LAB discontinuity relief can help to answer questions how and when the plates assembled and to what extent they were later deformed. Differences in changes of physical properties across the “discontinuities” are significant, but sharpness of the transitions depends on optics we are using. Moreover, the nature of the boundary/transition remains uncertain. Fundamental difference in origin and orientation of seismic anisotropy in the mantle lithosphere and in the sub-lithospheric mantle has led us to develop an original approach of LAB modelling. We associate the LAB with a transition of fossil anisotropy in the rigid high-velocity lithosphere to present-day related anisotropy in the more viscous underlying asthenosphere. We present a global LAB model calculated from depth-dependences of azimuthal and radial anisotropy of surface waves (Plomerova et al., 2002) and a uniform model of the European LAB (Plomerova and Babuska, 2010), calculated from P-wave travel times collected during regional passive experiments. In the latter, the LAB is modelled according to an empirical residual-depth relation. The high velocity contrast across the LAB (δvP ~ 0.6 km/s) required by the empirical gradient cannot be accomplished by isotropic velocities of materials forming the upper mantle, while it can be explained by different orientations of the high-velocities above and below the LAB. Relief of the lower plate boundary can vary considerably on short lateral distances and it is exposed to erosion from asthenosphere. On the other hand, dipping fabrics of often sharply bounded lithospheric domains, created probably during a plate formation, indicate stability of such a fossilized structure, which alters only near the domain boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is a powerful statistical method in solving inverse problems that arise from a wide range of applications, such as nuclear physics, computational biology, financial engineering, among others. In Earth sciences applications of MCMC are primarily in the field of geophysics [1]. The purpose of this study is to introduce MCMC to geochemical inverse problems related to trace element fractionation during concurrent melting, melt transport and melt-rock reaction in the mantle. MCMC method has several advantages over linearized least squares methods in inverting trace element patterns in basalts and mantle rocks. First, MCMC can handle equations that have no explicit analytical solutions which are required by linearized least squares methods for gradient calculation. Second, MCMC converges to global minimum while linearized least squares methods may be stuck at a local minimum or converge slowly due to nonlinearity. Furthermore, MCMC can provide insight into uncertainties of model parameters with non-normal trade-off.\nWe use MCMC to invert for extent of melting, amount of trapped melt, and extent of chemical disequilibrium between the melt and residual solid from REE data in abyssal peridotites from Central Indian Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the first step, we conduct forward calculation of REE evolution with melting models in a reasonable model space. We then build up a chain of melting models according to Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to represent the probability of specific model. We show that chemical disequilibrium is likely to play an important role in fractionating LREE in residual peridotites. In the future, MCMC will be applied to more realistic but also more complicated melting models in which partition coefficients, diffusion coefficients, as well as melting and melt suction rates vary as functions of temperature, pressure and mineral compositions.\n[1].

Our new tomographic models of the crust and upper mantle of the Arctic are constrained by an unprecedentedly large global waveform dataset and provide substantially improved resolution, compared to previous models. The new tomography reveals lateral variations in the temperature and thickness of the lithosphere and defines deep boundaries between tectonic blocks with different lithospheric properties and age.\nThe shape and evolution of the geotherm beneath a tectonic unit depends on both crustal and mantle-lithosphere structure beneath it: the lithospheric thickness and its changes with time (these determine the supply of heat from the deep Earth), the crustal thickness and heat production (the supply of heat from within the crust), and the thickness and thermal conductivity of the sedimentary cover (the insulation). Detailed thermal structure of the basins can be modelled by combining seismic velocities from tomography with data on the crustal structure and heat production, in the framework of computational petrological modelling.\nThe most prominent lateral contrasts across the Arctic are between the cold, thick lithospheres of the cratons (in North America, Greenland and Eurasia) and the warmer, non-cratonic blocks. The lithosphere of the Canada Basin is cold and thick, similar to old oceanic lithosphere elsewhere around the world; its thermal structure offers evidence on its lithospheric age and formation mechanism. At 150-250 km depth, the central Arctic region shows a moderate low-velocity anomaly, cooler than that beneath Iceland and N Atlantic. An extension of N Atlantic low-velocity anomaly into the Arctic through the Fram Strait may indicate an influx of N Atlantic asthenosphere under the currently opening Eurasia Basin.",

The cumulus clouds during the RACORO campaign simulated using a large eddy simulation (LES) model are also examined with the same approach. The analysis shows that combination of multiple variables can better represent entrainment rate in both the observations and LES than the single-variable fitting equations and the three commonly used parameterizations. A new parameterization is thus presented that relates entrainment rate to vertical velocity, buoyancy and dissipation rate; the effects of treating clouds as ensembles and humid shells surrounding cumulus clouds on the new parameterization are discussed. Physical mechanisms underlying the relationships of entrainment rate to vertical velocity, buoyancy and dissipation rate are also explored.

Plane assumption is inapplicability to the exceptionally large earthquakes, in this paper, with the finite element method considering Earth’s layered structure and curvature, co-seismic deformation field and stress field are calculated. Based on the Coulomb stress change, seismic activity of surrounding faults and triggering of aftershocks is estimated. The results show that: the effects of Earth’s layered structure and curvature on co-seismic horizontal and vertical displacement are significant. The plane layered model or plane half-space model may underestimate the far-field co-seismic displacement and strain near the equator and overestimate and underestimate the far-field displacement and strain near Antarctica, respectively. The range of influence of co-seismic displacement is about thousands of kilometers, relatively large horizontal displacements locate on the northwest and southeast of the seismic fault. Horizontal displacement in One-half of South America is about the magnitude order of 0.5 mm. Stress drop caused by this earthquake in Central Argentina is equivalent to 5-10 years tectonic stress accumulation while in Northern Argentina and Southern Argentina is equivalent to 1-5 years tectonic stress release. Coulomb stress change in earthquake fractured zone is equivalent to 15 years tectonic stress release which means next great earthquake will not come at this region in short time. Coulomb stress change in unfracture regions near the fracture zone is equivalent to 15 years tectonic stress accumulation, which means the seismicity increasing. Coulomb stress change on optimally orientated faults are calculated, 66.2% of aftershocks occur in regions where the failure stress exceed 10 kPa.

            "abstract": "The high noise level in the seismic records can significantly decline the efficiency of the automatic picking algorithms, particularly in the case of weak arrivals. Traditional methods used for improving the quality of arrivals are commonly based on pure spectral filtering. The problems related to the later arise when the signal and noise share the same band frequency. Furthermore, some of these filters may distort the key parameters of automatic picking (onset time and polarity). In the near surface surveys, the stacking addresses these problems thanks to data redundancy. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of first arrivals, and thereby increase their detectability, we propose an optimal alternative: the double stacking in the time domain. The first weighted stack is based on local similarity of the common offsets traces for a few adjacent shots. This stack approach is more tolerant to significant misalignment signals, and locally emphasizes the buried signals. The second stack is applied to a few neighboring traces (within moving spatial window), in the same shot gather, after correcting the delay times via cross correlation tools. In cases of very noisy data, the waveform stacking and the cross-correlation analysis are less efficient at higher frequencies, due to the limited coherence of short-period waveform. De-noising using wavelet transform was carried out as an auxiliary procedure before the second stack. To validate our approach, a synthetic profile was generated from a realistic model via finite difference modeling, and considerable noise levels were added to the simulated data. The weak events are remarkably enhanced, and are more identifiable on the stacked sections. We perform additionally a comparative study of the performance of automatic picking methods, using adaptive multi-method algorithm on noisy real data. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying the double stacking before the automatic picking.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial land use may impact both the amounts of and characteristics of organic and inorganic carbon (OC and IC, respectively) entering aquatic ecosystems. Better understanding of how different land uses alter carbon characteristics and export fluxes from watersheds may lead to better management practices for retaining OC in terrestrial habitats and therefore mitigate CO2 emissions from freshwater ecosystems where terrestrial OC may be more rapidly respired. We examined the fluxes and δ13C and ∆14C signatures of dissolved IC (DIC), dissolved OC (DOC), and particulate OC (POC) exported from 6 watersheds with differing land use at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) in Coshocton county in northeastern Ohio to assess whether differences in land use are related to variability in the export fluxes and isotopic characteristics of OC and IC pools. We used a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIR) to determine how the relative contributions of potential carbon sources to DIC, DOC, and POC change as a function of watershed land use. Mixing model results from each season were used to approximate relative annual contributions of potential sources to DIC, DOC, and POC export fluxes from each watershed. We found that agricultural land uses (i.e., corn, under both conventional till and no-till management) experienced the greatest degree of disturbance and had the greatest carbon export fluxes. However, the relative extent to which soil OC contributed to export fluxes compared to corn biomass varied as a function of tillage practices. In addition, nonparametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), based on the δ13C and ∆14C data and mixing model results for DIC, DOC and POC export fluxes, separated non-corn watersheds into 2 further classes of disturbance: moderate disturbance (pasture and mixed land use) and low disturbance (forest). These findings suggest that land use has a measurable impact on the concentration and characteristics of watershed C export fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The retreat of cliffs is an important mode of erosion in layered rocks of variable strength. For example, the iconic Colorado Plateau landscapes of Grand Canyon, Canyonlands, and Monument Valley owe their unique forms to this process. These landscapes are the end result of incision by trunk streams followed by cliff retreat. Local interactions between stochastic rockfall and first-order channels draining a cliff regulate the cliff retreat response to a base-level fall. However, nonlinear transport dynamics, steep slopes, and variable rock strength challenge the modeling of landscape evolution in these settings. Here, we employ structure-from-motion photogrammetry to generate high-resolution DTMs of a natural experiment site on the Colorado Plateau. The site features a simple, sandstone-over-shale stratigraphy with a continuous gradient in cliffband height and evidence for an ongoing transient response to base level fall. The terrain data inform a high-resolution (dx=5 m), 2D numerical model of cliffband erosion. The model simulates the interaction of three primary processes: fluvial erosion and sediment transport; hillslope transport of regolith, including shallow landsliding; and rockfall from resistant units. Crucially, the model allows us to modify stratigraphy arbitrarily to examine the landscape response to parameters such as thickness, spacing, and dip of resistant units. Results indicate that the contrast in fluvial erodibility sets the pattern of emergence of cliffs as a resistant layer is exhumed, while the difference in weathering rates across rock types sets the rate at which cliffs emerge. Once rockfall begins, erosion rates are modified by the thickness of the resistant layer, which sets the volume of rockfall debris reaching the channels below the cliff. The modeling highlights the need for process-based understanding of the conditions for cliff failure by rockfall and redistribution of the debris in very steep, rapidly-eroding landscapes.",

Remote sensing is a crucial tool to map land cover and cover changes, but it is still challenging to accurately quantify the plantation and its carbon stock from time-series satellite images. In this paper, the Yulin district, Shaanxi province, representing a typical afforestation area in the TNSFP region, was selected as the study area, and there were twenty-nine Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ epochs were collected from 1974 to 2012 to reconstruct the forest changes and carbon stock in last 40 years. Firstly, the Landsat ground surface reflectance (GSR) images from 1974 to 2013 were collected and processed based on 6S atmospheric transfer code and a relative reflectance normalization algorithm. Subsequently, we developed a vegetation change tracking method to reconstruct the forest change history (afforestation and deforestation) from the dense time-series Landsat GSR images based on the integrated forest z-score (IFZ) model, and the afforestation age was successfully retrieved from the Landsat time-series stacks in the last forty years and shown to be consistent with the surveyed tree ages, with a RMSE value of 4.32 years and a determination coefficient (R²) of 0.824. Then, the AGB regression models were successfully developed by integrating vegetation indices and tree age. The simple ratio vegetation index (SR) is the best candidate of the commonly used vegetation indices for estimating forest AGB, and the forest AGB model was significantly improved using the combination of SR and tree age, with R² values from 0.50 to 0.727. Finally, the forest AGB images were mapped at eight epochs from 1985 to 2013 using SR and afforestation age. The total forest AGB in six counties of Yulin District increased by 20.8 G kg, from 5.8 G kg in 1986 to 26.6 G kg in 2013, a total increase of 360%. For the forest area since 1974, the forest AGB density increased from 15.72 t/ha in 1986 to 44.53 t/ha in 2013, with an annual rate of about 1 t/ha. The results present a noticeable carbon increment for the planted artificial forest in Yulin District over the last four decades.\nKeywords: forest aboveground biomass (AGB), afforestation, remote sensing, time-series, vegetation indices ",

The drift was repeated as soon as the vessel drifted free. Altogether during the 6 month, 4 ice stations where installed and the complex ocean-sea ice-atmosphere system was studied with an interdisciplinary approach.\nDuring the N-ICE2015 cruise, extensive ice thickness and snow depth measurements were performed during both, winter and summer conditions.\nTotal ice and snow thickness was measured with ground-based and airborne electromagnetic instruments like EM31, GEM, and EM-bird; snow depth was measured with a GPS snow depth probe. Additionally, ice mass balance and snow buoys were deployed.\nSnow and ice thickness measurements were performed on repeated transects to quantify the ice growth or loss as well as the snow accumulation and melt rate. Additionally, we collected independent values on surveys to determine the general ice thickness distribution.\nIn terms of mass balance, average snow depths of 32 cm on first year ice, and 52 cm on multiyear ice were measured in January, the mean snow depth on all ice types even increased until end of March to 49 cm. The average total ice and snow thickness in winter conditions was 1.92 cm.\nDuring winter, we found an unusual small growth rate on multiyear ice of about 15 cm in 2 months, due to above-average snow depths and some extraordanary storm events that came along with mild temperatures. In contrast thereto, we were also able to study new ice formation and thin ice on refrozen leads.\nIn summer conditions an enormous melt rate, mainly driven by a warm Atlantic water inflow in the marginal ice zone, was observed during two ice stations with melt rates of up to 20 cm per 24 hours.\nThe here presented dataset is a mandatory parameter for understanding the ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions, for calculating energy fluxes, and biogeochemical processes.",

            "abstract": "The core mantle boundary (CMB) is one of the most significant boundary layers in the Earth, where the silicate mantle meets the liquid iron-nickel outer core and thus is crucial in understanding the thermal, chemical and dynamic processes in the Earth. Besides, the 200 - 300 km region above this boundary, known as D”, exhibits strong heterogeneities of different scales, from thousands to tens of km. A variety of studies have been conducted to study this region, especially the small-scale structures. Among them, PKP precursors provide valuable complementary information on such small-scale heterogeneities due to their special ray geometries. In this study, we collected seismograms from earthquakes in South America recorded by stations in Australia. After band passing, in the short period seismograms, we observed clear PKP precursor phases with large amplitudes comparable to those of PKIKP. Additionally, these precursor phases arrive about 7-10 s before PKIKP. Using array processing methods, we calculated the slowness of these precursors and found the slowness is from 3.2 to 3.4. Furthermore, the precursors have a phase shift of π/2 compared to PKIKP phase. Our preliminary results indicate that the observed precursors may originate from small scatterers near the core mantle boundary in the southeast side of Australia, and the P velocities of the scatterers may have more than 10% reduction. More synthetic tests will be carried out to further constrain the geometry and velocity variations of the scatterers.",

            "abstract": "The origin of lateral velocity heterogeneities is essential for our understanding of Earth’s interior. Ferropericlase’s (Fp) spin crossover (FSC) fundamentally changes the interpretation of the origin of lateral heterogeneities in the mid lower mantle. In a typical pyrolite compositional model, it induces an unusual increase in bulk sound velocity (Vϕ) with increasing temperature at mid-lower-mantle depths [1]. This reduces the sensitivity of longitudinal velocity (VP) to lateral temperature variations around 1700 km [1]. Here we show that FSC also dramatically impacts the manifestation of two important types of compositional heterogeneities, i.e., changes in iron concentration in Fp or in molar fraction of Fp. It enhances the sensitivity of Vϕ and VP to these compositional variations by several-fold at similar depths. Therefore, heterogeneities in VP tomography models are potentially good indicators of temperature versus compositional contributions to lateral velocity changes. In fact, VP heterogeneities at mid lower mantle depths common to multiple seismic models suggest that both lateral temperature and compositional variations may be significant in this region.\n[1] Wu, Z.Q., & Wentzcovitch, R.M.

            "abstract": "Back projection (BP) has recently emerged as a tool for imaging the spatio-temporal distribution of high-frequency (HF) emission during the earthquake rupture. BP images are typically constructed from HF-filtered, far field velocity waveforms, shifted and stacked according to the predicted travel-time from each node of a source grid. The underlying assumption is that the radiated wave field is coherent across the recording array, so that waveforms sum up constructively when the correct source point is selected. For regional arrays, at teleseismic distance, this assumption is generally valid up to 2-3 Hz.\nBP is an inherently HF method (resolution degrades at lower frequencies), and has been often used in conjunction with kinematic slip modeling (inherently low-frequency) to discuss the variability of rupture behavior with frequency. Many studies have evidenced that HF emissions occur at the border of large slip asperities and/or are associated with abrupt changes in rupture velocity.\nHere we perform a systematic investigation of the relationship between rupture properties and BP images of HF emission through the analysis of synthetic finite-source models, using a kinematic k-2 source model. This approach is based on a composite source description, with sub-events following a fractal distribution of sizes. Each elementary source is activated by the macro scale rupture front, with rupture duration proportional to its size. This approach generates, in the far-field approximation, ground displacements that follow the ω-2 model with frequency-dependent directivity effects. For a large earthquake rupture (M~9), synthetic far field recordings can be generated up to 4 Hz, with reasonable computing time.\nWe study several scenarios, exploring the spatial variability of rupture velocity, fractal properties (slip heterogeneity) and source directivity, and analyze the effect of the relative position between the recording teleseismic array and the fault.",

The West Myanmar, interpreted as forearc silver, is the archetype example of such forearc regions subordinate to Sunda arc-trench system, and is widely debated when and how its forearc regions formed. A total of twenty-two samples were obtained from the Indo-Burman Ranges and western thrust belt of Minbu Sub-basin along Taungup-Prome Road in Southwestern Myanmar (Figure 1), and five sandstone samples of them were performed at Apatite to Zircon, Inc. Three samples (M3, M5, and M11) collected from Eocene flysch and metamorphic core at the Indo-Burman Ranges revealed apatite fission track (AFT) ages ranging from 19 to 9 Ma and 6.5 to 2 Ma. Two samples (M20 and M21) acquired from the western thrust belt of Minbu Sub-basin yielded AFT ages ranging from 28 to 13.5 Ma and 7.5 to 3.5 Ma. Time-temperature models based on AFT data suggest four major Cenozoic cooling episodes, Late Oligocene, Early to Middle Miocene, Late Miocene, and Pliocene to Pleistocene. The first to third episode, models suggest the metamorphic core of the Indo-Burman Ranges has experienced multi-phase rapidly uplifted during the early construction of the forearc regions. The latest episode, on which this study focused, indicated a fast westward growth of the Palaeogene accretionary wedge and a eastward propagation deformation of folding and thrusting of the western thrust belt of Minbu Sub-basin. We argued that above multi-phase uplifted and deformation of the forearc regions were results of India/West Burma plate’s faster oblique convergence and faster sedimentation along the India/Eurasia suture zone.",

Hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 greatly affected production, almost to the same degree as strong freezes that occurred in the 1980’s. The spread of the citrus greening disease after the hurricanes has also contributed to a reduction in orange production in Florida. The occurrence of hurricanes and diseases cannot easily be predicted but the additional effects of climate on orange yield can be studied and incorporated into existing production forecasts that are based on physical surveys, such as the October Citrus forecast issued every year by the USDA. Specific climate variables ocurring before and after the October forecast is issued can have impacts on flowering, orange drop rates, growth, and maturation, and can contribute to the forecast error. Here we present a methodology to incorporate local climate variables to predict the USDA’s orange production forecast error, and we study the local effects of climate on yield in different counties in Florida. This information can aid farmers to gain an insight on what is to be expected during the orange production cycle, and can help supply chain managers to better plan their strategy.",

The use of “site specific” microseismic monitoring systems can allow to detect pre-failure signals in unstable sectors within the rock mass and to predict the possible acceleration to the failure. To this aim multi-scale geophysical methods can provide a unique tool for an high-resolution imaging of the internal structure of the rock mass and constraints on the physical state of the medium. We present here a cross-hole seismic tomography survey coupled with laboratory ultrasonic velocity measurements and determination of physical properties on rock samples to characterize the damaged and potentially unstable granitic cliff of Madonna del Sasso (NW, Italy). Results allowed to achieve two main advances, in terms of obtaining: i) a lithological interpretation of the velocity field obtained at the site, ii) a systematic correlation of the measured velocities with physical properties (density and porosity) and macroscopic features of the granite (weathering and anisotropy) of the cliff.\nA microseismic monitoring system developed by the University of Turin/Compagnia San Paolo, consisting of a network of 4 triaxial geophones (4.5 Hz) connected to a 12-channel data logger, has been deployed on the unstable granitic cliff. More than 2000 events with different waveforms, duration and frequency content were recorded between November 2013 and July 2014. By inspecting the acquired events we identified the key parameters for a reliable distinction among the nature of each signal, i.e. the signal shape (in terms of amplitude, duration, kurtosis) and the frequency content (maximum frequency content and frequency distribution). Four main classes of recorded signals can be recognised: microseismic events, regional earthquakes, electrical noises and calibration signals, and unclassified events (probably grouping rockfalls, quarry blasts, other anthropic and natural sources of seismic noise).",

            "abstract": "The space and time scales on which precipitation varies are small compared to the satellite coverage that we have, so it is necessary to merge “all” of the available satellite estimates. Differing retrieval capabilities from the various satellites require inter-calibration for the satellite estimates, while “morphing”, i.e., Lagrangian time interpolation, is used to lengthen the period over which time interpolation is valid. Additionally, estimates from geostationary-Earth-orbit infrared data are plentiful, but of sufficiently lower quality compared to low-Earth-orbit passive microwave estimates that they are only used when needed. Finally, monthly surface precipitation gauge data can be used to reduce bias and improve patterns of occurrence for monthly satellite data, and short-interval satellite estimates can be improved with a simple scaling such that they sum to the monthly satellite-gauge combination.\n The presentation will briefly consider some of the design decisions for practical computation of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission product Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), then examine design choices that maximize value for end users. For example, data fields are provided in the output file that provide insight into the basis for the estimated precipitation, including error, sensor providing the estimate, precipitation phase (solid/liquid), and intermediate precipitation estimates. Another important initiative is successive computations for the same data date/time at longer latencies as additional data are received, which for IMERG is currently done at 6 hours, 16 hours, and 3 months after observation time. Importantly, users require long records for each latency, which runs counter to the data archiving practices at most archive sites. As well, the assignment of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI’s) for near-real-time data sets (at 6 and 16 hours for IMERG) is not a settled issue.",

Recently, some phenomena indicate the existence of the poloidal motion of plasma in MCs. In order to study the possible cause of this motion, we use in-situ data from STEREO-A, STEREO-B and Wind spacecraft to analyze the magnetic cloud on November 19 to 20, 2007. A velocity-modified cylindrical force-free flux rope model is used to fit the MC at three spacecraft and the relation between the value of fitting velocity and observed velocity in the x'-y' plane in MC frame is obtained. Through the analysis, we find the difference of the speed of the ambient solar wind before the leading edge and after the trailing edge of the MC is the major cause of the poloidal motion of plasma in MC.",

            "abstract": "The North China Plain is one of the main grain producing areas of China, but is also a severe straw burning zone. Winter wheat and summer corn harvests in this area usually occur from the beginning of Jun and Oct, respectively. After harvest, farmers usually burn out the remaining straw for convenience. However, straw burning can release a large quantity of air pollutants and can consequently result in a significant deterioration in regional air quality. To monitor the impact of straw burning on particulate pollution, daily MODIS thermal anomaly products (MOD14 and MYD14) were used to identify dates and regions of straw burning. Then the corresponding MODIS AOD products (MOD04 and MYD04) and particulate matter (PM) concentration observations from ground stations were integrated using a geostatistical method. By combining the accurate station-based PM observations and satellite data of well spatial coverage, PM concentration distribution maps were generated. Meanwhile, NCEP reanalysis data were used to obtain the corresponding surface wind pattern maps. Preliminary results show that satellite and station-based observations can indicate the impact of straw burning on PM pollution during harvest time. Air qualities during these times are obviously affected by the straw burning and surface wind field. Moreover, the air quality of the southeast study region is susceptible to the straw burning in adjacent areas due to the characteristic of the terrain.",

            "abstract": "The Bjerkreim Sokndal intrusion consists of layers of plagioclase-pyroxene cumulates representing recharge and fractional crystallization of a jotunitic magma. The layers form a syncline with a SE plunging fold axis, and strong foliation at the limbs. One of these layers, MCU IVe’, is associated with a strong negative magnetic anomaly on the east of the syncline, reducing the magnetic field intensity at the surface to about 1/3 to 1/2 of the expected value. The anomaly is less prominent where MCU IVe’ outcrops in the hinge and west limb. Such a strong negative anomaly must be caused by remanent magnetization, most likely carried by lamellar hemo-ilmenite, which is known for its strong and stable remanence. A second magnetic phase present is magnetite. The aim of this study is to understand how the magnetic fabric affects the orientation and intensity of the remanence, which in turn controls the observed anomaly. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) have been measured on 500 cores from sites along MCU IVe’. The NRM direction changes along the layer, possibly related to mineral foliation. Both NRM intensity and mean susceptibility show a general decrease from east to north to west. In most sites, especially those with strong remanence, the NRM is sub-parallel to the maximum susceptibility, or lies within the magnetic foliation plane. Minimum susceptibility is normal to the expected mineral foliation plane in some sites, whereas it can lie within the foliation plane in others. This may be explained with the presence of two magnetic carriers, hemo-ilmenite and magnetite, which can give rise to different magnetic anisotropies. Understanding the relationship between mineral fabric, AMS, the intensity and direction of NRM, and the observed anomaly will help in interpreting other strong magnetic anomalies.",

Sub categories are rapidly emerging, such as context-aware ubiquitous learning, that involve students learning subject content while immersed in authentic and relevant surroundings. Learning cultures are a nebulous blend of traditions, values, beliefs, and rituals built up over time. For a long time, education has long been conceived as classroom-based and predominantly sedentary (Merchant, 2012). Recent mobile technologies are disrupting this culture in favor of learning that is contextualized, personalized, on demand, and ubiquitous (Crompton, 2013).\n21st century students are a different breed than past generations (Prensky, 2001). These students have grown up in a time that has not only altered their perceptions and practices but modified the wiring of the brain through neuroplasticity (Crompton, 2012). Students now cognitively receive information quickly through non-linear methods (Gross, 2003, Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005). They think differently. They also seem to be attached to mobile devices 24/7, although the content of the lesson does not match what they seem to be doing on the mobile devices. \nThis presentation will showcase how to get your students to harness the power of mobile devices for educational purposes. For example, students in your classes will be using devices to collaborate on activities with Google Forms, crowdsourcing the best class questions in Slido, and screencasting thoughts and ideas to share with others with Educreations.

            "abstract": "Percolation theory under different attacks is one of the main research areas in complex networks but never be applied to investigate climate network. In this study, for the first time we construct a climate network of surface air temperature field to analyze its percolation features. Here, we regard El Niño event as a kind of naturally attacks generated from Pacific Ocean to attack its upper climate network. We find that El Niño event leads an abrupt percolation phase transition to the climate network which makes it splitting and unstable suddenly. Comparing the results of the climate network under three different forms of attacks, including most connected attack (MA), localized attack (LA) and random attack (RA) respectively, it is found that both MA and LA lead first-order transition and RA leads second-order transition to the climate network. Furthermore, we find that most real attacks consist of all these three forms of attacks. With El Niño event emerging, the ratios of LA and MA increase and dominate the style of attack while RA decreasing. It means the percolation phase transition due to El Niño events is close to first-order transition mostly affected by LA and MA. Our research may help us further understand two questions from perspective of percolation on network: (1) Why not all warming in Pacific Ocean but El Niño events could affect the climate. (2) Why the climate affected by El Niño events changes abruptly.",

            "abstract": "This study deals with the analysis of the characteristics of extreme temperature events in the Middle East, using NCEP reanalysis gridded data, for the summer (May-October) and winter (November-April) seasons. Trends in the occurrences of three types of heat spells during 1948-2014 are studied by both Linear Regression (LR) and Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) are also investigated. To better understand the effects of heat spells on public health, the Humidex, a combination index of ambient temperature and relative humidity, is also used. Using percentile threshold, temperature (Humidex) Type-A and Type-B heat spells are defined respectively by daily maximum and minimum temperature (Humidex). Type-C heat spells are defined as the joint occurrence of Type-A and Type-B heat spells at the same time. In the Middle East, it is found that no coherent trend in temperature Type-A heat spells is observed. However, the occurrences of temperature Type-B and C heat spells have consistently increased since 1948. For Humidex heat spells, coherently increased activities of all three types of heat spells are observed in the area. During the summer, the magnitude of the positive trends in Humidex heat spells are generally stronger than temperature heat spells. More than half of the locations in the area show significantly negative DTR trends in the summer, but the trends vary according to the region in the winter. Annual mean temperature has increased an average by 0.5°C, but it is mainly associated with the daily minimum temperature which has warmed up by 0.84°C.Daily maximum temperature showed no significant trends. The warming is hence stronger in minimum temperatures than in maximum temperatures resulting in a decrease in DTR by 0.16 °C per decade. This study indicates hence that the UAE has not become hotter, but it has become less cold during 1948 to 2014.",

The choice of injection mode, resident or flux-weighted, is designed to mimic different physical phenomena. It has been hypothesized that solute plumes injected under resident conditions evolve to behave similarly to solutes injected under flux-weighted conditions. Previously, computational limitations have prohibited the large-scale simulations required to investigate this hypothesis. Using a new high performance DFN suite, dfnWorks, we simulate flow in kilometer-scale three-dimensional DFNs based on fractured granite at the Forsmark site in Sweden, and adopt a Lagrangian approach to simulate transport therein. Results show that after traveling through a pre-equilibrium region both injection methods exhibit linear scaling of the first moment of travel time and power law scaling of the breakthrough curve with similar exponents, slightly larger than two. The physical mechanisms behind this evolution appear to be the combination of in-network channeling of mass into larger fractures, which offer reduced resistance to flow, and in-fracture channeling, which results from the topology of the DFN.",

            "abstract": "The cratons of Central Africa are formed of various blocks of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic crust, flanked or truncated by Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic orogenic belts. The geology of east Africa has largely been shaped by the events of the Pan-African Orogeny when east and west Gondwana collided to form ‘Greater Gondwana’ at the end of the Neoproterozoic. The Pan-African orogeny in NE Africa involved the collision of Archaean cratons and the Saharan Metacraton with the Arabian Nubian Shield, a terrane comprising Neoproterozoic juvenile oceanic island arcs. Phanerozoic cover sedimentary rocks, eroded from the Pan-African orogenies, blanket much of NE Africa. Detrital data from these Phanerozoic cover sedimentary rocks, and modern rivers draining both the cover the basement, provide a wealth of information on basement evolution, of particular relevance for regions where the basement itself is poorly exposed due to ancient or modern sedimentary cover. From samples collected in Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, we provide combined U-Pb and Hf-isotope zircon, U-Pb rutile and Ar-Ar mica datasets, heavy mineral analyses, and bulk trace element data, from Archaean basement, Phanerozoic cover and modern river sediment from the Nile and its tributaries to document the evolution of the North African crust. The data document early crust-forming events in the Congo Craton and Sahara Metacraton, phased development of the Arabian Nubian Shield culminating in the Neoproterozoic assembly of Gondwana during the Pan African Orogeny, and the orogen’s subsequent erosion, with deposition of voluminous Phanerozoic cover.",

In an effort to address these challenges the impacts of drought and nutrient limitation on the CO2 assimilation of multiple genotypes of Brassica rapa was investigated using the Farquhar Model (FM) of photosynthesis following a Bayesian parameterization and updating scheme. Leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements from an unstressed group (well-watered/well-fertilized) and two stressed groups (drought/well-fertilized and well-watered/nutrient limited) were used to estimate FM model parameters. Unstressed individuals were used to initialize Bayesian parameter estimation. Posterior mean estimates yielded a close fit with data as observed assimilation (An) closely matched predicted (Ap) with mean standard error for all individuals ranging from 0.8 to 3.1 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Posterior parameter distributions of the unstressed individuals were combined and fit to distributions to establish species level Bayesian priors of FM parameters for testing stress responses. Species level distributions of unstressed group identified mean maximum rates of carboxylation standardized to 25° (Vcmax25) as 101.8 μmol m-2 s-1 (± 29.0) and mean maximum rates of electron transport standardized to 25° (Jmax25) as 319.7 μmol m-2 s-1 (± 64.4). These updated priors were used to test the response of drought and nutrient limitations on assimilation. In the well-watered/nutrient limited group a decrease of 28.0 μmol m-2 s-1 was observed in mean estimate of Vcmax25, a decrease of 27.9 μmol m-2 s-1 in Jmax25 and a decrease in quantum yield from 0.40 mol photon/mol e- in unstressed individuals to 0.14 in the nutrient limited group. In the drought/well-fertilized group a decrease was also observed in Vcmax25 and Jmax25. The genotype specific unstressed and stressed responses were then used to parameterize an ecosystem process model with application at the field scale to investigate mechanisms of stress response in B. rapa by testing a variety of functional forms to limit assimilation in hydraulic or nutrient limited conditions.",

            "abstract": "Arctic climate is sensitive to small concentrations of light-absorbing aerosols like black carbon, and hence the impacts of global climate change on aerosol transport to the Arctic are of interest. Here, we explore how climate warming under the RCP 8.5 scenario would impact Arctic aerosol distributions via changes in atmospheric transport and removal processes. We modify the bulk aerosol module in the Community Atmosphere Model to track distributions and fluxes of 200 black carbon-like tracers emitted from different locations, and we conduct idealized experiments with and without active aerosol deposition. Changing wind patterns, operating in isolation, cause the Arctic burdens of tracers emitted from East Asia and West Europe during winter to increase about 20-30% by the end of the century, while decreasing the Arctic burdens of North American emissions by 20-40%. These changes are caused by an altered winter polar dome structure that results from Arctic amplification and inhomogeneous sea-ice loss and surface warming, both of which are enhanced in the Chukchi Sea region. The resulting geostrophic wind favors Arctic transport of East Asian emissions while inhibiting poleward transport of North American emissions. When active deposition is also considered, however, Arctic burdens of emissions from northern mid-latitudes show near-universal decline. This is a consequence of increased precipitation and wet removal, particularly within the Arctic, leading to decreased Arctic residence time. Simulations with present-day emissions of black carbon indicate a 17% reduction in the Arctic annual-mean burden by the end of the 21st century, due to warming-induced transport and deposition changes.",

            "abstract": "During the autumn, leaf leachate plays a significant and influential role in a forested ecosystem’s hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles. As trees prepare for winter dormancy and future spring growth, they undergo resorption, senescence, and leaf abscission. How do these phenological changes affect the dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry of leaf leachates? Despite numerous studies into the factors that affect resorption efficiencies and the DOM signatures of leaf-litter leachate, little work has been done to look at the temporal effects of leaf-litter leachate on multiple watersheds in a region. In order to gain a better understanding of the physiological functional ecology of leaves in autumn in different watersheds, we examined changes in fluorescent DOM (FDOM) of Fagus grandifolia (American beech) leaf leachate from field sites in Maryland, Rhode Island, and Vermont. At each site, leaves were collected during three distinct phenological stages: fresh, senescing, and fresh litter. Leaves were collected at each site during their respective peaks for each phenological phase and then were sequentially measured, dried, and submerged in Nanopure deionized water. Leachate samples were analyzed for macronutrient concentrations and FDOM indexes, including specific ultraviolent absorbance at 254nm, humification index, spectral slope ratio, percent protein-like fluorescence, fluorescence index, and biological index. Preliminary results from Maryland suggest that, throughout autumn, the percent protein-like fluorescence and spectral slope ratio both decrease, fluorescence index remains relatively constant, and the humification index tends to increase. By investigating the temporal ecological roles of leaf-litter leachate in three different watersheds, we will be able to more accurately determine the effects of autumnal leaf changes on watersheds at the regional scale.",

However, coronagraphic observations from a single viewpoint are unable to detect all CMEs because they are limited by the properties of Thomson-scattered photospheric radiation by coronal electrons. To overcome this limitation and to extend the CME rate estimates beyond a single instrument, Webb & Howard (1994) formulated the “visibility function” as an instrument-specific calibration factor. Recently we have begun an investigation comparing visibility functions for SOHO LASCO, STEREO COR1/COR2, and the groundbased Mauna Loa Solar Observatory Mk3/Mk4 coronagraphs in order to extend the historical record of the CME rate. With the launch of the twin STEREO spacecraft in late 2006, we are able to use the combination of multiple instruments viewing from longitudinally-separated locations to obtain new estimates of the global CME rate. We provide a progress report on this activity.",

IMERG is a unified U.S. algorithm based on code from groups at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NOAA Climate Prediction Center, and Univ. of California Irvine’s Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing. Due to differing latency requirements from different classes of users, data sets are computed at 6 hours, 16 hours, and 3 months after observation time, referred to as Early, Late, and Final Runs, respectively. The Day-1 products cover the latitude band 60°N-S on a 0.1°x0.1°grid, with half-hourly data starting on 1 April 2015, 7 March 2015, and 10 March 2014 for the Early, Late, and Final, respectively.\nThe presentation will briefly outline the various data fields provided in the IMERG data files, including precipitation estimates and precipitation phase. The performance of the IMERG estimates will be discussed, including comparisons among the near-real-time “Early” and “Late” Runs and the research-quality “Final” Run. Early results show that IMERG is competitive with the current TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) estimates, even with the pre-GPM calibrations that are used in Day-1 IMERG and the input precipitation estimates. One important result is that the “morphed” data values have bulk difference statistics that are similar to the statistics for many of the individual sensors. In about March 2016 the GPM era will be reprocessed with improved, fully GPM-based algorithms. About a year later IMERG will be extended to cover the period 1998 to the present.

This paper has two main aims : (i) evaluate ISI-MIP2 Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) with regard to their capacity to reproduce observation-derived current global patterns in vegetation carbon residence time and (ii) compare spatial relationships of vegetation carbon residence time with climate in GVMs and observation.\nRecently, satellite-based measurements of biomass and eddy covariance-based estimates of gross primary production were combined to generate a contemporary snapshot of global ecosystem carbon residence times, henceforth 'observation-derived' data, by (Carvalhais et al., 2014). Emergent patterns and spatial relationships with few climatic variables, e.g. precipitation and temperature, were analysed. The vegetation component of this observation-derived data product is used here to evaluate global fields of current vegetation carbon residence time simulated by the ensemble of Global Vegetation Models that participated in the Inter-Sectoral Impat Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (ISI-MIP2). As well as, direct comparisons using simple statistics, spatial relationships between climatic forcings and simulated vegetation carbon residence times in the models and data are also investigated.\nFinally, building on the results of the previous two sections, data products for further model evaluation and key areas for model development are suggested.",

Three sites are being operated in pristine conditions, with atmospheric properties under natural biogenic conditions. These three sites named T0 are ATTO (Amazon Tall Tower Observatory), ZF2 and EMBRAPA. After the air masses are exposed to the Manaus plume, one site (called T2) is being operated under the direct influence of the Manaus plume at 5 Km downwind. Finally, at about 150 Km downwind of Manaus is the T3 Manacapuru site. Aerosol chemical composition is being analysed using filters for fine (PM2.5) and coarse mode aerosol as well as three Aerodyne ACSM (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors) instruments. Optical properties were measured with several AE33 aethalometers and MAAP, and multi wavelengths nephelometers. Aerosol size distribution is determined using scanning mobility particle sizers. The aerosol column is measures using AERONET sunphotometers before and after the Manaus plume, as well as several Lidar systems.\nThe three sites before the Manaus plume show remarkable similar variability in aerosol concentrations and optical properties. This pattern is very different at the T2 site, with large aerosol concentrations enhancing aerosol absorption and scattering significantly as a result of the Manaus pollution plume. The aerosol is very oxidized before being exposed to the Manaus plume, and this pattern changes significantly for T2 and T3 sites, with a much higher presence of less oxidized aerosol. Typical ozone concentrations at mid-day before Manaus plume is a low 10-12 ppb, value that changes to 50-70 ppb for air masses suffering the influence of Manaus plume. Aerosol size distribution also change significantly, with stronger presence of nucleation mode particles. A detailed comparison of aerosol characteristics and composition for the several sites will be presented together with air mass trajectories following the evolution of aerosol and trace gases in GoAmazon2014.\nResearch funded by INCT Global Change, CNPq and FAPESP.",

In this paper, three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection is investigated numerically for various values of the Rayleigh number and a fixed Prandtl number (corresponding to its value for convection in the Earth’s outer core).

            "abstract": "While cropping models represent the biophysical aspects of agricultural systems, system dynamics modelling offers the possibility of representing the socioeconomic (including social and cultural) aspects of these systems. The two types of models can then be coupled in order to include the socioeconomic dimensions of climate change adaptation in the predictions of cropping models.We develop a dynamically coupled socioeconomic-biophysical model of agricultural production and its repercussions on food security in two case studies from Guatemala (a market-based, intensive agricultural system and a low-input, subsistence crop-based system). Through the specification of the climate inputs to the cropping model, the impacts of climate change on the entire system can be analysed, and the participatory nature of the system dynamics model-building process, in which stakeholders from NGOs to local governmental extension workers were included, helps ensure local trust in and use of the model.However, the analysis of climate variability’s impacts on agroecosystems includes uncertainty, especially in the case of joint physical-socioeconomic modelling, and the explicit representation of this uncertainty in the participatory development of the models is important to ensure appropriate use of the models by the end users. In addition, standard model calibration, validation, and uncertainty interval estimation techniques used for physically-based models are impractical in the case of socioeconomic modelling. We present a methodology for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of coupled biophysical (cropping) and system dynamics (socioeconomic) agricultural models, using survey data and expert input to calibrate and evaluate the uncertainty of the system dynamics as well as of the overall coupled model. This approach offers an important tool for local decision makers to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change and their feedbacks through the associated socioeconomic system.",

            "abstract": "It is essential that developers have detailed knowledge of the tidal-stream energy resource. ROMS hydrodynamic models (~1 km resolution) of key areas in northwest Europe, were used to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of the tidal-stream resource. Currently, sites with peak spring tide velocities (M2 and S2 constituents) in excess of 2.5 m/s and water depths between 25 and 50 m are preferred. When assuming this so-called “1st generation” criteria, a limited resource with limited scope for long-term sustainability of the industry was calculated for the Irish Sea; a key area for UK development. Selecting sites that also included 20% lower velocities (>2 m/s) and deeper water locations (>25m) resulted in a seven-fold increase in the available resource (for the Irish Sea). Although new engineering challenges will be encountered (e.g. more wave exposed locations) by developing these 2nd generation tidal-stream energy sites (>2m/s and >25m), some oceanographic challenges would be improved. For example, the flood-ebb tidal flow is not typically rectilinear at 1st generation UK sites (a mean error from rectilinear of ~20° in this assumption), which is reduced to near-rectilinear flow (∼3° error) when including 2nd generation sites. Analysis of our northwest European model revealed more phase diversity is offered by developing lower tidal energy sites, allowing firm and constant electricity generation. Moreover, at 1st generation sites, we calculate significant, and unaccounted, variability in annual practical power generation. For example, mean peak spring tidal velocities can under-estimate the annual practical resource by up to 25%, for regions experiencing similar mean peak spring tidal velocities, due to the ratio of M2 and S2, together with the influence of other tidal constituents, such as K1 and O1. Therefore, based on prevalence, firm power and engineering challengers, we find a strong case for developing lower flow technologies.",

            "abstract": "Various propositions for the origin of meanders have been suggested in the past, involving local disturbances such as variable bank material, obstructions to flow, and sediment transport. Each of these approaches has required a very special and complex set of circumstances for the onset of meandering. However, meanders have also been observed in other systems such as the gulf stream , window glass , glacial meltwater, channels in submarine fans, the jet stream, water faucets, and many others. What has not been satisfactorily demonstrated is why some rivers (or parts of rivers) should tend to meander in the first place rather than ply a straight course to base level. We suggest that the fundamental cause of the river meander instability is simply a minimization of power (rate of work done), with an onset that occurs when inertial terms exceed body forces (e.g. gravity) acting on the flow, and thus create an adverse pressure gradient directed in the opposite direction of the flow. A simple way to visualize the cause of the instability is that the water “backs up” upon itself, running into a parcel of water downstream that is flowing more slowly than the water upstream. This causes the direction of maximum local water surface slope to be diverted to one side or the other of the regional slope. This can occur when a river encounters the ocean (or a lake, or a break in slope), and can occur in many other situations as well.\nWe analyzed various meandering systems globally, and conducted laboratory experiments under controlled conditions to determine the conditions necessary for the onset of the meander instability. The results indicate that the meander instability does not depend on sediment or erodible banks. The critical threshold for the onset of the meander instability occurs when inertial forces exceed body forces acting on the fluid such that an adverse pressure gradient arises. Better understanding of the meander instability should thus elucidate some of the processes and behavior of a range of fluid systems in the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, and at smaller scale in fluid jets and micro-scale water flows.",

In situ measurements of plant root OC exudation are relatively rare, and δ13C measurements of root exudates are generally lacking. Understanding both exudate fluxes and δ13C relative to other plant components, root characteristics and environmental parameters (e.g., vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture) will lead to better quantitative understanding of atmosphere—plant—soil linkages. We used a field based collection system to obtain root exudates from fine roots (diameter <5mm) over five sampling periods in a ~20 year old bottomland forest in central Ohio, USA. Exudates were analyzed for dissolved OC concentration and δ13C signatures. Exudate flux estimates were made at both the individual root level and also scaled to the entire sampling area. Preliminary data analysis suggests the mean root exudation rate was 26 µmol C g root -1 day-1 and when scaled to the 5600 m2 sampling area represents a mean flux of 4,200 µmol C m-2 day-1 from tree roots. The flux estimates presented here suggest root exudation may account for as much as 6% of net ecosystem production at the field location. Available data also suggests that exudate δ13C is enriched by 1-2 ‰ compared the root material from which exudates were collected. We will also assess the relationship between exudate, root and leaf δ13C, environmental parameters, and C fluxes at the site. If root exudation rate or δ13C varies as a function of environmental conditions this may suggest that heterotrophic remineralization of root exudates is one potential driver of correlations between soil δ13C-CO2 and environmental parameters.",

            "abstract": "On 7 Nov 2013 STEREO B was embedded in a magnetic-cloud (MC) like structure when an SEP event occurred reaching both STEREO spacecraft. The bi-drectional near relativistic electron distribution observed by STEREO B reveals such timing and relative intensity characteristics suggesting that the SEPs were injected separately into both loop legs of the MC. Observations by the Nancay Radioheliograph (NRH) of two distinct radio sources at the same time further support the above scenario. In order to derive the 3D morphology and average speed of the CME close to the Sun, we use the graduated cylindrical shell model (GCS) which is applied to the white-light coronagraph observations by the STEREO spacecraft and SOHO. Furthermore, a global magnetic topology model for magnetic clouds is applied to the in-situ measurements of the magnetic field. Both models suggest that the MC is strongly inclined with respect to the ecliptic yielding a north/south orientation. The energetic electron observations are used to probe the structure of the magnetic cloud: We determine the electron path lengths along both loop legs of the structure to infer the amount of field line twist inside the MC. The resulting path lengths are around 50% longer than the estimated lengths of the loop legs of the MC itself suggesting that the amount of field line winding is moderate.",

            "abstract": "The relatively fast transition from the warm Pliocene to the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) is puzzling. We have previously suggested that expansion of Antarctic glaciation following the mid-Pliocene warm period altered the oceanic circulation and inter-hemispheric transfer of heat and salt thereby providing a dynamic trigger for the intensification of the NHG at ~2.75 Ma and the ensuing glacial cycles (Woodard et al., 2014). Here we explore the hypothesis that enhanced chemical weathering under the warm Pliocene conditions contributed to the gradual cooling leading to the dynamic shift in ocean circulation. Using foraminiferal core-top and culture calibrations we have developed a new multi-elemental proxy approach for reconstructing changes in ocean calcium ([Ca]) and other major ion concentrations throughout the past ~3 Myr. Foraminiferal records from several drill sites in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggest that seawater [Ca] was ~20±5% higher during the mid-Pliocene period (~2.7-3.2 Ma) than at present, and gradually reaching modern seawater concentration by the early Pleistocene. Other seawater ion concentrations (e.g., Sr, Li, B) were also significantly higher at that time than at present. Correction for the estimated change in seawater Mg/Ca yields mid-Pliocene sea surface temperatures in the western equatorial Pacific ~1-2° warmer than today. We suggest that the higher seawater major-ion concentrations, reconstructed here, reflect enhanced chemical weathering, likely due to more intense tropical hydrologic cycle at that time. The implied increase in seawater alkalinity under the mid-Pliocene warm conditions could have acted to sequester atmospheric CO2 thus providing a negative feedback that possibly contributed to global cooling.\n",

            "abstract": "Ultrafine particles (UFPs) have an aerodynamic diameter less than 100 nanometre (nm). Their large surface areas per unit mass favor absorption of toxic chemicals in air. UFPs could penetrate deep into the respiratory or cardiovascular systems and pose adverse health effects. Recent studies showed the association between children exposure to UFPs and their systolic blood pressure. In urban environments, primary sources of UFPs are from road traffic emissions and account for most of the total particle numbers. Controls on UPFs rely on better understanding of their emission sources and environmental behaviour. Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change have monitored UFPs since 2010 at two near-road stations in Toronto by using TSI 3031 UFP monitors. One station is located in mixed residential and industrial area and 16 meters from a major road with over 20,000 vehicles per day. The other station is surrounded by mixed residential and commercial buildings and 20 meters from a major road with over 20,000 vehicles per day. UFPs concentrations were monitored using six size channels: 20-30nm, 30-50nm, 50-70nm, 70-100nm, 100-200nm, and 200-450nm. The TSI 3031 monitors generally performed well for long-term UFP monitoring. Multi-year measurements of UFPs at the two stations show no apparent inter-annual variation or seasonality. Smaller particles (i.e., 20-50 nm) were found to be composed of over 50% of the measured particles. The observations are generally consistent with the theoretical understanding of particle nuclei mode and accumulation mode. When air mass originated from road traffic, UFPs were elevated in morning traffic hours and to a less extent in the late afternoon. The elevated UFPs number concentrations coincided with other traffic-related air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and black carbon. Moreover, higher number concentrations were found on weekdays than weekends. The observations suggest that UFPs are mostly from vehicle emissions.",

In particular, its airborne gravity data in the area of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands (PRVI) made substantial improvements (~60%) on the precision of the geoid models at the local GNSS/Leveling bench marks in the target area. Fortunately, PRVI is free of the huge systematic error in the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Thus, the airborne contribution was evaluated more realistically. In addition, the airborne data picked up more detailed gravity field information in the medium wavelength band (spherical harmonic degree 200 to 600) that are largely beyond the resolution of the current satellite missions, especially along the nearby ocean trench areas. Under this circumstance (significant airborne contributions in the medium band), local surface gravity data need to be examined more carefully than before during merging with the satellite and airborne information for local geoid improvement, especially considering the well-known systematic problems in the NGS historical gravity holdings (Saleh et al 2013 JoG). Initial tests showed that it is very important to maintain high consistency between the surface data sets and the airborne enhanced reference model. In addition, a new aggregation method (Gerhards 2014, Inverse Problems) will also be tested to optimally combine the local surface data with the reference model. The data cleaning and combining procedures in the target area will be summarized here as reference for future applications.",

            "abstract": "This year, the USEPA reported no systemic problem with respect to pollution of potable waters by solutes or natural gas resulting from unconventional drilling for oil and gas, despite attempts by anti-fracking opponents to frighten the public about water pollution from rare circumstances (much as those who have cherry- picked climate data to suggest burning fossil fuels does not affect climate). Scientific “merchants of doubt” have figured out how to use peer-reviewed papers to advocate their bias, regardless of the side for which they advocate.\nI present a personal example. Prior to the EPA report, authors of a highly-cited peer-reviewed paper argued that more dissolved methane than usual should be expected in ground water located close to unconventional gas wells. This paper figured prominently in the New York State’s recent ban on fracking. To test the reproducibility of this conclusion, colleagues and I redid the study but by sampling ~13,000 NE Pennsylvania domestic wells, densely arrayed near ~800 gas wells. Not surprising, we found no systemic relationship between methane in drinking water and proximity to gas wells; failed gas wells actually are rare.\nThe peer reviewed system of publication has been broken for years, because of continual pressure to publish more to achieve academic success coupled to a flood of international submissions. Editors routinely have a difficult time finding senior scientists to agree to review papers, and so they wind up relying more on reviewers suggested by authors, who can and have gamed the peer review system through it. To resolve this problem, I suggest that journal editors be more far more draconian before releasing papers for review and that they enforce clear rubrics to insure that reviewers address reviews properly. Finally, conflict of interest disclosure needs to be clearer, since common assumption that bias inherently evolves from funded research outside of Federal and non-profit organizations, appears to be, at least to me, fundamentally flawed.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, wireless sensor network (WSN) emerges to collect Earth observation data at relatively low cost and light labor load, while its observations are still point-data. To learn the spatial distribution of a land surface parameter, interpolating the point data is necessary. Taking soil moisture (SM) for example, its spatial distribution is critical information for agriculture management, hydrological and ecological researches. This study developed a method to interpolate the WSN-measured SM to acquire the spatial distribution in a 5km*5km study area, located in the middle reaches of HEIHE River, western China. As SM is related to many factors such as topology, soil type, vegetation and etc., even the WSN observation grid is not dense enough to reflect the SM distribution pattern. Our idea is to revise the traditional Kriging algorithm, introducing spectral variables, i.e., vegetation index (VI) and abledo, from satellite imagery as supplementary information to aid the interpolation. Thus, the new Extended-Kriging algorithm operates on the spatial & spectral combined space. To run the algorithm, first we need to estimate the SM variance function, which is also extended to the combined space. As the number of WSN samples in the study area is not enough to gather robust statistics, we have to assume that the SM variance function is invariant over time. So, the variance function is estimated from a SM map, derived from the airborne CASI/TASI images acquired in July 10, 2012, and then applied to interpolate WSN data in that season. Data analysis indicates that the new algorithm can provide more details to the variation of land SM. Then, the Leave-one-out cross-validation is adopted to estimate the interpolation accuracy. Although a reasonable accuracy can be achieved, the result is not yet satisfactory. Besides improving the algorithm, the uncertainties in WSN measurements may also need to be controlled in our further work.",

The role of convective parameterizations at high horizontal resolution and their impacts on clouds, circulation, and precipitation processes represent large uncertainties in current-generation AGCMs. As the statistical equilibrium in which radiative cooling is balanced by convective heating, RCE offers a simplified framework to investigate such uncertainties.\nThe National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) is configured in a RCE setup that consists of an ocean-covered earth with diurnally varying, spatially uniform insolation with no rotation effects. CAM5 is run with the spectral element dynamics package at a standard resolution of approximately 111 km grid spacing. A series of simulations is performed in which the planetary radius is incrementally reduced. Because of the homogeneity of the RCE setup, the effect is to bring the grid points closer together, mimicking increased resolution without increasing the number of grid points (or computational expense). These simulations have horizontal grid spacing of 56 km, 28 km, 14 km, and 7 km; the last of which begins to approach cloud-system resolving scales. When compared to high-resolution simulations with CAM5, the results suggest that the reduced Earth approach is able to reproduce the behavior of convection at reduced computational cost. At grid spacing less than 20 km, convective motions are predominantly produced by resolved scales.",

Radial anisotropy displays an age independent positive gradient, that may correspond to a shallow discontinuity at ~70km depth. This is at odds with the view of a mechanical and age dependent LAB, expected to roughly follow the isotherms. To model the development of seismic anisotropy in oceanic basins, and its potential implications for the interpretation of the G discontinuity, we use the model of lattice preferred orientation (LPO) evolution D-Rex, coupled with a two dimensional model of a plate-driven flow in a fluid with a viscosity depending mainly on stress and temperature. We perform a systematic investigation of the influence on seismic anisotropy of the parameters controlling olivine LPO development. We find that the fraction of deformation accommodated by dislocation creep relative to diffusion creep, the strength of the slip systems involved in plastic deformation, and the efficiency of dynamic recrystallization are key parameters for the production of seismic anisotropy. For a wide range of parameters, the predicted radial anisotropy displays an age independent positive gradient near the depth of the G discontinuity. We thus conclude that this is an ubiquitus characteristic of the seismic anisotropy produced by the 2-D plate driven flow in oceanic basins. If not excluded, no additional ingredients such as partial melting, or change in water content are thus required to explain the radial anisotropy pattern near the LAB.",

            "abstract": "Tropical dry forests have long been used by humans. Has it been sustainable? Not in the southern Yucatan. Biomass accumulation declines with each cycle of shifting cultivation with implications for both internal recycling of nutrients and external inputs of nutrients. We detail the evidence for a decline in P inputs from biomass burning (aboveground biomass, litter, and coarse woody debris), an increase in leaching losses from deep soils, and a decline in atmospheric inputs of new P from Saharan dust following the transition from mature to secondary forest. Canopy trapping of dust is critical to maintaining P balance in this system. Effective trapping is diminished by changes in the structure of secondary forest--loss of height, leaf area and basal area. Experimental studies show that it is atmospheric transport of dust, not microbial shedding or leaching from live tissues, that explains the difference between throughfall P and P in bulk deposition. Because of net losses in P, uptake of carbon during regrowth is slower with each cycle of shifting cultivation. As much of the tropics has moved beyond a mature forest frontier, the decline in carbon sequestration is likely widespread over both dry and wet forests. The terrestrial carbon sink in the tropics may be declining. The capacity to sequester carbon through afforestation, reforestation and restoration has certainly diminished over time, limiting the effectiveness of such efforts to help mitigate climate change.",

It erupted from August 29th, 2014 to February 27th, 2015 outside the ice cap after a ca. 50 km long dike had formed, mainly in the subsurface beneath the ice. Both the dike formation and the following effusive eruption were accompanied by continuous, harmonic tremor and tremor bursts. During the eruption these tremor bursts were interpreted as magma-ice interaction, flowing water and magma. This analysis was mainly based on the seismic frequency content and amplitude distributions on the regional seismic network. It was sometimes supported by the detection of cauldrons in the ice on subsequent days.\n Here we analyse the tremor using three seven-element arrays south- and northwest of the glacier cap (Jökulheimar, Innri Eyrar and Urðarháls). Using array analysis we can better constrain event locations, estimate tremor migration speed and use wavefield slowness tohelp estimate the source depth which can help to constrain the source type.\nWe show that the backazimuths of the main harmonic tremor with dominant energy around 1 Hz correlate well with the extent of the growing lavafield for at least 27 days. Another one day long harmonic tremor episode contained energy up to 5 Hz but dominant at 1 to 2 Hz. The source was located beneath the ice and moved upwards and horizontally (about 42 deg). We compare it to tremor during smaller floods underneath the glacier and discuss a moving water or magma front as source.\nElastic full wavefield simulations in models including ice thickness and ice basal topography allow us to strip out path effects thus yielding information about the tremor sources. Indications are that (i) parts of the dike were still evolving well after it had been breached by advancing magma and (ii) that eruptive lava is a significant source of seismic tremor.",

The Sq amplitude was the smallest around the minimum of solar cycle 23/24 in 2008－2009. This significant depression implies that the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation responsible for ionization of the upper atmosphere decreased during this solar cycle minimum. In order to examine a global distribution of the long-term trend in the Sq amplitude, we derived the residual Sq amplitude from the deviation from the fitting curve between the solar F10.7 index and Sq amplitude. As a result, a majority of the trends in the residual Sq amplitude showed negative values over a wide region. This tendency was relatively strong in Europe, India, the eastern part of Canada, and New Zealand. Moreover, we estimate the neutral wind in the lower thermosphere from the Sq amplitude and height-integrated ionospheric conductivity in order to know the physical mechanism of the long-term trend in the residual Sq amplitude. As a result, the estimated thermospheric zonal and meridional winds showed a seasonal variation with a period of one year or less, but the solar activity dependence was unclear. This result suggests that the solar cycle dependence of the Sq amplitude may be mainly attributed to the variation of the ionospheric conductivity.",

            "abstract": "All Venus Express (VEX) instruments delivered their data products according to the Planetary Data System version 3 (PDS3) standard, and the atmospheric drag experiment (ADE) data was no exception. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Planetary Science Archive (PSA), which can be accessed at\nwww.rssd.esa.int/PSA\n, is being upgraded to make PDS4 data available from newer missions such as ExoMars and BepiColombo. Thus, the PSA development team has been working to ensure that the legacy PDS3 data will be accessible via the new interface as well. We will preview some of the new methods of accessing legacy VEX data via the new interface, with a focus being placed on the ADE data set. We will show how the ADE data can be accessed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and our plans for making this and other data sets compatible with the Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access (VESPA) project for creating a virtual observatory.\n From February 2010 through March 2014, ESA’s Venus Express mission conducted 11 ADE campaigns. During these observation campaigns, VEX’s pericenter was in the range of 165 to 190 km, while the spacecraft was near Venus’ North pole, and the entire spacecraft was used to make in situ measurements of the atmospheric density. This was done by rotating the solar panels in a manner that somewhat resembles a windmill. Also, VEX ‘s attitude and orbit control system was tasked with maintaining the spacecraft in a 3-axis stabilized mode during these pericenter passes. The torques that the reaction wheels had to exert to maintain this attitude were then analyzed to yield density readings.",

            "abstract": "Climate instability during the last million years of the Cretaceous (67-66 Ma) is still poorly documented and not well understood. One of the reasons for this is that in deep time, different proxies are likely to yield different temperatures. This is because the application of calibrations based on present day temperature proxy relationships is affected by source organism evolution, differences in ocean chemistry and non-analogue processes. Only by combining temperature estimates derived from different, independent proxies, the problems with individual proxies can be cancelled out. A quantitative, multi-proxy temperature record from the latest Cretaceous therefore may provide a better insight in climate changes across this time interval. For such a multi-proxy research, sediments are required that yield both well-preserved foraminiferal calcite as well as organic biomarkers. Very few sites are known to provide such sedimentary records, but ODP Leg 174AX Site Bass River (New Jersey Shelf) has proven to be an excellent archive for paleotemperature reconstructions for the Cretaceous and Paleogene. We here present a multi-proxy, quantitative paleotemperature reconstruction of the last million years of the Cretaceous of the Bass River core. Benthic and planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and δ18O were determined, as well as the organic geochemical sea surface temperature proxy TEX86. This resulted in a unique coupled surface and bottom water temperature record of the latest Cretaceous. Our data suggest a ~2-6 ˚C bottom water warming and a ~4-6 ˚C surface water warming approximately 300 kyr before the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, followed by a cooling trend across the boundary. This warming event appears to coincide with the main phase of the Deccan Traps eruptions and therefore probably represents a global event.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes in the North Atlantic region during the last glacial cycle were dominated by the slow waxing and waning of the North American ice sheet as well as by intermittent Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. However prior to the last deglaciation, little is known about the response of North American vegetation to such rapid climate changes and especially about the response of biomass burning, an important factor for regional changes in radiative forcing. Here we present continuous, high-resolution ammonium (NH4+) records derived from the NGRIP and GRIP ice cores, where background NH4+ concentrations in the ice document North American ammonia emissions from soils while wildfire derived NH4+ peaks superimposed on the background concentrations allow to reconstruct changes in North American wildfire frequency over the last 110,000 yr.\nSoil emissions increased on orbital timescales with warmer climate, related to the northward expansion of vegetation due to reduced ice-covered areas. During Marine Isotope Stage 3 DO warm events, a significantly higher fire recurrence rate is recorded, while ammonia soil emissions rose only slowly during longer interstadial warm periods, in line with slow ice sheet shrinkage and delayed ecosystem changes. Our results indicate that sudden warming events had little impact on NH4+ aerosol production from soil emissions and on NH4+ aerosol transport to Greenland during the glacial but triggered a significant increase in the frequency of fire occurrence.",

The main assumptions behind this methodology are that climate variables (such as temperature or precipitation) are linked a large-scale atmospheric predictand, which is usually taken as sea-level pressure, and that such predictands recur through time. They offer a possibility to estimate probability distributions of a climate variable, conditional to patterns of atmospheric circulation. In addition, this methodology allows the quantification of unusual weather patterns that have been observed. I will represent a way to use analogues of circulation for the detection/attribution of extreme events of precipitation and temperature. This approach will be illustrated on test cases, including the warm European winter of 2006/2007, the extremes of precipitation over Southern UK and northwestern France in January 2014, and the European summer of 2015. I will show how this analysis provides a low-cost estimate of the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) for extreme events that verify the above mentioned hypotheses.

            "abstract": "The radiogenic heat production as well as the secular cooling is essential in order to better understand the thermal history and dynamics in the Earth. Potassium is thought to be one of the important radioactive elements in the Earth’s interior. Although these elements are concentrated in the continental and oceanic crusts due to chemical differentiations through partial melting at plate boundaries due to their large ion-radii, they have been considered to return into the deep mantle accompanied with subducting slab through time . However, since there are few studies on host minerals of potassium in the high P,T condition, it has yet to be clear how much and where host rocks of such radioactive elements exist in the Earth. Hence, it is important to understand the fate of the potassium-bearing phase subducted into the deep Earth’s interior. Here we have studied the high-pressure stability and elasticity of KMg2Al5SiO12 hexagonal aluminous phase (K-Hex with three different size of cation cites, by means of the density functional computation method. Results indicate that the K-Hex phase remains mechanically stable up to 150 GPa and also energetically more stable than an isochemical form with the calcium-ferrite (K-CF) and calcium-titanate (K-CT) type structure with two different size of cation cites. In addition, when the spinel composition coexists with the K-hollandite (K-Hol) phase, which is ), which is considered to be able to host potassium the K-Hex phase becomes more stable than the K-Hol phase at pressures above ~27 GPa. These demonstrate that the Hex phase is substantially stable in the lower mantle, suggesting that it could be a potential host of potassium and other incompatible large-ion elements.",

The mission will investigate the plasma and magnetic structure of the Martian ionosphere, including transient plasma structures, magnetic field structure and dynamics, and energetic particle activity. The transit plan calls for a piggy back ride with Mars 2020 using a CAT burn for MOI, the first demonstration of CubeSat propulsion for interplanetary travel. MarsCAT will make correlated multipoint studies of the ionosphere and magnetic field of Mars. Specifically, the two spacecraft will make in situ observations of the plasma density, temperature, and convection in the ionosphere of Mars. They will also make total electron content measurements along the line of sight between the two spacecraft and simultaneous 3-axis local magnetic field measurements in two locations. Additionally, MarsCAT will demonstrate the performance of new CubeSat telemetry antennas designed at the University of Houston that are designed to be low profile, rugged, and with a higher gain than conventional monopole (whip) antennas. The two MarsCAT CubeSats will have five science instruments: a 3-axis DC magnetometer, adouble-Langmuir probe, a Faraday cup, a solid state energetic particle detector (Science Enhancement Option), and interspacecraft total electron content radio occulation experiment. The MarsCAT spacecraft will be solar powered and equipped with a CAT thruster that can provide up to 4.8 km/s of delta-V, which is sufficient to achieve Mars orbit using the Mars 2020 piggyback. They have an active attitude control system, using a sun sensor and flight-proven star tracker for determination, and momentum wheels for 3-axis attitude control.",

Much work has been done to understand the barriers to action, but these largely overlook the need to frame the discussion in terms of stakeholder values and co-create innovative solutions that meet their individual needs. A partnership-based effort in the upper Midwest and Northeast called the Climate Change Response Framework (CCRF;\nwww.forestadaptation.org\n) ensures relevance, breadth, and credibility of its products through stakeholder inclusion at all levels. The fundamental role of the CCRF is to help people meet their land stewardship goals while minimizing climate risk. This represents a subtle but important shift in focus to people and their values, as opposed to climate change and its effects. The CCRF uses a climate planning tool, the Adaptation Workbook (\nwww.adaptationworkbook.org\n), along with ecosystem vulnerability assessments and a diverse “menu” of adaptation approaches to generate site-specific adaptation actions that meet explicit conservation objectives. These tools are integrated into an Adaptation Planning and Practices workshop that leads organizations through this structured process of designing adaptation tactics for their projects and plans. All of these tools were developed with stakeholders, or in response to their direct and continuing feedback. The CCRF has involved thousands of people and over 100 organizations, published six ecoregional vulnerability assessments with more than 130 authors, and generated more than 125 intentional adaptation demonstrations in real-world land management projects on federal, state, tribal, county, conservancy, and private lands. The CCRF contributes strongly to the USDA Regional Climate Hubs, working on the applied end of the continuum of climate services occupied by providers such as the CSCs, LCCs, RISAs, and RCCs.",

This part of the atmosphere is highly sensitive to waves propagating upwards from the troposphere, either as pressure perturbations (gravity and acoustic waves) or electromagnetic perturbations from lightning discharges (resulting in EMPs, sprites, elves, etc.). These perturbations can affect the temperature, wind, species concentration, and even ionization in the upper atmosphere.\nVery low frequencies (VLF) radio signals, generated by man-made communication transmitters, have been recorded using ground-based VLF receivers in Israel. These radio waves propagate over long distances within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, reflected off the Earth's surface and the D-region. The characteristics of the received signals depend on several parameters along the path, but are fairly constant over short periods of time. In this study we present analysis of VLF narrowband data transmitted from Sicily, Italy, spanning one year, and detected in Tel Aviv, Israel. We show observations of the interaction between both pressure and EM perturbations from thunderstorms with the narrowband VLF data aloft. We clearly observe short period (~2-4 minutes) acoustic waves, longer period gravity waves (~5-7 minutes periods), while also many transient events related to heating and ionization of the D-region. Comparisons with WWLLN lightning data show the link between tropospheric thunderstorms and D-region variability.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, declines in water and soil quality have been observed in areas of Brazil where no-till agriculture had been previously implemented. Poor soil management associated with the absence of public policies has caused soil erosion, because many farmers are moving back from no-till to traditional cultivation for faster economic gains. A research project - SoloVivo Project - leaded by Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation) in partnership with Itaipu Binacional aims to develop and validate, in a participatory way, tools to evaluate the technical performance of soil and water management at the rural properties that practice no-till agriculture. In this context we have selected two paired small (< 100 ha) catchments in the Paranapanema region, São Paulo State, where no-till management is practiced at two different degrees of effectiveness. In the figure bellow it can be seen a scene of one of the two studied catchments. For monitoring rainfall, soil solution and stream water, each catchment will be equipped with a programmable datalogger (with cell phone communication for data collection) linked to: a high intensity tipping bucket rain gage; a reflectometer to monitor soil volumetric water content, bulk electric conductivity and temperature; a radar water level sensor; a turbidity sensor; and an electric conductivity-temperature probe. We expect that stream flow and sediment generation, besides water quality (measured by conductivity) may serve as indicators of the benefits of no-tillage agriculture done more or less well. The results of this study will be used to stimulate discussions at workshops with the farmers who participate in a rural producers association in the region. In addition this and other results can be used to help the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA) decide about applying no-till agricultural management systems in its programs of payment for environmental services.",

Land surface water index (LSWI), calculated as a normalized ratio between near infra-red (NIR) and short wave infra-red (SWIR), is sensitive to vegetation and soil water content. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the information rendered from LSWI can be used for drought monitoring under various land covers and soil types of Oklahoma. We used a LSWI-based drought monitoring algorithm to assess summer drought in 113 Oklahoma Mesonet stations. Drought duration and intensity were estimated based on duration of LSWI < 0 (DNLSWI) during summer months (Jun-Aug) and results were compared with the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). Results of LSWI analysis for the period of 2000-2013 revealed a strong correlation (r2= 0.61 – 0.68) and dynamics between LSWI anomalies and summer rainfall anomalies in drought years (2001, 2006, 2011, and 2012). The DNLSWI tracked the longitudinal gradient of summer rainfall in Oklahoma. The LSWI-based drought intensity analysis showed a consistent trend that higher drought intensity tends to have lower LSWI values and lower intensity drought tends to have higher LSWI values regardless of land covers and soil types. However, the accuracy for different drought classes varied substantially from 32% (D2 class) to 77 % (0 and D0 class). Results showed that drought intensity increased as the DNLSWI became longer.

Results also demonstrated that by counting DNLSWI (in days), drought intensity thresholds can be established and used as a simple complementary tool in several drought applications which have currently used a relatively complex, resource intensive USDM drought intensity classification.",

            "abstract": "Reduced visibility can be an indicator of poor air quality. Moreover, degradation in visibility can be hazardous to human safety; for example, low visibility can lead to accidents particularly during the winter season when fogs are prevalent. Here, we explore the combined influence of aerosol characteristics and meteorology on long-term visibility. We use visibility data from eight meteorological stations, situated in the UK, which have been running since the 1950s. The site locations include urban, rural and marine environments.\nMost stations show a long term trend of visibility increase, which is indicative of reductions in aerosol pollution, especially in urban areas. Additionally, results at all sites show a very clear dependence on relative humidity, indicating the importance of aerosol hygroscopicity on the ability of aerosols to scatter radiation and hence impact upon visibility. The dependence of visibility on other meteorological parameters (e.g. wind speed, wind direction) is also investigated.\nTo explain the long term visibility trends and their dependence on meteorological conditions, a light extinction model was constructed incorporating the concentrations and composition of historic aerosol. The lack of historic aerosol size distributions and aerosol composition data, which determine hygroscopicity and refractive index, leads to an under-constrained model. Aerosol measurements from the last 10 years are used to constrain these model parameters, and hence their historical variation can be estimated; sensitivity analyses are used to estimate errors for the time period before regular aerosol measurements are available.\nThis work has generated a unique 60 year data set with which to understand how aerosol concentration and composition has varied over the UK. The model is applicable and easily transferrable to other data sets worldwide. Hence, different clean air legislation can be assessed for its effectiveness in reducing aerosol pollution. The implications for the UK will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "It is now recognized that slow slip events on plate-boundary fault zones occur not only downdip of the seismogenic zone, but also updip within several km from the seafloor. These shallower events are advantageous because the fault material can be sampled by drilling, and in-situ conditions can be replicated in the laboratory. We report here on results of laboratory friction experiments investigating fault zone material sampled during Ocean Drilling Program and International Ocean Drilling Program expeditions to subduction zones in Japan and Costa Rica. We employ laboratory conditions of 7-16 MPa effective stress and ~20 °C simulating ~1-2.5 km burial depth. Additionally, we shear the samples at plate convergence rates of less than 10 cm/yr.\nWhen driven at plate convergence rates, friction perturbations analogous to slow slip events are sometimes observed. In plate-boundary fault zone samples from the Tohoku region at the Japan Trench, these events exhibit stress drops of 3-7% over several hours with a maximum slip rate of 10-25 cm/yr under 7 MPa effective normal stress. Increasing the effective normal stress to 16 kPa results in a corresponding increase in stress drop up to 15% and slip rates up to 57 cm/yr, consistent with critical stiffness theory which predicts that increasing effective normal stress decreases frictional stability. A sample from the plate boundary décollement from the Costa Rica margin exhibited similar slow slip behavior, with stress drops of 3-12% and maximum slip velocities up to 16 cm/yr. This sample is described as a hemipelagic clay, whereas a sample of nannofossil chalk from the same region did not exhibit such behavior. For the Nankai Trough offshore Japan, samples from the megasplay fault zone and décollement did not exhibit the slow slip events observed in the Japan Trench and Costa Rica samples. Analyses of velocity-stepping data from these tests indicate a propensity for velocity-weakening frictional behavior at slow rates. Collectively, our results demonstrate that plate-rate shearing rates in the laboratory can replicate the full range of frictional phenomena on shallow subduction megathrusts. Specifically, slow slip events can be generated and their characteristics depend on sample composition as well as testing conditions.",

This presentation will discuss the various forms of those efforts in relation to best practices as well as lessons learned and evaluation data. Examples include:\nGPM partnered with the Global Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program to conduct a student precipitation field campaign in early 2015. Students from around the world collected precipitation data and entered it into the GLOBE database, then were invited to develop scientific questions to be answered using ground observations and satellite data available from NASA. Webinars and blogs by scientists and educators throughout the campaign extended students’ and teachers’ knowledge of ground validation, data analysis, and applications of precipitation data.\nTo prepare teachers to implement the new Next Generation Science Standards, the NASA Goddard Earth science education and outreach group, led by GPM Education Specialists, held the inaugural Summer Watershed Institute in July 2015 for 30 Maryland teachers of 3rd-5th grades. Participants in the week-long in-person workshop met with scientists and engineers at Goddard, learned about NASA Earth science missions, and were trained in seven protocols of the GLOBE program. Teachers worked collaboratively to make connections to their own curricula and plan for how to implement GLOBE with their students. \nAdding the arts to STEM, GPM is producing a comic book story featuring the winners of an anime character contest held by the mission during 2013. Readers learn content related to the science and technology of the mission as well as applications of the data. The choice of anime/manga as the style for the comic book reflects the international and cross-cultural aspect of the GPM as a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. A limited run print version of the initial comic book is planned for Fall 2015, with an online version and supplemental resources such as a teacher guide available on the GPM education website.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is a short-lived climate forcing pollutant that is detrimental to human health and crop growth. Reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight produce ozone. Ozone production is a non-linear function of the concentrations of both NOx and VOC, with VOC acting as the “fuel” for ozone production and NOx as the “catalyst”. Different VOC, due to their differing structure and carbon content, have different maximum potential to produce ozone. Due to different degrees of reactivity, VOC also differ in the time taken to reach this maximum ozone production potential under ideal conditions. Ozone production is also influenced by meteorological factors such as radiation, temperature, advection and mixing, which may alter the rate of ozone production, and the degree to which VOC are able to reach their maximum ozone production potential. Identifying the chemical and meteorological processes responsible for controlling the degree to which VOC are able to reach their maximum ozone production potential could inform decisions on emission control to efficiently tackle high levels of tropospheric ozone.\nIn this study we use a boxmodel to determine the chemical processes affecting ozone production under different meteorological and chemical conditions. The chemistry scheme used by the boxmodel is “tagged” for each initial VOC enabling attribution of ozone production to its VOC source. We systematically vary a number of meteorological parameters along with the source of NOx within the box model to simulate a range of atmospheric conditions. These simulations are compared with a control simulation done under conditions of maximum ozone formation to determine which parameters affect the rate at which VOC produce ozone and the extent to which they reach their maximum potential to produce ozone. We perform multi-day simulations in order to examine whether these processes can influence ozone production over timescales relevant to regional-scale ozone production.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between climate variability and precipitation in several urban areas throughout the United States are developed using various global climate indices. Precipitation data for over 1200 stations are obtained from the United States Historical Climatology Network maintained by the National Climate Data Center, NOAA. All data are averaged over an extended period (up to five years) and correlated to several climate indices averaged over a period of equal length using lag times also up to five years. The period length and lag time are optimized in order to produce the highest correlation. The index that best correlates with precipitation for each urban area analyzed in the current study is identified and used to create regions within the United States that are predominantly affected by a particular index; strong correlations (r2 values > 0.70) were found in all regions. The final result is a map of the United States that displays the spatial distribution of each region. These results, which include the specific relationships developed for each region and urban area, will not only allow a greater understanding of the major mechanisms that are responsible for rainfall variability throughout the United States, but will also result in improved predictability of precipitation over multiple time scales, including seasonal and annual. In addition, the ability to predict total rainfall for periods greater than one year will allow an estimate of the persistence of trends and extreme events, such as periods of drought or above-average rainfall, to be made in advance; how far these projections can be made in advance depends on the lag times used to create each site-specific and regional correlation.

            "abstract": "The Indus Submarine Fan is the largest repository of clastic sediment eroded from the Western Himalayas since the start of India-Eurasia collision likely around 50 Ma. This sedimentary archiveis central to understanding how the climate and the tectonic evolution of the mountains have evolved together. A number of models now propose linkages between surface processes, controlled by climatic influences, and the tectonics of the solid Earth. In particular, exhumation of deeply-buried high-grade metamorphic rocks in the Greater Himalaya and the development of large-scale duplexes within the Lesser Himalaya are likely triggered by changes in the rate and location of erosion. Although some of these issues can be addressed by studies onshore, erosion has removed much of the older record from the crystalline basement itself. As a result the sediment record must be used to understand how fast erosion was occurring and whether that was linked to changes in tectonics and climate. A major unconformity in the foreland basin means that this work cannot be done fully using terrestrial records but rather the more complete records in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Drilling by International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 355 in the Eastern Arabian Sea has recovered two sections spanning the last ~11 Ma, which should allow us to reconstruct how the Western Himalaya have responded to climate change since the late Miocene, spanning the time when the Lesser Himalaya began to exhume. Autocyclic processes within the fan and a major mass transport deposit mean that the record is not continuous, but should nonetheless allow us to examine the impact of the important climatic transition at 7–8 Ma noted on the Oman margin and in the foreland basin. Initial results indicate that the Indus Fan was receiving material from Himalayan high-grade metamorphic rocks since at least ca. 14-17 Ma and that there was a direct connection with the suture, likely close to the western syntaxis, dating from the late Miocene.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of pressure buildup can provide explicit information on reservoir integrity and is an appealing tool, however pressure variation is dependent on a variety of factors causing high uncertainty in pressure predictions. This work evaluated pressurization of a reservoir system in the presence of leakage pathways as well as exploring the effects of compartmentalization of the reservoir utilizing design of experiments (Definitive Screening, Box Behnken, Central Composite, and Latin Hypercube designs) and response surface methods. Two models were developed, 1) an idealized injection scenario in order to evaluate the performance of multiple designs, and 2) a complex injection scenario implementing the best performing design to investigate pressurization of the reservoir system. A holistic evaluation of scenario 1, determined that the Central Composite design would be used for the complex injection scenario. The complex scenario evaluated 5 risk factors: reservoir, seal, leakage pathway and fault permeabilities, and horizontal position of the pathway. A total of 60 response surface models (RSM) were developed for the complex scenario with an average R2 of 0.95 and a NRMSE of 0.067. Sensitivity to the input factors was dynamic through space and time; at the earliest time (0.05 years) the reservoir permeability was dominant, and for later times (>0.5 years) the fault permeability became dominant for all locations. The RSM’s were then used to conduct a Monte Carlo Analysis to further analyze pressurization risks, identifying the P10, P50, P90 values. This identified the in zone (lower) P90 values as 2.16, 1.77, and 1.53 MPa and above zone values of 1.35, 1.23, 1.09 MPa for monitoring locations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In summary, the design of experiments and response surface methods allowed for an efficient sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to be conducted permitting a complete evaluation of the pressurization across the entire parameter space.",

Due to their high penetrating power these muons can be used to image the content (primarily density) of matter they pass through. They have already been used to image the structure of pyramids, volcanoes and other objects. Their applications can be extended to investigating the structure of, and monitoring changes in geological formations and repositories, in particular deep subsurface sites with stored CO2.\nCurrent methods of monitoring subsurface CO2, such as repeat seismic surveys, are episodic and require highly skilled personnel to operate. Our simulations based on simplified models have previously shown that muon tomography could be used to continuously monitor CO2 injection and migration and complement existing technologies.\nHere we present a simulation of the monitoring of CO2 plume evolution in a geological reservoir using muon tomography. The stratigraphy in the vicinity of the reservoir is modelled using geological data, and a numerical fluid flow model is used to describe the time evolution of the CO2 plume. A planar detection region with a surface area of 1000 m2 is considered, at a vertical depth of 776 m below the seabed. We find that one year of constant CO2 injection leads to changes in the column density of about 1%, and that the CO2 plume is already resolvable with an exposure time of less than 50 days. The attached figure show a map of CO2 plume in angular coordinates as reconstructed from observed muons.\nIn parallel with simulation efforts, a small prototype muon detector has been designed, built and tested in a deep subsurface laboratory. Initial calibrations of the detector have shown that it can reach the required angular resolution for muon detection.

Carbon isotopes, however, make it clear that the recent rise is not simply a resumption of the dramatic rise in the 1900s, but that other causes are at play, and that multiple fluxes may be interacting to yield the observed rise. At the same time, cautious attention is focused on the Arctic, where vast stores of carbon are poised for release as frozen soils melt, and some of that carbon will be released as methane.

            "abstract": "We are investigating the effects of earthquakes on the sedimentary record in the Ionian Sea through the analysis of turbidite deposits. A comparison between radiometric dating and historical earthquake catalogs suggests that turbidite emplacement triggered by great earthquakes represents over 90% of the deposits in this region. Although the average recurrence time of single events is about 500 yrs, age modelling indicates that their occurrence is not periodic, but rather varies between 100 and 700 yrs with clusters of higher frequency. Seismic reflection images show that some turbidite beds are very thick and marked by acoustic transparent homogenite mud layers at their top. Based on a high resolution study of the most recent of such megabeds, the Homogenite/Augias turbidite (HAT), we show that it was triggered by a catastrophic event, the AD 365 Crete earthquake. Radiometric dating support a scenario of synchronous deposition of the HAT in an area as wide as 100.000 km2, suggesting basin-scale sediment remobilization processes. The HAT (up to 25 m thick) is made of classic stacked and graded sand/silt units with different compositions related to the Malta, Calabria and Sicilian margins. This composition suggests multiple synchronous slope failures typical of seismo-turbidites; however, the Crete earthquake source is too distant from the Italian margins to cause sediment failures by earthquake shaking. Consequently, we propose that the HAT is a deep-sea “tsunamite” deposit. This megabed, together with other turbidites triggered by italian tsunamigenic earthquakes (i.e. AD 1908 Messina, 1693 Catania and 1169 Sicily), is being studied to define differences and similarities with the better known deposits triggered by direct seismic shaking. Textural, micropaleontological, geochemical and mineralogical signatures reveal that such turbidites show cyclic ordered series of sediment units suggesting discontinuities in deposition processes. Utilizing the expanded stratigraphy of the HAT, and the heterogeneity of the sediment sources of the Ionian margins, we are trying to unravel the relative contribution of seismic shaking (sediment failures, MTDs, turbidity currents) and of tsunami wave loading (overwash surges, backwash flows, turbidity currents) for seismo-turbidite generation.",

We use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to compute the displacement field between successive optical images acquired by multiple fixed cameras with clear views of the dome. The results of the these calculations are compared to the occurrence of seismic events.\nA systematic time-series DIC analysis of image pairs showed no sharp changes in the dome morphology during periods without seismic events. However, the results reveal that the steady dome growth at Mount St. Helens was interrupted by short term displacements reaching magnitudes on the order of a meter. These displacements are only observed in association with low frequency, large magnitude seismic events, followed by tremor with frequencies between 5 Hz and likely exceeding 30 Hz. For selected events that coincide with the timing of the acquisition of an accurate DEM of the crater floor, we reproject the displacement fields obtained from two cameras onto the topography. This enables 3D displacement vectors to be derived, showing that the co-seismic deformation is marked by subsidence of the dome in a segmented fashion, the central region displaying mainly vertical motion, while the displacements on the talus are more slope-parallel.\nThe exact relationship between the recorded seismic energy and the observed deformation of the dome can not be resolved because the cameras were only sampling every 15 – 60 minutes. However, our analysis suggests that the processes that give rise to the low frequency earthquakes, the tremor and deformation of the dome, are closely linked. We believe the tremor is recording the gravity-driven subsidence of the upper parts of the dome due to mobilization and evacuation of fluids from discrete cracks, occuring during or triggered by the generation of the leading low frequency earthquake.",

            "abstract": "While one objective of data management systems is to provide the units when annotating the collected data, another is that the units must be correctly manipulated during conversion steps. This is not a trivial task however and the units conversion time and errors for large datasets can be quite expensive. To date, more than a dozen Python modules have been developed to deal with units attached to quantities. However, they fall short in many ways and also suffer from not integrating with a units controlled vocabulary. Moreover, none of them permits the encoding of some complex units defined in the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc.’s Observations Data Model (CUAHSI ODM) as a vectorial representation for storage demand reduction and does not incorporate provision to accommodate unforeseen standards-based units.\nWe developed HydroUnits, a Python-based units management tool for three specific purposes: encoding of physical units in the Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) as defined in the IEEE 1451.0 standard, performing dimensional analysis and on-the-fly conversion of time series allowing users to retrieve data from a data source in a desired equivalent unit while accommodating unforeseen and user-defined units. HydroUnits differentiates itself to existing tools by a number of factors including the implementation approach adopted, the adoption of standard-based units naming conventions and more importantly the emphasis on units controlled vocabularies which are a critical aspect of units treatment. Additionally, HydroUnits supports unit conversion for quantities with additive scaling factor, and natively supports time series conversion and takes leap years into consideration for units consisting of the time dimension (e.g., month, minute). Due to its overall implementation approach, HydroUnits exhibits a high level of versatility that no other tool we are aware of has achieved. ",

Our research obtains some new results of zircon U-Pb, Hf isotopic data, and whole rock major and trace elements geochemical data of the intermediate (diorite porphyry) to acid (granite porphyry) dykes intruded into the Linzizong volcanics in Linzhou Basin. These dykes intruded into Dianzhong and Nianbo formations of Linzizong Group. All the samples are sub-alkaline, varying from calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline series. They are peraluminous (A/CNK>1.1). The diorite porphyry, intruded in 62.4Ma with positive zircon Hf isotopes (εHf(t)=+5.1~+7.6), have similar composition to the andesitic rocks from Dianzhong Formation. The granite porphyries, intruded between 55.1Ma and 61.1Ma, with εHf(t) ranging from -1.1 to +10.4, have comparable composition with the rhyolitic Nianbo Formation. A series of evidences, including: (1) the samples have positive, mantle-like Hf feature (average εHf(t)=+5.9 of 86 samples); (2) wide-range variation of εHf(t) in samples (3.5~8.8 ε units in the four granite porphyries), which implying an inhomogeneous source regions; (3) magma-mixing trend in the plots of FeOT against MgO, suggesting that the magma-mixing processes that have taken place in the southern Gangdese belt, can also be applied to explain the origin of these dykes in Linzhou Basin. The dykes intruded coeval or shortly later than their equivalent volcanic rocks (Dianzhong and Nianbo formations), are in the transitional settings from subduction of Tethyan oceanic crust to the collisional between India and Eurasia continents.",

            "abstract": "A climate change MOOC is a way to reach a global audience of many thousands of students. What was it like to teach climate change to an invisible class over the Internet, and how well did it work? The need to educate many people about climate change seems obvious. Climate change is one of the most important existential issues of our time. Sound science can inform wise policy, and coping successfully with climate change is surely an urgent global challenge that requires scientific input and a scientifically informed public. Today many scientists have opportunities to communicate what science has learned about climate and climate change. Yet being a scientific expert on these subjects does not necessarily mean having the skills to communicate effectively to a broad audience. Like learning to ski or to drive a car skillfully, learning to communicate climate science well takes time and effort. The MOOC format has its own special challenges. Effective communication should always resemble a conversation rather than a monologue, but a conversation can be difficult when the teacher will never see or hear from the great majority of students in the class. In addition, a well-funded and effective professional disinformation campaign has been successful in sowing widespread confusion about climate change. As a result, many people mistakenly think climate change science is unreliable or is controversial within the expert community. One can expect that some of the students taking the MOOC will have been influenced by this sort of erroneous information. Thus, one appealing topic to include in a MOOC on climate change is to give useful guidelines for recognizing and rejecting junk science and disinformation. This talk will describe one climate scientist’s first-person participation in teaching a climate change MOOC.",

As a results trying to understand and predict the surface hydrologic cycle in isolation might be highly unreliable. We present two examples were constraints induced by 1) radiation control through cloud albedo feedback and 2) carbon control on the surface water use efficiency are essential to correctly predict the seasonal hydrologic cycle.\nIn the first example we show that correctly modeling diurnal and seasonal convection and the associated cloud-albedo feedback (through land-atmosphere and convection-large-scale circulation feedbacks) is essential to correctly model the surface hydrologic cycle in the Amazon, and to correct biases observed in all general circulation models. This calls for improved modeling of convection to correctly predict the tropical continental hydrologic cycle.\nIn the second example we show that typical drought index based only on energy want water availability misses vegetation physiological and carbon feedback and cannot correctly represent the seasonal cycle of soil moisture stress. The typical Palmer Drought Stress Index is shown to be incapable of rejecting water stress in the future. This calls for new drought assessment metrics that may include vegetation and carbon feedback.",

            "abstract": "The Holocene is a period of fundamental climatic change in North Africa. Humid conditions during the so-called African Humid Period (AHP) have favored the formation of big lake systems. Only very few of these lakes persist until today. One of them is Lake Yoa (19°03′N/20°31′E) in the Ounianga Basin, Chad, which maintains its water level by ground water inflow. Here we present the magnetic characteristics together with proxies for lacustrine productivity and biota of a sediment core (Co1240) from Lake Yoa, retrieved in 2010 within the framework of the Collaborative Research Centre 806 – Our Way to Europe (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).\nMagnetic properties of AHP sediments show strong indications for reductive diagenesis. An up to ~ 80 m higher lake level is documented by lacustrine deposits in the Ounianga Basin, dating to the early phase of the AHP. The higher lake level and less strong seasonality restricted deep mixing of the lake. Development of anoxic conditions consequently lead to the dissolution of iron oxides. An exception is an interval with high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals, deposited between 7800 - 8120 cal yr BP. This interval post-dates the 8.2 event, which was dry in Northern Africa and probably caused a reduced vegetation cover. We propose that the latter resulted in the destabilization of soils around Lake Yoa. After the re-establishment of humid conditions, these soil materials were eroded and deposited in the lake.\nMagnetic minerals appear well preserved in the varved Late Holocene sequence, indicating (sub-) oxic conditions in the lake. This is surprising, because the occurrence of varves is often interpreted as an indicator for anoxic conditions of the lake water. However, the salinity of lake water rose strongly after the AHP. We therefore hypothesize that the conservation of varves and absence of benthic organisms rather relates to the high salinity than to anoxic conditions.",

A better understanding of how much and to what extent the irrigation water is transpired by crops relative to being lost through evaporation will contribute to better management of increasingly limited agricultural water resources. In this study, we examined the evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning over a field of forage sorghum (S. bicolor) during a growing season with several irrigation cycles. In several field campaigns we used continuous measurements of near-surface variations in the stable isotopic composition of water vapor (δ2H). We employed custom built transparent chambers coupled with a laser-based isotope analyzer and used Keeling plot and mass balance methods for surface flux partitioning. The preliminary results show that δT is more enriched than δE in the early growing season, and becomes less enriched than δE later in the season as canopy cover increases. There is an increase in the contribution of transpiration to ET as (1) leaf area index increases, and (2) as soil surface moisture declines. These results are consistent with theory, and extend these measurements to an environment that experiences extreme soil surface temperatures. The data further support the use of chamber based methods with stable isotopic analysis for characterization of ET partitioning in challenging field environments.",

            "abstract": "The Cedars is a complex of ultra-basic, reducing springs located in the Coastal Range Ophiolite (CA, USA), a site of present day serpentinization. Similar to other serpentinization-associated fluids, the groundwaters discharging at The Cedars contain elevated concentrations of C1-C6 alkanes and volatile organic acids (VOAs) which may originate from abiotic or thermogenic processes but can also be produced, consumed, or transformed by microbial activity. In contrast to other continental sites of serpentinization, geochemical indicators (δ13CCH4, δ2HCH4, CH4/C2-C6 alkanes) are consistent with a partial microbial origin of methane at The Cedars. These indicators, however, can provide only indirect evidence of microbial methanogenesis.\nTo further explore the metabolic potential of the indigenous microbial communities at The Cedars, we conducted a series of microcosm experiments in which fluids and sediments collected at The Cedars were incubated with 13C labeled substrates (formate, acetate, bicarbonate, methanol) under anaerobic conditions. 13C from all amended substrates was incorporated into CH4 demonstrating that these microbial communities can convert both organic and inorganic substrates to CH4. The apparent fractionation of 13C between methane and potential substrates indicated that carbonate reduction was the dominant pathway of methanogenesis, and 16S rDNA based community profiling revealed the presence of an OTU closest related to Methanobacterium sp., an autotrophic (CO2/H2) methanogen. Concentrations of C1-C4 VOAs increased 5-fold over the course of the experiment indicating the microbial production of VOAs. This acetogenesis occurred heterotrophically as autotrophic acetogenesis can be excluded because (a) δ13C values of acetate were similar to those of inorganic carbon (inconsistent with the strong discrimination against 13C observed in autotrophic acetogenesis) and (b) no incorporation of 13C from labeled bicarbonate was into acetate was observed.",

            "abstract": "Cloud and radiation processes are very important issues in Arctic climate system. Reanalyses have proved to be the essential tools to study extreme weather and climate events, especially in data-sparse region like the Arctic. Before using reanalyses products, their strengths and uncertainties should be identified. In this study, five recent reanalyses (JRA55, 20CR V2c, CFSR, ERA-Interim and MERRA) are compared with NASA CERES satellite observations with respect of cloud fraction (CF), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface longwave (LW)/shortwave (SW) radiation fluxes during the period of 03/2000-02/2012 over the Arctic (70-90°N). 20CR V2c, CFSR, ERA-Interim and MERRA overestimate CFs, particularly during the cold season, with the positive biases of annual means from +9.6% (MERRA) to +22.9% (20CR V2c). Only JRA55 can represent its overall seasonal variation and spatial distribution but with large negative biases (nearly -15%). All reanalyses can well capture the seasonal trend of TOA SW/LW upwelling fluxes. However, in all-sky condition, all of them show positive biases of TOA SW upwelling flux along northern and eastern coasts in Greenland during the warm season (JJA). There is a good agreement between reanalyses and observation in seasonal cycle of net TOA cloud radiative effects (CRE), which are calculated by TOA SW/LW fluxes. The spatial distributions of net TOA CRE in warm season show that only JRA55 and ERA-Interim are relatively consistent with their reanalyzed CFs. As for the surface radiation, the satellite-derived results were firstly validated by Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) ground-based observations. It illustrates that average biases of satellite retrievals are +9.85 W/m2 for surface downward SW flux and +0.39 W/m2 for downward LW flux in warm season within the Arctic. The seasonal variation of SW/LW fluxes can be well represented by four of five reanalyses except MERRA. Reanalyzed surface downward SW flux in JRA55, CFSR and ERA-Interim are relatively consistent with their CF results among these reanalyses. However, the biases in TOA and surface radiation fluxes cannot only explained by biased CFs in some of reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "Data from Cassini, Galileo, S-L 9 and Ulysses suggest Jupiter and Saturn are solid, frozen, Methane Gas Hydrate (MGH) planets. The bulk of these giants formed slow and cold by the natural accretion of snowflakes at their current orbital radii in the presence of methane, forming rigid incompressible bodies. MGH, (CH4)8(H2O)46 (d=0.9), is consistent with the abundances of the elements comprising the Earth (H>O>C). Their combined MGH comprises >250 earth-masses of H2O. Jupiter (d=1.33) incorporated most of the heavy elements in the nascent solar system, exemplified by an enormously enhanced D/H. The temperature excess of Jupiter’s atmosphere is the result of an impact ~6,000 years BP, triggering an incredibly energetic fusion explosion which ejected the masses of the proto-Galilean moons. It also initiated a continuing fusion furnace in the crater producing a jet of hot gases extending >2x106 km, beyond Callisto. The jet has slowly diminished over 6,000 years, resulting in the differences in the four Galilean Moons. The mass ejection (ang. mom.) slowed Jupiter’s rotation until ~1930, currently interpreted as a drift of the Great Red Spot. A diminishing fusion reaction (D + p → 3He + γ) continues to this day, producing Jupiter’s atmospheric ‘temperature excess’. Jupiter’s rapid rotation deflects the rising vortex of hot gases from the fusion reaction horizontally, driving multiple zonal vortices, constrained by the frozen MGH surface <1000 km below the cloud tops. It appears as the tilted Great Red Spot (GRS), ~30,000 km to the west of the crater at 22 o S Lat., which has remained unchanged in the last 350 years - impossible due to the enormous Coliolis effect. Streams of 3He produced in the fusion reaction exiting Jupiter through the center of the GRS have been detected by the Galileo probe and orbiter, Ulysses, and Cassini. The fusion releases methane, also heavy elements which oxidize as they rise, producing the cloud-top colors. The MGH hypothesis explains the >6 minute delays of the larger S-L 9 ‘main events' as the time required for the mushroom clouds from their impacts to reach the cloud tops. The Juno MWR can potentially detect the fusion source and certainly the hot, longitudinally extended column forming the GRS. The Gravity Experiment should detect the basin in which it is located, possibly others.",

            "abstract": "A decrease in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness has been observed within recent decades. Further decreases are expected to increase the fluxes aerosol and precursor gases from the open ocean surface within the Arctic. The resulting increase in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations would be expected to result in increased cloud albedo (Struthers et al, 2011), leading to potentially large changes in radiative forcings.\nHowever, Browse et al. (2014) have shown that these increases in condensable material could also result in the growth of existing particles to sizes where they are more efficiently removed by wet deposition in drizzling stratocumulus clouds, ultimately decreasing CCN concentrations in the high Arctic. The study of Browse et al (2014) was limited in that it did not simulate alterations of dynamics or cloud properties due to either changes in heat and moisture fluxes following sea­-ice loss or changing aerosol concentrations.\nTaken together, the results of Struthers et al (2011) and Browse et al (2014) show that significant uncertainties remain in trying to quantify aerosol­-cloud processes in the poorly understood Arctic system. It is likely that the CCN response to sea-­ice loss is controlled by many interrelated processes and unlikely that the current representation of these processes in global climate models include is sufficient to realistically simulate long­-term changes.\nUsing the Met Office Unified Model (UM) including Cloud AeroSol Interactions Microphysics (CASIM), we perform a case study of summertime high Arctic (>80N) clouds in order to better understand the processes currently governing Arctic clouds, and how they may change in the future. We compare our results with observations obtained during the 2008 ASCOS campaign. We then perform sensitivity studies to assess the changes in cloud properties to reductions in sea­-ice, through either changes in fluxes of surface heat and moisture or changes in fluxes of aerosol and precursor gases.\n\nBrowse, J., et al., Atmos.

The kinetic heating is modeled by a proton diffusion in v_perp. The protons additionally respond to the coronal hole forces of gravity, charge-separation electric field, and the mirror force as described in our previous kinetic guiding-center models. We have further extended this kinetic model to include wave growth and damping by the anisotropic protons through the quasilinear cyclotron-resonant interaction. We solve the coupled equations for the kinetic proton behavior and for the self-consistent development of ion-cyclotron wave spectra propagating within 60˚ of the magnetic field direction. We seek to obtain a steady-state solution, showing the evolution of the proton distribution and the wave spectra with increasing heliocentric radial position due to the combined effects of heating, resonant scattering coupled to the wave generation, and the kinetic response to the large-scale forces of the inhomogeneous coronal hole.

            "abstract": "We combined multiple tracers with continuous groundwater level monitoring in a modelling framework to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of influences of groundwater on runoff generation in a 3.2km2 catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The montane catchment is underlain by granite and metasediments and has extensive (70%) cover of diverse drift deposits which are up to 40m deep. Flat valley bottom areas fringing the stream channel are characterised by peat soil (0.5-4m deep) which cover about 20% of the catchment and receive drainage from upslope areas. Previous field and modelling work has identified dominant sources of runoff at the catchment-scale and the associated landscape controls on their dynamics and associated transit times. Whilst these studies have emphasised the importance of riparian wetlands as the dominant source of runoff, groundwater discharge provides both an important source of water to these wetlands throughout most of the year, as well as a direct flux into the channel network to sustain the lowest flows. Synoptic hydrogeochemical surveys were carried out on four occasions as flows declined during a 10 year return drought period. Samples were analysed for major anions, cations and water isotopes. Stream chemistry changes showed marked spatial variability implying geochemical differences in the bedrock geology and the distribution of storage in drift deposits. Temporal dynamics inferred heterogeneous montane groundwater bodies contributing to runoff generation differentially during the recession. Modelling confirmed that largest sources of groundwater appear to be located in drifts in the lower catchment where the most marked increase in weathering-derived ions occurred and depleted, non-fractionated isotope signatures implied deeper inflows.",

            "abstract": "Multi-decadal reanalysis datasets have been widely used to study the global terrestrial water and energy cycles. The driving component of the land surface water budget is the incoming precipitation forcing, which was traditionally generated by the atmospheric general circulation model component of the reanalysis system following the assimilation of atmospheric temperature and humidity observations. The recent CFSR and MERRA-2 reanalysis products, however, essentially use precipitation observations from satellites and/or gauges to force the land surface. This presentation first reviews the approach by which the precipitation observations are introduced in MERRA-2, which relies on a mix of (i) model-generated precipitation at high-latitudes, (ii) a pentad, 2.5 degree satellite product from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) over Africa, and (iii) a daily, 0.5 degree, gauge-based CPC precipitation product elsewhere. This approach represents an evolution of the method used in the land-only MERRA-Land reanalysis. Next, the precipitation climatologies and the resulting land surface conditions are evaluated regionally and for the reanalysis time period (1980-present) against available independent observations. MERRA-2 provides generally improved land surface conditions when compared to MERRA, its predecessor. Improvements include enhanced estimates of soil moisture, terrestrial water storage, runoff, screen-level temperature and turbulent fluxes, with MERRA-2 skill metrics generally similar to those of MERRA-Land. But MERRA-2 also suffers from adverse spin-up effects in soil moisture conditions at very high latitudes because of model precipitation bias in this region.",

The system ingests waveform data from about 500 stations and generates many thousands of triggers per day, from which a small portion produce earthquake alerts.\nWe have developed interactive web browser system-monitoring tools that display near real time state-of-health and performance information. This includes station availability, trigger statistics, communication and alert latencies. Connections to regional earthquake catalogs provide a rapid assessment of the Decision Module hypocenter accuracy.\nHistorical performance can be evaluated, including statistics for hypocenter and origin time accuracy and alert time latencies for different time periods, magnitude ranges and geographic regions. For the ElarmS event associator, individual earthquake processing histories can be examined, including details of the transmission and processing latencies associated with individual P-wave triggers. Individual station trigger and latency statistics are available. Detailed information about the ElarmS trigger association process for both alerted events and rejected events is also available.\nThe Google Web Toolkit and Map API have been used to develop interactive web pages that link tabular and geographic information.

            "abstract": "The retreat of cliffbands is an important erosional process within the relatively undeformed sedimentary layers of the Colorado Plateau. Many iconic cliff landforms, including those of Monument Valley and Grand Canyon, are maintained by the interaction of these different rock types. A several kilometer thickness of incised sandstone and shale formations allow this region to act as a natural laboratory for studying the effects of variable lithologies on landscape evolution.\nCliffband morphology and retreat on the plateau are controlled by several factors that may vary over time and space, including lithology, rate and distribution of rockfall debris, bedrock structure, baselevel, and climate. The relative importance of each factor in setting rates of cliff retreat are not entirely clear. Because regional headwaters are commonly sourced at cliff bases, these landforms are often the final and slowest areas to respond to baselevel changes, allowing rockfall and other local stochastic processes to overwhelm the erosional response to a baselevel forcing. The roles of these processes are difficult to assess because very few measurements of retreat rates over geomorphic timescales (103-106 years) have been produced, and thus changes in cliffband position through time have only been constrained by inferences made from the regional erosional history.\nHere, we control for climate and rock type by focusing on a continuous, 40-kilometer section of the lithologically consistent Coal Cliffs in Emery County, Utah. This area presents several natural experiments illustrating cliffband response to different forcings, including relict surfaces reflecting a baselevel change, drainage divides across which the adjustment to base level change may be asynchronous, a zone wherein the caprock layer has been removed by backscarp erosion, and a generally continuous gradient in cliff height from 50 to >200 meters along the cliffline. We employ terrestrial Cl36 exposure dating on terraces, talus flatirons, and perched boulders to constrain the rate of cliffband movement over the most recent period of retreat. Field mapping, relative weathering measurements, and high-resolution DEMs created from structure-from-motion (SFM) photogrammetry are used to evaluate the morphological response in each case.",

            "abstract": "In the Earth's magnetotail, brief periods of fast plasma flow (``bursty bulk flows''---BBFs) provide much of the sunward transport of mass, energy, and magnetic flux. As a result of coordinated studies using multi-satellite observations, it has been demonstrated that these fast flows are confined to flow channels in the plasma sheet whose full width is of the order of 1--3\nR\nE\nin the dawn-dusk direction and 1.5--2\nR\nE\nin the north-south direction. The present study uses 3D particle-in-cell simulations to determine the properties of the exhaust jets produced by reconnection initiated in finite-width regions of the plasma sheet. Relatively narrow fronts (\n<10\nd\ni\n) expand in the ion-drift direction to reach widths of 15--20\nd\ni\n. Broader initial fronts (25--50\nd\ni\n) tend to form a 10--15\nd\ni\nwidth higher-speed structure on the dawn side of the front. Thus the minimum width of an exhaust jet appears to be on the order of 1\nR\nE\n. All of these fronts exhibit a tendency to filament into structures of order 1--2\nd\ni\nin width, apparently due to the action of the ballooning/interchange instability. At the dawnward side of a front, the incoming ions are slowed sharply, and reflected ions appear downstream. Behind the front is a turbulent region with a strong localized duskward ion drift structure. Substantial increases in both ion and electron fluxes are observed at energies of 15--25\nE\nth\n. Isolated small-scale (\nd\ne\n≪L≪\nd\ni\n) regions of net dissipation of strength 1--2 nW/m\n3\nappear at the front. The implications of these results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost influence on the hydrologic connectivity of surface water bodies in high-latitude lowlands is complicated by subsurface heterogeneity and the propensity of the system to change over time. In general, permafrost limits the subsurface exchange of water, solute, and nutrients between lakes and rivers. It follows that permafrost thaw could enhance subsurface hydrologic connectivity among surface water bodies, but the impact of this process on lake distribution is not well known. Changes in the extent of lakes in interior Alaska have important ecological and societal impacts since lakes provide (1) critical habitat for migratory arctic shorebirds and waterfowl, fish, and wildlife, and (2) provisional, recreational, and cultural resources for local communities. We utilize electromagnetic imaging of the shallow subsurface and remote sensing of lake level dynamics in the Yukon Flats of interior Alaska, USA, together with water balance modeling, to gain insight into the influence of discontinuous permafrost on lowland lake systems. In the study region with relatively low precipitation, observations suggest that lakes that are hydrologically isolated during normal conditions are sustained by periodic river flooding events, including ice-jam floods that occur during river ice break-up. Climatically-influenced alterations in flooding frequency and intensity, as well as depth to permafrost, are quantitatively assessed in the context of lake maintenance. Scenario modeling is used to evaluate lake level evolution under plausible changing conditions. Model results demonstrate how permafrost degradation can reduce the dependence of typical lowland lakes on flooding events. Study results also suggest that river flooding may recharge a more spatially widespread zone of lakes and wetlands under future scenarios of permafrost table deepening and enhanced subsurface hydrologic connectivity.",

            "abstract": "The climate is affected by the land surface through regulating the exchange of mass and energy with the atmosphere. The energy that reaches the land surface has three pathways: (1) reflected into atmosphere; (2) absorbed for photosynthesis; and (3) discarded as latent and sensible heat or emitted as fluorescence. Vegetation removes CO2 from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis, but also releases CO2 back into the atmosphere through the process of respiration. The complex set of vegetation-soil-atmosphere interactions requires that a realistic land-surface parameterization be included in any climate model or general circulation model (GCM) to accurately simulate canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance.\nIn this paper, we present a new MODIS product, fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll throughout a canopy (fAPARchl), in three aspects: validation, mapping and application. The fAPARchl is retrieved through the coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT2 with surface reflectance of MODIS bands 1-7 at spatial resolution of 500 m. In order to validate the fAPARchl product, we design a new gridding approach that define the center of a selected site or field as the center of the grid and the MODIS observations of the grid is weighted by all overlapped observations from each orbit, respectively. Selected sites include evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, mixed forests, crops, shrublands, and grasslands under various climate conditions. The fAPARchl product is mapped at site/pixel, local and regional scales across the United States and Canada. The fAPARchl is utilized to estimate GPP, and compared to tower flux GPP for validation. The GPP estimation performance with fAPARchl is also compared with the GPP estimation performance with MOD15A2 FPAR. The fAPARchl product is further implemented into ecological models and land-surface models to simulate vegetation GPP. This study shows the importance of the new gridding approach for validation, and concludes that fAPARchl is superior to MOD15A2 FPAR in GPP estimation. This study will be extended to more sites in other regions under various climate conditions in the future for continuing validation and applications of the MODIS fAPARchl product.",

The rockets released samarium metal vapor in the lower F-region of the ionosphere that ionized forming a plasma cloud. A host of diagnostic instruments were used to probe and characterize the cloud including the ALTAIR incoherent scatter radar, multiple GPS and optical instruments, satellite radio beacons, and a dedicated network of high frequency (HF) radio links. Data from ALTAIR incoherent scatter radar and HF radio links have been analyzed to understand the impacts of the artificial ionization on radio wave propagation. During the first release the ionosphere was disturbed, rising rapidly and spread F formed within minutes after the release. To address the disturbed conditions present during the first release, we have developed a new method of assimilating oblique ionosonde data to generate the background ionosphere that can have numerous applications for HF systems. The link budget analysis of the received signals from the HF transmitters explains the missing low frequencies in the received signals along the great circle path. Observations and modeling confirm that the small amounts of ionized material injected in the lower-F region resulted in significant changes to the natural propagation environment.",

            "abstract": "We used geologic mapping applied to Dawn spacecraft data as a tool to understand the geologic history of the Ac-H-6 Haulani Quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres. This region, located between 22˚S-22˚N and 0-72˚E, is dominated by the 31km diameter Haulani impact crater in the west. Haulani shows a bright interior and is surrounded by bright ejecta, which preferentially extends westward. Photometrically corrected data show that small rays radially extend over several hundred kilometers to the west. A heavily cratered elevated plain extends around the equator to the NE, interrupted by a trough in the east. This plain seems to be part of a dominant geological unit crossing Ceres. A crater in the southern part of the plain reveals possible flow features extending to the NW, maybe of volcanic origin. The quadrangle is also affected by many impact craters with modified floors: smooth infilling, melted material, central peaks, possible domes and mass wasting. Some candidate volcanic domes occur in the northwestern and southern parts of the quadrangle. Linear depressions cross the quadrangle in W-E direction, with a slight tendency to NW. A set of small linear depressions close to each other are found in the SE. They are orientated in NW direction crossed by one in WE direction. At the time of writing, geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including grayscale and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be available to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) images in January 2016. The key goal of the ongoing mapping is to analyze, whether the origin of the bright material of the Haulani crater is endogenic or exogenic. Additionally, domes and linear depressions could be of volcanic and volcanic-tectonic origin.\nThis work is supported by the HGF Postdoc Program.",

            "abstract": "We present mini-LHR measurements of column CH4 from our preliminary field campaign outside of Fairbanks, AK in June 2015. The mini-LHR is fully automated and works in tandem with the AERONET sun photometer for collection of column CH4 every 15 minutes. As part of a comprehensive array of ground based instruments, measurements made by the mini-LHR will aid in monitoring of changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and help interpret data collected by space-born instruments.\nThe mini-LHR is a passive variation of typical heterodyne radiometry instruments, using sunlight as the light source for measuring CH4 in the infrared. Collecting through collimation optics mounted on the AERONET tracker, the sunlight is chopped in an optical chopper and mixed with a local oscillator in a fast photoreciever (InGaAs detector). The amplitude of the resultant RF (radio frequency) beat signal directly correlates with the concentration of the column gas being measured.\nWorking in conjunction with ground penetrating radar, covariance flux tower, and high-resolution surface CO2 and CH4 measurements, our column CH4 measurements contribute to a holistic view of the atmospheric evolution and response to permafrost thaw. With the intent to expand our observational network to other North American sites, our column CH4 measurements will be instrumental in showing the effects of permafrost thaw on global CH4 levels, as well as benefiting ongoing efforts in retrospective and predictive simulations of greenhouse gasses.",

However, during intense geomagnetic storms, density gradients associated with Storm Enhanced Density (SED) plumes and Sub-auroral Polarization Streams (SAPS) can move across the dayside mid-latitude ionosphere producing small spatial scale density structure that may be connected to ionospheric scintillation. The evolution of the SED plume during the March 17, 2015 “St. Patrick’s Day Storm” is investigated using aggregated data from high resolution GPS receivers at the University of Michigan and throughout the Great Lakes region.

            "abstract": "The greenhouse gas balance of natural and restored wetlands is an important consideration when assessing ecosystem services, structure and function and restoration success of wetlands. Fast methane (CH4) gas analyzers such as the LI7700 are now enabling continuous ecosystem scale (eddy flux) measurements and assessment in conjunction with CO2 measurements. Here, we have set up two locations, one in a natural and one in a restored tidal salt marsh in the Meadowlands of New Jersey (MNJ) USA, in order to compare ecosystem level methane and carbon dioxide fluxes. Continuous methane fluxes were measured at the ecosystem level over three growing seasons at the restored site and two growing seasons at the natural wetland site concomitant to carbon dioxide fluxes. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions were highly variable in space and time over the three years of investigation (2012-2014). The temporal dynamics of methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in each of the sites suggest small-scale site-specific controls on methane emissions, but ubiquitous, non-specific controls on carbon dioxide uptake and release. Methane emissions increased at the restored site from 2012 to 2013, despite no corresponding increases in carbon dioxide uptake. In contrast, methane emission decreased at the natural wetlands site over the same time with concomitant increase in carbon dioxide uptake (more negative net ecosystem exchange). In 2014, the trend continued at the natural and the restored wetland sites with decreasing methane emission and increasing CO2 uptake. The influence of temperature and phenology on the observed patterns will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "A newly acquired, high-resolution aeromagnetic survey provides insights into the near-surface lithology and tectonic structure throughout the greater Spokane area of northeastern Washington and northwestern Idaho. The region has a diverse array of magnetic lithologies, ranging from highly magnetic flood basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) to weakly magnetic Mesozoic plutonic and metamorphic rocks. Faults within these magnetic lithologies produce linear magnetic anomalies that permit mapping of geologic structures over tens of kilometers. A high-amplitude, linear magnetic anomaly overlies the NW- striking Cheney fracture zone 37 km southwest of Spokane and is interpreted as a basaltic dike swarm intruded during the extensional event that opened the fractures, possibly feeder dikes for overlying CRBG flows. A sub-parallel anomaly near the town of Cheney reflects another dike swarm, likely formed during the same extensional event. The Latah fault is seen as a discontinuous alignment of magnetic anomalies extending north-northwestward from south of Spokane to the northern edge of the magnetic survey, a distance of 44 km. An arcuate, north-striking magnetic lineament ~20 km northeast of Spokane may mark the Newport fault, the detachment that promoted exhumation of the Priest River metamorphic complex. A subtle northeast-striking magnetic lineament passes through downtown Spokane and may indicate the trace of the Spokane fault, suspected of producing more than 105 small (M≤4), shallow earthquakes within Spokane city limits in 2001, accompanied by 15 mm of vertical uplift. This magnetic lineament extends 22 km and, to the northwest, merges with the lineament interpreted as the Newport fault. The Spokane fault may represent a reactivated section of the Newport fault that otherwise is not known to be active today. New LiDAR data from the Spokane area does not show distinct fault scarps associated with these magnetic anomalies, but a more comprehensive analysis of the LiDAR data, including stream profiling and terrace mapping, may yield insights into Quaternary activity of these features.",

            "abstract": "Chloride is a naturally occurring ion in freshwater lakes that can have adverse ecological impacts if concentrations rise above natural background levels. Many lakes worldwide, including the Great Lakes, have seen increased chloride concentrations over the past few decades. Regional drivers include both natural processes (e.g., sea salt deposition and long periods of drought) and anthropogenic influences (e.g., runoff from road salt application and agricultural fertilizer and discharge of industrial effluent). While these trends and drivers have been studied at the watershed scale, there has been no large-scale analyses of chloride trends in freshwater lakes.\nHere, we have compiled a dataset of long-term (> 10 years) chloride concentrations in over 500 freshwater lakes, ponds and reservoirs worldwide (>0.04 ha), predominantly in the United States, Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The geographic and morphometric range of lakes in this dataset allows us to assess the impact of ecoregion, lake area, residence time, and lake depth on relative changes in chloride concentrations. For the United States, we combined our dataset with the National Land Cover Database and the National Hydrography Dataset to quantify percent impervious surface, as a proxy for road density, within the near-shore environment of our study lakes.\nWe find that urban lakes, especially in the American Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota) have strong positive trends in chloride concentrations, whereas remote lakes, such as ponds in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, have had stable or decreasing chloride levels. In states with seasonal road-salt application, the percent impervious surface within 100 m of a lake is strongly correlated with increases in chloride. Road salt runoff is just one ecological threat to urban lakes, but can be abated with proper management.",

            "abstract": "In this study we analyzed six Quaternary lava flows and one lava dome from Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field, in the Chilean Andes, in order to create a volcano-petrological eruptive model to get ideas about pre- and syn-eruptive stages, the main factors that control the broad distribution of vents and the architecture of magma reservoir. We estimated eruptive parameters such as effusion rates and erupted volumes, extrinsic and intrinsic lava flows emplacement controlling factors, magma ascent rates and pre-eruptive thermodynamics conditions to determine different stages in magma evolution from magma reservoir to emplacement of lava at surface. The analyzed lavas have andesitic-to-rhyolitic compositions, blocky morphology with volumes about a few cubic kilometers, thicknesses up to 140 m, maximum widths of 5 km and maximum lengths of 10 km. Modeling of the advance of these flows gives effusion rates of 10-1-102 m3s-1 and eruptions of a few months to years. Petrologic studies which include quantitative textural analyses and mineral and glass compositions, reveal similar provenance and crystalizing temperatures of similar minerals, coupled with similar pressures, H2O content and oxygen fugacity by similar lava composition, meanwhile individual chamber size estimations show an overlap sharing volume in near chambers indicating the equivalent provenance. Our main results about dynamics of lava flows suggest a crustal yield strength control in the emplacement over the internal viscosity of the flow for each lava. On the other hand, non-rhyolitic units appear to come from chambers located in similar depths and with coinciding volumes which indicate that the eruptions were triggered by the injection of different magma batches into a crystal-rich magma reservoir that could be divided into many sub-compartments which could explain the broad distribution of the vents. In addition, rhyolitic units also show similar thermodynamics conditions and coming from equivalent chambers.",

            "abstract": "Meeting the challenge of climate change will clearly require ‘deep learning’ – learning that motivates a search for underlying meaning, a willingness to exert the sustained effort needed to understand complex problems, and innovative problem-solving. This type of learning is dependent on the level of the learner’s engagement with the material, their intrinsic motivation to learn, intention to understand, and relevance of the material to the learner. Here, we present evidence for deep learning about climate change through a simulation-based role-playing exercise, World Climate. The exercise puts participants into the roles of delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations and asks them to create an international climate deal. They find out the implications of their decisions, according to the best available science, through the same decision-support computer simulation used to provide feedback for the real-world negotiations, C-ROADS. World Climate provides an opportunity for participants have an immersive, social experience in which they learn first-hand about both the social dynamics of climate change decision-making, through role-play, and the dynamics of the climate system, through an interactive computer simulation. Evaluation results so far have shown that the exercise is highly engaging and memorable and that it motivates large majorities of participants (>70%) to take action on climate change. In addition, we have found that it leads to substantial gains in understanding key systems thinking concepts (e.g., the stock-flow behavior of atmospheric CO2), as well as improvements in understanding of climate change causes and impacts. While research is still needed to better understand the impacts of simulation-based role-playing exercises like World Climate on behavior change, long-term understanding, transfer of systems thinking skills across topics, and the importance of social learning during the exercise, our results to date indicate that it is a powerful, active learning tool that has strong potential to foster deep learning about climate change.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming is currently one of the most important issues that we are facing. The degradation of permafrost beneath thermokarst lakes has been associated with enhanced methane emissions and it presents a positive feedback to climate warming. Thermokarst lakes release methane to the atmosphere mainly by ebullition (bubbling) but there are a large number of uncertainties regarding the magnitude and variability of these emissions. Here we present a methodology to estimate the amount of gas released from thermokarst lakes through ebullition using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). This geophysical technique is well suited for this type of problem because it is non-invasive, continuous, and requires less effort and time than the direct visual inspection. We are studying GPR data collected using 1.2 GHz frequency antennas in Brooklyn Lake, Laramie, WY, in order to quantify the uncertainties in the method. Although this is not a thermokarst lake, gas bubbles are trapped in the ice and spatial variability in bubble concentration within the ice is evident. To assess the variability in bulk physical properties of the ice due to bubbles, we gathered GPR data from different types of ice. We compared the velocity of the groundwave and reflection obtained from radargrams, and found on each case a larger value for the groundwave velocity suggesting a non-homogeneous medium and that the concentration of bubbles is prone to be near the surface instead of at greater depths. We use a multi-phase dielectric-mixing model to estimate the amount of gas present in a sample of volume of ice and found an uncertainty in relative permittivity (estimated using reflection velocity) of 0.0294, which translates to an uncertainty of 1.1% in gas content; and employing groundwave velocity we found 0.0712 and 2.9%, respectively. If locations of gas seeps in lakes could be detected and quantified using GPR along with field measurements, this could help to constrain future lake-source carbon gas estimates.",

The new ‘Earth Gravitational Model 2020’ [EGM2020] has an expected public release date of 2020, and will likely retain the same harmonic basis and resolution as EGM2008. As such, EGM2020 will be essentially an ellipsoidal harmonic model up to degree (n) and order (m) 2159, but will be released as a spherical harmonic model to degree 2190 and order 2159. EGM2020 will benefit from new data sources and procedures. Updated satellite gravity information from the GOCE and GRACE mission, will better support the lower harmonics, globally. Multiple new acquisitions (terrestrial, airborne and shipborne) of gravimetric data over specific geographical areas, will provide improved global coverage and resolution over the land, as well as for coastal and some ocean areas. Ongoing accumulation of satellite altimetry data as well as improvements in the treatment of this data, will better define the marine gravity field, most notably in polar and near-coastal regions. NGA and partners are evaluating different approaches for optimally combining the new GOCE/GRACE satellite gravity models with the terrestrial data. These include the latest methods employing a full covariance adjustment. NGA is also working to assess systematically the quality of its entire gravimetry database, towards correcting biases and other egregious errors where possible, and generating improved error models that will inform the final combination with the latest satellite gravity models. Outdated data gridding procedures have been replaced with improved approaches. For EGM2020, NGA intends to extract maximum value from the proprietary data that overlaps geographically with unrestricted data, whilst also making sure to respect and honor its proprietary agreements with its data-sharing partners.",

In this study we evaluate the contribution of these components for the storm observed from September 27 to October 4 in 2002. The thermal component of the pressure for the protons, helium and oxygen at 0--40 keV/q is measured by the Cluster/CIS/CODIF sensor. The contribution of the energetic ions at energies\n>\n40 keV is calculated from the Cluster/RAPID/IIMS observations. The results show that before the storm has initiated, the contribution of the energetic ions in to the total pressure is indeed negligible in the tail plasma sheet, less than\n∼\n1\\%. However, with the storm development contribution of the energetic part becomes significant, up to\n∼30%\n, towards the recovery phase and cannot be neglected. Heavy ions contribute to the 27\\% of the total pressure and half of them are energetic. The contribution of energetic ions to the pressure of the ring current (L\n≃\n5) is significant. The heavy ions play a dominant role in the plasma pressure, about 62\\% during the main phase of the magnetic storm. Half of them are energetic ions.

            "abstract": "Dominica has one of the highest concentrations of potentially active volcanoes worldwide. In addition to this activity, abundant geothermal manifestations are observed at the surface, especially in the southern part of the Island. The Boiling Lake – Valley of Desolation area is one of the most vigorous ones, hosting hot springs, mud pools, fumaroles, and steam vents. Intense alteration and many, predominantly phreatic explosive features, of varying scales characterize the whole area. The most prominent manifestation of such a phreatic eruption is the Boiling Lake, a high temperature volcanic crater lake and popular tourist attraction. Thus phreatic activity is one of the main volcanic hazards on the Island, to date largely unpredictable in time and magnitude. The conditions causing these eruptions, as well as their trigger mechanisms and magnitude need to be better understood.\nField mapping, together with the determination of in situ physical (density, humidity, permeability) and mechanical (strength, stiffness) properties yield the characterization of 3 main active areas with high probabilities for phreatic events. Rapid decompression experiments on samples from these areas gave insights into the fragmentation and ejection behavior. These experiments were flanked by chemical analyses and laboratory characterization (porosity, granulometry).\n The results show that hydrothermal alteration likely plays a crucial role in determining the probability of explosive events. High temperature acidic fluids, which lead to an intense alteration of the host rock’s mineralogy, change the rock properties favoring the formation of a low permeability layer above the vent and increasing the likelihood of the site experiencing a steam-blast eruption. The contribution of these results to constraining the conditions for and the dynamics involved in phreatic eruptions provides valuable input to hazard assessment of these frequently visited sites on Dominica and similar hydrothermally active areas worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Blocking anticyclones are known to be associated with persistent weather patterns that often lead to extreme weather events. An outstanding question, however, is whether the frequency and/or intensity of these dynamical features are changing in response to human-caused climate change, and in particular, to a disproportionately warming Arctic. In this presentation we describe a study using a pattern-recognition/clustering tool called Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to investigate the temporal behavior of blocks over recent decades, and attribute any changes to either frequency shifts in characteristic atmospheric patterns or to cluster-mean changes in a blocking characteristic for a given pattern. In this application, we use single contours of 500-hPa heights from reanalyses to identify characteristic ridge/trough patterns in the upper-level flow in the northern hemisphere. By mapping daily assessments of blocking occurrence and intensity to the SOM-derived patterns, we investigate temporal and regional changes in blocking. We find that the relative frequency of blocking days – defined as the number of blocked days in a particular pattern relative to the total number of days in that pattern – has increased significantly (> 95% confidence) in all regions: 60% of the patterns in the Atlantic, 80% in the Pacific, and 30% over continents. While the increases over oceans occur in all seasons, the higher occurrence of blocks over continents is confined to the warm season. Blocking intensity, however, has generally decreased, as expected with a weaker poleward temperature gradient. Blocking frequency and Arctic amplification are positively correlated over the Pacific and continental sectors, implying that as the Arctic continues to warm faster than mid-latitudes, the number of days with blocks should continue to increase. Better understanding the mechanisms for changes in blocks and other high-amplitude jet-stream patterns in a warming world will enhance predictability and help society prepare for unusual and extreme weather ahead.",

Light scattering from spheres is known to differ significantly from other particles shapes. In this work, we explore how the scattering phase function from aerosol particles evolve with particle sphericity. The analysis is performed on scattering patterns captured from individual atmospheric aerosol particles. The sphericity of single aerosol particles is quantified using autocorrelation analysis of the forward and backward scattering hemispheres. Preliminary results suggest that the scattering phase function quickly devolves from a shape consistent with spherical particles to a shape consistent with non-spherical particles. This supports the current remote sensing practice of characterizing atmospheric aerosol particles as a composition of spherical and non-spherical particles with less concern about the diversity of morphology within non-spherical particles. In addition, we found the backward scattering hemisphere was more sensitive to particle shape and thus a better indicator of the general shape of the phase function.",

It represented the beginning of coordinated, long-term eddy covariance flux tower measurements of the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water, and energy at the ecosystem scale in Canada and initiated research on how to upscale these processes to larger spatial domains using remote sensing. The focus of this presentation will be on the long-term impacts of BOREAS on carbon cycle and ecosystems research in Canada. The BOREAS flux tower effort was expanded to the national level in Canada through the Fluxnet-Canada and Canadian Carbon Program research networks (2002-2011). Within these two research networks, many of the Canadian scientists brought together during BOREAS continued their close scientific collaborations and maintained their links to related programs in the US such as the North American Carbon Program. These Canadian efforts allowed us to improve greatly our understanding of the impacts of inter-annual climate variability and ecological disturbance on carbon, water and energy dynamics of northern forests and allowed us to use these flux data for calibration and validation of a wide-range of ecosystem modelling and analysis efforts. Many of the flux tower measurements continue to this day and they assure the long-term legacy of the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program’s initial investment in the BOREAS field campaign.",

            "abstract": "The Aleutian arc provides an opportunity to study subducted sediment fluxes because such material unambiguously contributes to many Aleutian lavas. The sediment subduction flux is highest in the east and almost absent in the westernmost portions of the arc. However, it is unknown if the sedimentary flux beneath the arc is reflected in the magnitude of the sediment component in the arc lavas. In addition, it has been suggested that the chemical characteristics of the subducted sediment is likely to change along the arc from continental detrital in the east to abyssal pelagic clays in the central Aleutians, which should be manifested in the isotopic characteristics of Aleutian lavas. However, no direct measurements of pelagic sediments outboard of the Central Aleutians have been conducted to date.\nHere we use the novel tool of thallium (Tl) isotope ratios to assess sediment fluxes to the Aleutian arc. Thallium isotopes can be used to quantify sediment fluxes from the slab because pelagic sediments are highly enriched in Tl and display isotopic compositions that are heavier than the upper mantle. We have measured Tl isotope ratios of ~40 lavas covering the entire Aleutian arc as well as ~50 sediment samples from DSDP 178 and 183 as well as ODP 886C outboard of the Central Aleutians. We find that the Tl isotope compositions of the sediments subducted along the Aleutian arc change from values corresponding to continental crust material in the east to heavier values in the Central Aleutians, reflecting increased ferromanganese components in the pelagic clays going from east to west. This trend is mirrored by the lavas in the Eastern and Central Aleutians, which confirms that the composition of subducted sediment changes along the Aleutian arc. Lavas from the Western Aleutians, however, show no evidence of any sediment involvement, but indicate that a component from altered oceanic crust dominates the Tl isotope budget in this portion of the arc.\nWe conclude that Tl isotopes clearly reflect the change in sediment provenance outboard of the Aleutian arc and support previous studies that have inferred almost absent sediment inputs to the Western Aleutians.",

The multibeam data were used to define a region with several ~600 – 900 m tall gas plumes in the water column directly above cratered hummocky regions of the sea floor that have relatively high backscatter, at a water depth of ~1500 m. The natural gas hydrate stability zone reaches a minimum depth of ~600 m in the water column, similar to that of the tallest imaged bubble plumes, implying hydrate shells on the gas bubbles. Maximum tilt of the plume shows current shear in a direction from northwest to southeast (~128°), similar to the transport direction of North Atlantic Deep Water. The source of hydrocarbons, determined from existing geochemical data, suggests the gas source was subjacent marine Cretaceous source rocks. North-south trending faults, craters and mud volcanoes associated with the gas plumes point to the presence of a deep plumbing system and indicate that gas is a driver of mud volcanism. The widespread occurrence of seafloor morphology related to venting indicates that subsea emissions from the Barbados Accretionary Complex are substantial.",

Indeed, during many months preceding this event, at least three large seismic clusters have been observed, in July 2013, in January and in March 2014. Their location and final migration towards the mainshock rupture area represents the main motivation of this work.\nWe built a new, more complete catalogue for the period over December 2013 to March 2014 in Northern Chile, using a new automated array method for earthquake detection and location [Poiata et al. 2015]. With the data-set provided by the IPOC and ILN networks, we detected an average of 8000 events per month, forty times more than the catalogue produced by Centro Sismologico National del Chile. The new catalogue decreases the magnitude of completeness by more than two units, from 3.3 to 1.2. We observe two shallow clusters offshore of the cities of Iquique and Pisagua in January 2014, and a strong one covering the rupture zone of Mw 8.2 mainshock in March. A spatial-temporal statistical analysis of these three clusters allows us to better characterize the whole preparatory phase.\nWe interpret our results in light of the location, timing and energy of several aseismic slip events, evidenced by Boudin et al. [AGU 2014], which coincide with the seismic clusters. We propose that the preparatory phase of the Iquique earthquake consists of a complex interplay of seismic and aseismic slip along the subduction surface. Furthermore, our analysis raises new questions regarding the complex slip during the Mw 7.7 aftershock, and the spatial variation of the effective coupling along the subduction interface, imaged by GPS studies, suggesting new research direction that will be outlined.",

The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP) is impacted by the emission of 7 million vehicles (97% light-duty gasoline vehicles LDVs and 3% heavy-duty diesel vehicles HDVs) and several environmental programs were implemented to reduce the emissions. Inventories match site measurements and remote sensing and help to assess the real impact of road vehicle emissions on city’s air quality. In this paper we presented a high-resolution vehicle-based inventory of motor CO2 emissions mapped at a scale of 100 m and 1 hour. We used origin and destination (O/D) transport area zone trips from the mobility survey of the São Paulo Transport Metropolitan Company (Metro), a road network of the region and traffic datasets from the São Paulo Transport Engineering Company (CET). The inventory was done individually for LDVs and HDVs for the years 2008 and 2013 and was complemented with air quality datasets from the State Environmental Company (CETESB), together with census data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Our inventory showed partial disagreement with the São Paulo State’s GHG inventory, caused by the different approach used - bottom vs. top down – and characteristic spatial and temporal biases of the population inputs used (different emission factors). Higher concentrations became apparent near the road-network at the spatial scale used. The total emissions were estimated in 20,781 million tons per year of CO2eq (83.7% by LDVs and 16.3% HDVs). Temporal profiles - diurnal, weekly and monthly - in vehicle emission distributions were calculated using CET’s traffic counts and surrogates of congestion. These profiles were compared with average road-site measurements of CO2 for the year 2013. Measurements showed two peaks associated to the morning/evening peak hour of vehicles, one in the morning of 430 ppm at 8:00 am, and the average concentration was 406 ± 12 ppm. Correlation analyses were performed between the vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT), the CO2 concentrations (proxy for the temporal variation of the CO2 emission) and the census data (personal income and hospital admissions).",

This study uses two years of observations from a 30-m automatic weather station (AWS) installed on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica to evaluate forecasts from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS), a numerical weather prediction system based on the polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model that uses the MYJ planetary boundary layer scheme and that primarily supports the extensive aircraft operations of the U.S. Antarctic Program. The 30-m AWS has six levels of instrumentation, providing vertical profiles of temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. The observations show the atmospheric boundary layer over the Ross Ice Shelf is stable approximately 80% of the time, indicating the influence of the permanent ice surface in this region. The observations from the AWS are further analyzed using the method of self-organizing maps (SOM) to identify the range of potential temperature profiles that occur over the Ross Ice Shelf. The SOM analysis identified 30 patterns, which range from strong inversions to slightly unstable profiles. The corresponding AMPS forecasts were evaluated for each of the 30 patterns to understand the accuracy of the AMPS near surface layer under different atmospheric conditions. The results indicate that under stable conditions AMPS with MYJ under predicts the inversion strength by as much as 7.4 K over the 30-m depth of the tower and over predicts the near surface wind speed by as much as 3.8 m s-1. Conversely, under slightly unstable conditions, AMPS predicts both the inversion strength and near surface wind speeds with reasonable accuracy.",

            "abstract": "We ran the MC2 dynamic vegetation model for the conterminous US at 30 arc sec with and without land use and fire suppression for several climate change scenarios. We translated model results into key ecosystem services (ES) such as climate regulation through carbon uptake and sequestration (global climate) or through transpiration (regional climate) as well as water provision through runoff and throughflow. We also projected timber production and gauged the risk of production lost to fire and/or drought by simulating fuel loads and forest vigor annually through the 21st century. We calculated the rising irrigation demand for agricultural land which, coupled with available information on groundwater resources, could help plan for future cropping systems. By combining these results we can evaluate land cover value across the country in terms of quantity and quality of services rendered. By comparing projections with and without landuse and fire suppression we can illustrate differences in regulating and provisioning services between managed and natural lands.",

            "abstract": "Sand dunes have been shown to preserve the most recent wind patterns in their ripple formations. This investigation continues the manual documentation of ripples on Martian dunes in order to assess surface wind flow. Study sites investigated must have clear HiRISE frames and be able to represent diverse locations across the surface, decided primarily by their spread of latitude and longitude values. Additionally, frames with stereo pairs are preferred because of their ability to create digital terrain models. This will assist in efforts to relate dune slopes and obstacles to ripple patterns. The search and analysis period resulted in 40 study sites with mapped ripples. Lines were drawn perpendicular to ripple crests across three adjacent ripples in order to document both ripple wavelength from line length and inferred wind direction from azimuth. It is not possible to infer a unique wind direction from ripple orientation alone and therefore these inferred directions have a 180 degree ambiguity. Initial results from all study sites support previous observations that the Martian surface has many dune types in areas with adequate sand supply. The complexity of ripple patterns varies greatly across sites as well as within individual sites. Some areas of uniform directionality for hundreds of kilometers suggest a unimodal wind regime while overlapping patterns suggest multiple dominant winds or seasonally varying winds. In most areas, form flow related to dune shape seems to have a large effect on orientation and must be considered along with the dune type. As long as the few steep slip faces on these small dunes are avoided, form flow can be considered the dominant cause of deviation from the regional wind direction. Regional results, wind roses, and comparisons to previous work will be presented for individual sites.",

            "abstract": "Globally, there are now more secondary forests regenerating following anthropogenic disturbance than primary forests. However, carbon dynamics in secondary tropical forests in general, and seasonally dry forests in particular, have not been as well studied as primary wet forests. Young, regenerating forests may be more sensitive to climatic variability than older forests because of their dynamic demographic rates. Similarly, seasonally dry tropical forests may be particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation, as tree growth is highly constrained by water availability.\nWe examined how inter-annual variability in precipitation affected above-ground net primary productivity in chronosequences of dry forest in Costa Rica. Our sites included three forest cover types, whose distribution is linked to edaphic variation. Over our 6-yr dataset, annual rainfall varied from 1110 to 3040mm, with a 5-6 month dry season. ANPP ranged from 2.96 to 18.98 Mg ha-1 across sites that have been recovering for 7 to 67 years. Fine litter production dominated ANPP, and increased with forest age but not annual rainfall. By contrast, woody stem growth did not vary among forests that differed in age, but increased as a function of annual rainfall. These results differed by forest type. Lowland oak forests on low fertility soil had the lowest productivity and responses to rainfall, whereas forests on the highest fertility soils showed large increases in woody production with rainfall. Consistent with our expectation, younger forests on the intermediate soil type had higher variability in ANPP than older forests, but this was not significant for forests on the poor or high fertility soils. Our results highlight several important findings: 1) different components of ANPP vary in their responses to inter-annual variation in rainfall, 2) forest responses to climatic variability depend on species composition, which varies consistently with soil type in this landscape.",

            "abstract": "A collaborative project engaged a team of geophysicists, engineers, entomologists, and artists to visualize tunnels and chambers of a vast, leafcutting ant colony in rural Texas. Part of the plan was to test the nature of significant outcomes in different domains and contexts.\nOur team used Ground Penetrating Radar to scan part of the nest, then translate the data into 3D geometry to be experienced on an immersive visualization system. This provided the ability to zoom out of and into the model. The tunnel fragment could appear like a tiny crumb floating in air, or one could move inside it to view details and tunnel architecture. Exterior and interior structure could thus be perceived in a seamless way. The system enabled a kinesthetic sense — one both saw and felt surrounded by the scene. This was the first time GPR had been used to map a living ant colony. Due to this project, entomologists have begun to use GPR with encouraging results.\nThe Atta project inspired in us an enjoyment of experimentation and collaboration. Results were exhibited in international art venues, published in scientific journals, and demonstrated at hybrid venues for art and science. Each form of dissemination was suited to the host. Whether the result can be called art, science, or a blend is determined by its reception in a larger community. Like the species name and the pathway worn from tree to nest, the process of mapping the colony took the form of a palindrome: we pulled something out of the ground, passed it back and forth, and hoisted it out into the world.\nThe role of art in collaboration with science can take many forms. Art can enhance science understanding for non-scientists. Artists and scientists can co-invent new tools for inquiry. Artists are adept at creating ways to experience and understand data or phenomena through multi-modal experiences, for example, aural, haptic, or olfactory. Artists are trained to foreground the process of making as part of the “performance”—“how” one approaches the question is as important as “what tools” one chooses. The end result is always mediated by those choices. The outcome of a work depends on “ways of knowing” inherent in any larger context. Creativity and innovation are not goals in themselves, but means to enable thriving and healthy communities and a sustainable planetary civilization.",

In this work, T-matrix simulation of light scattering from spherical and spheroidal particles is used to explore the possibility of sizing particles from the total light scattering signal detected using the TAOS technique. Scattering patterns were calculated for particles that span various particle sizes, spheroidal shapes, complex refractive indices and particles orientations representative of atmospheric aerosol distributions.

            "abstract": "The role of volcano tourism is recognized as an important contributor to the economy of volcanic islands in the Lesser Antilles. However, if it is to be promoted as a sustainable sector of the tourism industry, visitors, tour operators, and vendors must be made aware of the potential health hazards facing them in volcanic environments. Volcanogenic air pollutants are of primary concern in this setting. In general, no warning signs, guidelines for recreational use, or emissions monitoring currently exists to provide warning to the public to decrease their vulnerability to the potential risks, or to minimize the liability of the agencies managing these areas. Sulphur Springs Park in Saint Lucia is a popular international destination, and concerns about the volcanic emissions and its possible health effect have been raised by visitors, staff, and management of the Park. As part of the responsibility of the UWI, Seismic Research Centre (SRC) to provide volcanic surveillance through its geothermal monitoring programme, a network was established for quantifying the ambient SO2 concentrations at Sulphur Springs in order to assess the potential risk of unsafe exposure. This effort required collaboration with the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) of Saint Lucia, as well as the staff and management of the Soufrière Regional Development Foundation (SRDF). Local personnel were trained in the active field sampling and analytical techniques required for the assessment of ambient SO2 concentrations over the monitoring period, thereby contributing to an active community-based effort. This type of approach was also thought to be an effective option for scientists to engage communities as partners in disaster risk reduction. Lessons learnt from this experience are presented for the benefit of other citizen monitoring projects, including its use as a tool for promoting volcanic hazard education, and enhancing communication and understanding between geoscientists and the community they serve.",

            "abstract": "Increases in global temperature over recent decades and projected acceleration in warming trends over the 21st century are established consequences of climate change. Possible manifestations of altered climate (e.g., more frequent, intense, and persistent temperature extremes) have resulted in a strong need to obtain information about future conditions. Under these circumstances, skillful decadal temperature predictions (DTPs) can have profound societal and economic benefits through informed planning and response.\nHowever, skillful and actionable DTPs are extremely challenging to achieve. Even though General Circulation Models (GCMs) provide decadal predictions of a number of climate variables, the direct use of GCM simulations is not encouraged because of the limited skill they exhibit. To address these shortcomings, we apply a statistical downscaling methodology to increase the GCMs’ skill in predicting decadal temperature over the continental United States. Here, we use kernel regression to establish statistical relationships between coarse resolution climate variables (predictors) and the fine resolution climate variable of interest (predictand). The climate variables used as predictors are obtained from National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data, and ‘Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model’ (PRISM) temperature data are used as predictand. Statistical relationships established over calibration period (1961-1990) are applied to retrospective decadal predictions by GCMs. The skill is quantified using a diagnostic skill score that allows the evaluation of the potential skill and conditional and unconditional biases associated with these predictions. Our approach has led to significant improvements in the prediction skill and to the removal of the biases. Results are discussed for predictions at different spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of grain-scale microstructure during the olivine to wadsleyite transformation through high pressure and temperature experiments. The grain-size evolution and the spatial distribution of newly formed fine grains during the phase transformation in the mantle transition zone have potentially large influence on the strength of a slab in the transition zone that has an important control on the slab deformation. However, most of previous experimental studies on the processes of phase transformations have focused on the kinetics of phase transformation and no experimental studies have been published on these microstructural issues. The key issues that we investigate include (i) the size of new grains and (ii) spatial distribution of new grains (critical conditions for percolation).\nWe conduct high-pressure, temperature annealing experiments and investigate the grain-scale microstructure evolution. We find that olivine transforms to wadsleyite mainly via grain boundary nucleated transformation mechanism: New grains are formed on pre-existing olivine-olivine grain-boundaries in all cases. In some runs, we identified the time for site saturation on grain-boundaries and together with the grain-size at site saturation we calculated both nucleation and growth rate. During early stages of transformation a grain boundary percolated microstructure develops and this may be very crucial in decreasing the overall strength of composite during this step. The grain size at the site saturation seems to decrease with overpressure. We also find that inadequate annealing of defects may give rise to apparent kinetic parameters interpretation of which may not be straightforward. We report inferred functional forms of nucleation and growth rate and discuss possible implications of these experimental observations on the weakening of a slab in the mantle transition zone.",

While climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, the resulting impact on recharge remains poorly understood. We quantify empirical relations between precipitation characteristics and episodic groundwater recharge for a wide variety of geographic and land-use types across North Carolina. We extract storm duration, magnitude, average rate, and storm intensity from precipitation records over periods of twelve to thirty-five years at ten locations, for a total of 3,544 individual storm events. Using time-series of water-table fluctuations from nearby monitoring wells, we estimate relative recharge to precipitation ratios (RPR) to identify statistical trends. RPR increases with increased storm duration, whereas RPR decreases with increasing magnitude, average rate, and intensity. Agricultural and urban areas exhibit the greatest decrease in RPR due to increasing storm magnitude, average rate, and intensity, while naturally vegetated areas exhibit a larger increase in RPR with increased storm duration. Though RPR is generally higher during the winter than the summer, this seasonal effect is magnified in the Appalachian and Piedmont regions. These statistical trends provide valuable insights into the likely consequences of climate and land-use change for water resources in humid, subtropical climates in the American southeast. If, as predicted, growing seasons lengthen and the intensity of storms increases with a warming climate, decreased recharge in Appalachia, the Piedmont, and rapidly growing urban areas in the region would further limit groundwater availability.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric pollutants have both beneficial and detrimental effects on carbon assimilation by land ecosystems. Aerosols promote carbon uptake by increasing diffuse radiation, while ozone damages leaf photosynthesis by oxidizing plant cells. As the world’s largest emitter of air pollutants, China experiences frequent haze episodes. In this study, we apply coupled chemistry-carbon-climate simulations using the Yale Interactive Terrestrial Biosphere Model that is embedded in the NASA ModelE2 global chemistry-climate model to quantify the combined effects of ozone and aerosol pollution on land carbon assimilation for the present and future world. The simulated land carbon cycle has been extensively evaluated at 145 FLUXNET sites globally. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface ozone are validated with satellite data and air quality monitoring data from a network of 188 Chinese sites. In the present day, we find that air pollution in China reduces net primary productivity (NPP) by 0.47 Pg C a-1 (10.8%), resulting from an increase of 0.13 Pg C a-1 (3.1%) by aerosol diffuse radiation fertilization and a decrease of 0.60 Pg C a-1 (13.9%) by ozone vegetation damage. Sensitivity simulations indicate that the effects are dominated by anthropogenic emissions. Simulations using natural precursor emissions only show minor changes in NPP. The IPCC RCP8.5 future world predicts an 18% reduction in SO2 emissions but increases of 17% in NOx and 15% in volatile organic compound emissions in 2030 relative to 2010. The emissions changes lead to reduced AOD but enhanced surface ozone over eastern China in 2030. For this future projection, we estimate a stronger NPP reduction of 0.62 Pg C a-1 (12.5%) due to air pollution in 2030. The increased future damage is a consequence of the opposing sign effects of aerosol diffuse radiation fertilization (0.13 Pg C a-1; 2.6%) and larger ozone inhibition (0.75 Pg C a-1; 15.1%).",

            "abstract": "Plant stomata couple the energy, water and carbon cycles. Photosynthesis requires stomata to open to take up carbon dioxide. In the process water vapor is released as transpiration. As atmospheric CO2 concentration rises, for the same amount of CO2 uptake, less water vapor is transpired, translating into higher water use efficiency. Reduced water vapor losses will increase soil water storage if the leaf area coverage remains similar. This will in turn alter the surface energy partitioning: more heat will be dissipated as sensible heat flux, resulting in possibly higher surface temperatures. In contrast with this common hypothesis, our study shows that the water saved during the growing season by increased WUE can be mobilized by the vegetation and help reduce the maximum temperature of mid-latitude heat waves.\nThe large scale meteorological conditions of 2003 are the basis of four regional model simulations coupling an atmospheric model to a surface model. We performed two simulations with respectively 2003 (CTL) and 2100 (FUT) atmospheric CO2 applied to both the atmospheric and surface models. A third (RAD) and a fourth (FER) simulations are run with 2100 CO2 concentration applied to respectively the atmospheric model only and the surface model only. RAD investigates the impact of the radiative forcing, and FER the response to vegetation CO2 fertilization.\nOur results show that the water saved through higher water use efficiency during the growing season enabled by higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations helps the vegetation to cope during severe heat and dryness conditions in the summer of mid-latitude climate.

            "abstract": "Coastal regions of eutrophication-driven oxygen depletion are widespread and increasing in number. Also known as dead zones, these regions take their name from the deleterious effects of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen less than 2 mg/L) on shrimp, demersal fish, and other animal life. Dead zones result from nutrient enrichment of primary production, concomitant consumption by chemoorganotrophic aerobic microorganisms, and strong stratification that prevents ventilation of bottom water. One of the largest dead zones in the world occurs seasonally in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), where hypoxia can reach up to 22,000 square kilometers. While this dead zone shares many features with more well-known marine oxygen minimum zones, it is nevertheless understudied with regards to the microbial assemblages involved in biogeochemical cycling. We performed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on six samples from the 2013 nGOM dead zone from both hypoxic and oxic bottom waters. Assembly and binning led to the recovery of over fifty partial to nearly complete metagenomes from key microbial taxa previously determined to be numerically abundant from 16S rRNA data, such as Thaumarcheaota, Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, SAR406, SAR324, Synechococcus spp., and Planctomycetes. These results provide information about the roles of these taxa in the nGOM dead zone, and opportunities for comparing this region of low oxygen to others around the globe.",

            "abstract": "A critical aspect of geologic carbon storage, a carbon-emissions reduction method under extensive review and testing, is effective multiphase CO2 flow and transport simulation. Relative permeability is a flow parameter particularly critical for accurate forecasting of multiphase behavior of CO2 in the subsurface. The relative per­meability relationship assumed and especially the irreducible saturation of the gas phase greatly impacts predicted CO2 trapping mechanisms and long-term plume migration behavior.\nA primary goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of relative permeability on efficacy of regional-scale CO2 sequestration models. To accomplish this we built a 2-D vertical cross-section of the San Rafael Swell area of East-central Utah. This model simulated injection of CO2 into a brine aquifer for 30 years. The well was then shut-in and the CO2 plume behavior monitored for another 970 years. We evaluated five different relative permeability relationships to quantify their relative impacts on forecasted flow results of the model, with all other parameters maintained uniform and constant.\nResults of this analysis suggest that CO2 plume movement and behavior are significantly dependent on the specific relative permeability formulation assigned, including the assumed irreducible saturation values of CO2 and brine. More specifically, different relative permea­bility relationships translate to significant differences in CO2 plume behavior and corresponding trapping mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Bioenergy is the most important renewable energy option in studies designed to align with future RCP projections, reaching approximately 250 EJ/yr in RCP2.6, 145 EJ/yr in RCP4.5 and 180 EJ/yr in RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century. However, many questions enveloping the direct carbon cycle and climate response to bioenergy remain partially unexplored. Bioenergy systems are largely assessed under the default climate neutrality assumption and the time lag between CO2 emissions from biomass combustion and CO2 uptake by vegetation is usually ignored. Emission metrics of CO2 from forest bioenergy are only available on a case-specific basis and their quantification requires processing of a wide spectrum of modelled or observed local climate and forest conditions. On the other hand, emission metrics are widely used to aggregate climate impacts of greenhouse gases to common units such as CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq.), but a spatially explicit analysis of emission metrics with global forest coverage is today lacking. Examples of emission metrics include the global warming potential (GWP), the global temperature change potential (GTP) and the absolute sustained emission temperature (aSET). Here, we couple a global forest model, a heterotrophic respiration model, and a global climate model to produce global spatially explicit emission metrics for CO2 emissions from forest bioenergy. We show their applications to global emissions in 2015 and until 2100 under the different RCP scenarios. We obtain global average values of 0.49 ± 0.03 kgCO2-eq. kgCO2-1 (mean ± standard deviation), 0.05 ± 0.05 kgCO2-eq. kgCO2-1, and 2.14·10-14 ± 0.11·10-14 °C (kg yr-1)-1, and 2.14·10-14 ± 0.11·10-14 °C (kg yr-1)-1 for GWP, GTP and aSET, respectively. We also present results aggregated at a grid, national and continental level. The metrics are found to correlate with the site-specific turnover times and local climate variables like annual mean temperature and precipitation. Simplified equations are derived to infer metric values from the turnover time of the biomass feedstock and the fraction of forest residues left on site after harvest. Our results provide a basis for assessing CO2 emissions from forest bioenergy under different indicators and across various spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "The extreme rainstorms that occurred in Colorado in September 2013 initiated numerous debris flows in the northern Front Range. These flows delivered sediment to upland streams, impacted buildings and infrastructure in and near Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), and underscored the importance of ongoing hazards in mountainous areas. Slope failures occurred primarily at elevations above 2600 m on south facing slopes >40 degrees. The 2013 failures provide a valuable opportunity to better understand site-specific geomorphic variables that control slope failure in the interior United States and the frequency of debris flows in steep terrain. Slope characteristics including soil depth, vegetation type and prevalence, contributing area, slope convexity/concavity and soil texture were compared between 11 debris flow sites and 30 control sites that did not fail in RMNP. This analysis indicates that slope morphology is the primary controlling factor: 45% of the debris flow sites initiated in or below a colluvial hollow and 36% of the failed sites initiated in other areas of convergent hillslope topography. Only one of the 30 control sites (3%) was located within a colluvial hollow and only two control sites (6%) were located in other areas of convergent topography. Difference in the average maximum soil thickness between debris flow sites (0.9 m) and control sites (0.7 m) is not significant but may reflect the difficulty of using a soil probe in glacially derived soils. Additional research includes field mapping and geochronologic study at one 2013 debris deposit with evidence of multiple mass movements. Preliminary results from the mapping indicate that up to six debris flows have occurred at this site. Radiocarbon analysis of organic material and 10Be analysis of quartz from boulders in old debris levees indicate the timing of past events in this area. Future land management in RMNP will utilize this understanding of controls on slope failure and event frequency.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the dynamic dusk side magnetopause show abundant evidence for the passage of surfaces waves that may have been created or amplified by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). That instability is fed by the flow shear of plasma across the magnetopause boundary. Wave amplification by the KHI involves steepening of the waves’ leading edges, which precedes wave breaking and conversion into KH vortices. Indeed, magnetopause surface waves featuring steeper leading edges have been observed in numerous occasions. By contrast, observations of steeper trailing edges in magnetopause surface waves are rare, and it is unclear how they develop. Chen et al. [J. Geophys. Res., 98, 5727 (1993)] suggested that this inverse wave steepening could originate from the release of magnetic tension in the magnetosheath (plasma depletion layer), based on ISEE measurements. However, more recent findings by Plaschke et al. [J. Geophys. Res., 118, 1483 (2013)] based on THEMIS multi-spacecraft measurements suggest that this explanation may not always be applicable.\nNew light can be shed on this phenomenon by the newly launched Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, which consists of four spacecraft that measure fields and particles with unprecedented time resolution. On July 9th, the MMS spacecraft began to obtain data regularly in a small-scale tetrahedron of about 160 km on a side. This tetrahedron may with time be further reduced to a size of about 10 km on a side. In this tetrahedral configuration, when close to apogee, the spacecraft stay in the (dusk side) magnetopause region over long periods of time, making possible a routine determination of wave steepness by timing analysis. We present a study thereof, relating our findings to local magnetospheric/magnetosheath and upstream conditions.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater position, abundance, and flow rates within a volcano affect the transmission of fluid pressure, transport of mass and heat and formation of mechanically weak hydrothermal alteration influencing the stability of volcanoes. In addition, eruptions can shatter volcanic rocks, weakening the edifice. Helicopter magnetic and electromagnetic (HEM) data collected over Mt. Baker and Mt. St. Helens volcanoes reveal the distribution of water, shattered volcanic rocks and hydrothermal alteration essential to evaluating volcanic landslide hazards. These data, combined with geological mapping and rock property measurements, indicate the presence of localized <100 m thick zones of water-saturated hydrothermally altered rock beneath Sherman Crater and the Dorr Fumarole Fields at Mt. Baker. Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that the hydrothermal clays contain ~50% bound water with no evidence for free water ponded beneath the ice. The HEM data suggest water-saturated fresh volcanic rocks from the surface to the detection limit (~100 m) over the entire summit of Mt. Baker (below the ice). A 50-100 m thick high resistivity layer (>1500 ohm-m) corresponding to domes, debris avalanche, volcanic rocks and glaciers mantles the crater at Mt. St. Helens. Shallow low resistivity layers corresponding to fresh, cold water and hot brines are observed below the high resistivity surface in EM data. Shallow ground water mainly concentrates in shattered dome material in the crater of Mt. St. Helens. Aeromagnetic data indicate the location of basalts sandwiched between debris avalanche deposits and shattered dome material. The combination of the EM and magnetic data help map the location of the shattered dome material that is considered to be the failure surface for the 1980 debris avalanche. The EM data image the regional groundwater table near the base of the volcano. The geophysical identification of groundwater and weak layers constrain landslide hazards assessments.",

            "abstract": "Green infrastructures (GI) are becoming more important for urban stormwater control worldwide. However, relatively few studies focus on researching the specific designs of GI at household scale. This study assesses the hydrological performance and cost-effectiveness of different GI designs, namely green roofs, bioretention systems and porous pavements. It aims to generate generic insights by comparing the optimal designs of each GI in 2-year and 50-year storms of Hong Kong, China and Seattle, US. EPA SWMM is first used to simulate the hydrologic performance, in particular, the peak runoff reduction of thousands of GI designs. Then, life cycle costs of the designs are computed and their effectiveness, in terms of peak runoff reduction percentage per thousand dollars, is compared. The peak runoff reduction increases almost linearly with costs for green roofs. However, for bioretention systems and porous pavements, peak runoff reduction only increases significantly with costs in the mid values. For achieving the same peak runoff reduction percentage, the optimal soil depth of green roofs increases with the design storm, while surface area does not change significantly. On the other hand, for bioretention systems and porous pavements, the optimal surface area increases with the design storm, while thickness does not change significantly. In general, the cost effectiveness of porous pavements is highest, followed by bioretention systems and then green roofs. The cost effectiveness is higher for a smaller storm, and is thus higher for 2-year storm than 50-year storm, and is also higher for Seattle when compared to Hong Kong. This study allows us to better understand the hydrological performance and cost-effectiveness of different GI designs. It facilitates the implementation of optimal choice and design of each specific GI for stormwater mitigation.",

            "abstract": "In most soils, there is a general positive correlation between clay and carbon content laterally through the landscape. Clay serves to both physically and chemically protect carbon from decompositional processes. However, in some of the highly weathered, naturally acidic soils, such as those located in the southern piedmont area of the US, these trends do not necessarily hold true. We conducted two transects through a clay rich soil dominated by montmorillonite and another through a soil dominated by non-active clays and iron oxides in order to compare trends in both particle size distributions and carbon and nitrogen content using both a laser particle size distribution system and an elemental analyzer. The montmorillonite rich soils contain a higher pH due to the alkaline nature of the parent rock (gabbro) and reveal a negative correlation between clay content and carbon storage. The trends also hold true for the non-active clay soils suggesting that the negative correlations are not necessarily linked to clay chemistry. The absence of a difference in nitrogen and carbon percentages within the different clays proves to be significant because it shows that the clay chemistry is not solely responsible for a positive correlation between clay and carbon content. These results reiterate the complexity of carbon storage processes within the piedmont soil system.",

            "abstract": "Since 1983, Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, has erupted almost continuously from vents on the East Rift Zone—at 32 years and counting, this is the longest-duration eruption in the past 500 years. Although forecasting the onset of eruptive activity using geophysical, geochemical, and geological monitoring has been demonstrated repeatedly at Kīlauea and elsewhere, little progress has been made in forecasting an eruption’s waning or end, particularly in the case of long-lived eruptions. This is especially important at Kīlauea for at least two reasons: (1) caldera formation at the end of another decades-long eruption, in the 15th century, raises the possibility of a link between eruption duration and caldera formation; and (2) long-lived eruptions can have an enduring effect on local population and infrastructure, as demonstrated by the repeated destruction of property by Kīlauea’s ongoing rift zone eruption.\nData from the past 15 years indicate that the magma supply rate to Kīlauea is an important control on eruptive activity. Joint inversions of geophysical, geochemical, and geological observations demonstrate that in 2006 the supply rate was nearly double that of 2000-2001, resulting in an increase in lava discharge, summit inflation, and the formation of new eruptive vents. In contrast, the magma supply during 2012, and likely through 2014, was less than that of 2000-2001. This lower supply rate was associated with a lower lava discharge and may have played a role in the stalling of lava flows above population centers in the Puna District during 2014–2015. Heightened eruptive vigor may be expected if magma supply increases in the future; however, a further decrease in supply rate—which is likely already below the long-term average—may result in cessation of the eruption. Multidisciplinary monitoring, and particularly tracking of CO2 emissions and surface deformation, should be able to detect changes in supply rate before they are strongly manifested at the surface.",

            "abstract": "During the last 15 years, the IBERSEIS and ALCUDIA controlled source experiments have acquired vertical incidence and wide angle seismic reflection data in southwest Spain, in the Variscan Sub-Portuguese, Ossa-Morena and Central-Iberian Zones. Apart from providing detailed information of the crust, these datasets have also imaged a conspicuous sub-crustal reflector. First identified on the IBERSEIS wide-angle reflection dataset, this interface seemed to feature a positive seismic impedance contrast. A boundary located between 61-72 km depth, with a Vp increase from 8.2 km/s to 8.3 km/s allowed us to model clear wide-angle reflections found above 180 km offsets. The fact that this reflector was not identified in the coincident vertical incidence dataset led us to interpret it as a gradient zone. A correlation with the ‘Hales gradient zone’, i.e. the boundary between spinel and garnet peridotites was our preferred interpretation.\nThe ALCUDIA experiment, later acquired northwards of the IBERSEIS profiles, also shows prominent sub-crustal arrivals with the same characteristics as those observed in the IBERSEIS wide-angle data. However, these reflections also appear, locally and at 19 s TWT, in the vertical incidence dataset, further constraining the depth at which this feature is located. In addition, the ALCUDIA wide-angle dataset shows deeper sub-horizontal reflectivity (at Vred=8 km/s) that maybe preliminarily associated with mantle anisotropy or even, with the lithosphere-astenosphere boundary.\nIntegration of the information provided by the IBERSEIS and ALCUDIA datasets with older and lower resolution data from the ILIHA project, where three sub-crustal phases were identified in SW Iberia, allows us to conclude that, in this area, mantle reflectivity is outstanding. Also, modeling of all the datasets contributes to map, at a regional scale, the Hales discontinuity or gradient zone in southwest Iberia. Further research, involving receiver function analysis is necessary to propose a model of the mantle in this privileged area in terms of reflectivity.",

To that end, we have recently improved the representation of firn in CESM. We increased the vertical thickness of snow, which enhances the buffering of meltwater through refreezing, and firn density, to allow for wind-induced snow compaction. Other model improvements focused on atmospheric clouds; the most recent CESM atmosphere model allows for more liquid water in clouds, which increases positive longwave cloud forcing, and has profound and beneficial impact on the ice sheet surface radiation balance. In this contribution, we will show that the above improvements enable a realistic CESM simulation of both Greenland and Antarctic SMB. This allows for analysis of future evolution of ice sheet SMB and the interactions between ice sheets and other components of the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires are natural disturbances vital to many ecosystems, however with longer wildfire seasons, increasing annual area burned, and higher fire severity associated with forest densification, concern has risen about the potential effect of fire on water supplies. The magnitude and timespan of wildfire impacts on hydrology vary considerably with geographic region depending on pre-fire conditions, fire severity, and post-fire precipitation patterns. According to estimates, approximately 50% of freshwater resources in the contiguous United States (CONUS) originate in forest watersheds, and therefore it is essential to understand how wildfires affect the hydrologic cycle, in particular peak flows, base flows, annual water yields and timing of availability of water. We here present an approach in which we combined long stream flow records with a 30-year burn severity dataset and digital elevation models in order to evaluate for 30 watersheds across the CONUS changes in flow regime observed after a major fire. Flow change was positively correlated with the fraction of the watershed burned, which in turn was correlated with the mean slope of the watershed. Predictions based on a monthly empirical rainfall-runoff model and a water balance model (WaSSI) showed that depending on topography, species composition and fire history, post-fire stream flow was higher than predicted in 15 watersheds, lower than predicted in 9 watersheds, and unchanged in 12 watersheds (p<0.05). The outcome of this analysis allows us to identify watersheds that are most sensitive to wildfire impacts.",

            "abstract": "Those who have experienced a total solar eclipse will travel to every corner of the Earth to observe one, such is its spectacular nature. So it is fortunate indeed to have this remarkable event come to the U.S. in less than two years, with its path of totality from Oregon to South Carolina within a day's drive for most of the nation's population. The date of the 21 August 2017 \"Great American Eclipse\" is rapidly approaching, and with focus on science literacy in U.S. schools greater than ever, educational and public outreach (EPO) must begin in earnest to maximize the scientific and educational benefits from this rare event. As every location in the U.S. will observe at least a partial eclipse, having EPO strategies in place ensures that the greatest number of students and other observers throughout the country will: a) be aware of and prepared for this event, b) observe (and record) it safely and knowledgeably, and c) gain an increased awareness of the natural world. The need for teachers to promote scientific literacy through curriculum is critical for this event. Despite an increased presence of technology in the classroom, more rigorous educational learning standards and virtually instantaneous access to information, data show that science illiteracy in U.S. schools and in the general population is still widespread. In addition, much fear, ignorance and confusion continue to surround eclipses. Many school districts plan to keep students indoors during the eclipse, while the media can be expected to instruct the public to do the same, thus depriving would-be observers of an unforgettable and most likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It would be a tragedy on many levels if this eclipse were not viewed, recorded and remembered live and outdoors--not indoors watching on media--by as many persons as possible. Proper EPO strategies performed with ample lead time can ensure that the 2017 U.S. Total Solar Eclipse will be a success from coast-to-coast, and with it, a heightened level of scientific awareness among the educational community and general public alike.

            "abstract": "This paper will present the results of large-scale three-dimensional calculations simulating the hydrological-mechanical behavior of a CO2injection reservoir and the resulting effects on wellbore casings and sealant repair materials. A critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations in local stress that can compromise seal integrity. The DOE-NETL project “Wellbore Seal Repair Using Nanocomposite Materials,” is interested in the stress-strain history of abandoned wells, as well as changes in local pressure, stress, and temperature conditions that accompany carbon dioxide injection or brine extraction.\nTwo distinct computational models comprise the current modeling effort. The first is a field scale model that uses the stratigraphy, material properties, and injection history from a pilot CO2injection operation in Cranfield, MS to develop a stress-strain history for wellbore locations from 100 to 400 meters from an injection well. The results from the field scale model are used as input to a more detailed model of a wellbore casing. The 3D wellbore model examines the impacts of various loading scenarios on a casing structure. This model has been developed in conjunction with bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up being used to test candidate seal repair materials. The results from these models will be used to estimate the necessary mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) under Grant Number DE-FE0009562.

            "abstract": "Agricultural production remains particularly vulnerable to weather fluctuations and extreme events, such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Crop insurance is a risk management tool that has been developed to mitigate some of this weather risk and protect farmer income in times of poor production. However, it is not clear what the implications of crop insurance are for crop irrigation. By providing a guaranteed level of income in case of crop failure, crop insurance can reduce the farmer's incentive to irrigate. Thus, crop insurance can decrease water use in times of drought and promote water sustainability. However, to minimize this “moral hazard”, the insurer may require farmers to irrigate crops more than necessary. Further, by shifting crop production, crop insurance may increase demand for water. Thus, it is unclear whether crop insurance increases or decreases crop water use. Here, we determine the empirical relationship between crop insurance and irrigation withdrawals in the United States. To establish causality, we exploit variation in crop insurance policies over time, using an instrumental variables approach. We find that a 1% increase in insured crop acreage leads to a 0.223% increase in irrigation withdrawals, primarily from groundwater aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Element partitioning is probably the most important concept in geochemistry. However some fundamental issues on element partitioning are poorly understood or misinterpreted or misused. In this presentation, I will discuss two issues. First, the dependence of (trace) element partitioning on the properties of trace element has been understood incompletely (or incorrectly). A strain energy model is a good approximation, but in all previous models, only the influence of the size of trace element is considered. As a result, the influence of “stiffness” of the trace element was ignored and the physical meaning of elastic constants in the theory was vaguely described as “site-elasticity”. I developed a modified model in which the influence of the stiffness of the trace element is included with the correct boundary conditions. The incorporation of the influence of stiffness of trace element is critical particularly in a case where the trace element is soft, e.g., a case of noble gas. The new model provides better explanation of the observed element partitioning. Second, the influence of selective dissolution of a trace element in the melt is often ignored. It is well known that the solubility of noble gas in the melt strongly depends on its atomic size. In contrast, the dependence of trace element solubility on its size is not well known but usually ignored. I developed a conceptual model to explain why noble gas solubility is strongly size dependent but not for the solubility of other charged trace elements.\nThese two shortcomings in the previous models are serious when the partitioning of noble gas elements is considered. Some applications of these models will be discussed including the behavior of the noble gases during melting and solidification and the evaluation of water content and its influence on the rheological properties of the lithosphere.",

The new spectrometer will provide solar SXR measurements of absolute irradiance in the 1.0 to 7.0 nm range spectrally resolved into bands narrower than 1 nm – measurements that are not available from existing solar-observing instruments but are important for studying and modeling coronal dynamics and the Sun-Earth’s connection, e.g. the Earth’s Ionosphere.\nFor the proposed SXR spectrometer we will introduce a transmission grating based on novel Nanowriter Electron-Beam Nanofabrication technology developed at the Center for X-ray Optics (CXRO) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The CXRO technology has been used in the fabrication of X-ray zone plates with feature sizes as small as 25 nm in optical elements with overall sizes on the order of 1 cm. The CXRO technology has significant flexibility in terms of pattern geometry, and is thus capable of producing linear transmission gratings with aperture sizes similar to SEM and ESP but with four times the dispersion. With such dispersion, reasonable spectral resolution (< 1nm) can be obtained using commercial off-the shelf (COTS) X-ray sensitive AXUV type silicon photodiodes from the Optodiode Corp. in an instrument with overall size and mass similar to that of SEM or ESP.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has been collecting global L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperature observations every 1-3 days since 31 March 2015. These observations are sensitive to soil moisture and soil temperature in the near-surface layer. They are used in the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) land data assimilation system to generate the Level 4 Soil Moisture (L4_SM) product, which provides 3-hourly, 9-km resolution, global estimates of surface (0-5 cm) and root zone (0-100 cm) soil moisture along with related land surface states and fluxes with a latency of ~3 days. This presentation investigates the soil moisture analysis underlying the L4_SM product. The soil moisture analysis converts the differences between model-predicted brightness temperatures and SMAP observations into adjustments (or increments) to the modeled soil moisture state based on error correlations between the modeled and observed variables. The analysis (i) uses an ensemble approach, (ii) is spatially distributed, (iii) performs downscaling from the resolution of the observations to the of the model, and (iv) respects the relative uncertainties of the modeled and observed brightness temperatures, thereby resulting in soil moisture estimates that meet the root-mean-square error target of 0.04 m3/m3 (after removal of the long-term mean differences). The early results presented here focus on an in-depth investigation of the observation-minus-forecast residuals, which reveals modest biases in the assimilation system. Furthermore, the investigation demonstrates where the assimilation system overestimates or underestimates the actual errors in the system. Finally, the increments that are applied to the model states are investigated.",

            "abstract": "Fire in the natural environment has been shown not only to alter the above and below ground carbon stocks, but can also play a role in altering the mineralogy of the geologic material in which it comes in contact. Our work seeks to utilize the nature of these changes in mineralogy on a small scale to seek a relationship between fire intensity and clay mineralogy in the landscape by using locations of past fires and modern analogues. During approximately 1260-1400 AD, the Hopi Indian Tribe had a settlement named Chevelon located near Winslow, Arizona on the high plains of the Sonoran Desert. Due to abundant ash deposits and the highly oxidized nature of some of the walls of this structure, it is thought this location was burned and subsequently abandoned near 1400 AD. To help understand the burning process, archeologists created the Homolovi structure, which is a modern day analogue to the Chevelon structure, which was burned in 2006 by loading with the fuel that would have likely been used by the tribe during that time. Samples were collected from the wall and floor from both structures to help find possible correlations between the structures that could explain the type of fire that occurred at the Chevelon site. Our research is using clay chemistry as a tool to investigate fire intensity in an archeological context. Powder x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to help identify clay mineralogy. Our results suggest that majority of the clay mixture contains quartz, calcite, illite, and an iron oxide. Standards of these minerals were then placed in a muffle furnace for 6 hours at temperatures beginning at 100°C and increasing in increments of 100°C until reaching 600°C to simulate a high fire intensity that would occur from an intentionally set fire. The samples were then studied using a powder x-ray diffractometer and SEM to understand clay chemistry of these minerals at increasing temperatures, and then compared to the samples from the Chevelon and Homolovi structures to get an understanding of both fire intensities. Our work suggests that there are progressive changes in O/Si ratios with temperature in silicates that may be useful in tracing temperature of the sediments during fire events. This may provide additional insight to archeological studies at other sites where fire structures are present.",

            "abstract": "The Lower Mississippi River Basin is one of the major agricultural production regions in the United States producing over two-thirds of the rice, nearly half of sugarcane produced in the U.S., as well as significant amounts of soybeans, corn, and cotton. While the region experiences over 50 inches of precipitation annually, reaching yield potential for crops requires irrigation. Approximately 75% of crop acres in the alluvial valley are irrigated, and the expectation is that all acreage will eventually be irrigated. Currently over 90% of water for crop irrigation is derived from the shallow alluvial aquifer outpacing net recharge by several million acre-feet per year. This has resulted in severe groundwater declines in Arkansas and an increasingly threatening situation in northwestern Mississippi. In Mississippi, direct injection has received increasing attention as a means of artificial recharge, though water quality remains a concern both for the integrity of the aquifer and efficiency of injection. This project considers the use of pumping wells near major rivers known to be in connection with the aquifer to induce additional infiltration of surface water by steepening local gradients. The pumped water would be transferred by pipeline to areas within the regional cone of depression where it is then injected to enhance groundwater recharge. Groundwater flow modeling with zone budget analysis is used to evaluate the potential for net supply gains from induced infiltration at potential sites along major rivers in the region. The groundwater model will further evaluate the impact of the transfer and direct injection on regional water tables.",

We demonstrate this approach using the coastal communities of Aberdeen, Hoquiam, and Cosmopolis in southwestern Grays Harbor County, Washington (USA), where previous research suggests approximately 20,500 people (99% of the residents in tsunami-hazard zones) will likely have enough time to evacuate before tsunami-wave arrival. Geospatial, anisotropic, path distance models were developed to map the most efficient pedestrian paths to higher ground from locations within the tsunami-hazard zone. This information was then used to identify evacuation basins, outlining neighborhoods sharing a common evacuation pathway to safety. We then estimated the number of people traveling along designated evacuation pathways and arriving at pre-determined safe assembly areas, helping determine shelter demand and relief support (e.g., for elderly individuals or tourists). Finally, we assessed which paths may become inaccessible due to earthquake-induced ground failures, a factor which may impact an individual’s success in reaching safe ground. The presentation will include a discussion of the implications of our analysis for developing more comprehensive coastal community tsunami-evacuation planning strategies worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Slip rates along faults are necessarily time-averaged, calculated by measuring the offset of a feature of known age. Paleoshorelines of pluvial lakes in the Basin and Range are ideal features to use in slip rate calculations, because they (1) are basin-wide, paleohorizontal features that cross faults; (2) can often be precisely dated; and (3) are easily mapped with high-resolution topographic data.\nSurprise Valley in the NW Basin and Range is bounded by the active, 90-km long Surprise Valley fault (SVF); the valley also hosted a Pleistocene pluvial lake. Using lidar-derived elevation models, we mapped and measured surface offset across fault scarps and across-basin vertical offsets of dated paleoshorelines that range in age from ~12-30 ka. Paleoshorelines dated at 19.44 ± 1.46 ka in the northernmost 40 km of the SVF are offset 4.74 m, indicating a slip rate of 0.28 mm/yr (assuming a fault angle of 60°). Offset of 16.48 ± 0.87 ka paleoshorelines along the central, 25 km-long segment is 14.38 m, a slip rate of 1.01 mm/yr; offset of 20.85 ± 1.84 ka paleoshorelines along the southernmost segment is 11.5 m, a slip rate of 0.64 mm/yr. In comparison, previous work measurements of offset and slip rate derived from geologic mapping and trenching estimate a slip rate of 0.6 mm/yr for the entire SVF.\nThe central segment of the SVF has the largest amount of slip and greatest slip rate; both die out towards the fault tips, as expected, though the pattern is asymmetric, suggesting the central and southern segments are acting independently from the northern segment and may be a barrier to earthquake rupture. Additionally, we note that earthquakes occur in a cluster as the paleolake regressed from its most recent highstand, suggesting that slip rate varies through time. These high-resolution datasets allow us to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of strain accommodation and the earthquake cycle in the northwestern Basin and Range.",

            "abstract": "Cratons, the ancient cores of the continents, are the longest-lived parts of Earth's surface that have survived thermal and mechanical erosion during multiple Wilson cycles. They are visible in tomographic images due to their thick (>200km), seismically fast keels or roots. The Laurentian keel beneath North America is intriguing since its root is thought to extend beneath both the Archean Superior craton and the Proterozoic Grenville province thus implying that keel formation may not have been restricted to Archean times.\nIn order to address this issue we present a P and S wave relative arrival-time tomographic study using data from seismograph networks in SE Canada and the NE US, stretching from the southern tip of Hudson Bay within the Superior craton to the coastal Phanerozoic Appalachian terranes. The tomographic images display three broad zones of increasing mantle wavespeed from globally “slow\" in the Appalachian terranes, to a “fast\" Grenville Province and “extremely fast\" Superior craton. We observe a linear low-velocity feature resulting from modification of the Laurentian keel by the passage of the Great Meteor hotspot. This feature is progressively offset southwestward with depth, potentially due to viscous coupling with mantle flow. No major plate-scale underthrusting during the Grenville Orogeny is apparent, which contradicts the inferred results from crustal seismic reflection and refraction studies. Our results therefore may have fundamental implications for the nature of the Grenville orogenic collision and cratonic stabilization of North America. The results also support the developing consensus that keels form in two stages: a chemically depleted core of Archean age followed by a thermally developed, less-depleted lithosphere during Proterozoic times, highlighted by an abrupt wavespeed contrast in the tomographic images.",

            "abstract": "Damage zones of active faults control their resistance to rupture and transport properties. Hence, knowing the damage’s origin is crucial to shed light on the (paleo)seismic behavior of the fault. Coseismic damage in the damage zone occurs by stress-wave loading of a passing earthquake rupture tip, resulting in dynamic (high strain rate) loading and subsequent dynamic fracturing or pulverization. Recently, interest in this type of damage has increased and several experimental studies were performed on dry rock specimens to search for pulverization-controlling parameters. However, the influence of fluids in during dynamic loading needs to be constrained.\nHence, we have performed compressional dynamic loading experiments on water saturated and oven dried Vosges sandstone samples using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus. Due to the high porosity in these rocks, close to 20%, the effect of fluids should be clear. Afterwards, microstructural analyses have been applied on thin sections.\nWater saturated samples reveal dynamic mechanical behavior that follows linear poro-elasticity for undrained conditions: the peak strength of the sample decreases by 30-50% and the accumulated strain increases relative to the dry samples that were tested under similar conditions. The mechanical behavior of partially saturated samples falls in between.\nMicrostructural studies on thin section show that fractures are restricted to some quartz grains while other quartz grains remain intact, similar to co-seismically damaged sandstones observed in the field. Most deformation is accommodated by inter-granular processes, thereby appointing an important role to the cement matrix in between grains. Intra-granular fracture damage is highest for the saturated samples.\nThe presence of pore fluids in the rocks lower the dynamic peak strength, especially since fast dynamic loading does not allow for time-dependent fluid dissipation. Thus, fluid-saturated rocks would show undrained mechanical behavior, creating local overpressure in the pore that breaks the inter-granular cement. This strength-decreasing effect provides an explanation for the presence of pulverized and coseismically damaged rocks at depth and extends the range of dynamic stress where dynamic damage can occur in fault zones.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol remote sensing techniques and back-trajectory modeling can be combined to identify aerosol types. We have clustered 7 years of AERONET aerosol signals using trajectory analysis to identify dominant aerosol sources at two AERONET sites in West Africa: Ilorin (4.34 oE, 8.32 oN) and Djougou (1.60 oE, 9.76 oN). Of particular interest are air masses that have passed through the gas flaring region in the Niger Delta area, of Nigeria, en-route the AERONET sites. 7-day back trajectories were calculated using the UK UGAMP trajectory model driven by ECMWF wind analyses data. Dominant sources identified, using literature classifications, are desert dust (DD), Biomass burning (BB) and Urban-Industrial (UI). Below, we use a combination of synoptic trajectories and aerosol optical properties to distinguish a fourth source: that due to gas flaring.\nGas flaring, (GF) the disposal of gas through stack in an open-air flame, is believed to be a prominent source of black carbon (BC) and greenhouse gases. For these different aerosol source signatures, single scattering albedo (SSA), refractive index , extinction Angstrom exponent (EEA) and absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) were used to classify the light absorption characteristics of the aerosols for λ = 440, 675, 870 and1020 nm. A total of 1625 daily averages of aerosol data were collected for the two sites. Of which 245 make up the GF cluster for both sites.\nFor GF cluster, the range of fine-mode fraction is 0.4 – 0.7. Average values SSA(λ), for the total and GF clusters are 0.90(440), 0.93(675), 0.95(870) and 0.96(1020), and 0.93(440), 0.92(675), 0.9(870) and 0.9(1020), respectively. Values of for the GF clusters for both sites are 0.62 – 1.11, compared to 1.28 – 1.66 for the remainder of the clusters, which strongly indicates the dominance of carbonaceous particles (BC), typical of a highly industrial area. An average value of 1.58 for the real part of the refractive index at low SSA for aerosol in the GF cluster is also an indicator of high BC content. Extinction Angstrom exponent, is an indicator of the particle size. EAE values of 0.95-1.32 for aerosol in the GF cluster shows that the aerosols are mainly fine or accumulation mode while values of EAE (0.36-0.6) for the other cluster indicate coarse mode domination of the aerosol.

The model is based on the linearized momentum/mass balance equations, and explicitly relates the transport of water between links of the river network and their surrounding hillslopes at the event time scale. The precipitation input, specified at the hillslope scale, is a steady marked Poisson point process with storm intensities of arbitrary distribution. A stochastic differential equation for the joint evolution of streamflow and runoff at every link of the river network is explicitly solved, and the associated invariant distribution characterized. The results explicitly show how the geometry of the river network, the storage dynamics of rivers and hillslopes, and the probabilistic properties of the rainfall field, conspire to shape the steady hydrological response of the watershed, along with its associated uncertainty. As an application, new formulas for the n-th moment of the streamflow are derived, as well as exact asymptotics of extreme discharge events. Consequently, the model offers insights about the long-term effects of a changing precipitation regime, over the streamflow distribution on an arbitrary watershed.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic rifted margins are characterized by massive igneous activity originating from the rift margin, characterized by seaward dipping reflectors. These consist of basalt flows and associated magmatic products, from deep magma chambers imaged on seismic data as High Velocity Bodies (HVB) with seismic velocities between 7 and 7.5 km/s. The relationship between rifting and decompression melting have been well quantified, using the HVB’s as constraints on magmatic production to match extension models. Crucial in this approach are the relationship between extension and mantle plumes, with HVB’s generated by mantle plumes often indicative of velocities between 7.5 – 7.8 km/s.\nHere I address information that can be obtained from sill complexes in sedimentary basins associated with rifting, representing the earliest phase of magmatism. I use a simple crustal scale hydrostatic model for dikes while incorporating the presence of sills by calculating magmatic overpressures from differences in pressure gradients. It transpires that the presence of sills as observed on seismic reflection and outcrop data, can be predicted. Modelling further suggests that the source of these sill complexes are large magma chambers at or near the Moho, and equate to HVB’s observed on seismic data. Utilizing simple mass balance calculations, the ratio of cumulate thickness (from HVB thickness) and expelled melt (from accumulated sill thicknesses) can be related to MgO content in expelled liquids, primary magma and cumulates. Higher MgO content translates in higher seismic velocities. Thus, HVB velocity can subsequently be used to discriminate between mantle plume, or shallow rift related melting.\nThe theory is applied to various basins bordering the northern North Atlantic (Vøring Basin, Jameson Land Basin and Rockall Basin) and South Atlantic rifts (Namibia), associated with the Paleocene/Eocene Iceland mantle plume and the Early Cretaceous Tristan da Cunha mantle plume magmatism respectively.",

            "abstract": "Isochemical hydration of forsterite will produce an equimolar serpentine + brucite assemblage with no net change in fluid pH. However, brucite is often absent within serpentinites due to contemporaneous or later-stage Si metasomatism. To study this “other half” of the serpentinization process, we injected Si-enriched, Mg-free evolved seawater with an initial pH of 7.97 at a Darcy velocity of 1.3 km/yr into a brucite-lined fracture at 150°C for 167 hours. FTIR, XRCT, EDS, XRD, and fluid chemistry data indicate strong Si uptake and lizardite crystallization, particularly when pH of the reacting fluid rises above ~8.5. In this regard, our experimental design offers a unique perspective on the mechanism of serpentinization: our relatively high fluid flux and relatively low temperature push the reaction out of the typical water transport-limited regime into the reaction rate-limited regime. In this regime, it appears that the rates of brucite dissolution outstrip the rates of serpentine precipitation, consistent with literature kinetic data. Thus, when brucite-fluid interfacial area is large, the Si-metasomatic component of serpentinization proceeds by way of a brucite dissolution step rather than direct addition of Si to the brucite structure. However, in later stages of the experiment, brucite reactivity and Si-uptake slow dramatically, consistent with a more diffusive control on reaction progress. The early reaction scheme is in agreement with literature measurements of considerable Mg isotope fractionation during room temperature serpentinization experiments, but the later-stage scheme is in agreement with literature measurements from higher-temperature field systems, which suggest Mg does not fractionate during serpentinization.",

In order to investigate the effect of carbonate subduction, we conducted biaxial deformation experiments within a pressure vessel using the Brittle Rock deformAtion Versatile Apparatus (BRAVA) at INGV. We obtained input sediments for two subduction zones, the Hikurangi trench, New Zealand (ODP Site 1124) and the Peru trench (DSDP Site 321), which have carbonate/clay contents of ~40/60 wt% and ~80/20 wt%, respectively. Samples were saturated with distilled water mixed with 35g/l sea salt and deformed at room temperature. Experiments were conducted at σN = 1–50 MPa with sliding velocities of 1–300 μm/s and hold times of 1–1000 s. Frictional strength of Hikurangi gouge is 0.35–0.55 and Peru gouge is 0.55–0.65. Velocity-stepping tests show that the Hikurangi gouge is consistently velocity strengthening (friction rate parameter (a-b) > 0). The Peru gouge is mostly velocity strengthening but exhibits a minimum in a-b at the 3–10 μm/s velocity step (with velocity weakening behavior at 25 MPa, indicating the potential for earthquake nucleation). Slide-hold-slide tests show that the healing rate (β) of the Hikurangi gouge is 1x10-4–1x10-3 /decade which is comparable to that of clays (β~0.002 /decade) while the healing rate of Peru gouge (β~6x10-3–7x10-3 /decade) is closer to that of carbonate gouge (β~0.01 /decade). The mechanical results are complemented by microstructural analysis. In lower stress experiments, there is no obvious shear localization. At 25 and 50 MPa, pervasive boundary-parallel shears become dominant, particularly in the Peru samples. Degree of microstructural localization appears to correspond with the trends observed in velocity-dependence. Our preliminary results indicate that carbonate/clay compositions could have a significant impact on the frictional behavior of subducting sediments.",

            "abstract": "The severest drought on record in southern California and predictions of continued water shortages make it essential to understand urban water use. However, urban evapotranspiration (ET), which is an important part of municipal water budgets, remains a major uncertainty. Urban ET is difficult to measure and model, particularly in cities with diverse plant composition. The city of Los Angeles contains more than 6 million trees, most of which are non-natives that originate from multiple geographic regions, which further complicates predictions of urban forest transpiration. Previously, we made extensive in situ measurements of tree transpiration and turfgrass ET in greater Los Angeles area. Here, we utilize these data to systematize transpiration of different tree species based on physiological mechanisms underlying plant water relations. The resulting empirical model estimates Los Angeles urban forest ET from easy-to-collect plant characteristics and freely available environmental parameters. Plant characteristics are tree diameter, wood type (e.g. coniferous), phenological type (e.g. evergreen) and plant composition. Environmental parameters are vapor pressure deficit of the air, incoming solar radiation and reference ET (all available at http://cimis.water.ca.gov). By combining this model with existing surveys of urban trees in Los Angeles, we estimated that citywide ET of irrigated landscapes varies from 1.2 ± 0.5 mm/d in winter to 2.8 ± 1.1 mm/d in summer. On average, trees and turfgrass contributed 27% and 73% to total tree+turfgrass ET, correspondingly. To our knowledge, this model provides the first citywide estimates of Los Angeles ET differentiated by wood types and plant composition. These results will inform decision makers about species-specific water use by urban trees and assist with determining landscape designs that are beneficial for water conservation. This model may also be incorporated into a regional hydrologic model to provide spatially resolved ET at the municipal scale.",

            "abstract": "Four nanosatellite advanced technology missions flying microwave radiometers for high-resolution atmospheric sensing are in varying stages of development. Microwave instrumentation is particularly well suited for implementation on a very small satellite, as the sensor requirements for power, pointing, and spatial resolution (aperture size) can be accommodated by a nanosatellite platform. The first mission, the Microsized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS), was developed to demonstrate temperature sounding in nine channels near 118 GHz on a 3U CubeSat (10x10x34 cm; 4.25 kg). MicroMAS was recently released from the International Space Station (ISS) for a 100-day mission, and while an eventual transmitter failure prevented demonstration of the radiometer payload, all key spacecraft subsystems provided on-orbit data to validate performance. Two 3U CubeSat follow-on missions, MicroMAS-2 (12 channels near 90, 118, 183, and 206 GHz; cross-track scanning) and MiRaTA (12 channels near 60, 183, and 206 GHz; no scanning; GPSRO onboard), will launch in 2016 for further demonstration.\nBuilding upon this work, the Earth Observing Nanosatellite-Microwave mission is being formulated by MIT Lincoln Laboratory for the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service as part of the Polar Follow-On (PFO) budget request to extend JPSS for two more missions, and provides a means to mitigate the risk of a gap in continuity of weather observations. The PFO request aims to achieve robustness in the polar satellite system to ensure continuity of NOAA’s polar weather observations. The baseline EON-MW design accommodates a scanning 22-channel high-resolution microwave spectrometer on a 12U (22x22x34 cm, 20 kg) CubeSat platform to provide data continuity with the existing AMSU and ATMS microwave sounding systems. EON-MW will nominally be launched into a sun-synchronous orbit for a two to three year mitigation mission in 2019 that will also extend technology demonstration beyond what MicroMAS and MiRaTA will achieve.\nKey EON-MW features include a compact dual-reflector radiometer design that permits the entire microwave sounding payload to be developed with a total mass of approximately 4 kg while maximizing antenna aperture for optimal spatial resolution.",

            "abstract": "We installed and tested the automated system for running realtime simulations of the solar corona (SC) and inner heliosphere (IH) using the newest SWMF AWSoM model. This model is powered by the Alfven wave turbulence with the physical description of the wave reflection and cascade. Once a day a new simulation of the SC and IH starts using the latest GONG magnetogram. The modeling is performed and the results are stored on a CCMC cluster (10 designated nodes, 16 processors each, altogether 160 CPU are used). The run duration is about eleven hours. The real time simulation with the help of SWMF AWSoM model at the CCMC currently provides a daily forecast of the solar wind parameters at the Earth trajectory. The results of the simulation will be compared daily to the ACE observations. This will allow to tune up the model free parameters and will help to improve the model performance. ENLIL model will be coupled to the solar corona part of the SWMF model in future. The coupled model prediction will be continuously validated with the ACE measurements of the solar wind.",

The Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral Atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission, the first stereoscopic ENA magnetospheric imager, provides global images of the inner magnetosphere from which global distributions of ion flux, energy spectra, and pitch angle distributions are obtained. We will show how the observed ion pressure correlates with SYM/H. Examples of multiple peaks in the ion spatial distribution which may be due to multiple injections and/or energy and pitch angle dependent drift will be illustrated.

            "abstract": "Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries has caused the displacement of people internally and internationally sometimes leading to drastic changes in the impact that traditional slash and burn shifting cultivation has on the forest ecosystem. In other areas, the lack of infrastructure and governance has isolated and protected areas of core forest from large scale exploitation. Observing specific patterns of forest fragmentation caused either by the expansion of existing rural complex areas or of isolated forest perforations has allowed us to track the differential growth of the human footprint throughout forested area of the country during the period 2000-2010. Our methodological approach involved the development of a model of shifting cultivation and forest fragmentation in which spatial rules applied morphological image processing to the Forets d’Afrique Central Evaluee par Teledetection (FACET) product. The result is a disaggregated classification of the primary forest into patch, edge, perforated, fragmented and core forest subtypes which we subsequently re-aggregated into homogenous anthropogenic macro-areas of rural complex and isolated forest perforations. We tracked how subsequent forest loss observed in 2005 and 2010 grew or shrunk these areas, presumably with differential impacts on the forest ecosystem. Using this approach we were able to map forest degradation by contextualizing the contribution of forest loss to change in different types of areas, highlighting how it can be greatly underestimated by a non contextualized per-pixel assessment of forest cover loss.",

            "abstract": "The conventional picture of the heliosphere is that of a comet-shaped structure with an extended tail produced by the relative motion of the sun through the local interstellar medium (LISM). On the other hand, the measurements of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) by IBEX and CASSINI produced some surprises. The CASSINI ENA fluxes from the direction of the nose and the tail were comparable, leading the CASSINI observers to conclude that the heliosphere was ``tailless''. The IBEX observations from the tail revealed that the hardest spectrum of ENAs were localized in two lobes at high latitude while the softest spectra were at low latitudes. Recent MHD simulations of the global heliosphere have revealed that the heliosphere drives magnetized jets to the north and south similar to those driven by the Crab Nebula and other astrophysical objects [1]. That the sun's magnetic field can drive such jets when the magnetic pressure in the outer heliosphere is small compared with the local plasma pressure (β=8∏ P/B2 >> 1) is a major surprise. An analytic model of the heliosheath (HS) between the termination shock (TS) and the heliopause (HP) is developed in the limit in which the interstellar flow and magnetic field are neglected [2]. The heliosphere in this limit is axisymmetric. The overall structure of the HS and HP are controlled by the solar magnetic field even in the limit of very high β because the large pressure in the HS is to lowest order balanced by the pressure of the LISM. The tension of the solar magnetic field produces a drop in the total pressure between the TS and the HP. This same pressure drop accelerates the plasma flow downstream of the TS into the north and south directions to form two collimated jets. The radii of these jets are controlled by the flow through the TS and the acceleration of this flow by the magnetic field -- a stronger solar magnetic field boosts the velocity of the jets and reduces the radii of the jets and the HP. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the global helioshere embedded in a stationary interstellar medium match well with the analytic model. The possbility of testing the jet model of the heliosphere using energetic neutral atoms from the outer heliosphere from IBEX and CASSINI is discussed.\n[1] Opher et al ApJ Lett. 800, L28, 2015.\n[2] Drake et al ApJ Lett., in press, 2015.",

            "abstract": "As a young rift among the extensively spreading north-south trending Cenozoic structures in southern Tibet, Yadong-Gulu Rift (YGR) is characterized by varying geophysical parameters across it, especially the high conductive layers in the middle and lower crust which extend discontinuously in the east-west direction. Both ModEM and Wsinv3dmt three dimentional (3D) inversion codes are used to explore the characteristics of lithospheric deformation, lithosphere rheology and metallogenic mechanism in Southern Tibet. The main feature of the 3D electrical structure is that the high conductive bodies in the middle crust tend to converge deep beneath YGR. Based on the forward modeling of modified 3D models, a double Moho with the upper boundary at 60 km and lower boundary at 80 km is proved to exist in the lower crust. And the high conductive bodise in the middle and lower crust may result from magma underplating and upwelling of the deep asthenosphere material caused by plate convergence besides partial melting. In terms of the formation of YGR, it can be attributed to the rheology difference of lithosphere between the two sides of YGR. According to the 3D inversion result and other petrological studies, the effective viscosity of rocks beneath Southern Tibet is low enough to produce rheology. The east-west rheology difference is probably caused by the plate tearing of the obliquely subducted Indian Plate.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to improve the understanding of past climatic or hydrologic variability have received a great deal of attention in various fields of geosciences such as glaciology, dendrochronology, sedimentology and hydrology. Based on different proxies, each research community produces different kinds of climatic or hydrologic reanalyses at different spatio-temporal scales and resolutions. When considering climate or hydrology, many studies have been devoted to characterising variability, trends or breaks using observed time series representing different regions or climates of the world. However, in hydrology, these studies have usually been limited to short temporal scales (mainly a few decades and more rarely a century) because they require observed time series (which suffer from a limited spatio-temporal density).\nThis paper introduces ANATEM, a method that combines local observations and large-scale climatic information (such as the 20CR Reanalysis) to build long-term probabilistic air temperature and precipitation time series with a high spatio-temporal resolution (1 day and a few km2). ANATEM was tested on the reconstruction of air temperature and precipitation time series of 22 watersheds situated in the Durance River basin, in the French Alps. Based on a multi-criteria and multi-scale diagnosis, the results show that ANATEM improves the performance of classical statistical models – especially concerning spatial homogeneity – while providing an original representation of uncertainties which are conditioned by atmospheric circulation patterns. The ANATEM model has been also evaluated for the regional scale against independent long-term time series and was able to capture regional low-frequency variability over more than a century (1883–2010).\n\nCitation: Kuentz, A., Mathevet, T., Gailhard, J., and Hingray, B.: Building long-term and high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation and air temperature reanalyses by mixing local observations and global atmospheric reanalyses: the ANATEM model, Hydrol.

Our analysis of these maxima shows that they occur predominantly at very high latitudes, with a mean of -74⁰ Magnetic Latitude (MLat) in the Southern Hemisphere, and 78⁰ MLat in the Northern Hemisphere. There is a maximum at 11.5-12 Magnetic Local Time (MLT) but the distribution is widely spread across all MLTs. The frequency of occurrence is correlated with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and with the SymH index.

The challenge is to find the connection between the plasma kappa values upstream and downstream the shock. Several past attempts to connect the upstream/downstream kappa indices were based on ill-defined first physical principles, such as the dependence of the temperature or the thermal pressure on the kappa index. However, the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy are independent of the kappa index, thus all different values of kappa are equivalent for describing the known R-H conditions. The upstream/downstream kappa values must be connected through a new physical concept related to the statistical origin of kappa distributions.",

Each project builds a component of cyberinfrastructure, such as collaboration environments, repositories, archives, union catalogs, or data manipulation services. The DataNet Federation Consortium (DFC) (datafed.org) has explored the types of interoperability mechanisms that are needed to build research collaboration environments that span the multiple NSF projects. Based on collaborations with each group, three basic mechanisms have proven to be sufficient: 1) Strong Federation: Tightly coupled federations in which shared name spaces are used for users and files along with communications based on well-defined protocols and API interfaces. Trust relationships based on policies play a major role in this federation. 2) Soft Federation: Loosly coupled federation where one system invokes remote services offered by another using service level communications. No name spaces are shared in such a federation. This type of federation is useful when well-defined services are available remotely on the internet. 3) Asynchronous Federation: Weakly coupled federation in which no direct interaction occurs between the systems. This level of federation is very extensible and flexible.\nLong-term sustainability can be achieved when the interoperability mechanisms enable interaction between old and new technologies – with the interactions being flexible or rigid depending upon the strength of trust needed between the systems. Sustaining cyberinfrastructure interoperability becomes feasible when the mechanisms enable the capture of the knowledge needed for interaction, without requiring changes to either sets of infrastructure. The DFC project has implemented all three types of federation to link services and systems based on the needs of the users.",

The spatial and temporal variation in LST is driven by radiation, wind, vegetation cover and roughness as well as soil moisture status in the surface and root zone. Data from airborne and satellite-based platforms provide LST from ~10 km to sub meter resolutions. A land surface scheme called the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model has been incorporated into a multi-scale regional modeling system ALEXI (Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse) and a disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) using higher resolution LST. Results with this modeling system indicates that it can be applied over heterogeneous land surfaces and estimate reliable surface fluxes with minimal in situ information. Consequently, this modeling system allows for scaling energy fluxes from subfield to regional scales in regions with little ground data. In addition, the TSEB scheme has been incorporated into a large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for investigating dynamic interactions between variations in the land surface state reflected in the spatial pattern in LST and the lower atmospheric air properties affecting energy exchange. An overview of research results on scaling of fluxes and interactions with the lower atmosphere from the subfield level to regional scales using the TSEB, ALEX/DisALEX and the LES-TSEB approaches will be presented. Some unresolved issues in the use of LST at different spatial resolutions for estimating surface energy balance and upscaling fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The long-term fate of soil carbon reserves with global environmental change remains uncertain. Shifts in moisture, altered nutrient cycles, species composition, or rising temperatures may alter the proportions of above and belowground biomass entering soil. However, it is unclear how long-term changes in plant inputs may alter the composition of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil carbon storage. Advanced molecular techniques were used to assess SOM composition in mineral soil horizons (0-10 cm) after 20 years of Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) at the Harvard Forest. SOM biomarkers (solvent extraction, base hydrolysis and cupric (II) oxide oxidation) and both solid-state and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to identify changes in SOM composition and stage of degradation. Microbial activity and community composition were assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Doubling aboveground litter inputs decreased soil carbon content, increased the degradation of labile SOM and enhanced the sequestration of aliphatic compounds in soil. The exclusion of belowground inputs (No roots and No inputs) resulted in a decrease in root-derived components and enhanced the degradation of leaf-derived aliphatic structures (cutin). Cutin-derived SOM has been hypothesized to be recalcitrant but our results show that even this complex biopolymer is susceptible to degradation when inputs entering soil are altered. The PLFA data indicate that changes in soil microbial community structure favored the accelerated processing of specific SOM components with littler manipulation. These results collectively reveal that the quantity and quality of plant litter inputs alters the molecular-level composition of SOM and in some cases, enhances the degradation of recalcitrant SOM. Our study also suggests that increased litterfall is unlikely to enhance soil carbon storage over the long-term in temperate forests.",

            "abstract": "Vidarbha region in Maharashtra, India (home for mandarin Orange) experience severe climatic uncertainties resulting in crop failure. Phytopthora are the soil-borne fungal species that accumulate in the presence of moisture, and attack the root / trunk system of Orange trees at any stage. A scientific understanding of soil-moisture-disease relations within the active root zone under different climatic, irrigation, and crop cycle conditions can help in practicing management activities for improved crop yield. In this study, we developed a protocol for performing 3-D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) at micro scale resolution to monitor the changes in resistivity distribution within the root zone of Orange trees. A total of 40 electrodes, forming a grid of 3.5 m x 2 m around each Orange tree were used in ERT survey with gradient and Wenner configurations. A laboratory test on un-disturbed soil samples of the region was performed to plot the variation of electrical conductivity with saturation. Curve fitting techniques were applied to get the modified Archie’s model parameters. The calibrated model was further applied to generate the 3-D soil moisture profiles of the study area. The point estimates of soil moisture were validated using TDR probe measurements at 3 different depths (10, 20, and 40 cm) near to the root zone. In order to understand the effect of soil-water relations on plant-disease relations, we performed ERT analysis at two locations, one at healthy and other at Phytopthora affected Orange tree during the crop cycle, under dry and irrigated conditions. The degree to which an Orange tree is affected by Phytopthora under each condition is evaluated using ‘grading scale’ approach following visual inspection of the canopy features. Spatial-temporal distribution of moisture profiles is co-related with grading scales to comment on the effect of climatic and irrigation scenarios on the degree and intensity of crop disease caused by Phytopthora.",

            "abstract": "We use multiple data streams in a model-data fusion approach to reduce uncertainty in predicting CO2 and CH4 exchange in drained and flooded peatlands. Drained peatlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California are a strong source of CO2 to the atmosphere and flooded peatlands or wetlands are a strong CO2 sink. However, wetlands are also large sources of CH4 that can offset the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of wetland restoration. Reducing uncertainty in model predictions of annual CO2 and CH4 budgets is critical for including wetland restoration in Cap-and-Trade programs. We have developed and parameterized the Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Methane Transport model (PEPRMT) in a drained agricultural peatland and a restored wetland. Both ecosystem respiration (Reco) and CH4 production are a function of 2 soil carbon (C) pools (i.e. recently-fixed C and soil organic C), temperature, and water table height. Photosynthesis is predicted using a light use efficiency model. To estimate parameters we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Multiple data streams are used to constrain model parameters including eddy covariance of CO2, 13CO2 and CH4, continuous soil respiration measurements and digital photography. Digital photography is used to estimate leaf area index, an important input variable for the photosynthesis model. Soil respiration and 13CO2 fluxes allow partitioning of eddy covariance data between Reco and photosynthesis. Partitioned fluxes of CO2 with associated uncertainty are used to parametrize the Reco and photosynthesis models within PEPRMT. Overall, PEPRMT model performance is high. For example, we observe high data-model agreement between modeled and observed partitioned Reco (r2 = 0.68; slope = 1; RMSE = 0.59 g C-CO2 m-2 d-1). Model validation demonstrated the model’s ability to accurately predict annual budgets of CO2 and CH4 in a wetland system (within 14% and 1% of observed annual budgets of CO2 and CH4, respectively). The use of multiple data streams is critical for constraining parameters and reducing uncertainty in model predictions, thereby providing accurate simulation of greenhouse gas exchange in a wetland restoration project with implications for C market-funded wetland restoration worldwide.",

Once a fire moves through an ecosystem, there are no simple ways to know exactly how deep the heat from the fire penetrated into the soil or what those temperatures actually were. Having this information may provide insight into ecosystem recovery and may have further applications to archaeological studies. We are investigating the biogeochemical structure of endomycorrhizal fungal spores, which show little to no morphological change when exposed to temperatures exceeding 500°C and should remain present in the soil following a fire event. We obtained soil samples from a pine dominated forest and a deciduous forest in two different soil types from the piedmont of the southeastern US and extracted the fungal spores for temperature experiments. We utilized a scanning electron microscope with emission dispersive spectroscopy to seek information on the biogeochemical structure of the spores and note any changes in nature of the structure and makeup as temperature increased. Initial results suggest that oxygen ratios may be changing with temperature, however, more work is being done on various species to see if there are species-specific trends.",

            "abstract": "For several decades Puerto Rico’s coastal and marine ecosystems (CMEs), particularly coral reefs, have suffered the effects of anthropogenic stresses associated to population growth and varying land use. Here we present an overview of the first year of findings of a NASA-funded project that studies human impacts in two priority watersheds (Manatí and Guánica). The project includes remote sensing analysis and hydrological, ecological and socio-economic modeling to provide a multi-decadal assessment of change of CMEs. The project’s main goal is to evaluate the impacts of land use/land cover changes on the quality and extent of CMEs in priority watersheds in the north and south coasts of Puerto Rico. This project will include imagery from Landsat 8 to assess coastal ecosystems extent. Habitat and species distribution maps will be created by incorporating field and remotely-sensed data into an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The social component will allow us to study the valuation of specific CMEs attributes from the stakeholder’s point of view. Field data was collected through a series of phototransects at the main reefs associated with these two priority watersheds. A preliminary assessment shows a range in coral cover from 0.2-30% depending on the site (Guánica) whereas apparently healthy corals dominate the reef in the north coast (Manatí). Reefs on the southwest coast of PR (Guánica) show an apparent shift from hard corals to a more algae and soft corals dominance after decades of anthropogenic impacts (sedimentation, eutrophication, mechanical damage through poorly supervised recreational activities, etc.). Additionally preliminary results from land cover/land use changes analyses show dynamic historical shoreline changes in beaches located west of the Manatí river mouth and a degradation of water quality in Guánica possibly being one of the main factors affecting the actual condition of its CMEs.",

            "abstract": "Organic and inorganic fertilizer additions to agricultural fields can lead to soil nitrogen (N) levels in excess of those required for optimal crop growth. The primary loss pathways for this excess N are leaching and denitrification. Nitrate leaching from agricultural sources contributes to the formation of hypoxic zones in critical estuarine systems including the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico. Denitrification can lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Agricultural practices such as controlling the timing and location of fertilizer application can help reduce these losses. The Precision Nitrogen Management (PNM) model was developed to simulate water transport, nitrogen transformations and transport, and crop growth and nutrient uptake from agricultural fields. The PNM model allows for the prediction of N losses under a variety of crop and management scenarios. Recent improvements to the model include the option to simulate artificially drained fields. The model performs well in simulating drainage and nitrate leaching when compared to measured data from field studies in artificially drained soils in New York and Minnesota. A simulated N budget was compared to available data. The improved model will be used to assess different management options for reducing N losses in maize production under different climate projections for key maize production locations/systems in the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Pulverized rocks (PR) are extremely incohesive and highly fractured rocks found within the damage zones of several large strike-slip faults around the world. They maintain their crystal structure, show little evidence of shearing or chemical alteration, and are believed to be produced by strong tensile forces. Several mechanisms for pulverization have been proposed such as a normal stress reduction at the rupture tip that results in unloading failure similar to rock bursts, or a rapid straining from the passing rupture that forces multiple fractures to propagate simultaneously as in the case of an impact. Each mechanism has flaws and for now lab and field studies are at an impasse. Numerical modeling, however, offers new insights into what is needed to produce PR and likely conditions of formation. We perform dynamic rupture simulations of different earthquakes, varying the magnitude, the slip distribution, and the rupture speed (supershear and subshear), while measuring the stresses produced away from the fault. A basic threshold of 10 MPa is set as the tensile strength of the rock mass and recordings are made of where, when, and by how much this threshold is exceeded for each earthquake type. Guided by field observations, we discern that a large (> Mw 7.3) supershear earthquake along a bimaterial fault produces a pulverized rock distribution most consistent with observations. The damage is asymmetric with the majority on the stiffer side of the fault extending out for several hundred meters. These results indicate that PR are not necessarily a cumulative damage product, but instead can be formed by a single large event. The results also suggest that the presence of PR may be a marker for past supershear rupture propagation, something with significant repercussions for seismic hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "Remotely triggered seismicity is a phenomenon in which an earthquake at one location triggers others over distances up to thousands of kilometers. The mechanism by which low-amplitude dynamic oscillations of the confining stress can produce such an effect, often after a time delay of minutes-to-days, is unclear, but a concentration of remotely triggered seismic events in carbon-dioxide-rich volcanic and geothermal regions suggests that an increase in pore fluid pressure associated with the nucleation and growth of carbon-dioxide gas bubbles may reduce the effective stress in critically loaded geologic faults. While this hypothesis has been tested in bench-scale laboratory experiments, field detection of seismically initiated gas bubble growth in groundwater may provide further evidence for this remote triggering mechanism. In the present study, a hydrophone continuously records the acoustic power spectrum in CH-10B, a hydrothermal well located in Long Valley Caldera, California – a site that is susceptible to remotely seismic triggering. This well exhibits co-seismic changes in water level in response to near and distant earthquakes, including every magnitude-six or greater at any location on Earth. Exploiting the inverse relationship between gas bubble radius and the peak acoustic frequency emitted when a gas bubble ruptures, this investigation seeks to detect changes in the acoustic power spectrum arising from a shift in the size-distribution or count rate of rupturing gas bubbles, coincident with a distant earthquake. By resolving the timing and intensity of the onset of a change in gas bubble rupture rate after the passage of seismic wave from a distant source, it may be possible to establish the extent to which seismically initiated gas bubble growth contributes to co-seismic borehole water level response, pore fluid pressure perturbations, and the onset of remotely triggered seismicity.",

Tens of millions more people will travel to the path of totality to view the eclipse first-hand. Using TV and the internet broadcasts, hundreds of millions of people will watch the eclipse, making the event the most viewed astronomical event in the history of mankind.\nThe Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE) Experiment for 2017 is being developed at the National Solar Observatory in partnership with universities, schools, astronomy clubs, and corporations. The CATE experiment will use more than 60 identical telescopes equipped with digital cameras positioned from Oregon to South Carolina to image the solar corona. The project will then splice these images together to show the corona during a 90-minute period, revealing for the first time the plasma dynamics of the inner solar corona. The goals for the highly leveraged CATE experiment are diverse and range from providing an authentic STEM research experience for students and lifelong learners, to making state-of-the-art solar coronal observations of the plasma dynamics of coronal polar plumes, to increasing the US scientific literacy.\nA key goal of this experiment is to donate the telescope and camera system to the volunteer who collects data with it during the total eclipse. The instrument will be then used for a variety of follow-up citizen science projects in astronomy, ranging from solar to cometary to variable star observations. For this reason no government funding is being sought for the equipment costs, but rather private and corporate sources are being developed.\nThe data collected for the 2017 eclipse will be freely available to the scientific, education and amateur astronomy communities. Crowd sourcing the data collection is an essential part of this project, as there are not enough solar physicists in this country to collect these observations. Finally, each site is expected to collect about 10 Gbytes of science data and 10 Gbytes of calibration data, resulting in 1.2 Tbytes of data for the project.",

Though all these efforts are useful in the understanding of its response to climate, the systematic understanding of uncertainties in representation of physical processes related to vegetation through sensitivity studies is imperative antecedently to understand the real role of vegetation in changing the climate. It is understood that the dense vegetation fluxes energy and moisture to the atmosphere. But, how much a specific process/a group of processes in the surface conditions of a specific area helps flux energy, moisture and tracers is unknown due to lack of process sensitivity studies and uncertain due to malfunctioning of processes. In this presentation, we have found a faulty parameterization, through process sensitivity studies, that would abet in energy and moisture fluxes to the atmosphere.\nThe model we have employed is the Common Land Model2014. The area we have chosen is the Congolese rainforest. We have discovered the flaw in the leaf boundary layer resistance (LBLR), through sensitivity studies in the LSMs, especially in the dense forest regions. This LBLR is over-parameterized with constant heat transfer coefficient and characteristic dimension of leaves; and friction velocity. However, it is too scant because of overlooking of significant complex physics of turbulence and canopy roughness boundary layer to function it realistically. Our sensitivity results show the deficiency of this process and we have formulated canopy boundary layer resistance, instead of LBLR, with depending variables such as LAI, roughness length, vegetation temperature using appropriate thermo-fluid dynamical principles. We are running the sensitivity experiments with new formulations for setting the parameter values for the data not available so far. This effort would lead to better physics for the land-use change studies and demand for the retrieval of new parameters from satellite/field experiments such as leaf mass per area and specific heat capacity of vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Every second millions of tiny meteoroids hit the Earth from space, vast majority too small to be observed visually. However, radars detect the plasma they generate and use the collected data to characterize the incoming meteoroids and the atmosphere in which they disintegrate. This diagnostics requires a detailed quantitative understanding of formation of the meteor plasma and how it interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Fast-descending meteoroids become detectable to radars after they heat due to collisions with atmospheric molecules sufficiently and start ablating. The ablated material then collides into atmospheric molecules and forms plasma around the meteoroid. Reflection of radar pulses from this plasma produces a localized signal called a head echo often accompanied by a much longer non-specular trail (see the Figure).\nUsing first principles, we have developed a consistent collisional kinetic theory of the near-meteoroid plasma responsible for the radar head echo. This theory produces analytic expressions describing the ion and neutral velocity distributions along with the detailed 3-D spatial structure of the near-meteoroid plasma. These expressions predict a number of unexpected features such as shell-like velocity distributions. This theory shows that the meteoroid plasma develops over a length-scale close to the ion mean free path with a strongly non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. The spatial distribution of the plasma density shows significant deviations from a Gaussian law usually employed in head-echo modeling.\nThis analytical model will serve as a basis for a more accurate quantitative interpretation of radar measurements, estimates of the ionization efficiency, and should help calculate meteoroid and atmosphere parameters from radar head-echo observations. This theory could also help clarify the physical nature of electromagnetic pulses observed during recent meteor showers and associated with the passage of fast-moving meteors through the atmosphere.",

The model describes the energy corresponding to forward and backward propagating modes, the residual energy, and the correlation lengths corresponding to forward and backward propagating modes and the residual energy. We apply the Zank et al. model to the super-Alfvénic solar wind, considering i) the heliosphere from 0.29 to 5 AU with and without the Alfvén velocity, and ii) the entire heliosphere from 0.29 to 100 AU in the absence of the Alfvén velocity. The model shows that (1) shear driving is responsible for the in situ generation of backward propagating modes, (2) the inclusion of the background magnetic field modifies the transport of turbulence in the inner heliosphere, (3) the correlation lengths of forward and backward propagating modes are almost equal beyond ∼30 AU, and (4) the fluctuating magnetic and kinetic energies in MHD turbulence are in approximate equipartition beyond ∼30 AU. Model results for each case are compared to observations, using Helios 2 and Ulysses observations for the first case, and Voyager 2 data for the second case. For the Voyager 2 observations, we calculate the turbulent quantities corresponding to a positive and negative sign of B_r and B_t, and the azimuthal angle φ=tan−1(B_t /B_r ). The model reproduces the observations quite well from 0.29 to 5 AU. The outer heliosphere (>1 AU) observations are well described by the model.

            "abstract": "Net uptake of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) has been observed sporadically for many years. Such observations have often been discounted as measurement error or noise, but they were reported frequently enough to gain some acceptance as valid. The advent of fast response field instruments with good sensitivity and precision has permitted confirmation that some soils can be small sinks of N2O. With regards to “closing the global N2O budget” the soil sink is trivial, because it is smaller than the error terms of most other budget components. Although not important from a global budget perspective, the existence of a soil sink for atmospheric N2O presents a fascinating challenge for understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes that explain the sink. Reduction of N2O by classical biological denitrification requires reducing conditions generally found in wet soil, and yet we have measured the N2O sink in well drained soils, where we also simultaneously measure a sink for atmospheric methane (CH4). Co-occurrence of N2O reduction and CH4 oxidation would require a broad range of microsite conditions within the soil, spanning high and low oxygen concentrations. Abiotic sinks for N2O or other biological processes that consume N2O could exist, but have not yet been identified. We are attempting to simulate processes of diffusion of N2O, CH4, and O2 from the atmosphere and within a soil profile to determine if classical biological N2O reduction and CH4 oxidation at rates consistent with measured fluxes are plausible.",

We all know that they need the sun and that they take up water from the ground, but what else do trees need from the ground? What do animals that eat leaves and wood get from the trees? Just as we need building blocks to grow our bodies, trees and animals also need building blocks for growing their bodies. Trees get part of their building blocks from the ground and animals get theirs from what they eat. When animals poop and when leaves fall, some of their building blocks return to the ground. When they die, their building blocks also go back to the ground. I also study what happens to the ground, the water, and the air when we cut down trees, kill or shoo away the animals, and make fields to grow our food. Can we grow enough food and still keep the ground, water, and air clean? I think the answer is yes, but it will take better understanding of how all of those building blocks fit together and move around, from ground to tree to animal and back to ground.",

            "abstract": "The High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE activity events (HILDCAAs) were first identified by Tsurutani and Gonzalez (1987), when they studied geomagnetic storms with a recovery phase longer than what is generally observed. They have used four criteria for defining the HILDCAA events, that are: First, the AE index must be 1000 nT at least once during the event; second, the event must be at last two days long; third, the AE index can not decay more than 200 nT for longer than two hours in each time; finally, the event must occurs outside of the main phase of the geomagnetic storm. Although several works have been done recently on HILCAAS, the main periodicities in solar wind and magnetosphere parameters during these events are still not well know. It is the aim of this work to determine these periods. In order to conduct this study, the global spectrum wavelet was used to determine the main periods of HILDCAA events. The 1-minute AE index and the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) were used to characterize the magnetosphic and solar wind. We have used data of events that occurred between 1975 and 2011 for the AE index, and between 1995 and 2011 for Bz component of the IMF (GSE and GSM coordinates systems). During HILDCAAs events, the main periods found in the AE index were between 4 and 12 hours, corresponding to 50% of the total periods identified. For the Bz component, the main periods were ≤ 8 hours, independently of the coordinate system used. We conjecture that those periods can be associates with Alfvén waves that present periods between 1 and 10 hours. These Alfven waves are associated to coronal holes because the HILDCAAs events occur more often in the descending phase of solar cycles, when the high speed streams are dominant and it are emitted from coronal holes. Cross-wavelet analysis results between IMF Bz and AE are also presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "High-precision measurements of W isotopic ratios have boosted recent exploration of early Earth processes from the small W isotope anomalies observable in some Hadean-Archean rocks. However, before applying W isotopic data to understand the geological processes responsible for the formation of these rocks, it is critical to evaluate whether the rocks’ present W contents and isotopic compositions reflect that of the protolith or the effects of secondary W addition/mobilization. To investigate this issue, we have carried out in situ concentration measurements of W and other HFSEs in mineral phases and alteration assemblages within a broad spectrum of rocks using LA-ICP-MS. Isotope dilution whole-rock W concentration measurements are used along with modes calculated from mineral and bulk rock major element data to examine the mass balance for W and other elements. In general, W is positively correlated with Nb, Ta, Ti, Sn, Mo and U, indicating similar geochemical behavior. Within granitic gneisses and amphibolites, biotite, hornblende, titanite and ilmenite control the W budget, while plagioclase and k-feldspar have little effect. For granulites, pyroxenites and eclogites, titanite, rutile, ilmenite, magnetite and sulfide, as well as grain boundary alteration assemblages dominate the W budget, while garnet, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase have little or no W. Within mantle harzburgites and dunites, major phases such as olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and spinel/chromite have very low concentrations of W, Nb, Ta, Sn and Mo. Instead, these elements are concentrated along grain boundaries and within sulfide/mss. Mass balance shows that for granitic gneisses and amphibolites, the rock-forming minerals can adequately account for the whole-rock W budget, whereas for ultramafic rocks such as pyroxenites, eclogites and harzburgites and dunites, significant W is hosted along grain boundaries, indicating that metamorphism and melt/fluid metasomatism can dramatically modify W concentrations in such rocks. Therefore, for rocks that experienced subsequent W enrichments, their W isotopic compositions may not necessarily represent their mantle sources, but could predominantly reflect later inputs, for example from a crustal reservoir that has long existed on Earth.",

Weston Geophysical performed measurements of the cavities left by small chemical explosions in hard rock in New England. The comparison of the measured cavity sizes with historical data from nuclear and chemical explosions in hard rock (e.g. granite) shows that the cavity radii scale as W1/3 and appear to be depth independent because the rock strength significantly exceeds the overburden pressure for all possible explosion depths. The cavity sizes produced by nuclear explosions in softer rock (e.g. alluvium) deviate from the cubic root scaling and depend on the confining pressure. Cavity size calculations as a function of yield using hydrodynamic simulations with GEODYN, an Eulerian hydrodynamic code developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, support these observations. We investigate the effects of the cavity size as well as the extent of the damage zones on seismic radiation.",

In central California, the Elkhorn Slough has been recently studied through seismic analysis, in order to acquire an understanding of its infill during the last thousands of years. Within those seismic units, the occurrence of gas (acoustic turbidity) is widespread in the central and upper slough. The depth of these gas pockets range from 5m below the channel floor to almost the surface. We have been monitoring the area for the last years completing the acquisition this year, running multiple seismic surveys to track the gas occurrences and attempt to quantify them. In a few areas, there is also strong evidence of gas seepage (acoustic plumes) directly above the interpreted gas pockets. A few push corers were recently taken to groundtruth the seismic data. We discuss these gas accumulations and seepages, their relationship with the seismic units, the tidal regime, the different seismic source frequencies, and the implications of the gas seepage in the water column and possibly the atmosphere of this fragile environment.\nAcknowledgments: CSUMB (chirp source), ESNERR staff, and the EART102 Spring 2015 class.

            "abstract": "Dengue infections are estimated to total nearly 400 million per year worldwide, with both the geographic range and the magnitude of infections having increased in the past 50 years. The primary dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti is closely associated with humans. It lives exclusively in urban and semi-urban areas, preferentially bites humans, and spends its developmental stages in artificial water containers. Climate regulates the development of Ae. aegypti immature mosquitoes in artificial containers. Potential containers for Ae. aegypti immature development include, but are not limited to, small sundry items (e.g., bottles, cans, plastic containers), buckets, tires, barrels, tanks, and cisterns. Successful development of immature mosquitoes from eggs to larvae, pupae, and eventually adults is largely dependent on the availability of water and the thermal properties of the water in the containers.\nRecent work has shown that physics-based approaches toward modeling container water properties are promising for resolving the complexities of container water dynamics and the effects on immature mosquito development. An energy balance container model developed by the author, termed the Water Height And Temperature in Container Habitats Energy Model (WHATCH'EM), solves for water temperature and height for user-specified containers with readily available weather data. Here we use WHATCH’EM with NASA Earth Science products used as input to construct global suitability maps based on established water temperature ranges for immature Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. A proxy for dengue risk is provided from habitat suitability, but also population estimates, as Ae. aegypti is closely associated with human activity. NASA gridded Global Population of the World data is used to mask out rural areas with low dengue risk. Suitability maps are illustrated for a variety of containers (size, material, color) and shading scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Because of its geophysical interpretation, Earth's polar motion excitation is generally decomposed into prograde (counter-clockwise) and retrograde (clockwise) circular terms at fixed frequency. Yet, these later are commonly considered as specific to the frequency and to the underlying geophysical process, and no study has raised the possibility that they could share features independent from frequency. Complex Fourier Transform permits to determine retrograde and prograde circular terms of the observed excitation and of its atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological counterparts. The total prograde and retrograde parts of these excitations are reconstructed in time domain. Then, complex linear correlation between retrograde and conjugate prograde parts is observed for both the geodetic excitation and the matter term of the hydro-atmospheric excitation. In frequency domain, retrograde circular terms present with their corresponding conjugate prograde terms an amplitude ratio following a probabilistic gamma distribution centred around 1.5 (maximum for 1); their phase difference obeys a distribution close to a normal law centred around 2 x 80°. This means an elliptical polarisation towards ~80° East with an ellipticity of 0.8, mostly resulting from the matter term of the hydro-atmospheric excitation. Whatsoever the frequency band above 0.4 cpd, the hydro-atmospheric matter term tends to be maximal in the geographic areas surrounding the great meridian circle of longitude ~80° or ~260° East. The favoured retrograde/prograde amplitude ratio around 1.5 or equivalently the ellipticity of 0.8 can result from the amplification of pressure waves progragating towards the west by the normal atmospheric mode Ψ31 around 10 days.",

            "abstract": "An extensive alluvial apron of coalescing gravel fans blankets the western flank of the Chajnantor Plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Remnant alluvial surfaces, terraces, and intermittent debris flow deposits preserved in this bajada indicate multiple intervals of aggradation, incision and terrace abandonment, and deposition. The high preservation potential and sensitivity to climate shifts of the region provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the sedimentary response to climate variations at an extreme of Earth’s climate. We use cosmogenic 36Cl exposure dating, aided by mapping, to establish a detailed chronology of the depositional history of the Chajnantor alluvial apron. Alluvial surfaces and gravel deposits yield cosmogenic exposure ages ranging from 20.7 ± 1.4 ka to 419.2 ± 39.6 ka. Debris flow boulders confined to modern and ancient channels yield cosmogenic exposure ages ranging from 9.3 ± 1.1 ka to 202.5 ± 19.6 ka. One localized (Qcf1) and two extensive (Qcf2 and Qcf3) abandoned alluvial fan surfaces yield cosmogenic exposure ages of ~145 ka, ~55 ka, and ~33 ka respectively. These abandonment ages coincide with periods of moraine stabilization and deglaciation on the adjacent Chajnantor Plateau. The cosmogenic exposure ages also reveal a transition from aggradation to incision during marine oxygen isotope stage II (MIS II), coincident with local deglaciation. We interpret that protracted periods of aggradation coincide with periods of increased precipitation and glacial occupation of the Chajnantor Plateau, and are punctuated by phases of incision and surface abandonment during interglacial periods. These results suggest that precipitation is the dominant mechanism driving alluvial fan formation and modulating sediment supply along the western margin of the Chajnantor Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The climate of the Himalayan region is changing rapidly - temperature is increasingly high and rainfall has become unpredictable. IPCC predicts that average annual mean temperature over the Asian land mass, including the Himalayas, will increase by about 3°C by the 2050s and about 5°C by the 2080s and the average annual precipitation in this region will increase by 10–30% by 2080s. Climate and the human activities can influence the land cover status and the eco-environmental quality. There are enough evidences that there is strong interaction between climate variability and ecosystems. A project was carried out in Gandaki river basin in central Nepal to analyze the relationship of NDVI vegetation index with the temperature, rainfall and snowcover information. The relationships were analyzed for different landuses classes-grassland, forest and agriculture. Results show that the snowcover area is decreasing at the rate of 0.15% per year in the basin. The NDVI shows seasonal fluctuations and lightly correlated with the rainfall and temperature.",

            "abstract": "Radiative forcing by reflecting (e.g., sulfate, SO4) and absorbing (e.g., black carbon, BC) aerosols is distinct: the former cools the planet by reducing solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the surface, without largely affecting the atmospheric column, while the latter heats the atmosphere directly. Despite the fundamental difference in forcing, here we show that the structure of the tropospheric response is remarkably similar between the two types of aerosols, featuring a deep vertical structure of temperature change (of opposite sign) at the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes. The deep temperature structure is anchored by the slow response of the ocean, as a large meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradient drives an anomalous inter-hemispheric Hadley circulation in the tropics and induces atmospheric eddy adjustments at the NH mid-latitudes. The tropospheric warming in response to projected future decline in reflecting aerosols poses additional threats to the stability of mountain glaciers in the NH. Additionally, robust tropospheric response is unique to aerosol forcing and absent in the CO2 response, which can be exploited for climate change attribution.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater in South Texas is heavily relied on for human consumption and irrigation for food crops. Like most of the south west US, woody encroachment has altered the grassland ecosystems here too. While brush removal has been widely implemented in Texas with the objective of increasing groundwater recharge, the linkage between vegetation and groundwater recharge in South Texas is still unclear. Studies have been conducted to understand plant-root-water dynamics at the scale of plants. However, little work has been done to quantify the changes in soil water and deep percolation at the landscape scale.\nModeling water flow through soil profiles can provide an estimate of the total water flowing into deep percolation. These models are especially powerful with parameterized and calibrated with long term soil water data. In this study we parameterize the HYDRUS soil water model using long term soil water data collected in Jim Wells County in South Texas. Soil water was measured at every 20 cm intervals up to a depth of 200 cm. The parameterized model will be used to simulate soil water dynamics under a variety of precipitation regimes ranging from well above normal to severe drought conditions. The results from the model will be compared with the changes in soil moisture profile observed in response to vegetation cover and treatments from a study in a similar. Comparative studies like this can be used to build new and strengthen existing hypotheses regarding deep percolation and the role of soil texture and vegetation in groundwater recharge.",

The CMIP3 and particularly CMIP5 experiences in submitting CESM data to those intercomparison projects revealed that the output format of the CESM is not well-suited for the data requirements common to model intercomparison projects. CESM, for efficiency reasons, creates output files containing all fields for each model time sampling, but MIPs require individual files for each field comprising all model time samples. This transposition of model output can be very time-consuming; depending on the volume of data written by the specific simulation, the time to re-orient the data can be comparable to the time required for the simulation to complete. Previous strategies including using serial tools to perform this transposition, but they are now far too inefficient to deal with the many terabytes of output a single simulation can generate. A new set of Python tools, using data parallelism, have been written to enable this re-orientation, and have achieved markedly improved I/O performance. The perspective of a data manager/data producer in the use of these new tools is presented, and likely future work on their development and use will be shown. These tools are a critical part of the NCAR CESM submission to the upcoming CMIP6, with the intention that a much more timely and efficient submission of the expected petabytes of data will be accomplished in the given time frame.",

The GoAmazon field project is exploring the region through various data collection and modeling to investigate in impacts of the urban polluted plume on the surrounding pristine areas. In this study a numerical model was applied to simulate the atmospheric dynamics and the Cloud Condensation Nucleai (CCN) concentrations evolution. Simulations with and without the urban plume was performed to identify its dynamics and local impacts. The results show that the land surface characteristics has important hole on the CCN distribution and rainfall over the region. At the south of Manaus the atmospheric dynamics is dominated by the cloud streets that are aligned with the trade winds and the Amazon River. At the north of Manaus, the Negro River produces the advection of a more stable atmosphere causing a higher CCN concentration on the boundary layer. Assuming a local high CCN concentration at the Manaus boundary layer region, the simulations show that the land-atmosphere interaction sets important dynamics on the plume. The model shows that the CCN plume moves along with the flow towards southwest of Manaus following the cloud streets and the river direction having the highest concentrations over the most stable water surface regions.",

            "abstract": "The fingerprint of climate change is more obvious in the Arctic than any other place on Earth. This is not only because the surface temperature there has increased at twice the rate of global mean temperature but also because Arctic sea ice extent has reached a record low of 49% reduction relative to the 1979-2000 climatology. Radiation absorption through black carbon (BC) deposited on Arctic snow and sea ice surface is one of the major hypothesized contributors to the decline. However, we note that chlorophyll-a absorption owing to increasing biology activity in this region could be a major competitor during boreal spring.\nModeling of sea-ice physical and biological processes together with experiments and field observations promise rapid progress in the quality of Arctic ice predictions. Here we develop a dynamic ice system module to investigate discrete absorption of both BC and chlorophyll in the Arctic, using BC deposition fields from version 5 of Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) and vertically distributed layers of chlorophyll concentrations from Sea Ice Model (CICE).\nTo this point, our black carbon mixing ratios compare well with available in situ data. Both results are in the same order of magnitude. Estimates from our calculations show that sea ice and snow around the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Baffin Bay has the least black carbon absorption while values at the ice-ocean perimeter in the region of the Barents Sea peak significantly. With regard to pigment concentrations, high amounts of chlorophyll are produced in Arctic sea ice by the bottom microbial community, and also within the columnar pack wherever substantial biological activity takes place in the presence of moderate light. We show that the percentage of photons absorbed by chlorophyll in the spring is comparable to the amount attributed to BC, especially in areas where the total deposition rates are decreasing with time on interannual timescale.\nWe expect a continuous increase in chlorophyll absorption as the biological activity becomes stronger in thin ice toward the center of the Arctic basin. Alternatively, a shift in relative importance could occur as total BC mixing ratios are reduced because of environmental advocacy.",

            "abstract": "Here we report the first allanite-bearing mantle eclogite xenolith, entrained in the 173 Ma Jericho kimberlite pipe, located in the Slave craton, northwestern Canada. This eclogite is unique among the other Jericho eclogites by an extreme LREE enrichment in all phases, and garnet alteration rims that are more calcic than the garnet cores. Allanite is an abundant accessory phase, present as dull orange, subhedral crystals. Other minerals in the paragenesis are garnet, clinopyroxene, apatite and sulfides; two compositionally and texturally distinct generations of phlogopite constitute a secondary paragenesis where allanite is no longer stable. Allanite in this sample is La-, Ce- and Th- rich, with concentrations at the weight % level, while Y is only present at the relatively low concentration of ~100 ppm. Electron backscatter imaging reveals complex zonation within the allanite crystals that is off-centre, non-symmetric, and patchy.\nIt is often asserted that eclogite xenoliths represent subducted oceanic lithosphere, despite significant differences in the composition and mineralogy between mantle-derived eclogite xenoliths and eclogite massif material. Both types of eclogite occurrences can contain quartz/coesite; massif eclogites often have small, sparse allanite inclusions, but allanite has never been reported in eclogite xenoliths in kimberlite. Allanite in massif eclogite is thought to form during subduction by the break-down of lawsonite and the incorporation of LREE into zoisite. Lawsonite breaks down into grossular and H20 at high pressures, which may explain the anomalous high-Ca rims measured in some garnets in this sample. This allanite-bearing eclogite may provide an unprecedented window for exploring a crucial stage of eclogite metamorphism and fluid mobilization in subduction zones. In addition, the U-Pb systematics currently under investigation may constrain the age of eclogitization.",

The curricular materials also tend to be older and to have very weak climate science content, especially with respect to tropical islands and climate change.\nIn collaboration with public broadcast station WGBH, PCEP has developed three climate education interactives that sequentially provide an introduction to key climate change education concepts. The first in the series focuses on the global carbon cycle and connects increased atmospheric CO2 with rising global temperatures. The second analyzes Earth system energy flows to explain the key role of the increased greenhouse effect. The third focuses on four climate change impacts (higher temperatures, rising sea level, changes in precipitation, and ocean acidification), and adaptation strategies to increase resiliency of local ecosystems and human systems.\nWhile the interactives have a Pacific island visual and text perspective, they are broadly applicable for other education audiences. Learners can use the interactives to engage with the basic science concepts, and then apply the climate change impacts to their own contexts.",

Radar observations from the 2011-2012 DYNAMO field campaign in the central IO have provided rich information on the 3D structure of MJO convection, including the transition from shallow to deep convection during the MJO onset. However, DYNAMO radar measurements are limited to only three MJO events and three radar sites. In this study, the shallow to deep transition (SDT) problem and lifecycle evolution of MJO events over the IO is revisited using longer term, larger-scale TRMM and GPM data. Our analysis indicates that the TRMM and GPM satellite is able to capture the evolution of individual MJO events (e.g., precipitation) on the daily and regional (e.g., 2000 km x 2000 km) scale. We have investigated the evolution and properties of ~40 prominent MJO events in terms of precipitation amounts, three-dimensional radar reflectivity, microwave ice scattering signatures, cloud top brightness temperature, and lightning flash rates. We track the SDT time scale and lifecycle evolution of each MJO using these multiple parameters, instead of composites in previous TRMM studies. MJO events have also been examined as a function of the MJO type (e.g., duration of MJO lifecycles and MJO strength). Preliminary results show that the SDT is on the scale of 7-10 days with small variations among different MJO types. SDT trends are less well-defined by the 20 dBZ (TRMM PR) echo top height compared to lower thresholds. In contrast, the satellite IR brightness temperature (TRMM VIRS), the 12 dBZ (GPM DPR Ka-band) echo top heights, and lightning flash rate (TRMM LIS) depict the STD rather well.",

            "abstract": "The presence of the ancient valley networks on Mars indicates a climate 3.8 Ga that was warm enough to allow substantial liquid water to flow on the martian surface for extended periods of time. However, the origin of these enigmatic features is hotly debated and discussion of their formation has been focused on how warm such a climate may have been and for how long. Recent warm and wet solutions using single-column radiative convective models involve supplementing CO2-H2O atmospheres with other greenhouse gases, such as H2 (i.e. Ramirez et al., 2014; Batalha et al., 2015). An interesting recent proposal, using the CAM 3-D General Circulation model, argues that global cirrus cloud decks in CO2-H2O atmospheres with at least 0.25 bar of CO2 , consisting of 10-micron (and larger) sized particles, could have generated the above-freezing temperatures required to explain the early martian surface geology (Urata and Toon, 2013). Here, we use our single-column radiative convective climate model to check these 3-D results and analyze the likelihood that such warm atmospheres, with mean surface pressures of up to 3 bar, could have supported cirrus cloud decks at full and fractional cloud cover for sufficiently long durations to form the ancient valleys. Our results indicate that cirrus cloud decks could have provided the mean surface temperatures required, but only if cloud cover approaches 100%, in agreement with Urata and Toon (2013). However, even should cirrus cloud coverage approach 100%, we show that such atmospheres are likely to have been too short-lived to produce the volumes of water required to carve the ancient valleys. At more realistic early Mars cloud fractions (~50%, Forget et al., 2013), cirrus clouds do not provide the required warming.\nBatalha, N., Domagal-Goldman, S. D., Ramirez, R.M., & Kasting, J.

            "abstract": "Nightside low altitude nightside ionosphere production sources for the terrestrial planets are either transport from the dayside and production due to energetic particle impacts. The transport can be driven by ion coupling to the neutral atmosphere motions as part of the general atmospheric global circulation patterns and/or by ionosphere density gradients near the terminators produced as a result of a dayside source of ionization (photoionization) and a nightside sink (chemical losses). The day to night transport of ionization at high altitudes on Venus (during solar max and at Earth maintains the ionosphere throughout the night. This is not the case for Mars, where the dense ionosphere carried from the day does not extend much further than ~120 degrees solar zenith angle. Although predicted neutral wind speeds in the lower thermosphere of Mars are comparable to those on Earth and Venus, the winds at Mars can have larger impacts on horizontal transport since the planet’s circumference is much smaller. One prominent effect of the winds is indicated by the observed rapid global dispersal of long-lived metal ions associated following the short, localized impact of the meteor storm associated with Comet Siding Spring . This paper will explore wind control of the low altitude Mars ionosphere ion composition measurements across the terminator from day into night, using the Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer instrument on MAVEN with the wind patterns predicted by the Mars Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (M-GITM).",

With a scheduled launch date of October 2017 most of the flight hardware has been assembled and algorithm development for its standard geophysical products is well underway. The spacecraft, built by Orbital ATK, is completed and is undergoing testing. ICESat-2’s single instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), is built by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and by the time of the Fall Meeting will have completed optical alignment and integration, and will start with its final testing. At the same time, airborne laser altimeter data are being used for algorithm development. This talk will give an overview of the design of ICESat-2, of its hardware and software status, as well as examples of ICESat-2’s coverage and what the data will look like.",

            "abstract": "We identified a series of abrupt changes in GPS site motions observed in Lower Cook Inlet of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone in late 2004, early 2010 and late 2011. The site motions during each interval (1992-2004, 2004-2010 and post-2011) appear to be steady. The deformation rates for 1992-2004 and 2010-2011 are similar to each other, as are 2004-2010 and post-2011. This pattern of toggling between two deformation patterns is due to time-dependent slip on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction plate interface. We modeled slow slip events in the seismogenic zone using the software TDEFNODE to estimate the slip rate deficit distribution on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction plate interface. Then we applied three different measures of the significance of the velocity change to estimate their timing in ~2010 and ~2011. Based on the estimated dates of velocity changes, we divided the GPS time series into the four time periods. Then a weighted non-linear least-squares inversion was applied to estimate the angular velocity of the Peninsula block and estimate the plate coupling variation simultaneously using TDEFNODE (McCaffrey, 2009). Fixing the angular velocity of all the blocks in the block model, we estimated the slip deficit rate distribution on the Alaska thrust for the four time periods with two different limiting ranges of the locking fraction (phi): [-2, 1] and [0, 1]. Negative slip deficit rates identified in period 1 and period 3 fit the data significantly better, which indicate that slip rates are faster than plate convergence rates during these two time periods. And our results suggest that a slow slip event in Lower Cook Inlet lasted at least 9 years (given that our data begin in 1995) with a moment magnitude of Mw = 7.5. Another slow slip event in the same area lasted almost 2 years from the end of 2009 to the end of 2011, with a cumulative moment magnitude of Mw = 6.8. We conclude that slip rates appear to be relatively constant during the time periods with SSEs, but relatively abrupt changes in slip rates between time periods with and without SSEs.",

They may also impact oxidative pathways of many trace gases including dimethylsulfide (DMS) and mercury. Bromine monoxide (BrO) is the most commonly observed bromine radical species. Since it absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it can be observed using remote sensing technique including Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). Previous studies have reported rapid enhancements tropospheric BrO (so called “bromine explosion”) connected to near-surface ozone depletion events during springtime in the Arctic. Space-based observation of BrO through Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is an excellent tool for studying bromine chemistry particularly for the Arctic due to its frequent observations at high latitudes. We derive tropospheric columns BrO by subtracting estimates of stratospheric column BrO from OMI total column BrO and air mass factor (AMF) correction, and analyze the tropospheric columns BrO in conjunction with Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application (MERRA) meteorological fields provided by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) in order to investigate a link between bromine explosion and near-surface meteorological factors.",

            "abstract": "The ubiquitous use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation is well known. GPS operates at L-band frequencies of 1-2 GHz. Because these low microwave frequencies penetrate clouds and rain, GPS signals can detect the specular reflection and diffuse scattering from flat and rough surfaces. This makes the GPS signals useful for geophysical measurements in all weather conditions. Aircraft and satellite-borne GPS reflectometers have been shown to successfully sense ocean surface wind. L-band reflectometry measures changes in ocean surface reflectivity due to changes of ocean surface roughness as wind increases. The use of GPS, together with other Global Navigation Satellite Systems, will soon provide hundreds of L-band transmitters in space and thus high temporal resolution for geophysical measurements. With its all weather capability and high temporal resolution, GPS reflectometry can provide wind speed data in hurricane conditions.\nSuch capabilities enable the new Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) project which aims to improve the skill of hurricane intensity forecasts. However, wave breaking under high winds produces sea foam (whitecaps) and sea spray, which complicate processes acting at the air-sea interface. Whitecaps and sea spray have high emissivity at L-band and will thus reduce the ocean reflectivity needed for wind speed retrieval. A combination of L-band reflectometry and L-band radiometry can thus help to better understand and model the physical mechanisms governing the L-band sensor responses. We use a radiative transfer model formulated in terms of foam layer thickness and void fraction to evaluate both the reflectivity and emissivity of a foam-covered sea surface. We report on the attenuation of L-band radiation in foam layers, and the corresponding foam reflectivity, for layers with varying thicknesses and void fractions. The reflected GPS signal sensitivity to wind speed variations in the presence of foam is assessed.",

The SEP events are characterized by enhancements in the proton flux at different energy levels. Although solar cycle 24 commenced in 2008, no SEPs were reported till 2010. We investigate the SEP events that occurred during ascending and maximum phase (2010 - June 2015) of solar cycle 24. During this interval, total 37 SEP events were identified by GOES spacecraft at Geosynchronous orbit. Out of 37 events only 5 events exhibited peak proton flux (PF) values between 104 p cm-2 sr-1 s-1 ≤ PF < 104 p cm-2 sr-1 s-1. However, none of the SEP events of current solar cycle registered peak flux value ≥ 104 p cm-2 sr-1 s-1, unlike the previous solar cycles 22 and 23. This confirms weaker solar activity during solar cycle 24 in comparison to previous cycles. We determine the solar source of these events, onset, duration and fluence for protons of energy E > 10 MeV. The SEPs are found to exhibit varying intensities, counts and ionic charges in different elements. Elemental and isotopic variation will also be ascertained for identified SEP events.",

            "abstract": "Plate convergence at more than 80 mm/yr and high annual precipitation make Taiwan one of the most active tectonic regions in the world with high erosion rate. Decadal suspended-sediment erosion rates were previously shown to be correlated with cumulative scalar seismic moment, but a link between sediment transport and interseismic fault activity and crustal deformation remains unknown. In this study, we use ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to reveal interseismic crustal deformation in Taiwan. We combine InSAR and GPS measurements in 2006-2010 time period and from prior to the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake as interseismic crustal deformation, and use block models to interpret interseismic geodetic measurements. We use the total variation regularization (TVR) algorithm to determine the number of faults and slip along the block-bounding faults needed to explain the interseismic geodetic measurements. We find 20-40 mm/yr interseismic slip rates on predominated thrust faults in eastern and southwestern Taiwan, whereas faults have less than 20 mm/yr slip rates in northwestern Taiwan. Higher interseismic slip and uplift rates in eastern Taiwan agree with long-term denudation rate as well as decadal erosion rate, and both modern and Holocene river erosion rates show higher correlation with interseismic fault slip than with topographic relief, stream power, or decadal seismic moment release. Our results imply that although large earthquakes could enhance sediment transport in a short period of time, higher interseismic slip rates lead to uplift and greater erosion in a longer time scale.",

            "abstract": "Future projections of population estimate that Earth will add 2.5 billion urban inhabitants by 2050. Rapid urbanization will occur to meet the demands of increasing populations. Bettencourt’s theory of urban scaling states (1) that properties of urban infrastructure (Y) are power law functions of population (N), described as Y=Y0Nβ, where β < 1.0 for urban infrastructure, and (2) that the relationship is scale-invariant. Studies by Bettencourt and colleagues provide evidence to support urban scaling using a range of urban infrastructure variables, such as impervious surface area or road volume as a power law function of population size. We tested the theory of urban scaling using, as a metric of urban infrastructure, the percent developed imperviousness (%ISA) data product at 30 m spatial resolution from the USGS National Land Cover Database for 2001, 2006, and 2011. We examined the scaling relations between %ISA and population for all metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the conterminous U.S. We compared the parameter coefficients derived from data in the recent past (2001-2011) to the parameter coefficients estimated using two different urban growth projections for 2010-2100. Both urban growth datasets included projections based on the IPCC SRES storylines. As expected, we found β < 1.0 for urban infrastructure properties using both the recent data and future projections. We found β to decrease over time for both urban projection datasets, suggesting increased densification of MSAs in the future. We calculated change in %ISA and population to investigate the impacts of the SRES storylines on future urban density. We found three major patterns in projections of future urban area and population by MSA: (1) increased densification of urban areas along the border with Mexico; (2) stagnant to decreasing population by 2100 yet increasing %ISA (small MSAs); and (3) a linear trend where increases in population coincide with increases in %ISA.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between sea surface salinity and the stable oxygen isotope composition of seawater (δ18Osw) is of utmost importance to the quantitative reconstruction of past changes in sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature from δ18O values of marine carbonates. This relationship is often considered to be a uniform across ocean basins, but the constancy of the salinity-oxygen isotope relationship across space and time is highly uncertain due to a dearth of paired salinity-δ18Osw measurements. Here we present new linear salinity-δ18Osw relationships from weekly seawater sampling programs at sites spanning the tropical Pacific Ocean. New data from Palau, Papua New Guinea, and Galápagos show a strong and statistically significant relationship between salinity and δ18Osw. We were unable to detect a δ18Osw-salinity relationship at Kiritimati due to the low seasonal variability in salinity and δ18Osw, although lagoonal samples did show a significant salinity-δ18Osw relationship. The slope of the δ18O-salinity relationship was largest in Palau and Papua New Guinea and smallest in the Galápagos, consistent with increasing salinity-δ18Osw slopes from east to west in previous isotope-enabled model simulations. These results suggest that modeling δ18O carbonate using a constant salinity-δ18Osw slope may underestimate the contribution of δ18Osw to δ18O carbonate variance in the western tropical Pacific, and overestimate its contribution in the eastern tropical Pacific. A comparison of salinity-δ18Osw relationships derived from spatial surveys and time series at Papua New Guinea and Galápagos suggests space-for-time substitution is reasonable at these sites, at least within the time period of the investigation. However, the salinity-δ18Osw relationship varied temporally at Palau, with a larger slope occurring during a period of enhanced ENSO variability from 1998-2000 versus a period of more subdued ENSO variability from 2013-2014.",

Streamflow was measured in catchments with uniform land use for September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2010. We used models to simulate evapotranspiration and streamflow for the four most common land cover types found in the Upper Xingu: tropical forest, cerrado (savanna), pasture, and soybean croplands. We used INLAND to perform single point simulations considering tropical rainforest, cerrado and pasturelands, and AgroIBIS for croplands. Converting natural vegetation to agriculture substantially modifies evapotranspiration and streamflow in small catchments. Measured mean streamflow in soy catchments was about three times greater than that of forest catchments, while the mean annual amplitude of flow in soy catchments was more than twice that of forest catchments. Simulated mean annual evapotranspiration was 39% lower in agricultural ecosystems (pasture and soybean cropland) than in natural ecosystems (tropical rainforest and cerrado). Observed and simulated mean annual streamflows in agricultural ecosystems were more than 100% higher than in natural ecosystems. The accuracy of the simulations is improved by using field-measured soil hydraulic properties. The inclusion of local measurements of key soil parameters is likely to improve hydrological simulations in other tropical regions.",

            "abstract": "The climatological conditions that characterize dryland environments – high potential evapotranspiration combined with low and variable total rainfall – pose challenges for farmers deciding when and how much to irrigate. These challenges are greater in developing countries where the absence of sufficient storage infrastructure means that irrigation water is sometimes applied to agricultural fields directly from rivers. Because soil moisture and river flow both depend on recent rainfall, high irrigation demand often coincides with low river flow, limiting access to water when it is most needed. These feedbacks can constrain the yield increases expected from irrigation in such settings.\nScaled up to the catchment level, irrigation water availability varies spatially as well as temporally. Irrigators in upstream areas of the catchment have first access to river water but rely on a smaller drainage network while those in downstream areas are affected by the opposite conditions. During periods of high rainfall, downstream users have the greatest access to water while upstream users are then favored during drought intervals. In the absence of rules governing water access, these flow dynamics will constrain the distribution of potential agricultural yields within the catchment.\nA simple numerical model simulating catchment and irrigation processes was constructed in order to better understand how climate and geomorphologic characteristics affect crop yield, economic returns and the spatial distribution of irrigated areas. By assuming a statistically representative river network structure, the model was first used to explore the effect of unregulated irrigation withdrawals on these variables. Multiple water management programs, including withdrawal limits, rotational systems and flow minima, were then simulated and the results compared to the unregulated case. This analysis shows the potential for simple models to provide insight into complex irrigation systems and to make general predictions about the impact of different regulatory frameworks.",

We perform Detection and Attribution (D&A) analysis using fingerprint methods by defining a signal that concisely express both spatial and temporal changes found in the model runs with the CMIP5 individual forcing runs; greenhouse (historicalGHG), natural (historicalNat), anthropogenic (historicalAnthro), and anthropogenic aerosols (historicalAA). We are able to detect changes in annual mean temperature over many of the homogenous temperature zones as well as seasonal means in some of the homogenous zones.

MISTiC’s extraordinarily small size, payload mass of less than 15 kg, and minimal cooling requirements can be accommodated aboard a 27U-class CubeSat or an ESPA-Class micro-satellite. Low fabrication and launch costs enable a LEO sun-synchronous sounding constellation that would collectively provide frequent IR vertical profiles and vertically resolved atmospheric motion vector wind observations in the troposphere. These observations are highly complementary to present and emerging environmental observing systems, and would provide a combination of high vertical and horizontal resolution not provided by any other environmental observing system currently in operation. The spectral measurements that would be provided by MISTiC Winds are similar to those of NASA’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder that was built by BAE Systems and operates aboard the AQUA satellite.  These new observations, when assimilated into high resolution numerical weather models, would revolutionize short-term and severe weather forecasting, save lives, and support key economic decisions in the energy, air transport, and agriculture arenas–at much lower cost than providing these observations from geostationary orbit. In addition, this observation capability would be a critical tool for the study of transport processes for water vapor, clouds, pollution, and aerosols. Key technical risks are being reduced through laboratory and airborne testing under NASA’s Instrument Incubator Program.",

            "abstract": "What is the habitability of a salty subsurface environment in a hyperarid region, where the salts are mixtures of chlorides, chloride hydrates, and hydrous sulfates?\nWe report a new concept developed on the basis of observations on Mars, field investigations at DLT playa in Qaidam basin on Tibet Plateau, and the laboratory studies of chlorides and sulfates.\nThe water activities maintained in a closed environment by either chlorides or by hydrous sulfates have been studied separately in laboratory. It was found that hydrous sulfates can keep high water activities (i.e., high relative humidity RH levels) in a closed environment (e.g., subsurface salty layers), and also require high RH for their deliquescence in order to generate liquid brine to support the essential functions of life form. In contrast, the deliquescence of chlorides and chloride hydrates can happen at mid-low RH levels, but an environment filled with chlorides and chloride hydrates would not provide a suitable RH range to induce their own deliquescence even with a considerable temperature (T) change, because their capability of maintaining a water activity (i.e., a RH level) in an enclosure is not a strong dependent of temperature.\nThe coexistence of chlorides and hydrous sulfates was found by the in situ measurements of all landed missions to Mars (rovers and landers). This coexistence was also found in the subsurface of DLT playa on Tibet Plateau by a detailed mineralogy study (Laser Raman spectroscopy and XRD). In addition, microbial life at DLT was evidenced by four types of analyses.\nWithin DLT subsurface, the highly hydrated sulfates (MgSO4.6-7H2O) would provide a suitable RH range (90-97%) for the deliquescence of co-existing chlorides (MgCl2.6H2O, KMgCl3.6H2O, NaCl, RH need to be > 33, 65, 75%) to start, which will form thin films of liquid brine at the surface of salt grains. Furthermore, we have found that the rates of deliquescence of chlorides are strong dependents of temperature. Thus a higher T during day time at DLT would generate a thicker brine film at grain surface. These parameters, sunlight, warmer T, and more aqueous brine, would favor life, i.e., the halophiles found at DLT.\nThis analog study shows that a salty subsurface (mixtures of chlorides, hydrated sulfates, and even perchlorates) in hyperarid region can have high habitability potentials.",

            "abstract": "The Southeast coast of Brazil (SE) is among the most densely populated areas in South America. Previous studies using 70yr records have shown that both intensity and frequency of rainy days have increased in the southern portion of SE whereas precipitation has become more concentrated in fewer extreme events in the northern portion of the region during the wet season. The present study investigates changes in regional circulation associated with the observed trends in precipitation using daily National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), at 0.5° spatial resolution. We compare the difference in the climatology between 1979-1988 and 2003-2012 decades of the following variables: sea level pressure, geopotential height (850hPa and 200hPa), wind (850hPa), temperature (850hPa), precipitation, and precipitable water. For each decade, we estimate the difference in the composites of the variables during days when precipitation was above the median during austral summer (December to February) and we perform these analyses separately for the two portions of SE. The difference in the climatology indicates an increase in precipitable water accompanied by the weakening of circulation along the east coast of Brazil in the last decade. These results seem independent on the El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability and are consistent with some robust climate change scenarios resulting from the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The weakening in circulation is more intense for events over northern SE, which could explain the decrease in the number of rainy days observed over the area. Nevertheless, when the necessary dynamic conditions are met, the increased precipitable water along the coast could result in more intense events. Events occurring over southern SE are associated with an increase in precipitable water and stronger northwesterly flow, which could reinforce moisture flux convergence and intensify rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Playas are significant dust sources and as a result are potentially hazardous to human health. The composition of the dust is a function of the mineralogical content of the playa and associated brines. Playas are found in arid climates globally, however they are challenging to map geologically as they are often hard to access, have subtle variations in mineralogy, and are topographically featureless. This study uses remote sensing in the form of imaging spectroscopy to map the mineralogical composition of five playas from different geologic settings: Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada, USA; Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, USA; White Sands National Monument, New Mexico, USA; Lake Brown, Western Australia, Australia; and Lake Tyrrell, Victoria, Australia.\nMultiple spectrometers were used for this study; these include the multispectral sensor ASTER, and the hyperspectral sensors AVIRIS, HICO, and HyMap. All scenes were processed in ENVI and corrected to at surface reflectance using FLAASH, QUAC or Empirical Line methods. Minerals were identified through a standard end-member extraction approach and mapped using multi-range spectral feature fitting and other methods. Additionally, remote data are combined with in-situ field-based spectra and sample-based laboratory spectra.\nInitial results suggest various and differing mineralogy between playas. The most abundant mineralogy includes clay minerals such as illite and montmorillonite and evaporites such as gypsum. Additionally there has been identification of Fe absorption bands in the visible / near infrared at White Sands National Monument, and Lake Brown and Lake Tyrell, suggesting the presence of iron bearing minerals. Further research will provide a more comprehensive list of minerals identified by absorption features as related to specific sensors. Collectively, these analyses will be used characterize overall patterns in playa surface mineralogy and to evaluate the parameters that influence playa dust source composition. ",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) aging significantly affects its distributions and radiative properties, which is an important uncertainty source in estimating BC climatic effects. Global models often use a fixed aging timescale for the hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic BC conversion or a simple parameterization. We have developed and implemented a microphysics-based BC aging scheme that accounts for condensation and coagulation processes into a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). Model results are systematically evaluated by comparing with the HIPPO observations across the Pacific (67°S-85°N) during 2009-2011. We find that the microphysics-based scheme substantially increases the BC aging rate over source regions as compared with the fixed aging timescale (1.2 days), due to the condensation of sulfate and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and coagulation with pre-existing hydrophilic aerosols. However, the microphysics-based scheme slows down BC aging over Polar regions where condensation and coagulation are rather weak. We find that BC aging is primarily dominated by condensation process that accounts for ~75% of global BC aging, while the coagulation process is important over source regions where a large amount of pre-existing aerosols are available. Model results show that the fixed aging scheme tends to overestimate BC concentrations over the Pacific throughout the troposphere by a factor of 2-5 at different latitudes, while the microphysics-based scheme reduces the discrepancies by up to a factor of 2, particularly in the middle troposphere. The microphysics-based scheme developed in this work decreases BC column total concentrations at all latitudes and seasons, especially over tropical regions, leading to large improvement in model simulations. We are presently analyzing the impact of this scheme on global BC budget and lifetime, quantifying its uncertainty associated with key parameters, and investigating the effects of heterogeneous chemical oxidation on BC aging.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of studies conclude that water limitations and heat stress may hinder the capacity of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) trees, a dominant species of Canada’s boreal forests, to grow and assimilate atmospheric carbon. However, there is currently no scientific consensus on the future of these forests over the next century in the context of widespread climate warming. The large spatial extent of black spruce forests across the Canadian boreal forest and associated variability in climate, demography and site conditions pose challenges for projecting future climate change responses. Here we provide an evaluation of the impacts of climate warming and drying, as well as increasing [CO2], on the aboveground productivity of black spruce forests across Canada south of 60ºN for the period 1971 to 2100. We use a new extensive network of tree-ring data obtained from Canada’s National Forest Inventory, spatially-explicit simulations of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and its drivers, and multivariate statistical modelling. We found that soil water availability is a significant driver of black spruce inter-annual variability in productivity across broad areas of the western to eastern Canadian boreal forest. Inter-annual variability in productivity was also found to be driven by autotrophic respiration in the warmest regions. In most regions, the impacts of soil water availability and respiration on inter-annual variability in productivity occurred during the phase of carbohydrate accumulation the year preceding tree ring formation. Results from projections suggest an increase in the importance of soil water availability and respiration as limiting factors on NPP over the next century due to warming, but this response may vary to the extent that other factors such as carbon dioxide fertilization, and respiration acclimation to high temperature, contribute to dampening these limitations.",

Each target can be exposed to micron and submicron particles accelerated to speeds up to 100 km/s.\nThe ice target consists of a LN2 cryogenic system connected to both a water-ice deposition system and a movable freezer/holder for a pre-mixed liquid cartridge. Impact products and chemistry are assessed with an integrated time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Such a system enables a program of research into the evolution of ice under micrometeoroid bombardment and the synthesis of complex organic molecules through micrometeoroid impacts. We present the early results from studies of hypervelocity iron particle impacts into frozen mixtures of H2O, NH3, and olivine grains which contain nanophase Fe, a possible catalyst for organic chemical reactions, under conditions of low-pressure background CO or CO2 gas.\nThe gas target consists of a differentially pumped chamber kept at pressures up to 0.5 Torr, such that high-velocity (~10-60 km/s) micrometeoroids are completely ablated within the 40 cm long measurement region. The chamber is configured with segmented electrodes to perform temporally- and spatially-resolved measurements of charge production during ablation, and localized light-collection optics enable an assessment of the light production. We present the latest results of experiments to determine the ionization efficiency of Fe particles ablating in N2, air, CO2, and He gas, and modifications to standard ablation models made possible from these experimental results. Such studies are critical for the interpretation of remote sensing measurements, including radar and lidar, which in turn make possible the assessment of the interplanetary dust particle flux.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic sea ice and its snow cover have a direct impact on both the Arctic and global climate system through their ability to moderate heat exchange across the ocean-sea ice-atmosphere (OSA) interface. Snow cover plays a key role in the OSA interface radiation and energy exchange, as it controls the growth and decay of first-year sea ice (FYI). However, meteoric accumulation and redistribution of snow on FYI is highly stochastic over space and time, which makes it poorly understood. Previous studies have estimated local-scale snow thickness distributions using in-situ technique and modelling but it is spatially limited and challenging due to logistic difficulties. Moreover, snow albedo is also critical for determining the surface energy balance of the OSA during the critical summer ablation season. Even then, due to persistent and widespread cloud cover in the Arctic at various spatio-temporal scales, it is difficult and unreliable to remotely measure albedo of snow cover on FYI in the optical spectrum. Previous studies demonstrate that only large-scale sea ice albedo was successfully estimated using optical-satellite sensors. However, space-borne microwave sensors, with their capability of all-weather and 24-hour imaging, can provide enhanced information about snow cover on FYI. Daily spaceborne C-band scatterometer data (ASCAT) and MODIS data are used to investigate the the seasonal co-evolution of the microwave backscatter coefficient and optical albedo as a function of snow thickness on smooth FYI. The research focuses on snow-covered FYI near Cambridge Bay, Nunavut (Fig.1) during the winter to advanced-melt period (April-June, 2014). The ACSAT time series (Fig.2) show distinct increase in scattering at melt onset indicating the first occurrence of melt water in the snow cover. The corresponding albedo exhibits no decrease at this stage. We show how the standard deviation of ASCAT backscatter on FYI during winter can be used as a proxy for surface roughness and subsequent snow thickness (ie. Rougher surfaces acquire thicker snow covers) and then how this surface manifests into statistically distinguishable surface melt pond fractions which largely governs the optical derived albedo. Such relationships are useful for modelling the subsequent summer melt pond fraction and albedo from winter snow cover.",

            "abstract": "Tropical peatlands contain a globally significant carbon pool. Southeast Asian peatlands are being deforested, drained and burned at very high rates, mostly for conversion to industrial oil palm or pulp and paper plantations. The climate mitigation potential of tropical peatlands has gained increasing attention in recent years as persistent greenhouse gas emissions can be avoided or decreased if peatlands remain intact or are rehabilitated. In addition, peatland conservation or rehabilitation for climate mitigation also includes multiple co-benefits such as maintenance of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and air quality from reduced fire occurrence. Inventory guidelines and methodologies have only recently become available, and are based on few data from a limited number of sites. Few heuristic tools are available to evaluate the impact of management practices on carbon dynamics in tropical peatlands, and the potential climate mitigation benefits of peatland restoration. We used a process based dynamic tropical peatland model to explore the C dynamics of several peatland management trajectories represented by hypothetical scenarios, within the context of simulated 21st century climate change. All scenarios with land use, including those with optimal restoration, simulate C loss over the 21st century, with C losses ranging from 10% to essentially 100% of pre-disturbance values. Fire, either prescribed as part of a crop rotation cycle, or stochastic occurrences in sub-optimally managed degraded land can be the dominant C-loss pathway, particularly in the drier climate scenario we tested. A single 25-year oil palm rotation, with a prescribed initial burn, lost 40-50 kg C/m2, equivalent to accumulation during the previous 500 years, 10-30% of which was restored in 75 years of optimal restoration. Our results indicate that even under the most optimistic scenario of hydrological and forest restoration and the wettest climate regime, only about one-third of the carbon lost to the atmosphere from 25 years of oil palm cultivation can be recovered within the next 75 years. In addition, peat fire suppression is the most effective management tool to maintain peatland carbon stocks, and should be a high priority for climate mitigation efforts on peatlands.",

These impacts drop to $0.8 trillion if investments are made in cost-effective adaptations and protections. Awareness of flood risk and its long-term fiscal impact historically has proven insufficient to motivate pre-disaster land use changes and investments in mitigation and protection.\nWhile many adaptations and protections fall largely under state and local authority, some stakeholders are interested in federal coastal flood protection projects, including projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Since the 1950s, Congress has authorized the Corps to construct specific coastal projects. The broad vision, strategy, and priorities for the federal role in coastal flood damage reduction projects nonetheless remain ill-defined.\nThis research analyzes (1) the authorization and appropriations trends for Corps coastal storm damage reduction projects, and (2) how Corps feasibility studies account for and address coastal flood hazards. Identified trends include: emergency appropriations for storm-damaged areas outstrip annual investments in coastal flood projects; the rate at which projects are congressionally approved for construction outpaces the rate at which construction is funded; and how coastal protection projects are evaluated in Corps feasibility studies shows variation and change in agency practices. These trends have consequences; they affect public and local expectations when projects begin providing protection benefits, and may influence investments in other adaptation measures. These trends also raise questions for policymakers at all levels and for scientists and practitioners interested in coastal flood resilience.",

At most of situations, predictions with high resolution are needed, like in case of rainfall in small basins, since variations due to topographic details become more important as grid spacing decreases. For small grid spacing, it is usual to dispense with convective parameterizations. In that case, the microphysics parameterization becomes responsible for the total generation of rain and comes to be more important in models. This research is based on high-resolution simulations of heavy rain events with the Eta model. Object-based evaluations showed that Eta model forecasts with 1 km of grid spacing have a trend to overestimate the rain. For the purpose of detecting error sources, an assessment of the behavior of Ferrier's parameterization was performed, by analyzing the contribution of each process to the tendency of the variables that are influenced by microphysical phenomena. At this stage, the role of ice-phase processes was especially evaluated. Based on the results of that step, changes in the established ratio between cloud ice and snow were tested and evaluated using an object-based method. It was possible to obtain appreciable modifications in forecasted precipitation accumulations.",

            "abstract": "When contemporary stress field in a region is well-known and faults are identified, it is possible to determine which faults are favorably oriented and are more likely to slip in the future. Stress data are also an important input in integrated crustal modeling to get more reliable evaluations in many applicative researches. Then, the knowledge of the active stress field contributes to the seismotectonic zoning of a region.\nIn Italy, although at large scale a first order stress field due to plate boundary forces controls the contemporary tectonics, some areas show changes in stress regime over small distances and/or with depth clearly linked to localized stress perturbations. Where information is lacking each prediction of stress patterns could significantly differ from the reality and any further evaluation would be weakly supported by data.\nTherefore we continuously collect the available stress indicators and here present an update of present-day stress orientations in Italy with the last 5 years data, relative to crustal earthquake focal mechanisms (0-40 km depth), borehole breakouts from deep wells and fault data. About 100 new quality-ranked entries complete the definition of the horizontal stress orientation and tectonic regime in some areas, and bring new information mainly in Po Plain and Calabria area, recently affected by important earthquake sequences. Now the global Italian dataset consists of ~800 data points, including ~580 of A-C quality, with an increase of 17% compared to the previous compilation (Montone et al., 2012). We use A-, B- and C-quality stress indicators for analyzing first-order stress patterns while we also consider D-quality data to define second-or third-order stress field, as observed in other studies in the world. In particular we discuss the simultaneous occurrence of different stress regimes and the complex interaction between first order stress field and local effects, and the influence of the inherited tectonic structures.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to impact not only the total amount, but also the frequency and intensity of rainfall on regional to global scales. Global climate models that diagnostically parameterize deep convection have been widely used to investigate how rainfall statistics will change in the future despite the problem that they struggle to capture these characteristics when compared to observed present-day precipitation. Here we analyze daily rainfall and its response to climate change using “cloud super-parameterization” (SP), in which convective and boundary layer processes are simulated by embedded cloud-resolving models rather than approximated by conventional parameterizations. We discriminate robust effects of SP by analyzing several statistics of the rainfall frequency and amount distributions (mean rainfall, dry day frequency, rainfall intensity, and rainfall amount mode) in three conventional and super-parameterized versions of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM and SPCAM) including (SP)CCSM4, (SP)CESM1-CAM4, and (SP)CESM1-CAM5. Little improvement in mean state biases is seen with super-parameterization, but several key secondary characteristics are improved. Importantly, the “amount mode” (the rain rate that delivers the most accumulated rain), which is systematically too weak in CAM, is improved in SPCAM. SPCAM also better captures extreme rain rates, with satisfying insensitivity to horizontal resolution, unlike standard CAM. Poleward of 50 degrees, where a high fraction of rainfall is produced by resolved-scale processes in CAM, few differences discriminate SPCAM vs. CAM daily rainfall properties. However in the tropics, where the convective parameterization produces the majority of rainfall, CAM has a distorted rainfall climate change response. The amount distribution does not smoothly shift right toward more intense rates as it does in SPCAM, but rather increases only the intense rain (large-scale) rates without altering moderate rain (parameterized) rates.",

            "abstract": "The Val d'Agri basin in the Apennines extensional belt hosts the largest oilfield in onshore Europe. High-quality recordings from a temporary dense network unravel a swarm of 111 small-magnitude events (ML ≤ 1.8) occurred in June 2006 during the first stage of wastewater injection into a high-rate well. 3D absolute locations and high-precision relative locations define a high-angle fault located 1 km below the well inside fractured and saturated carbonates where wastewater is re-injected. Seismicity begins 3 hours after the initiation of injection. The seismicity rate strictly correlates with injection curves and temporal variations of elastic and anisotropic parameters. Seismicity is induced by rapid communication of pore pressure perturbations along a high permeability fault-zone favorably oriented with respect to the extensional stress field. The spatiotemporal distribution of events agrees with an isotropic hydraulic diffusivity of 0.8 m2/s, which corresponds to high permeability values on the order of 10-13 m2/s. Such high permeability values are coherent with hydraulic well-tests in the very productive hydrocarbon reservoir and with the presence of a widespread system of open and conductive fractures in the carbonates that strike NW–SE parallel to the maximum horizontal stress of the extensional stress regime. Over the following 8 years, 235 events (ML ≤ 2.2) were recorded within 5 km of the disposal well by permanent stations of the local operator network and of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia. Accurate 3D locations concentrate on the fault and unravel that after June 2006 micro-seismicity migrated upwards and downwards along the fault measuring 5-km along dip. Subsurface data show that the fault is a pre-existing blind back-thrust of an inherited fold-thrust system developed in the carbonate reservoir during Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The seismicity rate correlates with short-term increases in injection pressure of the disposal well.",

            "abstract": "Current literature hypothesize that climate change-driven temperature increases will negatively affect the power production capacity of thermoelectric power plants, which currently produce ~88% of electricity used in the United States. This impact can occur through 1) warm cooling water that reduces the quantity of heat removed from the once-through (open-loop) steam system, 2) increased air temperature and/or humidity that decrease the amount of heat absorption in cooling towers/ponds of wet-recirculating (closed-loop) plants, and 3) environmental protection regulations that impose restrictions on both cooling water withdrawal volume and temperature of discharge. However, despite the widespread consensus that temperature and power generation are negatively related, different models yield a range of results and the magnitude of effects is uncertain. In this study, we test current literature's model predictions using historical data by assembling and analyzing a database of relevant parameters from distinct sources. We examine how daily and seasonal changes in cooling water, ambient air, and wet bulb temperatures have historically impacted coal and natural gas power plants in the U.S., focusing on 39 plants over a period up to 14 years. This allows us to assess how future changes in temperatures may affect generation. Our results suggest that water and ambient air temperatures have a lower impact on thermoelectric plant performance than previously predicted. Moreover, we find that recirculating power plants are more resilient to temperature variability than are once-through plants.",

            "abstract": "The global water cycle is hypothesized to intensify with a warming Earth’s atmosphere. To determine associated hydrological changes, most previous research has used precipitation scenarios without considering changes to the horizontal water vapor transport (IVT). As few studies have analyzed the IVT, and given that many extreme precipitation and flood events are driven by intense water vapor transport, it is the aim of this study to investigate projected changes to global IVT. Furthermore, this approach can identify climatological changes to the IVT between water source and sink regions.\nUsing 22 global circulation models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) we evaluate, globally, the mean, standard deviation, and the 95th percentile of IVT from the historical simulations (1979–2005) and two emissions scenarios (2073–2099); representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). This analysis is undertaken for December, January, and February (Boreal winter); and for June, July, and August (Austral winter).\nThe CMIP5 historical multi-model mean has good agreement with the fields from the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis, which provides confidence in the models’ signal. In the future, under more extreme emissions (RCP8.5), multi-model mean IVT increases by 30–40% in the North Pacific and North Atlantic storm tracks and in the equatorial Pacific Ocean trade winds. The Arctic region has the largest relative IVT increase especially in Boreal winter. Analysis of low-altitude moisture and winds suggest that these projected changes are mainly due to higher atmospheric water vapor content.",

            "abstract": "The Ring Laser (the G-ring) at Wettzell (WET), Germany, is a rotation-measurement instrument that can monitor tiny variations in seismic noise. It essentially records only SH-type signals. Combined with a co-located seismograph (three-component seismograph STS-2), we can monitor the amount of Love waves from this instrument and that of Rayleigh waves from the STS seismograph. We report on seasonal variation of Rayleigh-to-Love wave ratio in the secondary microseism.\nThe first step in our analysis is to obtain stacked Fourier spectra that were least affected by earthquakes. We used two earthquake catalogues to do this; the GCMT (Global Centroid Moment Tensor, Earthquakes M > 5.5) catalogue and the EMSC (European-Mediterranean Seismic Centre) catalogue for regional earthquakes (distance < 1000 km) with M > 4.5.\nWe then created monthly averages of noise Fourier spectra for the frequency range 0.13-0.30 Hz using both the G-ring and STS data from 2009 to 2015. Monthly spectra show clear seasonal variations for the secondary microseism. We obtained surface vertical acceleration from STS and surface transverse acceleration from G-ring from which we can directly measure the Rayleigh-to-Love wave ratio. The procedure is the same with an account in our recent GRL paper (Tanimoto et al., 2015).\nComparison between vertical acceleration and transverse acceleration shows that Rayleigh-wave surface amplitudes are about 20 percent larger than Love waves but in terms of kinetic energy this ratio will be different.\nWe converted these ratios of surface amplitude to those of kinetic energy using an available earth model (Fichtner et al., 2013). The averaged ratio over the frequency band 0.13-0.30 Hz shows is in the range 0.6-0.8 in spring, autumn and winter but it increases to about 1.2 in summer. Except for the summer, the amount of Love waves are higher but the amount of Rayleigh waves increases in summer and appears to exceed that of Love waves.",

Based on mass balance calculations and Turc-Budyko analysis, this study investigates the accuracy of twelve widely used precipitation gridded datasets for sub-basins in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) in the Himalayas-Karakoram-Hindukush (HKH) region. These datasets are: 1) Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), 2) Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), 3) NCEP / NCAR, 4) Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), 5) Climatic Research Unit (CRU), 6) Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), 7) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), 8) European Reanalysis (ERA) interim data, 9) PRINCETON, 10) European Reanalysis-40 (ERA-40), 11) Willmott and Matsuura, and 12) WATCH Forcing Data based on ERA interim (WFDEI). Precipitation accuracy and consistency was assessed by physical mass balance involving sum of annual measured flow, estimated actual evapotranspiration (average of 4 datasets), estimated glacier mass balance melt contribution (average of 4 datasets), and ground water recharge (average of 3 datasets), during 1999-2010. Mass balance assessment was complemented by Turc-Budyko non-dimensional analysis, where annual precipitation, measured flow and potential evapotranspiration (average of 5 datasets) data were used for the same period. Both analyses suggest that all tested precipitation datasets significantly underestimate precipitation in the Karakoram sub-basins. For the Hindukush and Himalayan sub-basins most datasets underestimate precipitation, except ERA-interim and ERA-40. The analysis indicates that for this large region with complicated terrain features and stark spatial precipitation gradients the reanalysis datasets have better consistency with flow measurements than datasets derived from records of only sparsely distributed climatic stations in the HKH. Given the importance of the HKH region as the water tower of South Asia, our findings also suggest a revisit and scrutiny of hydro-climatic studies in the study region as to biases caused by the gridded precipitation datasets.",

            "abstract": "The chemistry of HOx radicals in the troposphere can lead to the production of secondary products such as ozone and aerosols, while volatile organic compounds are degraded. The production rates and identities of secondary products depend on the abundance of NOx and other parameters. The amounts of VOCs and NOx can also affect the concentrations of OH, HO2 and RO2. Comparison of observations and model-derived values of HOx species can provide one way to assess the completeness and accuracy of model mechanisms. The functional dependence of measure-model agreement on various controlling parameters can also reveal details of current understanding of photochemistry in urban regions.\nDuring the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE), conducted during the summer of 2014, observations from ground-based and airborne platforms were performed to study the evolution of atmospheric composition over the Denver metropolitan area. Of particular interest in FRAPPE was the assessment of the roles of mixing of emissions from oil and gas exploration and extraction, and those from confined animal production operations, with urban emissions (e.g. from transportation, energy production, and industrial processes) on air quality in the metropolitan and surrounding region.\nOur group made measurements of OH, HO2, and HO2 + RO2 from the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft platform using selected ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The C-130 was equipped with instrumentation for the observation of a wide variety of photochemical-related species and parameters. These data are used to assess the photochemical regimes encountered during the period of the study, and to quantitatively describe the chemical processes involved in formation of secondary products. One of the tools used is a steady state model for short-lived species such as those that we observed.\nThis presentation summarizes the behavior of species that were measured during FRAPPE and what the observations reveal about urban photochemistry in a higher altitude metropolitan area such as Denver. The analysis of the data and the model representations lead to quantitative assessment of current understanding of tropospheric chemical processes in such environments.",

            "abstract": "Apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology is commonly used to study landscape evolution and potential links between climate, erosion and tectonics. The technique relies on a quantitative understanding of (i) helium diffusion kinetics in apatite, (ii) an evolving 4He concentration, (iii) accumulating damage to the crystal lattice caused by radioactive decay[1], and (iv) the thermal annealing of such damage[2],[3], which are each functions of both time and temperature. Uncertainty in existing models of helium diffusion kinetics has resulted in conflicting conclusions, especially in settings involving burial heating through geologic time. The effects of alpha recoil damage annealing are currently assumed to follow the kinetics of fission track annealing (e.g., reference [3]), although this assumption is difficult to fully validate. Here, we present results of modeling exercises and a suite of experiments designed to interrogate the effects of damage annealing on He diffusivity in apatite that are independent of empirical calibrations of fission track annealing. We use the existing experimental results for Durango apatite[2] to develop and calibrate a new function that predicts the effects of annealing temperature and duration on measured diffusivity. We also present a suite of experiments conducted on apatite from Sierra Nevada, CA granite to establish whether apatites with different chemical compositions have the same behavior as Durango apatite. Crystals were heated under vacuum to temperatures between 250 and 500°C for 1, 10, or 100 hours. The samples were then irradiated with ~220 MeV protons to produce spallogenic 3He, the diffusant then used in step-heating diffusion experiments. We compare the results of these experiments and model calibrations to existing models.\nCitations: [1]Shuster, D., Flowers R., and Farley K., (2006), EPSL 249(3-4), 148-161; [2]Shuster, D. and Farley, K., (2009), GCA 73 (1), 6183-6196; [3]Flowers, R., Ketcham, R., Shuster, D. and Farley, K., (2009), GCA 73, 2347-2365.",

The assessment of carbon stock and carbon change of forest soil in China is absence, though huge carbon sinks has been observed in biomass both of China and global forests in decades. This reveals less understanding of SOC than biomass of forests at large scale. We estimated the bulk density, SOC density and carbon stock of forest soil in China based on 1662 soil profiles collected in the first forest soil inventory during 2012-2014. We also analyzed the carbon stock change, and the effect of afforestation to both of the carbon stock change and SOC density change of forest soil in China 1980s-2010s. The results indicate that, for the forest soil in China 2010s, the average bulk density is 1.18 g cm-3, the mean SOC density is 114.7 Mg ha-1, and the SOC stock is 23.82 Pg C. During the period of 1980s-2010s, the SOC stock increased 2.45 Pg C, about 81.5 Tg C yr-1, which is a little less than the biomass carbon change of forests in China. Moreover, not the SOC density, but the increased forest area by afforestation is the major contribution to the SOC sink. The SOC density increased after afforestation for the soil great groups formed under cropland and desert, but decreased for the most soil great groups formed under grassland in 1980s-2010s. Therefore, if both of forest area and SOC density could be increased in China, the carbon sequestration ability would be enhanced and the effect of climate change would be released.",

            "abstract": "We present here a study about some possible physical-chemical changes on the Southern hemisphere atmosphere, in Brazil, due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) flux decreases (Forbush Decreases). Galactic Cosmic Rays are energetic particles that come from interstellar medium and arrive on the Earth isotropically and continuously. These particles interact with atmosphere constituents and induce the ionization of the neutral atmosphere. It is known that the presence of ions on the troposphere can change the vapor condensation patterns, since some ions can behave like cloud condensation nuclei. So, there is a work hypothesis, that the GCR flux decrease can cause some change on the physical-chemical of the atmosphere. We have investigated this possible effect, using three periods of Forbush Decrease effects (Nov/01, Oct/03 e Jul/12) with different magnitudes, on three different latitudinal range of Brazilian sector, Porto Alegre (30.08o S , YY O); Brasília (15.75o S , YY O) and Belém (1.46o S , YY O). The atmospheric effects are assessed by analysis of the temperature, pressure, humidity and aerossol data profiles, since the surface up to stratosphere. We have also studied, for comparison, high latitude atmosphere by atmospheric data from Jokioinen - Filand (60.8o N , 23.5o E) for the same three FDs. Then, our aim with this study is to investigate possible GCR decreases effects in the lower atmosphere at high, medium and low latitudes. The results obtained in this study will be compared with previous published works.",

            "abstract": "Malaria is a public health threat to people globally leading to 198 million cases and 584,000 deaths annually. Outbreaks of vector borne diseases such as malaria can be significantly impacted by climate variables such as precipitation. For example, an increase in rainfall has the potential to create pools of water that can serve as breeding locations for mosquitos. Peru is a country that is currently controlling malaria, but has not been able to completely eliminate the disease. Despite the various initiatives in order to control malaria - including regional efforts to improve surveillance, early detection, prompt treatment, and vector management - malaria cases in Peru have risen between 2011 and 2014.\nThe purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that climate variability plays a fundamental role in malaria occurrence over a 12-year period (2003-2014) in Peru. When analyzing climate variability, it is important to obtain high-quality, high-resolution data for a time series long enough to draw conclusion about how climate variables have been and are changing. Remote sensing is a powerful tool for measuring and monitoring climate variables continuously in time and space. A widely used satellite-based precipitation product, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), available globally since 1998, was used to obtain 3-hourly data with a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°. The precipitation data was linked to weekly (2003-2014) malaria cases collected by health centers and available at a district level all over Peru to investigate the relationship between precipitation and the seasonal and annual variations in malaria incidence. Further studies will incorporate additional climate variables such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and surface pressure from remote sensing data products and climate models. Ultimately, this research will help us to understand if climate variability impacts malaria incidence rates and to determine which regions of the country are most affected.",

            "abstract": "Fairbanks, AK experiences extreme pollution episodes that result in winter violations of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This poses a significant health risk for the inhabitants of the area. These high levels result from trapping of pollution in a very shallow boundary layer due to local meteorology, but the role of primary (direct emission) of particulate matter versus secondary production (in the atmosphere) of particulate matter is not understood. Analysis of the PM2.5 composition is being conducted to provide insight into sources, trends, and chemistry. Methods are developed to convert carbon data from IMPROVE (post-2009 analysis method) to NIOSH (pre-2009 method) utilizing blank subtraction, sampler bias adjustment, and inter-method correlations from co-located samples. By converting all carbon measurements to a consistent basis, long-term trends can be analyzed. The approach shows excellent mass closure between PM2.5 mass reconstructed from constituents and gravimetric-analyzed mass. This approach could be utilized in other US locations where the carbon analysis methods also changed. Results include organic and inorganic fractional mass percentages, analyzed over an eight-year period for two testing sites in Fairbanks and two in the nearby city of North Pole. We focus on the wintertime (Nov—Feb) period when most air quality violations occur and find that the particles consist primarily of organic carbon, with smaller percentages of sulfate, elemental carbon, ammonium, and nitrate. The Fairbanks area PM2.5 organic carbon / elemental carbon partitioning matches the source profile of wood smoke. North Pole and Fairbanks PM2.5 have significant compositional differences, with North Pole having a larger percentage of organic matter. Mass loadings in SO42-, NO3-, and total PM2.5 mass correlate with temperature. Multi-year temporal trends show little if any change with a strong effect from temperature. Insights from this study regarding primary versus possible secondary PM2.5 production processes can help in identifying effective PM2.5 control strategies.",

Along their path, some CMEs can drive shock waves, which accelerate ions and electrons. These fast electrons can generate type II radio bursts at the local plasma frequency and/or its first harmonic. In this study we use data from the two STEREO spacecraft which carry both imaging and radio instruments with direction-finding capabilities allowing us to track energetic electrons responsible for radio bursts. We present an analysis of type II bursts observed on the November 29 – 30, 2013. The shock wave signatures were possibly generated by an interaction of two consecutive CMEs. We have investigated three time-frequency intervals when received radio waves were sufficiently intense for direction-finding analysis. The obtained positions of triangulated radio sources suggest that the CMEs propagate towards the STEREO-A. The IP shock associated with this event has been also observed in situ by the MESSENGER and STEREO-A spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical cyclones, including winter westerly disturbances (WD) over central Asia, are fundamental features of the atmosphere that redistribute energy, momentum, and moisture from global to regional scales. Within the Karakoram and western Himalaya (KH), snowfall from only a few WD each winter maintains the region’s snowpack and its vast network of glaciers, which seasonally melt to sustain water resources for downstream populations across Asia. WD activity and subsequent precipitation in the mountains are influenced by global atmospheric variability and tropical-extratropical interactions. This research explores the independent influences of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation on WD and extreme precipitation events in the KH.\nOn interannual time-scales, El Niño suppresses convection in the Indian Ocean and induces a Rossby wave response over Southwest Asia that is linked with enhanced dynamical forcing of WD and available moisture content. Consequently, extreme orographic precipitation events are more frequent during El Niño than La Niña or neutral conditions. A similar spatial pattern of tropical diabatic heating anomalies is produced by the MJO at intraseasonal scales. In comparison to El Niño, the Rossby wave response to MJO activity is less spatially uniform over southwest Asia and exists on a much shorter time-scale. Consequently, this mode’s relationship with WD behavior and KH precipitation is more complex. Phases of the MJO propagation cycle that favor the dynamical enhancement of WD simultaneously suppress available moisture over southwest Asia, and vice versa. As a result, extreme precipitation events in the KH occur with similar frequency in most phases of the MJO, however, the relative importance of the dynamic and thermodynamic components of WD to orographic precipitation in the KH transitions as the MJO propagates. These findings give insight into the dynamics and predictability of extreme precipitation events in the KH through their relationship with global atmospheric variability, and are an important consideration for Asia’s water resources in a changing climate.",

We merged Landsat imagery with municipal level agricultural census data for the period 1974-2013, to produce 30 arc-second resolution (1 km x 1 km) yearly datasets of pasturelands and cattle stocking rate (see Dias et al poster in this same session). Our analysis of this dataset indicates that, in the period 1993-2013, the total pastureland area in the country has decreased at a rate of 1.4 M ha/yr, while average stocking rate is increasing at the rate of 0.025 AU/(ha.yr). Moreover, we calculated the stocking rate of the top 5% and top 10% hectares, and the yield gap, or the difference between these top rates and the average. The yield gap is the productivity difference between what is largely possible with current technology and climate (top 5% or top 10%) and the typical cattle raiser, represented by the average. Closing the yield gap is often considered as a standard form of increasing agricultural output in general. Our results indicate that, in the same period, the top 10% are increasing at the rate of 0.040 AU/(ha.yr), while the top 5% are increasing at the rate of 0.048 AU/(ha.yr), twice as high as the average. The yield gap is widening and the rate of separation is increasing in recent years. These data suggest that top yield cattle raisers in Brazil are investing in technology significantly more than the average. Regional analysis indicates that this is happening mainly in southern and northern Brazil, while in Central, Southeast and Northeast Brazil, high productivities are not increasing as fast. Since top yields are far from stabilizing, there is a very large potential for intensification, increasing cattle size and total cattle output in Brazil.",

The Amazon region is particularly susceptible to changes in number-diameter distributions of the atmospheric particle population because of the low background concentrations and high water vapor levels, indicating a regime of cloud properties that is highly sensitive to aerosol microphysics. This natural regime, different from most other continental areas worldwide, is expected to be perturbed by the interaction of the Manaus urban plume with the natural the natural environment. Studying the effects of this interaction on the cloud and aerosol life cycle is the main objective of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) campaign taking place around Manaus-Brazil from January 2014 to December 2015. In this paper we compare the particle hygroscopicity calculated from measurements of size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei performed at three ground sites during the first year of the GoAmazon 2014/15 experiment. Site T3 is about 70 km downwind from Manaus experiencing urban polluted and background conditions; site T2 is just across the Rio Negro from Manaus and CCN measurements were performed there only from 15 August 2014 to 30 Jan 2015; and T0, at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), is a pristine site about 200 km upwind from Manaus. Our results indicate a lower hygroscopicity under polluted conditions (mean kappa values around 0.14 to 0.16) than under clean conditions (mean kappa around 0.2 to 0.3). At the clean site, it was possible to identify peaks of large sea salt particles with organic coating, while small particles seems to be purely organic. The activation fraction and hygroscopicity will be compared and discussed as a function of particle size. The mean kappa at ATTO is 0.17+-0.05 (mean of June and September) when there is no impact from long range transport from Africa or fresh soot emissions affecting the site.",

Behind the dam the reservoir can trap sediment from the stream and fill over time. With increasing population and drinking and irrigation water demands, particularly in the areas that have highly variable weather and extended drought periods such as the United States Great Plains, reservoir sedimentation escalates water management concerns. Under nearly all projected climate change scenarios we expect that reservoir water storage and management will come under intense scrutiny because of the extensive use of interstate river compacts in the Great Plains. In the state of Kansas, located in the Great Plains, bathymetric surveys have been completed during the last decade for many major lakes by the Kansas Biological Survey, Kansas Water Office, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In this paper, we studied the spatial and temporal changes of reservoir characteristics including sedimentation yield, depletion rate, and storage capacity loss for 24 federally-operated reservoirs in Kansas. These reservoirs have an average age of about 50 years and collectively have lost approximately 15% of their original capacity, with the highest annual observed single-reservoir depletion rate of 0.84% and sedimentation yield of 1,685 m3 km-2 yr-1.",

Studying land-use and climate change and their impact under different scenarios can help suggest policy directions for future events. This study explores the spatial results of different land use and climate models on the extent of species rich areas in South Korea.\nWe built land use models of forest conversion and created four 2050 scenarios: (1) a loss trend following current levels, resulting in 15.5% lost; (2) similar loss, but with forest conservation in areas with suitable future climates; (3) a reduction of forest loss by 50%; and (4) a combination of preservation of forest climate refugia and overall reduction of loss by 50%.\nForest climate refugia were identified through the use of species distribution models run on 1,031 forest plant species to project current and 2050 distributions. We calculated change in species richness under four climate projections, permitting an assessment of forest refugia zones. We then crossed the four land use models with the climate-driven change in species richness.\nForest areas predominantly convert to agricultural areas, while climate-suitable extents for forest plants decline and move northward, especially to higher elevations.\nScenario 2, that has the higher level of deforestation but protects future species rich areas, conserves nearly as much future biodiversity as scenario 3, which reduced deforestation rates by 50%. This points to the importance of including biogeographic climate dynamics in forest policy. Scenario 4 was the most effective at conserving forest biodiversity.\nWe suggest conserving forest areas with suitable climates for biodiversity conservation and the establishment of monoculture plantations targeted to areas where species richness will decline based on our results.",

Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) are the two indexes used to investigate meteorological and hydrological drought, respectively. Study is done for Willamette Basin with a drainage area of 29,700 km2 accommodating more than 3 million inhabitants and 25 dams. We analyze our study for annual time scale as well as three future periods of near future (2010-2039), intermediate future (2040-2069), and far future (2070-2099). Large uncertainty is found from GCM predictions. Results reveal that meteorological drought events are expected to increase in near future. Severe to extreme drought with large areal coverage and several years of occurance is predicted around year 2030 with the likelihood of exceptional drought for both drought types. SPI is usually showing positive trends, while SDI indicates negative trends in most cases.",

This improved understanding includes characteristics such as the distributions of geographic locations, pulse durations, pulse shapes, and pulse multiplicities. Using this post-BATSE knowledge, we reassessed the BATSE TGF catalogue(http://gammaray.nsstc.nasa.gov/batse/tgf/). Some BATSE triggers have features that can easily identify the trigger as a TGF, while others display different features that are unusual for TGFs. The BATSE triggers of the TGF catalogue were classified into five categories: TGFs, Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs), unusual TGFs, uncertain due to insufficient data, and TEB candidates. The triggers with unusual features will be further investigated. A table of our classifications and comments will be added to the online catalogue.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic alteration of the phosphorus (P) cycle has led to subsequent soil and water quality issues. For example, P build up in soils due to historic fertilizer application may become biologically available and exacerbate eutrophication and anoxia in nearby water bodies. In the humid Northeastern United States, storm runoff transports P and also stimulates biogeochemical processes, these locations are termed biogeochemical ‘hot spots’. Many studies have looked at nitrogen and carbon cycling in biogeochemical hot spots but few have focused on P. We hypothesize the periodic wetting and drying of biogeochemical hot spots promotes a combination of abiotic and biotic processes that influence the mobility of P. To test this hypothesis, we took monthly soil samples (5 cm deep) from May to October in forest, pasture, and cropped land near Ithaca, NY. In-situ measurements taken with each sample included volumetric soil moisture and soil temperature. We also analyzed samples for ‘runoff generated’ phosphate, nitrate, and sulfate (from 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction), Fe(II), percent organic matter, pH, as well as oxalate extractable and total P, Al, and Fe. We used linear mixed effects models to test how runoff generated phosphate concentrations vary with soil moisture and whether other environmental factors strengthen/weaken this relationship. The knowledge gained from this study will improve our understanding of P cycling in biogeochemical hot spots and can be used to improve the effectiveness of agricultural management practices in the Northeastern United States.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variability in sediment flux is directly related to geomorphic change. Along the Colorado River, measurements of sediment flux are used to track changes in sediment storage and time the release of controlled floods aimed at building eroded sandbars. The very high uncertainty typical of measurements of sediment flux has been reduced by a program of continuous measurement of suspended-sediment concentration by acoustic surrogates. However, there is still significant uncertainty in calculations of total flux. A large fraction of that uncertainty may be caused by overly simplified treatment of bedload flux, which is currently estimated as a constant 5% of the suspended sand flux. That constant is based on estimates of bedform migration rate made with side-scan sonar. Here, we apply theory which relates bedform migration and streamwise sediment flux, to bathymetric data collected at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution adjacent to the USGS sediment monitoring station above Diamond Creek (362 km downstream from Lees Ferry, AZ). Quantitative time series measurements of reach averaged bedform transport are calculated and compared to fluxes estimated by expressing bedload as a constant fraction of suspended load. Over the range of discharges expected during normal dam operations, bedload transport estimated from the migration of bedforms in the study reach is at least 20% of instantaneous suspended sand load measured at the gage. While bedload appears to be controlled primarily by discharge (and therefore transport capacity of the flow), suspended sand load varies inversely with the grain size of suspended material, suggesting dependence on sediment supply. Sediment transport capacity can vary significantly at a given discharge depending on local hydraulic geometry, so it is likely that there is more spatial variability in bedload transport than suspended sand transport.",

Transitions between atmospheric states, buoyant flows over complex terrain, and times with only weak forcing mechanisms all have rich physical expressions of atmospheric flow that are not fully understood. These motions often span a large range of scales and are nonstationary. Traditional atmospheric measurement approaches are inadequate in these situations as they do not have the data density or the physical extent to capture the full range of motions. An unmanned aerial system (UAS) is used to lift distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technologies to observe the early morning transition from stable to unstably stratified conditions. The UAS/DTS combination yielded observations of temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere with never-seen-before resolution and extent. The data reveal a complex interplay of motions that occur during the morning transition that ultimately results in the propagation and growth of unstable wave modes. The observations have given new insight into the appropriate scaling variables for the morning transition time.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic evolution of the radiation belts is believed to be controlled in large part by two separate but related classes of naturally occurring plasma waves: ELF/VLF chorus and hiss emissions. Although whistler mode chorus has been extensively studied since the first reports by Storey in 1953, the source mechanism and properties are still subjects of active research. Moreover, the origin of plasmaspheric hiss, the electromagnetic emission believed to be responsible for the gap between the inner and outer radiation belts, has been debated for over four decades.  Although these waves can be observed in situ on spacecraft, ground-based observing stations can provide orders of magnitude higher data volumes and decades long data coverage essential for certain long-term and statistical studies of wave properties. Recent observational and theoretical works suggest that high resolution analysis of the spectral features of both hiss and chorus emissions can provide insight into generation processes and be used to validate existing theories.\nApplication of the classic Fourier (FFT) technique unfortunately yields a tradeoff between time and frequency resolution. In additional to Fourier spectra, we employ novel methods to make spectrograms with high time and frequency resolutions, independently using minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR). These techniques are applied to ground based data observations of hiss and chorus made in Alaska. \nPlasmaspheric hiss has been widely regarded as a broadband, structure less, incoherent emission. We quantify the extent to which plasmaspheric hiss can be a coherent emission with complex fine structure. Likewise, to date, researchers have differentiated between hiss and chorus coherency primarily using qualitative “naked eye” approaches to amplitude spectra. Using a quantitative approach to observed amplitude and we present more rigorous classification criteria for these emissions.",

All available data from 2007-2014 within and near the Yellowstone region was downloaded for the USArray TA network (TA), the Yellowstone Seismic Network (WY), the NOISY array (Z2), the USGS Intermountain West network (IW), the Plate Boundary Observatory Borehole Seismic Network (PB), and the USGS National Seismic Network (US). For each station, we perform daily noise pre-processing (temporal normalization and spectrum whitening) simultaneously for all three components before multi-component noise cross-correlations are calculated. Results for both Rayleigh- and Love-wave phase velocity inversions clearly show the low velocity anomaly associated with the upper-crustal magma reservoir seen previously using body wave tomography. In addition, low-velocity anomalies associated with sediment-filled basins are visible in Wyoming. Short period low Love-wave velocities are seen along the Snake River Plain, the track of the Yellowstone hotspot likely related to the shallow sediment layer. Based on the surface wave phase velocity maps, we invert for a 3D S-wave crustal model. The resulting model will be compared to previous, but spatially limited, body wave S-wave models as well as recent body wave P-wave velocity models to better constrain Vp/Vs ratios as well as the melt fraction of the magma chamber. Preliminary results using amplitude information of noise cross-correlations to calculate Rayleigh-wave ellipticity, or Rayleigh-wave H/V (horizontal to vertical) amplitude ratios to better constrain the shallow velocity structure will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We propose to use the evidence from our solar system to understand exoplanets, and in particular, to predict their surface chemistry and thereby the possibility of life. An Earth-like planet, born from the same nebula as its host star, is composed primarily of silicate rocks and an iron-nickel metal core, and depleted in volatile content in a systematic manner. The more volatile (easier to vaporize or dissociate into gas form) an element is in an Earth-like planet, the more depleted the element is compared to its host star. After depletion, an Earth-like planet would go through the process of core formation due to heat from radioactive decay and collisions. Core formation depletes a planet’s rocky mantle of siderophile (iron-loving) elements, in addition to the volatile depletion. After that, Earth-like planets likely accrete some volatile-rich materials, called “late veneer”. The late veneer could be essential to the origins of life on Earth and Earth-like planets, as it also delivers the volatiles such as nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and water to the planet’s surface, which are crucial for life to occur. Here we build an integrative model of Earth-like planets from the bottom up. Thus the chemical compositions of Earth-like planets could be inferred from their mass-radius relations and their host stars’ elemental abundances, and the origins of volatile contents (especially water) on their surfaces could be understood, and thereby shed light on the origins of life on them. This elemental abundance model could be applied to other rocky exoplanets in exoplanet systems.",

The Markov model is constructed in a reduced multivariate EOF (MEOF) space with 3 MEOFs. The cross-validated hindcast skill of NINO3.4 in 1980-1995 is competitive among dynamical and statistical models. The model was implemented into operation at CPC in early 2000s since it successfully forecasted the El Nino in winter 1997/98 starting from November 1996 initial conditions (I.C.). In this study, we assessed the real time forecast skill of ENSO by the Markov model in 1996-2015 and compared it with that of other operational forecast models. It is found that the Markov model has lower forecast skill of ENSO in the 2000s than that in the 1980s and 1990s, which is common among ENSO forecast models. The lower forecast skill of the Markov model in the 2000s can be attributed to weak precursor of positive heat content anomaly in the equatorial Pacific and a shorter lead time of the precursor relative to NINO3.4, both of which is related to the decadal change of ENSO. However, out of surprise, the Markov model successfully forecasted the El Nino in winter 2014/15 starting from February 2014 I.C.. In addition, the Markov model forecasted the continuation of the El Nino into the spring/summer/fall of 2015. Starting from March 2015 I.C., the Markov model forecasted a strong El Nino in winter 2015/16. This surprising long-lead forecast skill can be attributed to the positive second principal component (PC) of MEOF that leads NINO3.4 by 6-9 months, a precursor commonly seen in the 1980s and 1990s. This provided us confidence in the model forecast of a strong El Nino in winter 2015/16 that is highly consistent with the ensemble forecast of dynamical models.",

            "abstract": "Two surrogate reactive organic gas (ROG) mixtures were developed to create a controlled reactivity environment simulating different urban atmospheres with varying levels of anthropogenic (e.g. Los Angeles reactivity) and biogenic (e.g. Atlanta reactivity) influences. Traditional chamber experiments focus on the oxidation of one or two volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors, allowing the reactivity of the system to be dictated by those compounds. Surrogate ROG mixtures control the overall reactivity of the system, allowing for the incremental aerosol formation from an added VOC to be observed. The surrogate ROG mixtures were developed based on that used to determine maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) scales for O3 formation from VOC precursors in a Los Angeles smog environment. Environmental chamber experiments were designed to highlight the incremental aerosol formation in the simulated environment due to the addition of an added anthropogenic (aromatic) or biogenic (terpene) VOC. All experiments were conducted in the UC Riverside/CE-CERT dual 90m3 environmental chambers. It was found that the aerosol precursors behaved differently under the two altered reactivity conditions, with more incremental aerosol being formed in the anthropogenic ROG system than in the biogenic ROG system. Further, the biogenic reactivity condition inhibited the oxidation of added anthropogenic aerosol precursors, such as m-xylene. Data will be presented on aerosol properties (density, volatility, hygroscopicity) and bulk chemical composition in the gas and particle phases (from a SYFT Technologies selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer, SIFT-MS, and Aerodyne high resolution time of flight aerosol mass spectrometer, HR-ToF-AMS, respectively) comparing the two controlled reactivity systems and single precursor VOC/NOx studies. Incremental aerosol yield data at different controlled reactivities provide a novel and valuable insight in the attempt to extrapolate environmental chamber data to ambient observations and aerosol models.",

The network is mainly composed approximately by one hundred broad-band and strong motion instruments and 130 GNSS devices; all will be connected in real time. Forty units present an optional RTX capability, where satellite orbits and clock corrections are sent to the field device producing a 1-Hz stream at 4-cm level. Tests are being conducted to stream the real-time raw data to be later processed at the central facility. Hypocentral locations and magnitudes are estimated after few minutes by automatic processing software based on wave arrival; for magnitudes less than 7.0 the rapid estimation works within acceptable bounds. For larger events, we are currently developing automatic detectors and amplitude estimators of displacement coming out from the real time GNSS streams. This software has been tested for several cases showing that, for plate interface events, the minimum magnitude threshold detectability reaches values within 6.2 and 6.5 (1-2 cm coastal displacement), providing an excellent tool for earthquake early characterization from a tsunamigenic perspective.",

            "abstract": "Forest inventory faces a new era as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) increased the precision of measurements, while reduced field effort and price of data acquisition. A large number of algorithms were developed to identify various forest attributes from UAS data. The objective of the present research is to assess the robustness of two types of tree identification algorithms when UAS data are combined with digital elevation models (DEM). The algorithms use as input photogrammetric point cloud, which are subsequent rasterized. The first type of algorithms associate tree crown with an inversed watershed (subsequently referred as watershed based), while the second type is based on simultaneous representation of tree crown as an individual entity, and its relation with neighboring crowns (subsequently referred as simultaneous representation). A DJI equipped with a SONY a5100 was used to acquire images over an area from center Louisiana. The images were processed with Pix4D, and a photogrammetric point cloud with 50 points / m2 was attained. DEM was obtained from a flight executed in 2013, which also supplied a LIDAR point cloud with 30 points/m2. The algorithms were tested on two plantations with different species and crown class complexities: one homogeneous (i.e., a mature loblolly pine plantation), and one heterogeneous (i.e., an unmanaged uneven-aged stand with mixed species pine –hardwoods). Tree identification on photogrammetric point cloud reveled that simultaneous representation algorithm outperforms watershed algorithm, irrespective stand complexity. Watershed algorithm exhibits robustness to parameters, but the results were worse than majority sets of parameters needed by the simultaneous representation algorithm. The simultaneous representation algorithm is a better alternative to watershed algorithm even when parameters are not accurately estimated. Similar results were obtained when the two algorithms were run on the LIDAR point cloud.",

            "abstract": "Debates persist about the interpretations of stable-isotope based proxies for the surface uplift of the north-central Tibetan Plateau. These disputes arise from the uncertain relationship between elevation and the δ18O values of meteoric waters, based on modern patterns of isotopes in precipitation and surface waters. We present a comprehensive river water data set (1,315 samples) covering most parts of Tibet to characterize the spatial variability and controlling factors of their isotopic compositions. Compared with the annual mean oxygen isotope values of precipitations, we conclude that river waters are a good substitute for isotopic studies of precipitations on the high flat Tibetan Plateau on a mean annual scale, but experience predictable negative shifts in the marginal piedmont lowlands. In the marginal mountainous regions of the plateau, especially the southern and eastern margins, the d18O and d-excess values of river waters decrease and increase respectively with increasing mean catchment elevation, which can be modeled as a Rayleigh distillation process with decreasing condensation temperature and under relative humidity lower than 100%. However, in the interior of the plateau (north of the Trans-Himalaya range), northward increasing trends in d18O and dD values are pronounced and present robust linear relations; d-excess values are lower than the marginal mountainous regions and exhibit distinct contrasts between the eastern (8‰–12‰) and western parts of the plateau (<8‰). We suggest that these isotopic features of river waters in the interior of the plateau result from combined effects of: 1) mixing of different moisture sources transported by the Indian summer monsoon and Westerly winds; 2) contribution of moisture from recycled local surface water; and 3) sub-cloud evaporation under low relative humidity, especially in regions with small annual precipitation amount.",

            "abstract": "The upcoming avalanche of openly available SAR imagery is expanding the horizons of what can and cannot be accomplished with InSAR. Historically, InSAR performed best in arid regions - an observation that became a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy as satellite agencies acquired less data in regions with vegetation and agricultural activity. Here we present an overview of the development of InSAR research in tectonics and land surface change over the past 2+ decades, with a view towards some of the new advances in modeling and data management that will be necessary to fully take advantage of SAR data in the near future. One of the most basic breakthroughs will be that issues with decorrelation and the need for sophisticated time series analysis just to enable phase unwrapping will no longer be a major problem over many areas of the globe. New challenges will be the interpretation of coherent signal related to vegetation, soil moisture and time-variable phase scattering height in regions that previously would have just been flagged as “noise”. We present results based on the ingestion of independent optical and radar observation types into SAR time series analysis, with applications to deformation sources in the Central and Eastern United States.\nThe land surface properties in the Central and Eastern United States differ from those in the arid regions where InSAR has often been used, both in the presence of vegetation and the often very rapid changes in surface scattering characteristics that occur seasonally and during single events (snowfall, flooding, etc.). In the past, observations were so sparse that these changes resulted in decorrelation, rendering the data unusable. However, shorter acquisition times and a wider range of radar wavelengths allow the extraction of coherent signals from these areas, even spanning large snow storms. The resulting data contain signals that were often disregarded during InSAR time series analysis, but that must be either accounted for or masked when no sufficient model exists. We present examples associated with agricultural and urban areas, where the addition of independent data types can help classify the surface and improve the extraction of true ground motion.",

Recently launched and future SAR missions with open data access will increase the temporal sampling rates further over many areas of the globe, resulting in a new ability to lower the detection threshold for earthquakes and, potentially, interseismic motion and transients associated with subduction zone settings. \nHere we describe some of the anticipated detection abilities for events ranging from earthquakes and slow slip along the subduction zone interface up to landslides, and examine the variations in land use around the circum-Pacific and how that and its changes over time will affect the use of InSAR. We will show the results of an effort to combine Landsat and other optical imagery with SAR data catalogues in the Pacific Northwest to improve the characterization of ground deformation signals, including the identification of “spurious” signals that are not related to true ground deformation.

            "abstract": "The collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia in the early Cenozoic is widely believed to be the root cause of the transition from a “greenhouse” world to an “icehouse” world over the last 50 Myr. My colleagues and I proposed that this collision resulted in a globally significant increase in chemical weathering rates that led to a drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and the eventual build-up of ice sheets at both poles. Geologic and field data provide support for this hypothesis, including: a) the timing of collision and cooling, b) the observation that chemical weathering rates increase with physical erosion and denudation, and c) proxy evidence for changes in ocean chemistry consistent with increased chemical weathering over Cenozoic. However, a significant problem continues to plague this seemingly straightforward interpretation--namely, where does the CO2 needed to support the inferred increase in chemical weathering over the Cenozoic come from? The ocean-atmosphere reservoir of carbon is so small that it would be depleted after million years or so. A negative feedback within the carbon cycle is needed to prevent atmospheric CO2 levels being drawn down to snowball Earth levels. Classically, a surface temperature-weathering feedback, first described by Walker in 1981, is invoked--but, if chemical weathering has been higher over the last 40-50 Myr relative to the previous period then this feedback could only work if there has been a similar increase in mantle CO2 degassing rates uncoupled to seafloor spreading rates (which are currently believed to have remained constant). Alternatively, possible negative-feedbacks within the carbon cycle may exist in the organic carbon cycle, in the seafloor basalt weathering/reverse weathering realm, and/or possibly be disguised by a large changes in the amount of terrestrial silicate weathering happening in regions without a continental signature (e.g., island arcs). Ultimately, the carbosphere, which extends from the mantle to the atmosphere and upon which Earth’s climate and life depends, is influenced by numerous interconnected geologic processes we are only just beginning to understand.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea level, whether rapid or gradual, influence the style and preservation of shorelines and near-shore features including fossil reefs, paleo-sea cliffs and scarps, as well as intertidal and subtidal facies and biota. Using insight from modern shoreline systems, members of the PLIOMAX FESD project have mapped mid-Pliocene, MIS11, and MIS5e shorelines at numerous localities around the world and then modeled the effects of subsequent glacial isostatic adjustment on their current position. For MIS5e we find evidence for a rapid rise in sea level in the later phase of the interglacial, consistent with a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Estimates for maximum sea level during MIS5e, between 6 and 9 m, are in agreement with other studies and imply mass loss from ice sheets at both poles. For MIS11, which appears to have been slightly warmer than MIS5e, our best estimate of sea level rise is 6-13 m, a value subsequently narrowed to 8.5-12 m. Recent advances in ice sheet models also illustrate the potential for a substantial Antarctic contribution to elevated sea-level during MIS5e and other Pliestocene interglacials including MIS11. For the Pliocene interval around 3 Ma, we cannot place useful bounds on sea level because shoreline features have been vertically displaced many tens of meters by mantle dynamic topographic changes of uncertain magnitude and, probably to a lesser degree, by flexure associated with sediment redistribution. However, these once horizontal shorelines, which are sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, provide useful targets against which to measure the performance of time-dependent mantle convection models. Ultimately, the paleo-shoreline data is telling us that when global climate warming is more than 2°C (relative to pre-industrial, or >1°C relative to today), significant loss of ice mass occurs at high latitudes equivalent to a minimum rise in sea level of 6m.",

The system has a novel optical design to enable long-aperture measurements of emission lines in the absence of continuum, intended primarily to measure the H and D Ly αlpha emission lines and thereby the D/H ratio from the martian upper atmosphere. The system also detects the OI 1304 triplet with the three component lines well resolved. The main scientific goal of the echelle channel is to measure the H and D Ly αlpha emissions, and to discover how the H and D densities, temperatures, and escape fluxes vary with location, season, topography, etc. The global D/H ratio of the martian atmosphere is roughly 5 times higher than in the terrestrial atmosphere due to the escape of a large volume of water into space, likely early in the history of Mars. Since H atoms escape faster than D atoms, the D/H ratio increases with time as more water is lost. Recent IR observations indicate large variations in the D/H ratio in the lower atmosphere from location to location, and possibly seasonal changes [Villanueva et al. 2015]. HST and MEX measurements of the H corona of Mars show large (order of magnitude) changes in the H exosphere and escape flux with changing seasons and/or heliospheric distance [Clarke et al. 2014; Chaffin et al. 2014]. Do the same variations apply to deuterium? Are there similar variations in the D/H ratio? Early results from the echelle channel will be presented.",

We utilize African Rainfall Climatology Precipitation Estimates (1983-2014) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR: 1981-2014) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: 2001:2014) to examine the aspects of the annual cycle and interannual variability using both time series plots and time-space diagrams. With respect to Lake Chad region, the first two decades of the series (1981-2000) show predominantly dryer than long-term average conditions with the periods 1989, 1992 and 1996/1997 as the signature drought periods coinciding with the desiccation of the Sahel region during the 1980s to early 1990s decades. The period 2000 to present is dominated by above average rainfall and NDVI with 2003, 2007 and 2012 being the most pronounced wet/greener years. The southern African ecosystems (Okavango and Etosha) show more or less a similar temporal pattern to that of Lake Chad basin, however, the wet periods are more amplified and persistent especially 2000, 2006, 2010 and 2014, with corresponding above average NDVI departures. The amplified nature of wet and dry periods present in the southern African ecosystem time series are consistent with the El Niño Southern Oscillation teleconnection patterns. Overall these three ecosystems serve as detectable fingerprints of changing climate conditions and ecosystems in these arid regions.",

As if that were not enough to cause substantial sleep loss in modelers, we propose here a fifth element of uncertainty that results from implementation ambiguity that occurs when the model’s mathematical description is translated into computational code. We demonstrate the implementation ambiguity using the example of nitrogen down regulation, a necessary process in modeling carbon-climate feedbacks. We show that, depending on common land BGC model interpretations of the governing equations for mineral nitrogen, there are three different implementations of nitrogen down regulation. We coded these three implementations in the ACME land model (ALM), and explored how they lead to different preindustrial and contemporary land biogeochemical states and fluxes. We also show how this implementation ambiguity can lead to different carbon-climate feedback estimates across the RCP scenarios. We conclude by suggesting how to avoid such implementation ambiguity in ESM BGC models.",

However, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) modulates this ENSO teleconnection through transient eddy interaction, reinforcing or weakening atmospheric circulation anomalies in the South Pacific Ocean. ENSO teleconnections also depend on the location of the heating/cooling anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, otherwise known as ENSO flavors. Numerical simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) have been performed based on tropical forcing of El Niño flavors with warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the central (CP) or eastern (EP) tropical Pacific. CAM captures well the wide spatial and temporal variability associated with the SAM with both types of El Niño forcing. Autocorrelation analysis reveals a higher degree of SAM persistence in the EP simulations, supporting the expectation that EP events effectively influence SAM- events through the propagation of eddy momentum to the high latitudes. However, CAM only simulates accurately the impacts on atmospheric circulation in the high latitudes when the observed SAM phase is matched, especially for CP events. Evaluation of the transient eddies supports this conclusion, as eddy-propagation to the high latitudes is more robust during in-phase events (El Niño/SAM-) while out-of-phase events (El Niño/SAM+) inhibit eddy behavior in the mid-latitudes and limit the propagation of the tropical teleconnection. A regional perspective shows that this interaction takes place primarily over the Pacific Ocean, with high latitude circulation variability being a product of both tropical and high-latitude forcing.",

            "abstract": "Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) was developed to characterize the uncertainty in hydrologic predictions. However, ESP outputs are still prone to bias due to the uncertainty in the forcing data, initial condition, and model structure. Among these, uncertainty in forcing data has a major impact on the reliability of hydrologic simulations/forecasts. Major steps have been taken in generating less uncertain precipitation forecasts such as the Ensemble Pre-Processing (EPP) to achieve this goal. EPP is introduced as a statistical procedure based on the bivariate joint distribution between observation and forecast to generate ensemble climatologic forecast from single-value forecast. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of pre-processed ensemble precipitation forecast in generating ensemble streamflow predictions. Copula functions used in EPP, model the multivariate joint distribution between univariate variables with any level of dependency. Accordingly, ESP is generated by employing both raw ensemble precipitation forecast as well as pre-processed ensemble precipitation. The ensemble precipitation forecast is taken from Climate Forecast System (CFS) generated by National Weather Service‘s (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) models. Study is conducted using the precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) over two basins in the Pacific Northwest USA for the period of 1979 to 2013. Results reveal that applying this new EPP will lead to reduction of uncertainty and overall improvement in the ESP.",

            "abstract": "Future geostationary (Geo) advanced InfraRed (IR) sounders have finer spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions compared with the existing GOES sounders, providing much improved resolving power of atmospheric thermodynamic information. When quantitatively assessing the value-added impact from such instruments over the current sounding systems onboard the Low Earth Orbit (Leo) satellites, the real question is what is the optimal impact using the current assimilation/forecast systems. More specifically, will assimilation of more observations from Geo IR sounders with the current assimilation/forecast systems yield improved forecast as expected? And if so, how to assimilate the high temporal resolution Geo sounding information and what is the impact on forecasts? Taken tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting as an example, this study tries to address these questions through a quick regional Observing System Simulation Experiments (r-OSSE) study. The synthetic observations are simulated from the sample ECMWF T1279 nature run (NR) for Hurricane Sandy (2012), including RAOB, the Leo AIRS, and Geo AIRS. Various experiments were carried out using WRF 3.6.1 and GSI 3.3 to study the impact on Sandy track forecast. And the study shows that a) it is critical to assign an appropriate observational error (observation error covariance matrix – O matrix) in order to show improved positive impacts from Geo AIRS over Leo AIRS; b) cycling of 3/6-hourly shows improved positive impacts over none cycling, but hourly cycling does not show further improvement on forecasts among all experiments, and c) with thinning (120 ~ 240 km), the impacts have the following order: hourly > 3-hourly > 6-hourly > none cycling. These experiments indicate that while more observations may improve forecasts, much more observations are difficult to show further improvement with the current assimilation/forecast system configurations. There exists a tradeoff between the number of observations to be assimilated and the impact of single observation in order to maintain the value-added impact. The ultimate objective of this study is to find the optimal point where the advantage of observations is maximized with the existing assimilation/forecast systems. This will be done by adjusting the relative weighting between the background and the observations.",

            "abstract": "“Application-based service learning” (ABSL) refers to an approach to formal course instruction that integrates service and research components into the course. An ABSL approach was employed in a field-based environmental chemistry course, whose goal was to evaluate and monitor the aqueous geochemistry of coal mine-derived acid mine drainage (AMD) in the Appalachia basin. In this course, students conducted literature reviews on the geochemistry and environmental impacts of AMD, participated in a field sampling campaign of several AMD treatment systems, and conducted chemical analyses of the samples that they retrieved. The remainder of the course was dedicated to “lab meetings,” during which data was analyzed, conclusions were drawn from the data, and a manuscript was drafted that described the findings of the field analyses, and made recommendations regarding the performance of the AMD treatment systems. The service component of the course focused on socioeconomic impacts of coal mining and the Appalachian region, with the final manuscript distributed to AMD treatment practitioners and state regulatory agencies. A comparison of pre- and post-course questionnaires that included Likert scale questions revealed that students’ attitudes toward basic research improved over the period or the course. Based on the questionnaires attitudes toward service diminished, but “open-ended” questionnaires indicated an improved attitude toward both research and service, with an emphasis on the benefits of research that serves the community. Ultimately, we hope to develop approaches to compare the effectiveness of ABSL-based across disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Growing water scarcity underlies the importance of cooperation for the effective management of river basins, particularly in the context of international rivers in which unidirectional externalities can lead to asymmetric relationships between riparian countries. Studies have shown that significant economic benefits can be expected through basin-wide cooperation, however, the equitable partitioning of these benefits over the basin is less well studied and tends to overlook the importance of stakeholder input in the definition of equitability. In this study, an institutional arrangement to maximize welfare and then share the scarcity cost in a river basin is proposed. A river basin authority plays the role of a bulk water market operator, efficiently allocating bulk water to the users and collecting bulk water charges which are then equitably redistributed among water users. This highly regulated market restrains the behaviour of water users to control externalities and to ensure basin-wide coordination, enhanced efficiency, and the equitable redistribution of the scarcity cost. The institutional arrangement is implemented using the Eastern Nile River basin as a case study. The importance of this arrangement is that it can be adopted for application in negotiations to cooperate in trans-boundary river basins. The benefit sharing solution proposed is more likely to be perceived as equitable because water users help define the sharing rule. As a result, the definition of the sharing rule is not in question, as it would be if existing rules, such as bankruptcy rules or cooperative game theory solutions, are applied, with their inherent definitions of fairness. Results of the case study show that the sharing rule is predictable. Water users can expect to receive between 93.5% and 95% of their uncontested benefits (benefits that they expect to receive if water was not rationed), depending on the hydrologic scenario.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami flow speed can be interpreted from information contained in sandy tsunami deposits. Several inverse sediment transport models have been used to calculate tsunami flow speed from the vertical and horizontal grain size distributions of sandy tsunami deposits. The reconstructions are based on sediments that are interpreted to be deposited from suspension. Here we use the DELFT3D and Tunami forward numerical models of tsunami hydrodynamics to gain insight into the different phases of flow in a tsunami and the locations along an inundation path where assumptions of the inverse models are satisfied. Inverse model evaluations are constrained using field observations of tsunami flow depth, speed (limited observations), and deposit characteristics at a site near the Sendai Airport where the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami inundated 4.5 km inland. In addition to determining when and where flow speeds are high enough to suspend sediment, specific assumptions of suspended load capacity and particle trajectory models are tested. For the suspended load capacity model, the temporal and spatial gradients of flow are evaluated to test the degree to which the steady and uniform flow assumptions apply. For suspended particle trajectory models, the assumption that particles have a single path from where they are picked up to where they are deposited is evaluated in light of the temporal and spatial distributions of bottom shear stress. This research is a step towards combining forward and inverse models to create more robust hybrid tsunami inundation/sediment transport/geomorphic models. With increased knowledge of the applicability of inverse sediment transport models, the flow speed and size of paleotsunamis will be better understood and the ability to assess tsunami hazard from paleotsunami deposits will improve.",

            "abstract": "Seismic discontinuities are rapid changes in velocity and density over depth that arise from mechanisms such as changes in mineralogy, major element composition, melt content, volatile abundance, anisotropy, or a combination of the above. Seismic imaging of discontinuities complements information provided by seismic tomography and is important for understanding the dynamics and the structure of the mantle. For example, imaging variations in the depth and sharpness of discontinuities can trace underlying variations in temperature and composition in the mantle.\nWe use ScSScS precursors and ScS postcursors (ScS reverberations) to map the depth and sharpness of upper- and mid- mantle discontinuities beneath North America. To observe the reverberations, we collected broadband data recordings of earthquakes with depth > 300 km, source moment magnitude ≥ 5.5, and location < 60 degrees of EarthScope USArray stations. Two primary source regions met our qualifications: earthquakes from the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath South America, and earthquakes from the subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the Sea of Okhotsk. Our dataset consists of ~15 deep focus earthquakes that have well defined ScS and ScSScS arrivals.\nWe use array processing to generate vespagrams for detecting the ScS reverberations. Seismic energy falling at the appropriate slowness and travel time for reflections from upper- and mid- mantle discontinuities is migrated to depth. We use the resulting ScS reverberation derived reflectivity profiles to obtain estimates for discontinuity depth and impedance contrast in the regions falling between the source and array. We can use this information to image parts of the mantle under North America. Preliminary results indicate presence of multiple discontinuities in the upper mantle, including the 410 km discontinuity, a complex 660 km discontinuity, and intermittent mid-mantle discontinuities at 800-900 km depth.",

            "abstract": "Rwanda, a mountainous nation in Equatorial East Africa, is one of the least-urbanized nations in Africa. The majority of the population are subsistence farmers, and major sources of air pollution (e.g., particulates, greenhouse gases) in Rwanda include agricultural burning and cookstoves in rural areas, and older diesel vehicles and mototaxis in cities. Currently, initiatives to supply efficient cookstoves, development of cleaner-burning fuel from recycled agricultural waste, and new regulations on vehicle emissions and importation are underway. These initiatives seek to help Rwanda grow in the greenest way possible, to mitigate negative health and climate effects of development; however, little ambient data on air quality is available in different regions of Rwanda for a baseline study before and benefits study after these initiatives. The Rwanda Climate Observatory, located on the summit of Mt. Mugogo (-1.5833°, 29.5667°), a 2.5 km peak, has recently begun measurements of black carbon (BC) aerosol concentration and O3 and CO gas concentrations. BC measurements were performed with a 7-wavelength Magee Scientific aethalometer and the aethalometer model was used to calculate the influence of fossil fuel and biomass burning sources on BC concentrations. CO and O3 measurements were used in conjunction with BC aerosol data, and HYSPLIT back trajectories were also used to help discriminate between periods of heavy burning and periods of regional influence from traffic and general cookfire emissions. Since Mt. Mugogo is in a rural area, this station captures a snapshot of regional background pollution away from high anthropogenic influence. The nearby households and fields also allow case studies of household and crop burning during localized events and help quanitfy potential daily exposure to particulates and climate-forcing emissions in remote areas of this developing country. We will present time series of the BC, O3, CO and insolation measurements at Mt. Mugogo, and interpret them in terms of sources, circulation, air chemistry and physics, and sinks.",

It is suggested that electron temperature anisotropy can enhance the mirror instability growth rate while leaving the proton cyclotron instability unaffected, therefore it can help mirror instability to dominate the proton cyclotron instability in the Earth's magnetosheath. We used particle in cell expanding box simulations to investigate the electron temperature anisotropy effects on mirror instability evolution. Electron temperature anisotropy leads to generation of electron whistler instability. Our results show that the electron whistler instability grows much faster than the proton mirror instability and consumes all the electron free energy so there is no electron temperature anisotropy left for mirror instability to take advantage to grow faster than the proton cyclotron instability.",

The GOCART model belongs to the family of sectional aerosol models that use the mass of aerosol particles partitioned by their size, e.g., using fixed number of non-overlapping size bins. The discretization of the size distribution, however, imposes limits to the accuracy of this approach when using small number of bins. The simplified external mixture treatment of aerosols in GOCART and the use of mass tracers poses challenges for obtaining number concentration of aerosol particles and size resolved aerosol properties, which are important for modeling of aerosol activation properties and aerosol optical parameters. To further advance the GMAO's modeling capabilities a new aerosol component (MAMchem) was implemented in the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5). It predicts spatially and temporally varying aerosol size distribution and mixing state of sulfate, ammonium, black carbon, primary and secondary organic matter, sea salt and dust aerosols. The aerosol microphysics in the new aerosol component is the seven mode version of the modal aerosol model MAM7 [Liu et al., 2012] which was recently extended to include nitrate aerosols. MAMchem is coupled with the GEOS-5 radiation component and the two-moment cloud microphysics scheme enabling global and regional studies of aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions and feedbacks. In this presentation, we discuss the implementation of MAM7 in GEOS-5 and show results from GEOS-5/MAM7, i.e. MAMchem, simulations including global aerosol simulations at mesoscale (~20km) resolution with such a detailed representation of aerosol processes. The aerosol and cloud fields simulated with MAMchem are evaluated and compared with observations and results from the GEOS-5 meteorological and aerosol reanalysis during the SEAC4RS field campaign.",

There is currently a strong need for high temporal and spatial resolution ET products for climate and hydrological modelers. A satellite-based retrieval method based on vegetation index-temperature trapezoid (VITT) concept has been developed. This model has the ability to generate accurate ET estimates at high temporal and spatial resolutions by taking advantage of key remotely sensed parameters such as vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface temperature (LST) acquired by satellites as well as routinely-measured meteorological variables such as air temperature (Ta) and net radiation. For local-scale applications, the model has been successfully implemented in Python programming language and tested using Landsat satellite products at an eddy covariance flux tower in Florida. It is fully functional and automated such that there is no need of user intervention to run the model. The model development for continental-scale applications using VI and LST products from NASA satellites such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is currently in progress. The results for local-scale application and early results for continental-scale (US) will be presented and discussed.",

Prior to ~AD 1200, surface waters in the western Guaymas Basin (boxcore MD02-2517c2 at 27.4850° N, 112.0743°W, water depth 887 m) were characterized by high biologic productivity with alternating assemblages of productive diatoms (Thalassionema nitzschioides, Fragilariopsis doliolus) and silicoflagellates (Octactis pulchra, Dictyocha stapedia). Beginning at ~ AD 1200 productivity declined abruptly in two steps (at ~AD 1200 and ~1500) that were marked by increases in the relative abundance of tropical diatoms and silicoflagellates.\nIn contrast, eastern Guaymas Basin Kasten Core BAM80 E-17 (27.920° N, 111.610°W, 620 m of water depth), was dominated by high biosiliceous productivity during the past 2000 years with increases corresponding to solar minima, arguing that an intensification of winter northwest winds drove coastal upwelling. In both Guaymas Basin records silicoflagellate assemblages suggest surface-water cooling during Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ~AD 800-1200) relative to the intervals before and after. Together, these records support a cooler La Niña-like MCA followed by a warmer El Niño-like Little Ice Age, similar to results obtained from the Santa Barbara Basin to the north.\nDuring La Niñas, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) occupies a more northerly position in the eastern tropical Pacific, facilitating summertime surges of Pacific tropical moisture up the Gulf and higher monsoonal precipitation in the southwestern US.

(2008, JGR) of the broader MCA (AD 800-1300) utilizes La Niña-like Pacific sea surface temperatures to argues for an intensified North American Monsoon during the MCA.

            "abstract": "Water temperature is a critical variable to aquatic ecosystems because it controls metabolic rates and the distribution of aquatic organisms. Therefore, understanding the impacts of future climate on stream water temperature is relevant to sustainable management of water resources. Empirical models based on the statistical relation between air and steam water temperature offer a powerful tool for prediction at large scales. We will demonstrate how simple linear regression models based on short-term historical stream temperature (ts) observations and readily available interpolated air temperature (ta) estimates can be used for rapid assessment of historical and future changes in ts. This methodology was applied to 61 sites in the Southeast region of the US. We found that between 2011 and 2060, all sites were projected to experience increases in ts under the three evaluated climate projections (mean of +0.41 °C per decade). We also developed continental scale models to predict mean and maximum ts in ungauged locations across the US. The models linearly describe site relationships between monthly mean and maximum ta and ts as a function of climatic, hydrologic, and land cover variables. The empirical models were derived using data from 171 reference sites. These sites drain areas spanning four orders of magnitude and are located in 32 states and 16 hydrologic regions. Model performances yielded average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients between 0.78 and 0.85. These models were incorporated into the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) Ecosystem Services Model developed by the U.S. Forest Service to predict mean and maximum ts under different climatic projections and land cover changes at the USGS 8 digit hydrologic unit code watershed resolution across the US. The results identify regions in the country where significant increases in ts may occur, potentially causing stress to aquatic ecosystems as climate change progresses.",

            "abstract": "JPSS data provide unique information that could be critical for the forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) track and intensity and is currently underutilized. Preliminary results from several TC applications using data from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), carried by the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite (SNPP), will be discussed. The first group of applications, which includes applications for moisture flux and for eye-detection, aims to improve rapid intensification (RI) forecasts, which is one of the highest priorities within NOAA. The applications could be used by forecasters directly and will also provide additional input to the Rapid Intensification Index (RII), the statistical-dynamical tool for forecasting RI events that is operational at the National Hurricane Center. The moisture flux application uses bias-corrected ATMS-MIRS (Microwave Integrated Retrieval System) and NUCAPS (NOAA Unique CrIS ATMS Processing System), retrievals that provide very accurate temperature and humidity soundings in the TC environment to detect dry air intrusions. The objective automated eye-detection application uses geostationary and VIIRS data in combination with machine learning and computer vision techniques for determining the onset of eye formation which is very important for TC intensity forecast but is usually determined by subjective methods. First version of the algorithm showed very promising results with a 75% success rate. The second group of applications develops tools to better utilize VIIRS data, including day-night band (DNB) imagery, for tropical cyclone forecasting.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and findings contained in this article are those of the authors and should not be construed as an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or U.S. Government position, policy, or decision.",

            "abstract": "AeroCom, an open international collaboration of scientists seeking to improve global aerosol models, recently initiated a project comparing model output to in-situ, surface-based measurements of aerosol optical properties. The model/measurement comparison project, called INSITU, aims to evaluate the performance of a suite of AeroCom aerosol models with site-specific observational data in order to inform iterative improvements to model aerosol modules. Surface in-situ data have the unique property of being traceable to physical standards, which is a big asset in accomplishing the overarching goal of bettering the accuracy of aerosol processes and predicative capability of global climate models. The INSITU project looks at how well models reproduce aerosol climatologies on a variety of time scales, aerosol characteristics and behaviors (e.g., aerosol persistence and the systematic relationships between aerosol optical properties), and aerosol trends. Though INSITU is a multi-year endeavor, preliminary phases of the analysis, using GOCART and other models participating in this AeroCom project, show substantial model biases in absorption and scattering coefficients compared to surface measurements, though the sign and magnitude of the bias varies with location and optical property. Spatial patterns in the biases highlight model weaknesses, e.g., the inability of models to properly simulate aerosol characteristics at sites with complex topography (see Figure 1). Additionally, differences in modeled and measured systematic variability of aerosol optical properties suggest that some models are not accurately capturing specific aerosol co-dependencies, for example, the tendency of in-situ surface single scattering albedo to decrease with decreasing aerosol extinction coefficient. This study elucidates specific problems with current aerosol models and suggests additional model runs and perturbations that could further evaluate the discrepancies between measured and modeled aerosol optical properties.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the spatial and areal inconsistencies of the most recent global land cover datasets were analyzed quantitatively with widely used common thematic legends (IGBP-17, modified IGBP-9, IPCC-5 and 3 classes) in Heihe River Basin. These products included Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (hereafter abbreviated as GLC30), Global Land Cover Map (hereafter abbreviated as GlobCover2009) and the IGBP layer of MODIS Collection 5.1 land cover (hereafter abbreviated as MODISLC_IGBP). Before areal and spatial inconsistencies were assessed, uncertainty caused by legend conversion was also discussed quantitatively. Majority filtering and statistical methods were adopted to upscale from high to low spatial resolution classifications and to compute inconsistencies respectively. The results indicated that IGBP-17 and “3 classes” were not suitable as common legends to compare land cover products using LCCS and FAO, because IGBP-17 itself included ambiguous type and too much aggregation in “3 classes” was less meaningful for users due to less information. In general, 5 - 12 kinds of land cover type were suitable quantity to compare different land cover products. In the IGBP-9 and IPCC-5 legend conversion, GLC30 also had “zero” uncertainties, and the GlobCover2009 had the largest uncertainties, the values were 17.3%, 7.44%, 0.46% and 16.2%, 5.95%, 0.40% in the mountainous, oasis and desert area respectively. The hierarchical classification system with explicit attribution information was suggested to global land cover producers by authors, because it can be used to reduce effectively uncertainty of legend conversion caused by arbitrary errors. The order of areal inconsistency showed opposite to overall spatial inconsistency. Areal inconsistency between GLC30 and GlobCover2009 was the least among the three groups comparison, with values less than 19.71%, 8.10%, 1.58% and 27.20%, 8.05% and 1.53% in mountainous, oasis and desert areas, respectively. However, the overall spatial inconsistency between them showed the largest value, with values 18.46% and 18.31%.",

            "abstract": "Methane is a troublesome greenhouse gas. It has multiple natural and anthropogenic sources, including microbial production in low oxygen environments, fossil sources related to coal and natural gas production, and biomass burning, making source attribution difficult. Atmospheric methane concentration rose rapidly in the industrial period, increasing by 250%, only to stall out in the first decade this century, and then rising again after 2007. Its emission is strongly related to variables that are hard to predict, such as precipitation rates, biomass burning, and natural gas use, so future projections remain murky. And unlike CO2, which is strongly tied to energy use, anthropogenic impacts on methane are strongly tied to food production. Finally, methane is expected to be released from a thawing Arctic in large, but largely unknown quantities. Understanding methane as a greenhouse gas is imperative if anthropogenic impacts on the climate system are to be managed in the future. This talk addresses what we can say about the recent rise in methane using mole fractions and 13C data from the existing NOAA Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. The approach is strongly data based, and while we will present model results, the data itself are clear on several points. While attention is increasingly focused on the Arctic, the north-south gradient of CH4 concentration does not support significant changes to Boreal and Arctic emissions. This finding raises the question of how methane will behave in a warmer, wetter world. We use a simple, three end-member model, run in both forward and inverse modes, to look more deeply into the sources of the recent increase. Evidence exists for recent increases in fossil sources, in line with methane production as a fuel source, although the contribution is small. Better data are needed to constrain the 13C of sources, including the fossil sources, a problem we are working on. Importantly, while the current monitoring network is adequate to place bounds on various sources, recent cuts to the network and stalled plans for expansion clearly hamper our ability to quantify the evolution of emissions and sinks of this greenhouse gas, and thus provide as timely and accurate information for policy makers as the problem warrants.",

NAPL has a complex mode of transportation in the heterogeneous subsurface domain, which results in difficulties for cleaning up contaminated sites. Here, we use sandbox experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Oscillatory Hydraulic Tomography (OHT) for NAPL source zone characterization. In a saturated soil fluid system, the effective hydraulic conductivity (K) is dependent on the soil properties, fluid density, and fluid viscosity. By taking advantage of the differences of fluid properties before and after NAPL intrusion, we can estimate the NAPL source zone migration throughout time by imaging changes in effective K. Using OHT testing, we can derive the K heterogeneities before, during and after NAPL intrusion. NAPL source zone can be located by subtracting the background K from the K tomogram after NAPL intrusion. This approach can avoid mass extraction and injection that occurs in traditional hydraulic tomography approaches while obtain a good estimation of subsurface K heterogeneity and NAPL migration. We believe this method is more cost effective and efficient for field remediation applications.",

A key responsibility is to identify defensible options for the design and management of systems under an uncertain and changing climate. In the water resources sector this requires defining a range of different climate change narratives in order to evaluate the vulnerability of infrastructure and the effectiveness of different management strategies to climate-related stresses.\nRecent research is just now beginning to reveal how different methodological choices can impact portrayals of climate risk. We present research showing that the common approaches to climate change assessments in the water sector are affected by substantial uncertainties in methods used for climate downscaling and hydrologic modeling, and suggest that many of these uncertainties are reducible. For example, improving continental scale hydrologic model parameters can reduce one source of uncertainty. We also present research to improve characterization of uncertainty, in order to reduce the extent to which the portrayal of climate change impacts depends on ad hoc methodological choices and provide a holistic estimate of the degree to which the climate change signal emerges from the envelope of uncertainty. We hope that this presentation stimulates discussion on the best practices for climate impact assessments, and ways to improve the robustness of water resources planning under a changing climate.",

For temperature, CORDEX RCMs MMEs shows a cold bias over West Africa compare to ESMs MMEs but for precipitation there is clear bias reduction. Over the Sahel and Gulf of Guinea there is more added value for precipitation downscaling compare to temperature one and uncertainty (spread) is reduced.

We found that the CORDEX MMEs was able to capture the observed spatial patterns of the first Rotated EOFs but fail to reproduce the inter annual variability compare to CMIP5 and CMIP5_SUBSET.

            "abstract": "The discovery of tectonic tremor and constituent low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) offers seismologists new opportunities to study both deformational processes and structure within the subduction zone forearc. This assertion is especially true for northern Cascadia where i) regular seismicity is sparse, and ii) a relatively transparent overriding plate inflicts minimal distortion upon direct P and S wave arrivals from LFEs. Despite low signal-to-noise ratios, LFEs are highly repetitive and signal can be enhanced through construction of stacked templates. Studies in both Cascadia and Nankai reveal an association between LFE hypocenters and a high Vp/Vs, low-velocity zone (LVZ) that is inferred to represent overpressured upper oceanic crust. Scattered signals within Vancouver Island templates, interpreted to originate at boundaries of the LVZ, place LFEs within the LVZ and suggest that this structure may define a distributed (several km) zone of deformation. A recent analysis of LFE magnitudes indicates that LFEs exhibit scaling relations distinct from both regular earthquakes and longer period (10's of seconds to days) phenomena associated with slow slip. Regular earthquakes generally obey a scaling of moment proportional to duration cubed consistent with self similarity, whereas long period slow slip phenomena exhibit a linear scaling between moment and duration that can be accommodated through constant slip or constant stress drop models. In contrast, LFE durations are nearly constant suggesting that moment is governed by slip alone and that asperity size remains approximately constant. The implied dimensions (~1 km2), the persistance of LFEs in time and their stationarity in space point to structural heterogeneity, perhaps related to pockets of upper oceanic crust impervious to hydrothermal circulation, as a fundamental control.",

            "abstract": "Extreme downslope wind and warming events, locally termed as “sundowners,” are notorious for accelerating the spread of wildfires in the vicinity of Santa Barbara, California. Unique topographic features characterize the terrain of this region: about 100 km of narrow coastal plains run approximately east-west, and are bordered by a steep mountain range (exceeding elevations of 1200 m), which runs parallel to the coastline. Named for their typical onset during the early to late afternoon, Sundowners are foehn winds associated with gusty winds down the lee slope of the mountains and canyons, abnormal rapid drop in relative humidity and rise in temperature. Some Sundowner events can exceed wind speeds of gale force and temperatures of 40°C (~100°F). Not only do these events disrupt the marine-influenced weather regime, they also cause significant damage to agriculture, threaten urban landscapes, and coincide with nearly every major wildfire. Sundowners are mesoscale phenomena that develop as a result of a north to south pressure gradient at the Santa Ynez Mountains. Here, Sundowners are identified using the Montecito remote operated weather station (MTIC1) from December 1999 to February 2014. The MTIC1 is located within a mountain pass where Sundowner winds are most significant. A Sundowner database, provided by the National Weather Service, is used to identify the events. We show that recordings of maximum temperatures, sustained wind speeds, wind gusts, and minimum relative humidity indicate that Sundowner events are increasing in frequency and intensity, particularly in spring.

            "abstract": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was an abrupt warming event, characterized by a global temperature increase of about 5-8°C and associated with the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) of ~2.5-4‰ in marine environments. Here we evaluate temperature and salinity changes across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary in the Millville New Jersey coastal plain core (ODP Leg 174AX) using two independent temperature proxies (the organic paleothermometer TEX86 and Mg/Ca ratio of planktonic foraminifera) and δ18O of planktonic foraminifera. Paleotemperature estimates show warming of 5-7°C during the CIE, though different temperature calibrations provide a broad range of absolute temperatures. We argue that the temperature calibration of TEXL 86 provides the best temperature estimate (warming from 23°C to 30°C) because it is the only one that yields realistic salinities, whereas the TEXH 86 calibration yields extremely high sea surface salinities (~48 psu in the latest Paleocene). In contrast to the previous studies, use of the correct calibration effectively eliminates any temperature increase prior to the CIE suggesting that temperature was not the trigger for the massive release of carbon. A salinity decrease of at least ~4 psu was associated with the onset of the CIE/PETM. This implies freshening of surface and thermocline waters supports the hypothesis of an enhanced hydrological cycle. We conclude that our results are consistent with the hypothesis of Appalachian Amazon river system development and increased river runoff to the New Jersey continental margin during the PETM.",

            "abstract": "In recent years there has been growing interest in using chromium isotopes (δ53Cr) as a proxy to investigate the redox evolution of Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system throughout geological history. Potential archives for seawater δ53Cr that have been identified to date include iron formations and organic-rich siliciclastic sediments. However, these types of sediments are not common and they are discontinuous over geologic time. As a result, alternative types of archives are needed. Here we evaluate the utility of foraminifera tests as a recorder of seawater δ53Cr. Core-tops used were from different ocean basins. Mono-specific samples of Globigerinoides sacculifer, Orbulina universa, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, Globoratalia crassula-crassaformis, Globoratalia truncatulinoides, and Globigerinella siphonifera were isolated to investigate inter-species isotope fractionation. Chromium concentrations were measured by isotope dilution method to be 0.1–0.3 μg/g. The δ53Cr values of these species range from 0.2‰ to 2.4‰, with an analytical uncertainty of 0.3‰ (95% confidence). Despite the high analytical uncertainty due to the extremely low levels of Cr present, there is still large detectable variation in foraminiferal δ53Cr values, which overlap presently available seawater values (Bonnand et al., 2013; Scheiderich et al., 2015). Possible explanations for such variations in foraminiferal δ53Cr values include heterogeneity of seawater δ53Cr in the modern oceans, and/or photobiochemical redox cycling of Cr in the surface oceans. Therefore, care should be taken when using foraminifera to reconstruct past seawater δ53Cr values.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) depends on sufficient infiltration capacity within the near-surface sediments to pass water from a retention pond into the subsurface for storage. MAR system operations may be optimized with a detailed understanding of pond-bottom infiltration properties. We used two vertically co-located fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) cables in a 0.63 hectare basin to observe a phase shift due to the diurnal temperature signal for estimating infiltration rate at high spatial and temporal resolution. While the average infiltration rate remains relatively constant under fixed-head conditions, the maximum infiltration rate varies more than an order of magnitude even over daily timescales. On average, half of the pond bottom infiltrated nearly 80% of the total water volume during the course of the experiment. We also found spatial variability in the rate of change of infiltration rate during a 5-day ponding cycle, an effect we attribute to variable biological pore clogging. Areas with high initial infiltration rate experienced pore clogging and subsequent decrease in infiltration efficiency. These results suggest that sparse, discrete estimates of infiltration would be insufficient to effectively understand how the near-surface properties control movement of water from the pond into the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "One-dimensional radiative transfer models (RTM) are a common tool used for calculating atmospheric heating rates and radiative fluxes. In the forward sense, RTMs use known (or observed) quantities of the atmospheric state and surface characteristics to determine the appropriate surface and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes. The NASA CERES science team uses the modified Fu-Liou RTM to calculate atmospheric heating rates and surface and TOA fluxes using the CERES observed TOA shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) fluxes as constraints to derive global surface and TOA radiation budgets using a reanalyzed atmospheric state (e.g. temperature and various greenhouse gases) from the newly developed MERRA-2. However, closure studies have shown that using the reanalyzed state as input to the RTM introduces some disparity between the RTM calculated fluxes and surface observed ones. The purpose of this study is to generate a database of observed atmospheric state profiles, from satellite and ground-based sources, at several permanent Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, including the Southern Great Plains (SGP), Northern Slope of Alaska (NSA) and Tropical Western Pacific Nauru (TWP-C2), and Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) permanent facilities. Since clouds are a major modulator of radiative transfer within the Earth’s atmosphere, we will focus on the clear-sky conditions in this study, which will set up the baseline for our cloudy studies in the future. Clear-sky flux profiles are calculated using the Edition 4 NASA LaRC modified Fu-Liou RTM. The aforementioned atmospheric profiles generated in-house are used as input into the RTM, as well as from reanalyses. The calculated surface and TOA fluxes are compared with ARM surface measured and CERES satellite observed SW and LW fluxes, respectively. Clear-sky cases are identified by the ARM radar-lidar observations, as well as satellite observations, at the select ARM sites.",

            "abstract": "A variety of geophysical data, including newly released 3-D seismic reflection data, show us that the crustal structure of the Mid-Continent region of North America is very complex. The dimensions of many of the crustal structures is very large by global standards, and thus, they are a tectonic puzzle because of their size, structural complexity, and distance from active plate margins that usually create the driving mechanisms for intraplate deformation evident. The crust of the Mid-Continent region formed during a period of continental growth that extended from about 1.8 to 0.9 Ga. The impressive Mid-Continent rift system (MCRS) tried to interrupt this period of continental growth at about 1.1 Ga but it its western arm failed even though it modified the crust massively. However, the supercontinent resulting from this growth did not survive long and began to break up by ~700 Ma. This period of rifting established the structural framework of the southern Mid-Continent region, subsequent Early Paleozoic basin development, and at least partly, the formation of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains in the late Paleozoic. The Southern Oklahoma aulacogen (SOA) is an impressive example of this rifting event. The deformation that formed the Ancestral Rocky Mountains resulted in massive inversion of SOA rift structures and is due to a plate collision in the late Paleozoic whose origin is under debate. There has been increased emphasis on the use of gravity, magnetic, seismic, drilling, and remote sensing data in studies of the Mid-Continent region. For example, the MCRS is traditionally viewed as ending in central Kansas and the SOA can be interpreted as ending in the Texas panhandle. However, we used enhancement of gravity and magnetic data, seismic data, geologic mapping, and deep-drilling data to study its southern extent, and it appears that the MCRS could extend further southward beneath the much younger Anadarko basin of Oklahoma to abut the SOA.",

            "abstract": "The clustering of earthquakes in time and space is widely accepted, however the existence of correlations in earthquake magnitudes is more questionable. In standard models of seismic activity, it is usually assumed that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Our work seeks to test this assumption by analysing magnitude correlation between earthquakes and their aftershocks. To separate mainshocks from aftershocks, we perform stochastic declustering based on the widely used Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, which allows us to then compare the average magnitudes of aftershock sequences to that of their mainshock.\nThe results of earthquake magnitude correlations were compared with acoustic emissions (AE) from laboratory analog experiments, as fracturing generates both AE at the laboratory scale and earthquakes on a crustal scale. Constant stress and constant strain rate experiments were done on Darley Dale sandstone under confining pressure to simulate depth of burial. Microcracking activity inside the rock volume was analyzed by the AE technique as a proxy for earthquakes.\nApplying the ETAS model to experimental data allowed us to validate our results and provide for the first time a holistic view on the correlation of earthquake magnitudes. Additionally we search the relationship between the conditional intensity estimates of the ETAS model and the earthquake magnitudes. A positive relation would suggest the existence of magnitude correlations.\nThe aim of this study is to observe any trends of dependency between the magnitudes of aftershock earthquakes and the earthquakes that trigger them.",

            "abstract": "Despite the collection of routine annual agricultural surveys and significant advances in GIS and remote sensing products, little econometric research has been undertaken in predicting developing nation’s agricultural yields. In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011-2013 Meher crop seasons aggregated to the woreda administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40% of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. The model also identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (eg. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, irrigation), weather (eg. rainfall), water availability (vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5% of their potential wheat output per hectare given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. At the median, Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP, and Tigray produce 48.6, 51.5, 49.7, and 61.3% of their local attainable yields, respectively. This research has a broad range of applications, especially from a public policy perspective: identifying causes of yield fluctuations, remotely evaluating larger agricultural intervention packages, and analyzing relative yield potential. Overall, the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels.",

            "abstract": "Opportunity has been exploring exposures of Noachian-age rocks along the rim of Endeavour crater since August 2011, motivated by orbital spectral evidence for phyllosilicates at multiple locations along the crater’s rim. As reported previously, Opportunity discovered multiple bright linear features at “Cape York” that have been interpreted as veins of Ca sulfate deposited in bedrock fractures, and in-situ measurements are consistent with the presence of smectite clays in rocks and veneers on the east side of Cape York. The inferred neutral pH and relatively low temperature of the fluids involved in multiple phases of alteration would have provided a habitable environment if life existed on Mars at that time. Because Opportunity can no longer directly sense phyllosilicate mineralogy with the MiniTES or Mössbauer spectrometers, it is focusing on characterizing outcrop multispectral reflectance with Pancam, chemistry with the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer and microtexture with the Microscopic Imager (MI) of potential phyllosilicate host rocks.\nWhile traversing the western side of “Murray Ridge,” Opportunity found outcrops of breccia that are similar in texture and chemical composition to the Shoemaker Formation rocks exposed at Cape York. MI images of the breccias show cm-size angular clasts in fine-grained matrix, consistent with an impact origin. At “Cook Haven,” the rover wheels overturned a few rocks, exposing dark Mn-rich coatings and haloes on brighter sulfates (Figure 1), which suggest aqueous precipitation followed by interaction with a strong oxidant. The dark, resistant coatings on “Thessaloniki” are less than about 0.1 mm thick, barely resolved in places by MI stereogrammetry. Opportunity’s mission continues, with the rover exploring more exposures of phyllosilicates detected from orbit on “Cape Tribulation.” The latest MI results, including observations in “Marathon Valley,” will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Particulate matter in marine and aquatic systems has been shown to host microbial communities distinct from the free-living fraction, which is attributed to the concentration of nutrients and the presence of microhabitats within these particles. Some of these microhabitats include anoxic zones within the interior of the particles, allowing the presence of anaerobic microbes. While several studies have explored the bacterial community composition of particulate matter in marine, estuarine, and riverine systems, there have been fewer studies analyzing the archaeal community. As such, the implication of particle-associated anaerobic archaea in an oxygenated water column environment has not been fully explored. We investigated near shore particle-associated archaea to determine the extent to which the potential anaerobic habitat of particles has in allowing global distribution of anaerobic sediment associated archaea. In this study, the archaeal community structure of size-fractioned particles was analyzed for the presence of archaeal groups along a salinity gradient in the tidally influenced Broadkill River. Four freshwater to brackish stations were analyzed as well as one marine station. It was found that members of methanogen groups and the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeota Group were preferentially enriched on larger particles in fresh and brackish river water, but the community at the marine station was consistent between particle sizes with very few members of anaerobic sedimentary groups present. These results suggest that larger particles may have a greater potential for an anaerobic interior habitat and that in addition to salinity, particle composition may be a factor that dictates which archaeal groups can thrive. The presence of anaerobic sedimentary archaeal groups within larger particles also suggests the plausibility for entrained particulate matter as a transport and distribution mechanism for sedimentary archaeal groups throughout the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Although the recent global warming hiatus has featured a slowdown in the annual, global mean surface air temperature trend, temperature extremes have exhibited contrasting changes, as both wintertime cold and summertime hot extremes have increased over Northern Hemisphere (NH) land from 2002-2014. To investigate the sources of NH temperature extreme variability, we use multiple linear regression analysis that includes as predictors the typical drivers of global-scale climate variability – tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST), volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and the linear time trend. This analysis suggests that natural forcings, including tropical SSTs and solar variations, have contributed to the recent increase in NH winter cold extremes. The magnitude of the recent increase in summer hot extremes is only captured after including an additional SST predictor for a pattern that resembles the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which suggests the importance of Atlantic Ocean SSTs for recent increases in hot extremes. When the regression models are applied to local, grid point scales, they indicate the promise for substantial skill in seasonal predictions of extreme temperature over some NH regions. Overall, this work reveals important sources of natural variability in extreme temperature trends superimposed upon the long-term increase of hot extremes and decrease of cold extremes.",

            "abstract": "The North American Monsoon regime results from an interplay between the ocean, atmosphere and continental topography though there is an ongoing debate as to the relative importance of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the NE tropical Pacific warm water lens region, solar radiation variability, land snow cover and soil moisture over the Western North America mountain ranges and the strength and spatial patterns of the dominant winds. The links between these factors and the monsoonal variability appear to be of variable importance during the short instrumental record, and hampers any prediction on the future evolution of this climatic regime in a warming climate. The terrigenous component in very-high sedimentation rate sediments on the margins of the Gulf of California links monsoonal precipitation patterns on land with the varying importance of the lithogenic component in these margin sediments.\nHere we use the elemental composition of Si and Fe in these margin sediments, as a proxy for the lithogenic component in a collection of box and kasten cores from the eastern and western margins of the lower Gulf of California. This region shows a strong tropical influence during the summer, as part of the northernmost extension of the eastern tropical Pacific warm water lens region. A period when the southwestern winds bring moist air masses inland enhancing the monsoonal rains on the eastern reaches of Sierra Madre Occidental. High resolution XRF results allow us to explore the relationships between different elemental ratios in these sediments and the available instrumental record and several paleo-reconstructions to evaluate the possible links between external forcings and internal feedback effects, to help to understand the controls on the evolution of the monsoonal regime in this region.",

            "abstract": "Variability and trends in annual runoff efficiency (RE)—computed as the ratio of annual runoff (streamflow per unit area) to annual precipitation—in the conterminous United States (CONUS) are examined for the period from 1951 through 2012. Changes in RE are analyzed using measured runoff and precipitation aggregated to United States Geological Survey 8-digit hydrologic cataloging units (HUs). Results indicate that, in the central CONUS, RE has predominantly increased (determined using Kendall’s Tau statistic) likely due to changes in climate. Some HUs in the central CONUS, however, indicate changes in RE that cannot be attributed to climate variability. In addition, many HUs in the western CONUS show decreases in RE that do not appear to be related to climate changes. Some of the RE increases in the central CONUS that cannot be explained by climate occur in agricultural areas with substantial artificial drainage (i.e. tile drains, canals, ditches). The decreases in RE in the central CONUS that are not explained by climate coincide with HUs where water is withdrawn for irrigation and subsequently consumed by evapotranspiration. These results indicate that climate and anthropogenic effects associated with agriculture have affected changes in RE in the CONUS.",

            "abstract": "It is assumed that retreating sea ice in the Eurasian Arctic will accelerate hydrocarbon development and associated tanker traffic along Russia’s Northern Sea Route. However, oil and gas extraction along the Kara and Barents Sea coasts will likely keep developing rapidly regardless of whether the Northwest Eurasian climate continues to warm. Less certain are the real and potential linkages to regional biota and social-ecological systems. Reindeer nomadism continues to be a vitally important livelihood for indigenous tundra Nenets and their large herds of semi-domestic reindeer. Warming summer air temperatures over the NW Russian Arctic have been linked to increases in tundra productivity, longer growing seasons, and accelerated growth of tall deciduous shrubs. These temperature increases have, in turn, been linked to more frequent and sustained summer high-pressure systems over West Siberia, but not to sea ice retreat. At the same time, winters have been warming and rain-on-snow (ROS) events have become more frequent and intense, leading to record-breaking winter and spring mortality of reindeer. What is driving this increase in ROS frequency and intensity is not clear. Recent modelling and simulation have found statistically significant near-surface atmospheric warming and precipitation increases during autumn and winter over Arctic coastal lands in proximity to regions of sea-ice loss. During the winter of 2013-14 an extensive and lasting ROS event led to the starvation of 61,000 reindeer out of a population of ca. 300,000 animals on Yamal Peninsula, West Siberia. Historically, this is the region’s largest recorded mortality episode. More than a year later, participatory fieldwork with nomadic herders during spring-summer 2015 revealed that the ecological and socio-economic impacts from this extreme event will unfold for years to come. There is an urgent need to understand whether and how ongoing Barents and Kara Sea ice retreat may affect the region’s ancient and unique social-ecological systems. If sea ice retreat is contributing to increasingly severe ROS events and high reindeer mortality, it has major implications for the future of reindeer nomadism. At the same time, rapid oil and gas infrastructure expansion has strong potential to limit the movement of large herds during extreme events.",

            "abstract": "Seismic wavefield computations using the Spectral Element Method are now regularly used to recover tomographic images of the upper mantle and crust at the local, regional, and global scales (e.g. Fichtner et al., GJI, 2009; Tape et al., Science 2010; Lekic and Romanowicz, GJI, 2011; French and Romanowicz, GJI, 2014). However, the heaviness of the computations remains a challenge, and contributes to limiting the resolution of the produced images. Using source stacking, as suggested by Capdeville et al. (GJI,2005), can considerably speed up the process by reducing the wavefield computations to only one per each set of N sources. This method was demonstrated through synthetic tests on low frequency datasets, and therefore should work for global mantle tomography. However, the large amplitudes of surface waves dominates the stacked seismograms and these cases can no longer be separated by windowing in the time domain. We have developed a processing approach that helps address this issue and demonstrate its usefulness through a series of synthetic tests performed at long periods (T >60 s) on toy upper mantle models. The summed synthetics are computed using the CSEM code (Capdeville et al., 2002). As for the inverse part of the procedure, we use a quasi-Newton method, computing Frechet derivatives and Hessian using normal mode perturbation theory.",

            "abstract": "Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements from ten dual-frequency GPS receivers in the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) are used to evaluate the performance of IRI-2007 within the Canadian Arctic. In all regions, we see systematic underestimation of daytime TEC, particularly at solar maximum, where summer RMS TEC errors range from up to 10 TECU at sub-auroral stations to up to 14 TECU in the polar cap region. Performance during winter periods was exceptional, with RMS errors well constrained below 2 TECU at all stations. Diurnal variability in TEC is found to be underestimated during equinox periods by up to 40% at sub-auroral latitudes and up to 70% in the polar cap region. During the winter, the IRI performs much better, where diurnal variations are matched to within an overestimation of 40% or an underestimation of 20% across all regions.\nUsing a CHAIN ionosonde, collocated with the Resolute GPS receiver, we are able to diagnose the main contributing layer of the ionosphere to the observed TEC errors. At the Resolute station, the IRI is found to produce bottomside TEC within 1 TECU of observation; however, topside TEC demonstrates significant errors of up to 7 TECU during equinox and summer periods at high solar activity. Winter topside TEC is found to be within 1 TECU, even at solar maximum. Diurnal variability in topside TEC is found to be almost entirely driven by NmF2 variability.\nIt is also shown that the IRI’s use of the highly smoothed IG12 index to drive solar activity can result in significant errors during periods of large amplitude, short-term changes in solar activity. Using a monthly IG index to drive the model, rather than IG12, we find that IRI TEC errors reduce from 5 TECU to less than 1 TECU during a three month, ~100% increase in solar activity between October and December, 2011. Overall, all stations showed an average improvement of 0.33 TECU while using monthly IG rather than the IRI’s default IG12 index.",

The fidelity of CFSv2 in simulating the mean state of the global climate, particularly the Indian summer monsoon, relative to the CMIP5 models (Sabeer et al 2013) is the reason behind choosing CFSv2 as the GCM to implement SMCM.\nWe expect to see an improved climate simulation in SMCM-CFSv2 because of the theoretically sound and tested design of the multicloud approach (Khouider and Majda 2006, and the relevant subsequent work thereafter).\nIn order to implement SMCM in CFSv2, first we identify different climatic regions based on the mean state of the global climate (using the CFSR 20year monthly climatology). Then we initialize the climatological values (computed from the CFSR 20year monthly climatology) of the variables required in the multicloud parameterization scheme, for the different climatic zones. We input moisture, temperature and PBL height from the CFSv2 to the multicloud parameterization module and then compute the corresponding variables that were initialized from the mean state. Then we compute the deviation of those variables from the background state. Based on middle troposphere dryness, we compute the heating rates for the deep, congestus and stratiform convection from these deviations from the background (deterministic approach). The stochastic extension involves the evolution of the cloud area fractions, associated to each one of the three cloud types, which are represented by a stochastic lattice subgrid model whose random transitions depend on CAPE and large-scale tropospheric dryness. The stochastic model feedback, to the GCM dynamics, occurs through the modulation of the heating rates by the cloud area fractions.",

Here we adopt the idea of interpreting large-scale atmospheric dynamical processes, particularly those tied to propagation of large-scale waves, as information flow around the globe, which can then be calculated using causal discovery methods.

These graphs are created globally for different seasons and their connection to phase/energy propagation of atmospheric waves are investigated. Specifically, we examine the information flows 1) in the topical region that represent horizontal and vertical propagations of Kelvin and Rossby-gravity waves whose associated momentum transfer are known to play a key role in the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), and 2) in the northern extratropics that represent propagations of planetary-scale waves whose heat/momentum fluxes are responsible for vacillations in the polar stratospheric vortex and occurrences of extreme events such as the stratospheric sudden warming. The sensitivity of the constructed graphs of 3D information flow to data resolution and pre-processing methods (e.g., spatial and temporal filtering) will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) has a large global warming potential and mediates global tropospheric chemistry. In California, CH4 emissions estimates derived from “top-down” methods based on atmospheric observations have been found to be greater than expected from “bottom-up” population-apportioned national and state inventories. Differences between bottom-up and top-down estimates suggest that the understanding of California’s CH4 sources is incomplete, leading to uncertainty in the application of regulations to mitigate regional CH4 emissions. In this study, we use airborne measurements from the California research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) campaign in 2010 to estimate CH4 emissions in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), which includes California’s largest metropolitan area (Los Angeles), and in the Central Valley, California’s main agricultural and livestock management area. Measurements from 12 daytime flights, prior information from national and regional official inventories (e.g. US EPA’s National Emission Inventory, the California Air Resources Board inventories, the Liu et al. Hybrid Inventory, and the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement dataset), and the FLEXPART-WRF transport model are used in our mesoscale Bayesian inverse system. We compare our optimized posterior CH4 inventory to the prior bottom-up inventories in terms of total emissions (Mg CH4/hr) and the spatial distribution of the emissions (0.1 degree), and quantify uncertainties in our posterior estimates. Our inversions show that the oil and natural gas industry (extraction, processing and distribution) is the main source accounting for the gap between top-down and bottom-up inventories over the SoCAB, while dairy farms are the largest CH4 source in the Central Valley. CH4 emissions of dairy farms in the San Joaquin Valley and variations of CH4 emissions in the rice-growing regions of Sacramento Valley are quantified and discussed. We also estimate CO and NH3 surface fluxes and use their observed correlation with CH4 mixing ratio to further evaluate our CH4 total emission estimates, and understand the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions.",

Understanding the temporal response of streams to heavy rainfall requires a hydrological model that considers meteorological, hydrological, and geological components of the streams and their watersheds. SWAT is a physically-based, semi-distributed model that is capable of simulating water flow within watersheds with both long-term, i.e. annually and monthly, and short-term (daily and sub-daily) time scales. However, the capability of SWAT in sub-daily water flow modeling within large watersheds has not been studied much, compare to long-term and daily time scales. In this study we are investigating the water flow in a large, semi-arid watershed, Nueces River Basin (NRB) with the drainage area of 16950 mi2 located in South Texas, with daily and sub-daily time scales. The objectives of this study are: (1) simulating the response of streams to heavy, and often quick, rainfall, (2) evaluating SWAT performance in sub-daily modeling of water flow within a large watershed, and (3) examining means for model performance improvement during model calibration and verification based on results of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The results of this study can provide important information for water resources planning during flood seasons.",

A model that integrates gas diffusion, mass flow and biological processes in soils was developed and used to predict the ∆CO2 and ∆O2 concentration differential between the soil surface and the bulk atmosphere under a wide range of environmental conditions that include temperature, soil gas and water content, soil respiratory quotient and rate of O2 uptake, soil porosity and CO2 leakage rate. The results predicted that measurement of ∆(CO2:O2) measurements at the soil surface relative to air should be able to detect a CCS leak as low as 2 µmol/m2/sec. To test this hypothesis, a gas analysis system was designed and constructed. It should allow a series of experiments under controlled conditions to test all aspects of the model. It is hoped that the results from this work will ultimately lead to the development of a new instrument and protocol for the early detection of CO2 leaks from a geological storage sites.",

            "abstract": "The current generation of models has followed a myriad of different development paths, making it difficult to identify a clear path to model improvement. Model comparison studies have been undertaken to explore model differences, but have not been able to meaningfully attribute inter-model differences to individual model components because there are often too many differences among the participating models. Model comparison studies have therefore provided limited insight into the causes of differences in model behavior, and model development has relied on the inspiration and experience of individual modelers rather than on a systematic analysis of model shortcomings.\nThis presentation introduces a unified approach to process-based hydrologic modeling to enable controlled and systematic evaluation of different modeling approaches. Our model framework, called the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA), formulates a general set of conservation equations, providing the flexibility to experiment with different spatial representations, different flux parameterizations, different model parameter values, and different time stepping schemes. The SUMMA framework presented here enables users to decompose the modeling problem into the individual decisions made as part of model development, and evaluate different model development decisions in a systematic and controlled way.\nWe present case studies to illustrate the use of SUMMA to select among competing modeling approaches, based on observed data from the Reynolds Creek CZO. Specific examples of preferable modeling approaches include adjustments to the shape of the below-canopy wind profile to improve simulations of below-canopy snowpack, and explicitly representing distributed lateral flow processes to improve simulations of riparian transpiration and streamflow. Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation, emphasizing that improving model fidelity requires a sagacious choice of both process parameterizations and model parameters. Moving forward, we envisage that SUMMA can accelerate the diagnosis and correction of model structural errors, and improve the characterization of model uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Slipping zones in shallow sections of megathrusts and large landslides are often made of smectite and quartz gouge mixtures. Experiments aimed at investigating the frictional processes operating at high slip rates (>1 m/s) may unravel the mechanics of these natural phenomena. Here we present a new dataset obtained with two rotary shear apparatus (ROSA, Padua University; SHIVA, INGV-Rome). Experiments were performed at room humidity and temperature on four mixtures of smectite (Ca-Montmorillonite) and quartz with 68, 50, 25, 0 wt% of smectite. The gouges were slid for 3 m at normal stress of 5 MPa and slip rate V from 300 µm/s to 1.5 m/s. Temperature during the experiments was monitored with four thermocouples and modeled with COMSOL Multiphysics. In smectite-rich mixtures, the friction coefficient µ evolved with slip according to three slip rate regimes: in regime 1 (V<0.1 m/s) initial slip-weakening was followed by slip-strengthening; in regime 2 (0.1<V≤0.3 m/s) µ was slip-independent; in regime (V>0.3 m/s) µ had strong slip-weakening behavior. Instead, in quartz-rich mixtures the gouge had a monotonic slip-weakening behavior, independently of V. Temperature modelling showed that the fraction of work rate converted into heat decreased with increasing smectite content and slip rate. Quantitative X-ray powder diffraction (Rietveld method) indicates that the production of amorphous material from smectite breakdown increased with frictional work but was independent of work rate. Scanning Electron Microscopy investigation evidenced strain localization and presence of dehydrated clays for V≥0.3 m/s; instead, for V<0.3 m/s, strain was distributed and the gouge layer pervasively foliated. In conclusion, amorphization of the sheared gouges was not responsible of the measured frictional weakening. Instead, slip-weakening was concomitant to strain localization and possible vaporization of water adsorbed on smectite grain surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Crustal magnetic fields in the northern hemisphere of Mars are generally much weaker than those in the south (Connerney et al. 2005). Over two large regions, Utopia Planitia and the Tharsis rise, the observed magnetic field at 400 km altitude is thought to be dominated by fields induced by the solar wind interaction, although the draping pattern is asymmetric and may be influenced by the presence of crustal sources far from the spacecraft (Brain et al., 2006). The MAVEN mission (Jakosky et al. 2015) provides a comprehensive set of plasma and magnetic field observations to altitudes as low as ~150 km (~120 km during \"deep dips\") and over a wide range of local times and solar zenith angles. From 12/1/2014 to 2/15/2015, when periapsis was at high northern latitudes, the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) observed ionospheric photoelectrons with energies from 3 to 500 eV at low altitudes (140-200 km) and high solar zenith angles (120-145 deg) on ~35% of the orbits. Since this electron population is unambiguously produced in the dayside ionosphere, these observations demonstrate that the deep Martian nightside is at times magnetically connected to the sunlit hemisphere. We investigated the occurrence rate of ionospheric photoelectrons as a function of altitude, solar zenith angle, and magnetic field orientation, and found that photoelectrons are more likely to be observed at low altitudes and high solar zenith angles when the local field is more vertically oriented. This implies that the magnetic field extends to high altitudes between the night hemisphere, where photoelectrons are observed, and the source region in the dayside ionosphere, thus avoiding significant attenuation in transit. The BATSRUS Mars multi-fluid MHD model (Dong et al., 2014) suggests the presence of closed crustal magnetic field lines over the northern hemisphere that straddle the terminator and extend to high SZA. Simulations with the SuperThermal Electron Transport (STET) model (Xu and Liemohn, 2015) show that photoelectron transport along such field lines can take place without significant attenuation. Precipitation of photoelectrons onto the nightside atmosphere should cause ionization and possibly auroral emissions in localized regions. On one orbit, the O2+ energy flux measured by STATIC correlates well with precipitating photoelectron fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The poleward transport of energy is a key aspect of the climate system, with surface ocean currents presently dominating the transport out of deep tropics. A classic study by Stone (1978) proposed that the total heat transport is determined by astronomical parameters and is highly insensitive to the detailed atmosphere-ocean dynamics. On the other hand, previous modeling work has shown that past continental configurations could have produced substantially different tropical ocean heat transport (OHT). How thoroughly does the atmosphere compensate for changes in ocean transport in terms of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative budget, what are the relevant mechanisms, and what are the consequences for surface temperature and climate on tectonic timescales? We examine these issues in a suite of aquaplanet GCM simulations subject to large prescribed variations in OHT. We find substantial but incomplete compensation, in which adjustment of the atmospheric Hadley circulation plays a key role. We then separate out the dynamical and thermodynamical components of the adjustment mechanism. Increased OHT tends to warm the mid- to high latitudes without cooling the tropics due asymmetries in radiative feedback processes. The warming is accompanied by hydrological cycle changes that are completely different from those driven by greenhouse gases, suggesting that drivers of past global change might be detectable from combinations of hydroclimate and temperature proxies.",

            "abstract": "Thallium (Tl) is proving to be a useful paleoredox proxy given that the Tl isotope composition of seawater is highly dependent on the magnitude of manganese (Mn) oxide burial in the ocean. In turn, Mn oxides require oxygen at the sediment-water interface to precipitate, linking the Tl isotope cycle to ocean oxygenation. Currently, the marine residence time of Tl is ~20kyrs and the Tl isotope composition of seawater is invariant, which suggests Tl isotopes could be a global tracer of marine Mn-oxide burial. Importantly, recent research suggests sediments deposited under a euxinic water column faithfully record the Tl isotope value of the overlying oxic water column (e.g. Black Sea and Cariaco Basin). Therefore, analysis of organic-rich black shales may prove useful in evaluating the seawater Tl isotope composition of past oceans and, hence, large-scale burial of Mn-oxides and the extent of bottom water ocean oxygenation. A logical test for this proxy is during the well-studied Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event termed Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE-2) at ~94 Ma. It is known that the global extent of anoxia and euxinia increased during this event, however, to what extent global bottom water deoxygenation occured is unconstrained. If deep water deoxygenation occurred, it would be hypothesized that Mn-oxide precipitation would decrease, resulting in a positive Tl isotope excursion during OAE-2.\nWe have analyzed the Tl isotope composition of organic-rich black shales from Site 1258 of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) spanning the period before, during, and after OAE-2. Based on Fe redox proxies, the entire section is euxinic and thus no Mn-oxides are present (i.e. no local redox changes). Before the event, Tl isotope compositions are similar or slightly heavier than modern seawater values. Just prior to the onset of OAE-2, a positive shift occurs and is maintained until recovery, slightly before the termination of the event. The shift to heavier values and subsequent recovery is interpreted to reflect a global reduction in Mn-oxide burial, which occurs slightly before the event and remains until a rebound of global Mn-oxide burial after the OAE. For the first time, this suggests a decline in the global extent of oxygenated bottom waters, which predated the carbon isotope excursion and hence the global perturbation of the carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis of stalagmite multivariate geochemical records can provide insight into climate variability as well as the frequency of high-magnitude events (i.e. volcanic eruptions) and even land use changes above cave systems. For most environmental proxies, large trace element data sets can pose difficulties for analysis and interpretation due to natural processes acting across wide ranges of time scales and magnitudes with overlapping influences on individual chemical species. To reduce the complexity of geochemical data, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Evolutionary Spectral Analysis to a large high-resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) stalagmite trace element data set from northern Yucatán, Mexico (CH-1), from about 1500-2007 CE. In our study, PCA identified five significant principal components (PCs) in this CH-1 record, which explain >83% of the data set’s variability. Our analysis reveals that PC1 responds to overall trace element loading, including both short-lived trace element influxes associated with volcanic eruptions, and sustained land use changes associated with the Spanish settlement and Henequen (succulent plant) production. PC2 reflects prior calcite precipitation associated with regional dry climate anomalies by increasing Sr and Mg substitution in calcite. High loadings for B and Na indicate that PC3 is sensitive to wet climate anomalies. PCs 4 and 5 reflect related but lagged trace element transport mechanisms. Evolutionary spectral analysis results for the PCs reveal the changing influence of solar 11 and 22-year cycles and the 3-7 year El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system over the last 500 years. This study adds to growing evidence that speleothems can record multivariate trace element fingerprints of volcanic eruptions, soil erosion, and different styles of climate variability, which can be useful for model verification and sensitivity testing studies.",

            "abstract": "Understanding olivine-bearing materials in Terra Sirenum provides insight into the magmatic and hydrologic processes that shaped the Southern Highlands of Mars. Our study addresses two questions: “What is the geologic context of olivine compositions in the study area?” and “What does olivine abundance, composition, and geologic context suggest about the magmatic and weathering processes in our study area?” To answer these questions, we mapped olivine deposits within a region of Terra Sirenum using JMARS [1]. We used Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) data to map the extent of olivine deposits and to understand their degree of consolidation. To investigate olivine composition, we used the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) global maps of Forsterite/Fayalite compositions [2]. We found that the olivine compositions vary from most iron-rich types (Fo01) to the most magnesium-rich (Fo91), with the vast majority identified as Fo68. The results of our study are consistent with those implied by the magma overturn model [3], which explains the compositional changes in Martian magmas over time. In addition, the extent of olivine-bearing deposits within our study area suggests that mechanical weathering (e.g., aeolian and gravity-driven processes) is more likely to dominate the sedimentary record in recent geologic time over water-driven processes. We will present our results, which detail the present-day surface geology of our study area in Terra Sirenum. Our results have implications for Martian magma evolution as well as the extent water has played in shaping the surface of the planet.\n[1] Gorelick, N., et al.

            "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a progression towards using models as a tool for predicting high frequency contributing area dynamics in catchments. High frequency contributing area modeling can become a viable alternative to the current approach for estimating contributing area in Canadian catchments, which assumes a static portion of the catchment’s gross drainage area. The current approach does not consider the spatiotemporal variability of contributing area dynamics, and therefore, represents an important challenge for characterizing the recurrence that saturated areas in the catchment can actively connect and contribute to the main channel in response to runoff producing snowmelt or storm events. Such characterizations are useful to assess the relative importance of different areas within a catchment for runoff generation, and nutrient production and transport. In this study, the PDMROF configuration of Environment Canada’s MESH model has been applied to simulate areas actively contributing to daily streamflow from four nested catchments of the Qu’Appelle River basin. The return periods of annual maximum contributing areas were computed using Weibull’s equation. The research also evaluates if runoff magnitude is always associated with the same extent and recurrence of contributing area and investigates how contributing area and streamflow return periods relate. This work provides the foundation for evaluating the effect of environmental changes (mainly land use and climate associated changes) on contributing area recurrence by conducting similar investigations under various environmental change scenarios.",

The paired basin study was established to investigate questions that have arisen with regards to changes in the amount and timing of water yield following forest treatments. Precipitation, stream flow, soil moisture, chloride concentrations in precipitation and stream flow were measured to quantify the water budget components. While the study is ongoing, the results from six water years show a high degree of confidence in the techniques applied. The total inflow from precipitation for each integration period minus the outflow of stream flow, evapotranspiration, recharge and soil moisture leaves a remainder of less than 1%, thus most of the water is accounted for. Volume-weighted chloride concentration in precipitation ranges from 0.20 to 0.23 mg/L for the three integration periods. The annual volume-weighted chloride concentration in stream flow for the same periods ranges from 2.18 to 3.32 mg/L in the treated basin and 0.93 to 1.35 mg/L in the control basin. Based on the ratio of chloride in precipitation to the concentration in stream flow, evapotranspiration is estimated to be about 90 to 96 percent in the treated basin and 76 to 85 percent in the untreated basin for the three integration periods of the ongoing investigation. Higher evapotranspiration rates in the treated basin may be due to the change in vegetation or to a greater area at a lower elevation with a west facing slope. While no increase in stream flow in the treated basin from the forest treatments has been detected, the intensity of runoff appear to be reduced from pre-treatment to post-treatment conditions. With continued monitoring as the vegetation reestablishes to the desired “restored” condition, we will be able to track changes in the water budget.A paired basin study in the Upper Santa Fe River watershed following forest restoration measured water budget components in a treated and untreated basin.

            "abstract": "Ions created within a flowing plasma by ionization of neutrals respond to the electric and magnetic fields associated with the flow becoming what are called pick-up ions (PUI). PUI play an important role in many solar system plasma environments and affect the energy and momentum balance of the plasma flow. PUI have been observed during several recent space missions and PUI data will be compared and interpreted using models. Pick-up oxygen ions were observed in the solar wind upstream of Mars by the Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) and Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) instruments on NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft. The pick-up oxygen ions are created when atoms in the hot corona are ionized by solar radiation and charge exchange with solar wind protons. The ion fluxes measured by SEP can constrain the oxygen escape rate from Mars. PUI were also been detected at distances of 10 - 100 km from the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko (67P/CG) by plasma instruments (IES and ICA) onboard the Rosetta Orbiter when the comet was at 3 AU. The newly-born cometary ions are accelerated by the solar wind motional electric field but remain un-magnetized, as suggested by pre-encounter models (Rubin et al., 2014). The inner magnetosphere of Saturn and the water plume of the icy satellite Enceladus provide a third example of PUI. H2O+ ions created by ionization of neutral water producing ions that are picked-up by the co-rotating magnetospheric plasma flow. These ions then undergo a complex interaction with the plume gas including collisions that convert most H2O+ ions to H3O+, as measured by the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the debate about the nature and controls of seasonal variation in structure and metabolism of Amazonian rainforests is critical to understanding their response to climate change. In situ studies have observed higher photosynthetic and evapotranspiration rates, increased litterfall and leaf flushing during the sunlight-rich dry season. Satellite data also indicated higher greenness level, a proven surrogate of photosynthetic carbon fixation, and leaf area during the dry season relative to the wet season. Some recent reports suggest that rainforests display no seasonal variations and the previous results were satellite measurement artefacts. Therefore, we re-examine here several years of data from three sensors on two satellites under a range of sun positions and satellite measurement geometries and document robust evidence for a seasonal cycle in structure and greenness of wet equatorial Amazonian rainforests. This seasonal cycle is concordant with independent observations of solar radiation. We attribute alternative conclusions to an incomplete study of the seasonal cycle, i.e. the dry season only, and to prognostications based on a biased radiative transfer model. Consequently, evidence of dry season greening in geometry corrected satellite data was ignored and the absence of evidence for seasonal variation in lidar data due to noisy and saturated signals was misinterpreted as evidence of absence of changes during the dry season. Our results, grounded in the physics of radiative transfer, buttress previous reports of dry season increases in leaf flushing, litterfall, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration in well-hydrated Amazonian rainforests.",

            "abstract": "The cloud uptake of SO2 during wintertime conditions over the Eastern United States is presented. In wintertime conditions in the Eastern United States there are fewer reactant sinks for gaseous SO2, as a result the atmospheric lifetime is measurably longer. An examination of the SO2/CO2 mixing ratio above and below the cloud layer in comparison to the internal concentration of gaseous CO2 inside the cloud layer will determine uptake of SO2 due to aqueous reactivity SO2/CO2. The performance of this will allow for a numerical estimate of the CO2-H2O complexes compared to the SO2-H2O complexes formed at the cloud droplet surface. The data obtained originates from a series of survey night and day flights on a C-130 aircraft that occurred from Feb 3 to Mar 13, 2015 over the Eastern coastal region of the United States ranging from New York to Florida. The following instruments were utilized in obtaining gaseous measurements; for water droplet size distribution a Condensation Nucleus Counter (CN Counter) (NCAR) and a Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe, Model 100 (FSSP-100) (NCAR), for SO2 measurements the TECO 43C SO2 analyzer (NOAA—ESRL/NCAT) and a CO/CO2 analyzer (NCAR).

            "abstract": "The Himalayan metamorphic core, exposed between two opposite sense shear zones, is locally preserved in a series of foreland klippen. The upper shear zone, the South Tibetan Detachment (STD), is a key element in many competing tectonic models. One of these models, tectonic wedging, requires that the STD merges with the reverse-sense basal shear zone towards the foreland. We tested this hypothesis in two foreland klippen in western Nepal. The Karnali klippe is a doubly-plunging synform underlain by a folded reverse-sense shear zone. It comprises amphibolite metamorphic facies rocks overlain by greenschist to subgreenschist facies sedimentary rocks. The contact is marked by a folded ca. 1 km thick normal-sense shear zone, which we correlate with the STD. Quartz and calcite recrystallization textures and quartz crystallographic preferred orientations suggest an abrupt decrease in temperature of deformation from ~750 °C in the footwall to 580 and 475 °C at the base and top of the shear zone, respectively, and to 150-200 °C in the hanging wall. In-situ monazite petrochronology indicates prograde metamorphism between 36 and 30 Ma in the immediate footwall of the STD, followed by tectonic exhumation from 28 to <24 Ma, possibly starting as early as 30 Ma. Preliminary muscovite 40Ar/39Ar ages suggest that deformation along the STD ceased by ca. 18 Ma. Field data from the adjacent Jajarkot klippe indicate a similar first order structural architecture, although protoliths, metamorphic grade and deformation temperature differ significantly. Transport-parallel exposure of the STD in this area implies a minimum slip of 165 km. The presence of the STD on both flanks of the Karnali and the Jajarkot klippen is inconsistent with predictions that the STD merges at depth with the basal shear zone in the Karnali klippe and north of the Jajarkot klippe. Our observations are consequently not compatible with the tectonic wedging model proposed for western Nepal.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory is an atmospheric monitoring station on the North side of Mauna Loa Volcano (4169 m summit) located at an altitude of 3396 m. The bright sun, dark lava surface, and the seven percent grade of the mountain create a surface radiation wind that changes from upslope in the daytime to downslope after sunset. The radiation wind has a magnitude of 2.5-3.0 m/s. The off-island wind interacts with the mountain to create a barrier wind. The radiation wind dominates when the off-island winds are low and opposite is true when the off-island winds are strong. Temperature inversions form at sunset in the first 50 meters above the ground. Aerosol profiles, measured with a unique technique called CLidar or camera lidar, often increase and show a peak between 60 and 160 meters. The aerosol generally decreases to upper tropospheric values with a distinct change in the rate of decrease at 600 m above the ground. At night the region between the aerosol peak and 600 m is often flowing upslope, counter to the downslope surface flow. The source of the air in this counter flow region is not well understood, but appears to come from levels below the station altitude at least occasionally. This possibly would impact the interpretation of some of the air samples taken during this period.",

            "abstract": "Public land management plans are potentially powerful policies for building sustainability and adaptive capacity. Land managers are recognizing the need to respond to numerous climate change impacts on natural and human systems. For the first time, in 2015, the federal government required each state to incorporate climate change into their State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAP) as a condition for funding. As important land management tools, SWAPs have the potential to guide state agencies in shaping and implementing practices for climate change adaptation. Intended to be revised every ten years, SWAPs can change as conditions and understanding of climate change evolves. This study asks what practices are states using to integrate climate change, and how does this vary between states? To answer this question, we conducted a broad analysis among seven states (CO, MT, NE, ND, SD, UT, WY) and a more in-depth analysis of four states (CO, ND, SD, WY). We use seven key factors that represent best practices for incorporating climate change identified in the literature. These best practices are species prioritization, key habitats, threats, monitoring, partnerships and participation, identification of management options, and implementation of management options. The in-depth analysis focuses on how states are using climate change information for specific habitats addressed in the plans. We find that states are integrating climate change in many different ways, showing varying degrees of sophistication and preparedness. We summarize different practices and highlight opportunities to improve the effectiveness of plans through: communication tools across state lines and stakeholders, explicit targeting of key habitats, enforcement and monitoring progress and success, and conducting vulnerability analyses that incorporate topics beyond climate and include other drivers, trajectories, and implications of historic and future land-use change.",

            "abstract": "Research experiences for undergraduates (REU) have been shown to support the success of STEM undergraduates through improving their research skills, ability to synthesize knowledge, and personal and professional development, all while socializing them into the nature of science. REUs are further intended to support STEM career choice and professional advancement, and have thus played a key role in diversity efforts. Recruiting and retaining diverse students in STEM through REUs is of particular importance in the geosciences, where women and ethnic minorities continue to be significantly underrepresented. However, few studies have examined the long-term impacts of these REUs on students’ academic and career trajectories. Further, those that do exist primarily study the experiences of current graduate students, scientists, and faculty members—that is, those who have already persisted—which overlooks the multiple academic and career paths REU students might follow and may preclude a thorough examination of REUs’ diversity impacts.\nIn this long-term retrospective study of the academic and career impacts of a REU program at a large Western U.S. research university, we interviewed 17 former REU participants on their expectations prior to their REU participation, their experiences during the REU, the immediate outcomes from the experience, and its long-term impacts on their academic and career choices. To address gaps in the existing literature on REU impacts, we purposively sampled students who have taken a variety of educational and career paths, including those not engaged in science research. Despite varied trajectories, the majority of the students we interviewed have persisted in the geosciences and attest to the REU’s profound impact on their career-related opportunities and choices. This presentation describes students’ diverse STEM pathways and discusses how students’ REU expectations, experiences, and immediate outcomes continued to make an impact long-term.",

The composition, concentration and size distribution of aerosol in the polar stratosphere are considered to be strongly influenced by the transportations from mid-latitude to polar region and exchange of stratosphere to troposphere. In order to study the aerosol composition and size distribution in the Arctic stratosphere and the relationship between their aerosol microphysical properties and transport process, we carried out balloon-borne measurement of aerosol volatility above Ny-Aalesund, Norway in the winter of 2015.\n In our observation, two optical particle counters and a thermo denuder were suspended by one rubber balloon. A particle counter measured the heated aerosol size distribution (after heating at the temperature of 300 degree by the thermo denuder) and the other measured the ambient aerosol size distribution during the observation. The observation was carried out on 15 January, 2015. Balloon arrived at the height of 30km and detailed information of aerosol size distributions in upper troposphere and lower stratosphere for both heated aerosol and ambient aerosol were obtained.\n As a Result, the number ratio of non-volatile particles to ambient aerosol particles in lower stratosphere (11-15km) showed different feature in particle size range of fine mode (0.3<Dp<0.8µｍ) and coarse mode (0.8µｍ<Dp). The vales of number ratio of non-volatile particles to ambient aerosol particles were 1-3% in fine mode range and 7-20% in coarse mode range. They suggested that fine particles are composed dominantly of volatile species (probably sulfuric acid), and coarse particles are composed of non-volatile species such as minerals, sea-salts. In our presentation, we show the obtained aerosol size distribution and discuss the aerosol compositions and their transport process.",

            "abstract": "Excess planetary CO2 and accompanying ocean acidification are naturally mitigated on geologic time scales via mineral weathering. Here, CO2 acidifies the hydrosphere, which then slowly reacts with silicate and carbonate minerals to produce dissolved bicarbonates that are ultimately delivered to the ocean. This alkalinity not only provides long-term sequestration of the excess atmospheric carbon, but it also chemically counters the effects of ocean acidification by stabilizing or raising pH and carbonate saturation state, thus helping rebalance ocean chemistry and preserving marine ecosystems. Recent research has demonstrated ways of greatly accelerating this process by its integration into energy systems. Specifically, it has been shown (1) that some 80% of the CO2 in a waste gas stream can be spontaneously converted to stable, seawater mineral bicarbonate in the presence of a common carbonate mineral – limestone. This can allow removal of CO2 from biomass combustion and bio-energy production while generating beneficial ocean alkalinity, providing a potentially cheaper and more environmentally friendly negative-CO2-emissions alternative to BECCS. It has also been demonstrated that strong acids anodically produced in a standard saline water electrolysis cell in the formation of H2 can be reacted with carbonate or silicate minerals to generate strong base solutions. These solutions are highly absorptive of air CO2, converting it to mineral bicarbonate in solution. When such electrochemical cells are powered by non-fossil energy (e.g. electricity from wind, solar, tidal, biomass, geothermal, etc. energy sources), the system generates H2 that is strongly CO2-emissions-negative, while producing beneficial marine alkalinity (2-4). The preceding systems therefore point the way toward renewable energy production that, when tightly coupled to geochemical mitigation of CO2 and formation of natural ocean “antacids”, forms a high capacity, negative-CO2-emissions, “supergreen” source of fuel or electrcity.\n1) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es102671x\n2) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es800366q\n3) http://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10095.full.pdf\n4) http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b00875",

            "abstract": "Various conditions within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) can lead to critical layers and instabilities for propagating gravity waves (GWs). These critical layers cause gravity wave breaking, resulting in momentum deposition and the generation of secondary gravity waves, which can trigger far reaching effects on the MLT region including induced drag on mean winds. GWs play an important role in the vertical transport of momentum from the lower to the upper and middle atmosphere. A better understanding of their generation, propagation, and breaking is needed to improve predictive capabilities for momentum deposition and coupling within the atmosphere. Understanding the conditions under which GWs break and generate secondary GWs is especially of importance, as secondary GWs allow for momentum to be transported to even higher altitudes within the atmosphere.\nRecent measurements from the DEEPWAVE campaign exhibiting critical layers within or near the MLT that lead to GW breaking are discussed. Furthermore, examples are given of observed secondary GW generation. Shown in the attached figure is one such example of observed secondary GWs. The sodium mixing ratios from a flight over the south island of New Zealand on 13 July 2014 demonstrated the presence of strong mountain waves (MWs). Figure A shows strong MW perturbations below 86km. However, the MWs start to dissipate quickly in altitude as they approach a critical level near 90km where the wind was estimated to be near 0 m/s. Figure B shows smaller scale GW perturbations beginning to form near 90km where the MWs have largely dissipated. Figure C shows that these smaller-scale secondary GWs are visible up to higher altitudes, and there are multiple scales of these secondary GWs. These data demonstrate the important role that critical layers play in GW breaking, secondary GW generation, and the transport of momentum.",

            "abstract": "Weather prediction accuracy has become very important for the Northeast U.S. given the devastating effects of extreme weather events in the recent years. Weather forecasting systems are used towards building strategies to prevent catastrophic losses for human lives and the environment. Concurrently, weather forecast tools and techniques have evolved with improved forecast skill as numerical prediction techniques are strengthened by increased super-computing resources. In this study, we examine the combination of two state-of-the-science atmospheric models (WRF and RAMS/ICLAMS) by utilizing a Bayesian regression approach to improve the prediction of extreme weather events for NE U.S. The basic concept behind the Bayesian regression approach is to take advantage of the strengths of two atmospheric modeling systems and, similar to the multi-model ensemble approach, limit their weaknesses which are related to systematic and random errors in the numerical prediction of physical processes. The first part of this study is focused on retrospective simulations of seventeen storms that affected the region in the period 2004-2013. Optimal variances are estimated by minimizing the root mean square error and are applied to out-of-sample weather events. The applicability and usefulness of this approach are demonstrated by conducting an error analysis based on in-situ observations from meteorological stations of the National Weather Service (NWS) for wind speed and wind direction, and NCEP Stage IV radar data, mosaicked from the regional multi-sensor for precipitation. The preliminary results indicate a significant improvement in the statistical metrics of the modeled-observed pairs for meteorological variables using various combinations of the sixteen events as predictors of the seventeenth. This presentation will illustrate the implemented methodology and the obtained results for wind speed, wind direction and precipitation, as well as set the research steps that will be followed in the future.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructing tectonic histories relies on the ability to establish P-T-t paths from samples and data collected in the field. Efforts to establish detailed P-T-t pathways have benefitted recently from dramatically improved ability to resolve mineral chemical and isotopic properties at the micron scale. We present here a new interpretation of the HP and UHP metamorphic history of a 1.8 Gya terrain in West Greenland (Glassley et al., 2014) that is based on these new analytical capabilities, coupled with sampling at high spatial density.\nThe terrain consists of a tectonic assemblage of metasomatically altered pillow basalts, ultramafic bodies, exhalative and chemical oceanic metasediments, pelites, and quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, that are the preserved remnants of a subduction channel.\nUsing LA-SF-ICP-MS analyses on zircons, we time-correlated recrystallization events that could be well-documented using micro-analytical techniques (EBMA; Raman; LA-ICP-MS). More than 700 207Pb/206Pb dates and more than 1,000 electron microprobe mineral analyses were used in this correlation effort.\nThe results demonstrate that: 1) Recrystallization is highly localized, often restricted to tectonic domains of less than a few 10s of km2. Few tectonic lenses preserve evidence of the most extreme P-T conditions (5 GPa at temperatures of approximately 1,000 C); 2) The extent of area involved in a recrystallization “event” is mainly a reflection of local rock chemistry/mineralogy and fluid activity; 3) Since individual crystals preserve multiple parts of a P-T-t path in compositional zoning, isotopic dates must be very carefully correlated with corresponding mineral compositions in order to establish t at P & T; 4) Preservation of the prograde P-T-t path during subduction is rare.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic has been undergoing rapid changes. Sea ice has retreated at an accelerating rate, and storms activity has intensified. Storms transport energy to the Arctic and increase the ocean mixing of Arctic Ocean, which enhances the ice retreat. However, clouds brought by the storms can also block solar radiation, thus impede the ice retreat. This study is to investigate integrated impacts of storm on the Arctic sea ice, especially from the view of storm persistency and intensity. To investigate storm impacts on the surface radiation balance and ocean mixing, composite analysis is conducted in the years with longer- or shorter-than-usual storm durations and with higher- or lower-than-usual storm intensities. Results suggest that storms significantly cause a reduction of downwelling shortwave radiation during the melting season (April- September), leading to a cooling effect stronger than the warming effect due to enhanced longwave radiation and warm advection brought by the storms. Storm induced ocean mixing pronounced if the strong storms occur in the late melting season (July-September), when there are increased open waters in the Arctic Ocean. Considering the positive and negative impacts of the storm on the sea ice melting, a storm forcing index (SFI) is proposed, which shows a good correlation with the summer minimum sea ice extent.",

            "abstract": "Simulations of aerosols, clouds and their interaction contribute to the major source of uncertainty in predicting the changing Earth’s energy and in estimating future climate. Anthropogenic contribution of aerosols affects the properties of clouds through aerosol indirect effects. Three different versions of NASA GISS global climate model are presented for simulation of the twentieth century climate change. All versions have fully interactive tracers of aerosols and chemistry in both the troposphere and stratosphere. All chemical species are simulated prognostically consistent with atmospheric physics in the model and the emissions of short-lived precursors [Shindell et al., 2006]. One version does not include the aerosol indirect effect on clouds. The other two versions include a parameterization of the interactive first indirect aerosol effect on clouds following Menon et al. [2010]. One of these two models has the Multiconfiguration Aerosol Tracker of Mixing state (MATRIX) that permits detailed treatment of aerosol mixing state, size, and aerosol-cloud activation. The main purpose of this study is evaluation of aerosol-clouds interactions and feedbacks, as well as cloud and aerosol radiative forcings, for the twentieth century climate under different assumptions and parameterizations for aerosol, clouds and their interactions in the climate models.\nThe change of global surface air temperature based on linear trend ranges from +0.8°C to +1.2°C between 1850 and 2012. Water cloud optical thickness increases with increasing temperature in all versions with the largest increase in models with interactive indirect effect of aerosols on clouds, which leads to the total (shortwave and longwave) cloud radiative cooling trend at the top of the atmosphere.\nMenon, S., D.

            "abstract": "Construction histories of Archean cratons remain poorly understood; their destruction is even less clear because of, by definition, its rarity. By assembling geophysical and geochemical data in 3-D lithosphere models, a clearer understanding of the geometry of major structures within the Rae, Slave and Wyoming cratons of central North America is now possible. Little evidence exists of subducted slabs similar to modern oceanic lithosphere in these construction histories whereas underthrusting and wedging of proto-continental lithosphere is inferred from multiple dipping discontinuities. Archean continental building blocks may resemble the modern lithosphere of Ontong-Java-Hikurangi oceanic plateau. Radiometric dating of xenoliths provides estimates of rock types and ages at depth beneath sparse kimberlite occurrences. These ages can be correlated to surface rocks. The 3.6–2.6 Ga Rae, Slave and Wyoming cratons comprise smaller continental terranes that ‘cratonized’ during a granitic bloom at 2.61-2.55 ga. Cratonization probably represents the final differentiation of early crust into a relatively homogeneous, uniformly thin (35-42 km), tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite crust with pyroxenite layers near the Moho atop depleted lithospheric mantle. Peak thermo-tectonic events at 1.86-1.7 Ga broadly metasomatized, mineralized and recrystallized mantle and lower crustal rocks, apparently making mantle peridotite more ‘fertile’ and conductive by introducing or concentrating sulfides or graphite throughout the lithosphere at 80-120 km depths. This metasomatism may have also weakened the lithosphere or made it more susceptible to tectonic or chemical erosion. The arrival of the subducted Shatsky Rise conjugate at the Wyoming craton at 65-75 Ma appears to have eroded and displaced the thus weakened base of the craton below 140-160 km. This replaced old refertilized continental mantle with new depleted oceanic mantle. Is this the same craton?",

            "abstract": "To explore effective ways to decrease soil CO2 emission and increase grain yield, field experiments were conducted on two upland rice soils (Lixisols and Gleyic Luvisols) in northern Benin in West Africa. The treatments were two tillage systems (no-tillage, and manual tillage), two rice straw managements (no rice straw, and rice straw mulch at 3 Mg ha-1) and three nitrogen fertilizers levels (no nitrogen, recommended level of nitrogen: 60 kg ha-1, and high level of nitrogen: 120 kg ha-1). Potassium and phosphorus fertilizers were applied to be non-limiting at 40 kg K2O ha-1 and 40 kg P2O5 ha-1. Four replications of the twelve treatment combinations were arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil CO2 emission, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured at 5 cm depth in 6 to 10 days intervals during the rainy season and every two weeks during the dry season. Soil moisture was the main factor explaining the seasonal variability of soil CO2 emission. Much larger soil CO2 emissions were found in rainy than dry season. No-tillage planting significantly reduced soil CO2 emissions compared with manual tillage. Higher soil CO2 emissions were recorded in the mulched treatments. Soil CO2 emissions were higher in fertilized treatments compared with non fertilized treatments. Rice biomass and yield were not significantly different as a function of tillage systems. On the contrary, rice biomass and yield significantly increased with application of rice straw mulch and nitrogen fertilizer. The highest response of rice yield to nitrogen fertilizer addition was obtained for 60 kg N ha-1 in combination with 3 Mg ha-1 of rice straw for the two tillage systems. Soil CO2 emission per unit grain yield was lower under no-tillage, rice straw mulch and nitrogen fertilizer treatments. No-tillage combined with rice straw mulch and 60 kg N ha-1 could be used by smallholder farmers to achieve higher grain yield and lower soil CO2 emission in upland rice fields in northern Benin.",

A consequence of the large geometric factor is that “ambient mode” electron flux measurements (500 eV electrons having 0°, 90°, or 180° pitch angle) can vary depending on the orientation of the EDI instrument with respect to the magnetic field, a nonphysical effect that requires a correction. Here, we present determinations of the θ- and ø-dependent correction factors for the eight EDI GDUs, where θ (ø) is the polar (azimuthal) angle between the GDU symmetry axis and the local magnetic field direction, and compare the corrected fluxes with those measured by the fast plasma instrument (FPI). Using these corrected, high time resolution (~1,000 samples per second) ambient electron fluxes, combined with the unprecedentedly high resolution 3D electric field measurements taken by the spin-plane and axial double probes (SDP and ADP), we are equipped to accurately detect electron-scale current layers and electric field waves associated with the non-Maxwellian (anisotropic and agyrotropic) particle distribution functions predicted to exist in the reconnection diffusion region. We compare initial observations of the diffusion region with distributions and wave analysis from PIC simulations of asymmetric reconnection applicable for modeling reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause, where MMS will begin Science Phase 1 as of September 1, 2015.",

            "abstract": "CO is mostly produced in the lower troposphere by incomplete combustion of biomass and fuels. CO oxidation consumes ~75% of the tropospheric OH, which then is not available to remove CH4 and other greenhouse gases. CO oxidation also leads to the production of tropospheric O3. These critical impacts of CO on air quality and climate require accurate determination of the abundance and evolution of CO near the surface.\nSatellite retrievals would be well-suited to monitor surface CO globally. However, how do they compare to actual surface abundances? Some aspects to be considered include: the vertical sensitivity of retrievals (given by the averaging kernels), or how thick are the atmospheric layers that can be resolved; the vertical correlation length of CO with respect to the thickness of those layers; and the horizontal variability of CO with respect to the instrument's footprint.\nTo investigate these questions we analyze MOPITT retrievals, DISCOVER-AQ and NOAA profiles, as well as WDCGG surface measurements. MOPITT, on board NASA's Terra satellite, has been measuring tropospheric CO since 2000, providing the longest global CO record to date. Its unique multispectral CO product offers enhanced sensitivity to CO near the surface. Vertical profiles of the lower troposphere were acquired during the DISCOVER-AQ airborne campaigns over selected regions of the USA. NOAA's airborne flask sampling program results in a multi-year, multi-seasonal record of vertical profiles from near the surface up to the mid troposphere, acquired over a number of stations, mostly in North America. Long-term, cross-calibrated surface CO data from ground stations worldwide are available through the WDCGG.\nStatistical analyses of the DISCOVER-AQ and NOAA profiles indicate that surface vertical correlation length varies greatly depending on geographic location. This may explain contrasting results obtained for different ground stations when comparing MOPITT and WDCGG co-located data and timeseries.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake-induced landslides can generate significant damage within urban communities by damaging structures, obstructing lifeline connection routes and utilities, generating various environmental impacts, and possibly resulting in loss of life. Reliable hazard and risk maps are important to assist agencies in efficiently allocating and managing limited resources to prepare for such events. This research presents a new methodology in order to communicate site-specific landslide hazard assessments in a large-scale, regional map. Implementation of the proposed methodology results in seismic-induced landslide hazard maps that depict the probabilities of exceeding landslide displacement thresholds (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 10 meters). These maps integrate a variety of data sources including: recent landslide inventories, LIDAR and photogrammetric topographic data, geology map, mapped NEHRP site classifications based on available shear wave velocity data in each geologic unit, and USGS probabilistic seismic hazard curves. Soil strength estimates were obtained by evaluating slopes present along landslide scarps and deposits for major geologic units. Code was then developed to integrate these layers to perform a rigid, sliding block analysis to determine the amount and associated probabilities of displacement based on each bin of peak ground acceleration in the seismic hazard curve at each pixel. The methodology was applied to western Oregon, which contains weak, weathered, and often wet soils at steep slopes. Such conditions have a high landslide hazard even without seismic events.

            "abstract": "This paper is the first to investigate the role of online information and social media in enabling households to reduce natural disaster losses. The historic 2011 Bangkok flood is utilized as a case study to assess how internet use allowed households to mitigate flood losses. This event was one of the first major disasters to affect an urban area with a substantial population connected to social media. The role of online information is investigated with a mixed methods approach, using both quantitative (propensity score matching and multivariate regression analysis) and qualitative (in-depth interviews) techniques. The study relies on two data sources – survey responses from 469 Bangkok households and in-depth interviews with internet users who are a subset of the survey participants.\nPropensity score matching indicates that social media use enabled households to reduce mean total losses by 37%, using a nearest neighbor estimator. Average loss reductions amounted to USD 3,708 to USD 4,886, depending on the matching estimator. In addition, regression analysis suggests that social media use is associated with lower flood losses (average reduction of USD 2,784). These reductions are notable when considering that total flood losses in 2011 averaged USD 4,903. Social media offered information that was not available from other sources, such as localized and nearly real-time updates of flood location and depth. With knowledge of current flood conditions, Bangkok households could move belongings to higher ground before floodwaters arrived. These findings suggest that utilizing social media users as sensors could better inform populations during natural disasters, particularly in locations that lack real-time, accurate flood monitoring networks. Therefore, expanded access to the internet and social could especially be useful in developing countries, ungagged basins, and highly complex urban environments. There is also an enormous opportunity for disseminating government disaster communication through social media. Overall, the study reveals that online information can enable effective disaster preparedness and reduce flood losses.",

            "abstract": "We investigate response of moist convection to multi-scale feature of the spatial variation of surface sensible heat fluxes (SHF) in the afternoon evolution of the convective boundary layer (CBL), utilizing a mesoscale-domain large eddy simulation (LES) model. The multi-scale surface heterogeneity feature is analytically created as a function of the spectral slope in the wavelength range from a few tens of km to a few hundreds of m in the spectrum of surface SHF on a log-log scale. The response of moist convection to the κ-3 - slope (where κ is wavenumber) surface SHF field is compared with that to the κ-2 - slope surface, which has a relatively weak mesoscale feature, and the homogeneous κ0 - slope surface. Given the surface energy balance with a spatially uniform available energy, the prescribed SHF has a 180° phase lag with the latent heat flux (LHF) in a horizontal domain of (several tens of km)2. Thus, warmer (cooler) surface is relatively dry (moist). For all the cases, the same observation-based sounding is prescribed for the initial condition. For all the κ-3 - slope surface heterogeneity cases, early non-precipitating shallow clouds further develop into precipitating deep thunderstorms. But for all the κ-2 - slope cases, only shallow clouds develop. We compare the vertical profiles of domain-averaged fluxes and variances, and the contribution of the mesoscale and turbulence contributions to the fluxes and variances, between the κ-3 versus κ-2 slope cases. Also the cross-scale processes are investigated.",

            "abstract": "Utilization of meteoric 10Be as a paleoenvironmental proxy has the potential to offer new insights into paleoprecipitation records and paleoclimate models, as well as to long-term variations in erosion with climate. The delivery of meteoric 10Be to the surface varies with precipitation and its strong adsorption to sediment has already proven useful in studies of erosion. Thus, it is likely meteoric 10Be concentrations in lake sediments vary under both changing climate and changing sediment influx. Assessment of the relative importance of these changes requires the comparison of 10Be concentrations in well-dated lake cores with independent paleoenvironmental proxies, including oxygen isotope, pollen, and charcoal records, as well as variation in geochemical composition of the sediments. Blacktail Pond details 15,000 years of climatic change in the Yellowstone region. We develop a new model framework for predicting meteoric 10Be concentrations with depth in the core, based on sedimentation rates of both lake-derived and terrigenous sediments and changes in the flux of meteoric 10Be with precipitation. Titanium concentrations and previously determined 10Be concentrations in wind-derived loess provide proxies for changing delivery of 10Be to the lake by terrigenous sources. We use existing paleoenvironmental data obtained from this core and the surrounding region to develop models for changing rainfall across the region and predict meteoric 10Be delivery to the lake by precipitation. Based on a suite of ~10 models, sedimentation rate is the primary control of meteoric 10Be in the Blacktail Pond core unless terrestrial input is very high, as it was post-glacial in the early Holocene when the lake experienced a high influx of loess and terrigenous sediments. We used these models to inform sample selection for 10Be analysis along the Blacktail pond core. Core sediments are processed for meteoric 10Be analysis using sequential digestions and standard extraction procedures. 10Be concentrations will be used to test the suite of model predictions, and validate the application of meteoric 10Be concentrations as a proxy for changing erosion and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "In this study we have two main purposes. The first one is to simulate five midsize earthquakes (Mw≈5.0) recorded in the Marmara region, which has a geologically complex and heterogeneous crustal structure. We synthesize ground motion for the full wave train on three components, and applied a ‘physics based’ solution of earthquake rupture. The simulation methodology is based on the studies by Hutchings et al. (2007), Scognamiglio and Hutchings (2009). For each earthquake, we synthesized seismograms using by 500 different rupture scenarios that were generated by Monte Carlo selection of parameters within the range.\nSynthetic ground motion is a major challenge for seismic hazard assessment studies. Especially after the adoption of performance-based design approach with the Earthquake resistant design of engineering structures. To compute realistic time histories for different locations around Marmara region can be helpful for engineering design, retrofitting the existing structures, hazard and risk management studies and developing new seismic codes and standards.\nThe second purpose is to validate synthetic seismograms with real seismograms. We follow the methodology presented by Anderson (2003) for validation. This methodology proposes a similarity score based on averages of the quality of fit measuring ground motion characteristics and uses a suite of measurements. Namely, the synthetics are compared to real data by ten representative ground motion criteria.\n The applicability of Empirical Green’s functions methodology and physics based solution of earthquake rupture had been assessed in terms of modeling in complex geologic structure. Because the methodology produces source and site specific synthetic ground motion time histories and goodness-of-fit scores of obtained synthetics is between ‘fair’ to ‘good’ range based on Anderson’s score, we concluded that it can be tried to produce ground motion that has not previously been recorded during catastrophic earthquake in the region or some very active seismic area to develop or improve seismic codes and standards.

Recently, the inner edge of the habitable zone has been calculated using 3D atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) that include the effects of subsaturation and clouds, but different models obtain different results. We study potential sources of differences in five GCMs through a series of comparisons of radiative transfer, clouds, and dynamical cores for a rapidly rotating planet around the Sun and a synchronously rotating planet around an M star. We find that: (1) Cloud parameterization leads to the largest differences among the models; (2) Differences in water vapor longwave radiative transfer are moderate as long as the surface temperature is lower than 360 K; (3) Differences in shortwave absorption influences atmospheric humidity of synchronously rotating planet through a positive feedback; (4) Differences in atmospheric dynamical core have a very small effect on the surface temperature; and (5) Rayleigh scattering leads to very small differences among models. These comparisons suggest that future model development should focus on clouds and water vapor radiative transfer.",

            "abstract": "Thermodynamic and microphysical processes in the atmosphere are sufficiently fast that the effects of complex terrain on mountain meteorology are evident at spatial scales less than ten kilometer, much smaller than the resolution of most global atmosphere models. The resulting orographic signatures in air temperature and precipitation influence the surface hydrology of mountain watersheds. To account for these effects in global models, we build on a method developed first for a regional climate model in the 1990s and applied to only one global model in the 2000s. The mean surface elevation and fractional area of a moderate set of subgrid elevation classes is determined based on high-resolution Digital Elevation Model and a percentile-area classification scheme. This information is applied to a simple model of airflow over topography to determine the vertical displacement of air parcels passing through the grid cell. Conservation of energy and water determines the temperature and humidity profiles that drive subgrid predictions of thermodynamics for each elevation class that provides atmospheric forcing for the land model that in turn simulates surface states and fluxes as lower boundary conditions for the atmosphere model. All of the atmospheric and land surface physics is applied to each elevation class. Results can be distributed geographically according to the distribution of surface elevation at high spatial resolution. We will demonstrate the performance in the DOE ACME model.",

            "abstract": "Inspiration for the Vents program arose from two serendipitous events: the discovery of seafloor spreading-center hydrothermal venting on the Galápagos Rift in 1977, and NOAA’s deployment of the first US civilian research multibeam bathymetric sonar on the NOAA Ship Surveyor in 1979. Multibeam mapping in the NE Pacific revealed an unprecedented and revolutionary perspective of the Gorda and Juan de Fuca spreading centers, thus stimulating a successful exploration for volcanic and hydrothermal activity at numerous locations along both. After the 1986 discovery of the first “megaplume,”, quickly recognized as the water column manifestation of a deep submarine volcanic eruption, the Vents program embarked on a multi-decadal effort to discover and understand local-, regional-, and, ultimately, global-scale physical, chemical, and biological ocean environmental impacts of submarine volcanism and hydrothermal venting. The Vents program made scores of scientific discoveries, many of which owed their success to the program’s equally innovative and productive technological prowess. These discoveries were documented in hundreds of peer-reviewed papers by Vents researchers and their colleagues around the world. An emblematic success was the internationally recognized, first-ever detection, location, and study of an active deep volcanic eruption in 1993. To continue the Vents mission and further enhance its effectiveness in marine science and technology innovation, the program was reorganized in 2014 into two distinct, but closely linked, programs: Earth-Oceans Interactions and Acoustics. Both are currently engaged in expeditions and projects that maintain the Vents tradition of pioneering ocean exploration and research.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric advection of heat and moisture from lower latitudes to the high-latitude Arctic is a critical component of Earth’s energy cycle. Large-scale advective events have been shown to make up a significant portion of the moist static energy budget of the Arctic atmosphere, even though such events are typically infrequent. The transport of heat and moisture over surfaces covered by ice and snow results in dynamic changes to the boundary layer structure, stability and turbulence, as well as to diabatic processes such as cloud distribution, microphysics and subsequent radiative effects. Recent studies have identified advection into the Arctic as a key mechanism for modulating the melt and freeze of snow and sea ice, via modification to all-sky longwave radiation. This paper examines the radiative impact during summer of such Arctic advective events at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), considering also the important role they play for the surface energy budget. Using infrared sounder measurements from the AIRS satellite, the summer frequency of significantly stable and moist advective events from 2003-2014 are characterized; justification of AIRS profiles over the Arctic are made using radiosoundings during a 3-month transect (ACSE) across the Eastern Arctic basin. One such event was observed within the East Siberian Sea in August 2014 during ACSE, providing in situ verification on the robustness and capability of AIRS to monitor advective cases. Results will highlight the important surface warming aspect of stable, moist instrusions. However a paradox emerges as such events also result in a cooling at the TOA evident on monthly mean TOA radiation. Thus such events have a climatic importance over ice and snow covered surfaces across the Arctic. ERA-Interim reanalyses are examined to provide a longer term perspective on the frequency of such events as well as providing capability to estimate meridional fluxes of moist static energy.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the Jurassic Quiet Zone (JQZ) has been a long-standing debate in understanding Earth’s geomagnetic field history and behavior. We present a coherent and likely globally significant marine magnetic reversal record for the JQZ by constructing a correlation of new and previously acquired magnetic anomaly profiles in the western Pacific. We obtained a high-resolution marine magnetic anomaly record using sea surface, mid-water (3-km level deep-towed), and near-bottom (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)) profiles that targeted a spreading corridor in the Hawaiian lineation in 2011 (TN272 on R/V Thompson) and 2014 (SKQ2014S2 on R/V Sikuliaq). To extract crustal magnetic signals, the sea surface and mid-water magnetic data were corrected for ship-to-sensor offset, the diurnal effect, and the present-day ambient geomagnetic field. Mid-water data were upward continued to a constant 3 km level plane and to the sea surface. Near-bottom data were calibrated to remove the induced magnetic field by AUV Sentry, then corrected for IGRF and diurnal variations. We used these near-source data as an anchor for correlations with the sea surface and mid-water level data because of the AUV’s superb inertial navigation and hydrodynamically stable, quiet platform environment. Our sea surface anomaly correlation with the previously established Japanese lineation sequence shows (i) an excellent correlation of anomaly shapes from M29 to M42; (ii) a remarkable similarity in anomaly amplitude envelope, which decreases back in time from M19 to M38, with a minimum at M41, then increases back in time from M42; and (iii) refined locations of pre-M25 lineations in the Hawaiian lineation set. Moreover, short-wavelength anomalies from the mid-water and near-bottom profiles show a strong similarity in the M37/M38 polarity attributes found both in the magnetostratigraphic and marine magnetic records, implying that rapid magnetic reversals were occurring at that time. The average reversal rate calculated from the new Hawaiian sea surface level synthetic block model, coincides with the anomalously high reversal rate for the Japanese lineations, suggesting that reversal rates are highest during periods with the lowest anomaly amplitudes, indicating a very unique period of geomagnetic field behavior in the Earth’s history.",

It refers to the continuous hydric mass exchanges between the atmosphere, earth, surface and underground waters. Other than water accumulation in different regions, i. e. the oceans, the terrestrial water fulfills multiple cycles including condensation, precipitation and evaporation. The contribution of the rain direct evaporation to the heat and moisture of the clouds and to the atmospheric moisture cycling is fundamental, but very few measurements of those processes are available. Rain evaporation directly influences the induction and mainteinance of the downdrafts under the cloud base both in mesoscale precipitation or convective environment. In the past, different approaches measured and retrieved rain evaporation both through remote sensing (radar) or in-situ measurements, but the different methods came with serious errors in the estimation. We first present with this study a retrieval of the rainfall evaporation using dual-wavelength high-resolution lidar. This already proven technique (Lolli et al., 2013) permits to retrieve the raindrop equivolumetric diameter and then the evaporation at each range bin up to full evaporation. The results are then utilized to assess the discrepancies with an approximate analytical solution model for raindrop evaporation.",

Previous studies have relied primarily on moments-analyses, which, although satisfactory for simple distributions and density calculations, often return unreasonable values for higher order moments (e.g., temperature) and fail to account for non-thermal effects (e.g., temperature anisotropy and beams) and multiple ion-species. A Levenberg-Marquadt non-linear algorithm is applied to the PESA-Lo data in order to calculate the characteristic parameters of the proton, alpha-particle, and beam distributions. This analysis is augmented with calibration data from the WIND Faraday cups and magnetic-field data from WIND/MFI. Preliminary results from this non-linear analysis indicate that it indeed provides higher-quality ion parameters than the existing moments-analysis. When this analysis is complete, the set of bulk-parameter values will be suitable for studies of microinstabilities in the solar wind and of possible correlation between magnetic field fluctuations and non-thermal properties of the ion distributions. Applications of thermodynamic principles, such as the Boltzmann H-theorem, will allow for further characterization of the non-thermal properties of the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Regional mineral dust in the American Southwest affects snow-melt rates, biogeochemical cycling, visibility, and public health. We measured total suspended particulates (TSP) across a 500-km-long sampling network of five remote sites in Utah and Colorado, USA, forming a gradient in distance from major dust emitting areas. The two westernmost sites on the Colorado Plateau desert had similar TSP concentrations (2008-2012, daily average=126 µg m-3; max. daily average over a two-week period=700 µg m-3 at Canyonlands National Park, Utah), while the easternmost High Plains site, close to cropped and grazed areas in northeastern Colorado, had an average concentration of 143 µg m-3 in 2011-2012 (max. daily average=656 µg m-3). Such concentrations rank comparably with those of TSP in several African and Asian cities in the paths of frequent dust storms. Dust loadings at the two intervening montane sites decreased from the western slope of the Rocky Mountains (Telluride, daily average=68 µg m-3) to an eastern site (Niwot Ridge, daily average=58 µg m-3). Back-trajectory analyses and satellite retrievals indicated that the three westernmost sites received most dust from large desert-source regions as far as 300 km to their southwest. These sources also sometimes sent dust to the two easternmost sites, which additionally captured dust from sources north and northwest of the central Rocky Mountains as well as locally at the Plains site. The PM10 fraction accounted for <15% of TSP, but most TSP is only slightly larger (typical median size, 15-20 µm) after about 100-800 km transport distances. Correlations between TSP and PM10 values indicate increases in both fractions during regional wind storms, especially related to Pacific frontal systems during late winter to late spring. These measurements and observations indicate that most dust deposition and associated air-quality problems in the interior American West are connected to regional dust sources and not to those in Asia.",

            "abstract": "Wherever snowmelt runoff substantially contributes to winter-spring streamflows, warmer winter-spring temperature can accelerate snow melt and reduce later streamflows. These changes can adversely affect human activities and ecological communities (e.g. flood, drought, salmon survival rate, and blooming season). Here we investigate changes in timing of winter-spring streamflows over North America (NA) during 1933-2013 and 1951-2000 using observed streamflow and simulated runoff from pre-industrial (unforced) control and historical (realistically forced) runs from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model version 3. The study regions are north of 41˚N in NA. We analyze winter-spring center of volume date (WSCV), the date by which half of the accumulated January through June daily streamflow volume occurs. We first performed a sliding trend analysis of WSCV for time periods starting in various years (1951 through 1984) and ending in 2000. We found that the observed decreasing trends (Theil-Sen slopes) of WSCV over the northeast and northwest U.S. regions are at the edge of detectability (i.e., lie near the edge of the 5th-95th percentile envelope of control runs) for trends beginning any time between 1950 and 1970, but are consistent with the envelope of historical runs for all beginning trend years. Interestingly, for the 1933-2013 analysis, results for the northwest U.S. show that the observed trends of WSCV are positive for periods beginning as early as the mid-1960s, and inconsistent with historical runs for periods beginning in the mid-1950s and later. Aside from this inconsistency, observed trends to 2013 are consistent with both control and historical runs. This study suggests that internal variability has played a major role in timing of winter-spring streamflows to date, despite global warming, and thus that clear detection and attribution of WSCV trends in the study regions may require longer streamflow records than those now available.",

            "abstract": "Transportation corridors built along natural slopes are subject to frequent rockfall hazards, which can disrupt service and cause damage to infrastructure. Many of these areas exist along the Fraser-Thompson corridor of the CN rail line in Southern British Columbia, particularly in the White Canyon area near Lytton. Here the rail track is situated between the 500 m high slopes and the river, for 2.4 km. The frequency-magnitude relationship between these events and the percentage of rockfalls making it to track level are important components of hazard assessment for these slopes. Traditional methods of collecting rockfall data in this area involve visual inspection by maintenance personnel, however this is an onerous task for such a large slope with frequent rockfall activity, and therefore the rockfall record for this area is often lacking data. Since 2012, high-resolution terrestrial LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) data has been collected for the White Canyon area and analysis of change from sequential LiDAR scans provides detailed data that can’t be obtained from traditional rockfall databases, including the magnitude and spatial distribution of rockfall events. While the LiDAR change detection can be useful in identifying rockfall volumes and source zones, it can be difficult to determine the end location of each rockfall and the exact timing of events, as scan data is usually collected over a period of several months. Recently, a microseismic monitoring system has been deployed over a section of the railway track and data is available on time and location of impact at the track level, which permits assessment of the number of rockfalls traversing the whole slope down to track level. This, in combination with data on rockfall magnitudes and source zones obtained from the LiDAR change detection can provide useful information for management of tracks in these hazardous settings and also provides data for calibration of rockfall modelling.",

However, the validity of the Markov hypothesis or more precisely the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is verified only rarely. In this work, we present a new breakthrough method that resolves crucial difficulties that arise when verifying Markovianity. Our method is computationally efficient and robust in the sense that statistical errors are kept at low levels in spite of limited sample sizes. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new method in the context of macro dispersion in the heterogeneous subsurface. We find that depending on the heterogeneity level, Markovian models work well above a certain scale of interest for media with exponentially decaying and Gaussian log-conductivity correlation structures (see figure). Moreover, we find surprising similarities in the velocity dynamics of both structures, which is relevant when formulating predictive macro-dispersion models.",

As temperature is increasing, respiration may accelerate over photosynthesis, yet the dynamics in tidal temperate wetlands are not clear as the tidal influence impact respiration egress of the soil. Here, we investigated soil respiration of two different microsites in each a natural and a restored wetland over a range of temperature and water level conditions over the growing season. Soil respiration increased with incoming tide and was lowest under water-inundated conditions. Mudflat microsites tended to have higher soil respiration than vegetated areas, indicating sufficiently high carbon input into non-vegetated areas for high respiratory fluxes. Whereby Spartina alterniflora microsites exhibited on average lower soil respiration fluxes of about 13 micromol m-2 s-1, Spartina patens exhibited higher fluxes at about 38 micromol m2 s-1 with Phragmites australis intermediate soil respiratory fluxes. Largest spatial variation was observed for mudflat microsites.",

Evidence has also indicated that a persistence of such flow channels after substorm onset may enhance post-onset auroral poleward expansion and activity. Here, we combine auroral imager and radar observations to show evidence that polar-cap flow channels can directly feed the substorm bulge westward motion, i.e., the westward traveling surge, and its poleward expansion well into the pre-existing polar cap. By taking advantage of the capability of tracing polar cap arcs and patches over long distances with red line imaging, we are able to trace flow features that strongly affect the substorm bulge across the polar cap for up to ~1-1.5 hr prior to their impacting and affecting the substorm bulge.",

The presentation will describe the Replay methodology in detail, particularly how it differs from nudging and how it relates to the way the underlying MERRA-2 reanalysis was generated. The adaptation made for downscaling consists of modifying Replay to constrain only the longer scales of the flow, while allowing the model to produce its own mesoscale.

            "abstract": "Hudson Bay is a shallow intracratonic basin that partially conceals the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO) in northern Canada. The THO is thought to be a Himalayan-scale Paleoproterozoic orogenic event that was an important component of assembly of the Canadian Shield, marking the collision of the Archean Superior and Western Churchill plates. Until recently, only global and continental-scale seismic tomographic models had imaged the upper-mantle structure of the region, giving a broad but relatively low-resolution picture of the thick lithospheric keel.\nThe Hudson Bay Lithospheric Experiment (HuBLE) investigated the present-day seismic structure beneath Hudson Bay and its surroundings, using a distributed broadband seismograph network installed around the periphery of the Bay and complemented by existing permanent and temporary seismographs further afield. This configuration, though not optimal for body-wave studies which use subvertical arrivals, is well-suited to surface wave tomographic techniques, with many paths crossing the Bay. As there is little seismicity in the region around the Canadian Shield, two-station measurements of teleseismic Rayleigh wave phase velocity formed the principal data set for lithospheric studies. The interstation measurements were combined in a linearized tomographic inversion for maps of phase velocity and azimuthal anisotropy at periods of 20-200 s; these maps were then used to calculate a pseudo-3D anisotropic upper-mantle shear-wavespeed model of the region.\nThe model shows thick (~180-260 km), seismically fast lithosphere across the Hudson Bay region, with a near-vertical ‘curtain’ of lower wavespeeds trending NE-SW across the Bay, likely associated with more juvenile material trapped between the Archean Superior and Churchill continental cores during the THO. The lithosphere is layered, suggesting a 2-stage formation process. Seismic anisotropy patterns vary with depth; a circular pattern in the uppermost mantle wrapping around the Hudson Bay basin is superseded in the lower lithosphere by a pattern that mirrors THO-related structures within the crust; the lower layer thus likely formed when stress patterns related to the THO were still active.",

            "abstract": "Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are characterized by a long dry season when little rain falls. At the same time, many neotropical soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor. Because TDFs are often subject to both water and nutrient constraints, the question of how they will respond to environmental perturbations is both complex and highly interesting. Models, our basic tools for projecting ecosystem responses to global change, can be used to address this question. However, few models have been specifically parameterized for TDFs.\nHere, we present a new version of the Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2) model that includes a new parameterization of TDFs. In particular, we focus on the model’s framework for representing limitation by multiple resources (carbon, water, nitrogen, and phosphorus). Plant functional types are represented in terms of a dichotomy between “acquisitive” and “conservative” resource acquisition strategies. Depending on their resource acquisition strategy and basic stoichiometry, plants can dynamically adjust their allocation to organs (leaves, stem, roots), symbionts (e.g. N2-fixing bacteria), and mycorrhizal fungi.\nSeveral case studies are used to investigate how resource acquisition strategies affect ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations. Results are described in terms of the basic setting (e.g., rich vs. poor soils; longer vs. shorter dry season), and well as the type and magnitude of environmental perturbation (e.g., changes in precipitation or temperature; changes in nitrogen deposition). Implications for ecosystem structure and functioning are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Formation of ammonium and organic nitrogen (ON) species was studied for secondary organic material (SOM) of variable viscosity, ranging from non-liquid to liquid physical states. The SOM was produced as particles of 50 to 150 nm in diameter in aerosol form from six precursors, including three terpenoid and three aromatic species. The viscosity of the hygroscopic SOM was adjusted by exposure to relative humidity (RH) from <5% to >90% RH in steps of 10% at 293 ± 2 K. The aerosol was subsequently exposed to 5 ppm NH3 for mean reaction times of 30, 370, or 5230 s. Ammonium and ON were characterized by high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS). The ammonium-to-organic ratio of mass concentrations (MNH4/MOrg) in the particles increased monotonically from <5% RH to a limiting value at a threshold RH, implicating a switchover in the reaction kinetics from a system limited by diffusivity within the SOM for low RH to one limited by other factors, such as saturated uptake, at higher RH. Formation of ON was observed for aromatic-derived SOMs, but not significant for terpenoid-derived SOMs. For aromatic-derived SOMs, the ON-to-organic ratio of mass concentrations (MON/MOrg) was negligible for RH <20%, increased monotonically from 20% to 60% RH, and stayed constant for RH >60%. The threshold RH for the switchover from kinetically controlled regime to a non-kinetically-controlled one was thus different between formation of ammonium and ON. This difference suggests that water may play a role in the slow reactions of ON formation as a reactant or a catalyst, in addition to affecting the reactant diffusion as in the fast reaction of ammonium formation. The implication is that formation of ammonium salts and organic nitrogen species by certain SOMs should be treated separately in chemical transport models to reflect the different roles of water that may affect the phase state of the SOMs or may act as a reactant or a catalyst.",

As the increasing prevalence of invasive plant species threatens biodiversity, advances in remote sensing technology can help monitor invasive species and their effects on ecosystems and plant communities. To assess whether we could study the effects of invasive species on biodiversity using remote sensing, we asked whether species diversity was positively correlated with spectral diversity, and whether correlations differed among spectral regions along the visible and near-infrared range. To answer these questions, we established community plots in secondary successional fields at the Blandy Experimental Farm in northern Virginia and collected vegetation surveys and ground-level hyperspectral data from 350 to 1025 nm wavelengths. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between spectral diversity and species diversity in the visible ranges of 350-499 nm (Pearson correlation=0.69, p=0.01), 500-589 nm (Pearson=0.64, p=0.03), and 590-674 nm (Pearson=0.70, p=0.01), slight positive correlation in the red edge range of 675-754 nm (Pearson=0.56, p=0.06), and no correlation in the near-infrared ranges of 755-924 nm (Pearson=-0.06, p=0.85) and 925-1025 nm (Pearson=0.30, p=0.34). These differences in correlations across spectral regions may be due to the elements that contribute to signatures in those regions and spectral data transformation methods. To investigate the role of pigment variability in these correlations, we estimated chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin concentrations of five dominant species in the plots using vegetation indices. Although interspecific variability in pigment levels exceeded intraspecific variability, chlorophyll (F value=118) was more varied within species than carotenoids (F=322) and anthocyanins (F=126), perhaps contributing to the lack of correlation between species diversity and spectral diversity in the red edge region. Interspecific differences in pigment levels, however, make it possible to differentiate species remotely.",

            "abstract": "The formation of layered structures is a common feature within many natural system and occur on various scales (planets, Earth's oceans, magma chambers, etc.). Since the knowledge of slab stagnation in the transitions zone of the Earth's mantle the question whether the mantle is or at least has been layered to some degree is still under debate. On this basis we address two important features that lead to layered mantle convection and may affect each other and with this the thermal evolution of the mantle and the evolving heterogeneities. On the one hand we examine a double-diffusive system that is capable of the self-organised formation of layers from a previously non-layered state and on the other hand we incorporate a phase transition. In oder to determine the interaction of double-diffusive layers with a phase transition we carried out numerical simulations ranging from exothermic to endothermic conditions. Taking into account a depth and temperature dependence of the phase transition the results show that on the one hand double-diffusive layering is strongly affected by the presence of phase transition but on the other hand the equilibrium position of the phase transition is shifted depending on the properties of the considered transition. In addition to that we incorporate the chemical dependence of the phase change and determine the influence on the layer growth and the overall dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Using a commercial navigation-grade strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU) for airborne gravimetry can be advantageous in terms of cost, handling, and space consumption compared to the classical stable-platform spring gravimeters. Up to now, however, large sensor errors made it impossible to reach the mGal-level using such type IMUs as they are not designed or optimized for this kind of application. Apart from a proper error-modeling in the filtering process, specific calibration methods that are tailored to the application of aerogravity may help to bridge this gap and to improve their performance. Based on simulations, a quantitative analysis is presented on how much IMU sensor errors, as biases, scale factors, cross couplings, and thermal drifts distort the determination of gravity and the deflection of the vertical (DOV). Several lab and in-field calibration methods are briefly discussed, and calibration results are shown for an iMAR RQH unit. In particular, a thermal lab calibration of its QA2000 accelerometers greatly improved the long-term drift behavior. Latest results from four recent airborne gravimetry campaigns confirm the effectiveness of the calibrations applied, with cross-over accuracies reaching 1.0 mGal (0.6 mGal after cross-over adjustment) and DOV accuracies reaching 1.1 arc seconds after cross-over adjustment.",

One thing to be justified is, however, if the influence of complex 3-D topography can be adequately represented by the embedded 2-D CRMs. In this study, simulations are performed in the presence of a variety of topography with embedded 3-D and 2-D CRMs in a single-column inactive GCM. Through the comparison between these simulations, it is demonstrated that the 2-D representation of topography is able to simulate the statistics of precipitation due to 3-D topography reasonably well as long as the topographic characteristics, such as the mean and standard deviation, are closely recognized. It is also shown that the use of two perpendicular sets of 2-D representations tends to reduce the error due to a 2-D representation.",

            "abstract": "As water in a stream or river flows over ripples and other bedforms, differential surface pressures create bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The oxygen, carbon, and nutrients carried into the bed by the surface water as well as those already existing in the bed material form the basis for microbial communities in the sediment.The resulting dissolved oxygen conditions are a critical control on the ecological function of the hyporheic zone (HZ), from both micro- and macro-biological habitat perspectives. Because hyporheic exchange rates are controlled by surface flow velocity, variations in surface flow have significant impact on the subsurface oxygen conditions. Most rivers are subject to flow velocity variations due to natural forcing including precipitation and variations in evapotranspiration as well as anthropogenic forces like dam releases. We use a large (10m x 0.7m x 0.3m) programmable flume instrumented with a bedform-scale high-resolution planar optode dissolved oxygen imaging system to observe the distribution of oxygenated sediment within the HZ over time. Using this system we characterize the rate at which hyporheic oxygen conditions reconfigure in response to changes in the surface flow velocity, particularly the time it takes for conditions to recover after a pulse of increased flow velocity. In addition, we make use of numerical models to further identify critical response time drivers. With these tools, we develop equations to describe the post-disturbance recovery time as a function of relative pulse magnitude and duration. Using these equations we can predict the time scale over which the hyporheic zone will recover following both natural and anthropogenic flow regime disturbances. Being able to predict the magnitude and duration of dissolved oxygen changes in the wake of flow perturbing events allows us to better understand the impact these disturbances have on the ecology of the hyporheic zone.",

            "abstract": "Satellite ocean color data over the past decade has revealed the existence of large phytoplankton blooms in the North Pacific Ocean - specifically in the region NE of Hawai´I near 30°N. These blooms cover thousands of km2, persist for weeks or longer, and are often dominated by nitrogen-fixing diatom symbioses. These events have proven difficult to study outside of the time series station ALOHA at Hawai´i. The limited data indicates that the 30°N blooms are longer-lived, larger, and occur at a greater temperature range than the blooms that develop closer to Hawai´i. In the NE Pacific, at least some of these blooms occur at or near the subtropical front, a salinity-defined temperature compensated frontal zone that has a number of fronts imbedded in it. Here we will report on the results from the MAGI (Mesoscale features Aggregates Interaction) project. In this project, we deployed a Liquid Robotics SV2 Wave Glider® in June, 2015 for a multiple (up to 6) month mission to sample these features and assist in characterizing the bloom dynamics of this region. The Wave Gliders are the first unmanned autonomous marine robots to use only the ocean's wave energy for propulsion. The gliders are navigated remotely allowing a dynamic route through the keying of unique waypoints. Waypoints can be changed to sample features as they develop in the near-real time satellite imagery.

            "abstract": "By observing the fluctuations in direction and intensity of the Earth’s magnetic field through time, we increase our understanding of the fluid motions in the Earth’s outer core that sustain the geomagnetic field, the geodynamo. Recent archaeomagnetic studies in the Near East have proposed extremely rapid increases - ‘spikes’ - in geomagnetic field intensity ca. 3000 years ago that have proved problematic for our current understanding of core-flow. However, until now, these geomagnetic spikes had not been observed outside of the Near East, where they have been found in metallurgical slag and mud brick walls.\nWe present a new fully-oriented, geomagnetic secular variation and relative palaeointensity (RPI) record for the last 17,000 years from Hall’s Cave, Texas. Sediment washed into the cave has formed a continuous stratigraphic sequence that is at least 3.5 m thick. Within the stable, cool climate of the cave, pedogenic and bioturbation processes are almost non-existent, thereby limiting post-depositional physical and geochemical alteration of the magnetic record. The sub-aerial and subterranean setting of the sedimentary sequence in Hall’s Cave enabled us to collect oriented palaeomagnetic cubes from an excavated section through the sequence.\nThe palaeomagnetic samples yielded high-quality vectors. An age model for the sequence, determined using 57 AMS 14C-dates on individual bones from microvertebrate, was combined with the palaeomagnetic data to construct a secular variation record. The record is in broad agreement with predictions by Holocene field models for the site’s location. However, at ca. 3000 years ago, the RPI data indicate an almost four-fold increase in geomagnetic field intensity lasting several hundred years and contemporaneous with the more short-lived, decadal-scale spikes reported from the Near East. Evidence for this extreme intensity event outside of the Near East has major implications for our current understanding of core-dynamics.",

For geoscientists, this is particularly important due to the vast amount of data collected as part of field work, model studies, or other efforts. While many geoscientists want to ensure their data is appropriately maintained, they are generally not trained in good data management, which, realistically, has a much lower priority in the “publish or perish” cycle of research. Many scientists learn programming or advanced computational and data skills during the process of developing their research. With the amount of digital data being collected in the sciences increasing, and the interest federal funding agencies are taking in ensuring data collected is well maintained, there is pressure to quickly and properly educate and train geoscientists on its management. At the University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder), Research Data Services (RDS) has developed several educational and outreach activities centered at training researchers and students in ways to properly manage their data, including “boot camps”, workshops, individual consultations, and seminars with topics of interest to the CU-Boulder community. Part of this effort is centered at incentivizing the researcher to learn these tools and practices despite their busy schedule. Much of this incentive has come through small grant competitions at the university level. The two competitions most relevant are a new “Best Digital Data Management Plan” competition, awarding unrestricted funds to the best plan submitted in each of five categories, and an added data management plan requirement to an existing faculty competition. This presentation will focus on examples of user outreach and educational opportunities given to researchers at CU-Boulder, incentives given to the researchers to participate, and assessment of the impact of these activities.",

            "abstract": "Since 2013, airborne lidar surveys have been performed throughout the melt season at near-weekly intervals over the 1,400 km2 Tuolumne River Basin in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, with the goal of deriving high-resolution measurements of snow depth and reflectance for the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). Since the beginning of the campaign, a distributed, physically-based snow model (iSnobal) has been used to estimate the spatial snow density distribution critical for providing accurate SWE products to water managers downstream. An important feature of iSnobal is the ability to stop and then restart using an initialization image constructed from the results of the prior time step. This work examines the effect of assimilating the ASO lidar-derived snow depths to guide the modeled density distribution, since precipitation has been found to be the most difficult parameter to distribute over large mountain basins. Results indicate that the initial model update for each winter is the most significant, with subsequent updates in the absence of severe spring storms having increasingly smaller impacts on the total modeled basin water storage. However, the unprecedented temporal resolution of the ASO lidar surveys provide new insight into the springtime evolution of a large basin snowpack and immensely improve melt timing predictions, which are becoming more and more vital for reservoir management in a changing climate.",

We fit analytical scattering phase function to Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft observations of Jupiter at 0.64 μm and Saturn at 0.64 and 0.44 μm and to Cassini spacecraft observations of Jupiter at 0.938 μm atmospheric window, 0.889 μm CH4 absorption band, and 0.258 μm UV filter. Using scattering ray-tracing model of a planet by Dyudina et al. (2005)*, the images of the planets with different scattering properties are simulated to calculate the reflected luminosity as it varies with scattering phase to produce full-orbit light curves. We compare the light curve shapes and total reflection integrated in all directions (spherical albedos) for Jupiter and Saturn with the ones for planets with Lambertian and semi-infinite Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere. Saturn-like and especially Jupiter-like atmosphere produces light curves that are several times fainter at half-phase than does a Lambertian planet, given the same brightness at transit. The spherical albedo (and hence the wavelengh-integrated Bond albedo) is lower than for a Lambertian planet. Corresponding absorption of the stellar light and planet’s heating rate would be higher than estimated for Lambertian planets, especially for bright planets. In extreme case of Jupiter-like scattering at 0.64 μm Lambertian assumption can overestimate spherical albedo by a factor of ∼1.5. We will discuss how the light curves and absorption for planets covered by atmospheres would differ from the light curves of rocky planet without atmosphere.\n* Dyudina, U.

            "abstract": "Most of my career has been spent analyzing data from research projects in the atmospheric sciences. I spent twelve years researching boundary layer interactions in the polar regions, which included five field seasons in the Antarctic. During this time, I got both a M.S. and Ph.D. in atmospheric science. I learned most of my data science and programming skills throughout this time as part of my research projects. When I graduated with my Ph.D., I was looking for a new and fresh opportunity to enhance the skills I already had while learning more advanced technical skills. I found a position at the University of Colorado Boulder as a Data Research Specialist with Research Computing, a group that provides cyber infrastructure services, including high-speed networking, large-scale data storage, and supercomputing, to university students and researchers. My position is the perfect merriment between advanced technical skills and “softer” skills, while at the same time understanding exactly what the busy scientist needs to understand about their data. I have had the opportunity to help shape our university’s data education system, a development that is still evolving. This presentation will detail my career story, the lessons I have learned, my daily work in my new position, and some of the exciting opportunities that opened up in my new career.",

            "abstract": "The high Nd isotope ratios of North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW, εNd ~ -4) have been difficult to reconcile with the eolian inputs as reflected in surface waters (e.g. Jones et al. 2008 EPSL), which have much lower εNd (~ -10), indicating potential addition of volcanic component. In order to constrain the Nd sources in the North Pacific, we measured εNd on seawater from 5 stations across the North Pacific sampled by the INOPEX Cruise (2009).\nBelow ~ 2000m, measured εNd values in the North Pacific match previously published data and correspond with NPDW values. Easternmost Sta. 32 (45.5°N 158.5°W) shows higher εNd (~ -3) than corresponding potential density (ρ) layers of other stations. This may indicate addition of a high-εNd source from Aleutians-Kamchatka volcanic margin along the transport path of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) from westernmost Sta. 44 (39.8°N 152.4°E) to Sta. 32. As a result, NPDW at Sta. 32, formed from the LCDW, also shows higher εNd than the other stations.\nAbove ~ 2000m, samples at Sta. 5 (52.7°N 164.9°E) near the Aleutian-Kamchatka intersection have higher εNd than corresponding density layers of other stations, consistent with higher contributions from regional volcanoes. From the surface to ρ = 27.17 (250 - 750m, depending on location), a peak of εNd ~ -1.4 at ~ 100m (ρ = 26.56) at Sta. 5 coincides with a peak of dissolved 232Th, which indicates high lithogenic input from the Aleutian-Kamchatka margin (Hayes et al. 2014 EPSL). Thus the εNd peak likely reflects the remineralization of volcanic ash. εNd values of Sta. 32, 39 (38.0°N 164.5°E), 41 (38.4°N 160.3°E), and 44 generally increase with increasing density over this interval. Since the surface εNd at these stations (-4.8 to -4.0) indicates eolian dust input from the Asian deserts, an explanation for the increasing εNd is that the addition of a high-εNd volcanic source prevails over the remineralization of eolian desert dusts.\nOur results are consistent with contributions to the high εNd in North Pacific seawater from volcanic margins. [Nd] and REE will be analyzed to further investigate the Nd sources.",

Responsible and efficient use of the subsurface poses many challenges, many of which require the capability to monitor and manipulate sub-surface stress, fractures, and fluid flow at all scales. Adaptive control of subsurface fractures and flow is a multi-disciplinary challenge that, if achieved, has the potential to transform all subsurface energy strategies. As part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s SubTER (Subsurface Technology and Engineering Research development and demonstration) initiative, a multi-National Laboratory team is developing next-generation approaches that will allow for adaptive control of subsurface fractures and flow. SubTER has identified an initial suite of technical thrust areas to focus work, and has initiated a number of small projects. This presentation will describe early progress associated with the SubTER technical topic areas of wellbore integrity, subsurface stress and induced seismicity, permeability manipulation and new subsurface signals. It will also describe SubTER plans, and provide a venue to solicit suggestions and discuss potential partnerships associated with future research directions.",

            "abstract": "This presentation reports a ‘large-sample’ (2050 watersheds from around the world) intercomparison of 2 CRR model structures (GRX and MRX, both used for many research & operational applications), using a multi-objective evaluation process and two-way split-sample testing. The watershed sample represents a diversity of hydro-meteorological and measurement contexts thereby lending confidence and statistical robustness to the analyses and inferences drawn therefrom (Gupta et al., 2014). Overall, our results indicate that:\n(i) The GRX and MRX models both provide similar levels of long-term (aggregate) performance during calibration and evaluation (as assessed by the various metrics computed). Hence, their simulations (and biases) are strongly correlated.\n(ii) Both models suffer from a lack of robustness when simulating water balance and streamflow variability, although simulation of streamflow timing and rate of change is quite good (as indicated by the long-term linear correlation between observed and simulated time-series).\n(iii) The MRX model tends to provide better and more robust reproduction of short-term processes than the GRX model (as indicated by the distributions of short-term linear correlations between observed and simulated time-series).\n(iv) Model performance variations from one period to another appear to be mainly due to temporal variations in the hydro-meteorological properties of the period.\n(v) The use of KGE (Gupta et al., 2009) as an objective function tends to reduce long-term process model bias (on average), which is not the case with NSE (Nash & Sutcliffe, 1970).\nFurther, our results clearly show that sub-period variability in model performance can be quite high (especially for water balance), and that aggregate long-term (full period) statistics can tend to over-estimate true predictive performance of a hydrologic model. Our preliminary results indicate that there may be value in computing and examining distributions of the various model performance metrics over sub-period samples, instead of relying upon a single period-average deterministic value. This could greatly improve model diagnosis by helping to reveal situations involving model structural inadequacy, non-stationarity of hydro-meteorological processes and/or problems with measurement data.",

            "abstract": "Gravity Waves (GWs) play an important role in both the formation and destruction of polar mesospheric clouds. In summer, while vertically propagating GWs induce a residual circulation that cools the summer mesosphere and therefore supports the formation of PMCs, observation and modeling studies have also shown that short period GWs can additionally destroy PMCs. In this study we analyze the effect of non-vertical propagation of GWs on PMCs using temperature data from the SABER instrument on TIMED satellite and PMC occurrence frequency from the CIPS instrument on the AIM satellite. During the 2007 PMC season, time series of GWs over the monsoon region at 50 km and PMCs over the polar region at 84 km have a correlation coefficient of 0.9. SABER GW amplitude and momentum flux over the monsoon region show a poleward tilt with altitude. This slanted structure suggests a poleward, but non-vertical, propagation of GWs facilitated by the easterly winds associated with the monsoon circulation, thus indicating a possible source of high latitude middle atmospheric GWs.",

            "abstract": "The remarkable navigational ability of homing pigeons (Columba livia) is influenced by a number of factors, an unknown one of which causes the \"Wintereffekt\"1 or annual variation in homing performance. Minima in homeward orientation and return speeds have been observed in winter, with maxima in summer, during repetitive pigeon releases from single sites near experimental lofts in Wilhelmshaven, Göttingen, and Munich, Germany, and near Pisa, Italy1-4. Overall the annual variation is more pronounced in northern Germany than Italy4, and both mature and juvenile cohorts respond to this seasonal factor. Older, more experienced pigeons are better at compensating for its effects than naïve ones, but are still affected after numerous releases. The narrow low-frequency band of atmospheric background noise (microbaroms; 0.1-0.3 Hz) also varies with an annual cycle that generally has higher amplitudes in winter than in summer depending on location5. In addition, homing pigeons, and possibly other birds, apparently use infrasonic signals of similar frequency as navigational cues6, and a seasonal variation in background noise levels could cause corresponding changes in signal-to-noise ratios and thus in homing performance. The annual variation in homing performance, however, was not observed during long-term pigeon releases at two sites in eastern North America. The annual and geographic variability in homing performance in the northern hemisphere can be explained to a first order by seasonal changes in infrasonic noise sources related to ocean storm activity, and to the direction and intensity of stratospheric winds. In addition, increased dispersion in departure bearings of individual birds for some North American releases were likely caused by additional infrasonic noise associated with severe weather events during tornado and Atlantic hurricane seasons.\n1Kramer, G. & von Saint Paul, U., J.

            "abstract": "Aerial- and ground-based photography can provide valuable information about coastal environments in space and time including the presence or absence of shorefast ice, beach characteristics and morphology, high-water indicators produced during storm surge events, bluff failure mechanisms, and habitat identification. Recent advances in digital photogrammetry and construction of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms allow for improved mapping and analysis of coastal change in 3-dimensions at a relatively low cost. For example, analyses can include delineating shorelines based on a tidal datum, mapping inundation extent based on a known or modeled flood level, or quantifying volumetric change. Repeat aerial surveys and associated orthophoto and DEM construction serve as a powerful monitoring tool that can provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for coastal change.\nAlong the extensive and remote coast of Alaska, high-quality imagery and elevation data are rare, in part because traditional methods of acquiring the data are cost prohibitive. Here we evaluate the usefulness of data sets acquired using small aircraft and SfM techniques for evaluating seasonal change to the beach and permafrost bluffs at Barter Island, Alaska during the summer of 2014. Considerable bluff retreat and morphological change were measured along a 2.7 km stretch of coast with net mean volume loss of approximately 28,000 ± 540 m3 between the top and the base of the bluffs. The pattern of change was dominantly landward retreat of the top of the bluffs and removal of the debris fan at the base of the bluffs. Barrier-spit overwash and migration and deposition of storm berms were also observed and accurately measured. Our results suggest that this is a cost-effective method for mapping coastal change in remote environments leading to a similar data acquisition effort for the State of Alaska, primarily for shoreline and coastal hazard mapping purposes, along a major section of the western coast of Alaska in 2015.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of future drought characteristics is difficult as climate models usually have bias in simulating precipitation frequency and intensity. To overcome this limitation, output from climate models need to be bias corrected based on the specific purpose of applications. In this study, we examine the significance of bias correction in the context of drought frequency and scenario analysis using output from climate models. In particular, we investigate the performance of three widely used bias correction techniques: (1) monthly bias correction (MBC), (2) nested bias correction (NBC), and (3) equidistance quantile mapping (EQM) The effect of bias correction in future scenario of drought frequency is also analyzed. The characteristics of drought are investigated in terms of frequency and severity in nine representative locations in different climatic regions across the United States using regional climate model (RCM) output from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is used as the means to compare and forecast drought characteristics at different timescales. Systematic biases in the RCM precipitation output are corrected against the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data. The results demonstrate that bias correction significantly decreases the RCM errors in reproducing drought frequency derived from the NARR data. Preserving mean and standard deviation is essential for climate models in drought frequency analysis. RCM biases both have regional and timescale dependence. Different timescale of input precipitation in the bias corrections show similar results. Drought frequency obtained from the RCM future (2040-2070) scenarios is compared with that from the historical simulations. The changes in drought characteristics occur in all climatic regions. The relative changes in drought frequency in future scenario in relation to historical simulations when both scenarios (historical and future) are bias corrected are similar to when both are not bias corrected. Our study show that the potential changes in drought frequency vary from +51 % to -57 %.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s lower thermosphere is an important interface region between the neutral atmosphere and the “space weather” environment. While the high-latitude region of the thermosphere responds promptly to energy inputs, relatively little is known about the global/regional response to these energy inputs. Global temperatures are predicted to respond within 3-6 hours, but the details of the thermal response of the atmosphere as energy transports away from high-latitude source regions is not well understood. The Optical Profiling of the Atmospheric Limb (OPAL) mission aims to characterize this thermal response through observation of the temperature structure of the lower thermosphere at mid- and low-latitudes.\nThe OPAL instrument is designed to map global thermospheric temperature variability over the critical “thermospheric gap” region (~100-140 km altitude) by spectroscopic analysis of molecular oxygen A-band emission (758 – 768 nm). The OPAL instrument is a grating-based imaging spectrometer with refractive optics and a high-efficiency volume holographic grating (VHG). The scene is sampled by 7 parallel slits that form non-overlapping spectral profiles at the focal plane with resolution of 0.5 nm (spectral), 1.5 km (limb profiling), and 60 km (horizontal sampling). A CCD camera at the instrument focal plane delivers low noise and high sensitivity. The instrument is designed to strongly reject stray light from daylight regions of the earth.\nThe OPAL mission is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CubeSat-based Science Missions for Geospace and Atmospheric Research program. The OPAL instrument, CubeSat bus and mission are being designed, built and executed by a team comprised of students and professors from Utah State University, Dixie State University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, with support from professional scientists and engineers from the Space Dynamics Laboratory and Hawk Institute for Space Science.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) is a model of the trajectory of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (Kay et al. (2013, 2015)). ForeCAT models a CME as a torus, calculates magnetic pressure and tension forces and drag at grid points along the CME, and integrates these forces to calculate a complete trajectory. To do so, ForeCAT must assume models of CME mass and size evolution. Kay et al. (2015b) demonstrated that when approximating CME mass as constant and using observed angular widths to determine CME size evolution, ForeCAT successfully replicates the observed trajectory of the 2008 December 12 CME. Here, we use ForeCAT to replicate the observed trajectory of the 2010 August 14 CME assuming constant mass and constant angular width. We also find that ForeCAT can reproduce the observed trajectory when we assume an increasing mass with distance as the CME propagates, and when assuming a changing angular width. Under each of these assumptions, we calculate the reduced chi-squared between simulated and observed latitudes to constrain CME parameters such as drag coefficient, initial latitude and longitude, and initial speed of the CME. With this exploration we show that ForeCAT can constrain tightly the initial parameters of the CME in the low corona.",

            "abstract": "Since the Copenhagen accord in 2009, several countries have affirmed their commitment to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The United States and Canada committed to reduce their emissions by 17% below 2005 levels, by 2020, Europe by 14% and China by ~40%. To achieve such targets, coherent and effective strategies in mitigating atmospheric carbon emissions must be implemented in the next decades. Whether such goals are actually achieved, they require that reductions are \"measurable\", \"reportable\", and \"verifiable”. Management of greenhouse gas emissions must focus on urban environments since ~74% of CO2 emissions worldwide will be from cities, while measurement approaches are highly uncertain (~50% to >100%). The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) was established to develop, assess and improve top-down and bottom-up quantifications of urban greenhouse gas emissions. Based on an aircraft mass balance approach, we performed a series of experiments focused on the improvement of CO2, CH4 and CO emission rates quantification from Indianapolis, our final objective being to drastically improve the method overall uncertainty from the previous estimate of 50%. In November-December 2014, we conducted nine methodologically identical mass balance experiments in a short period of time (24 days, one downwind distance) for assumed constant total emission rate conditions, as a means to obtain an improved standard deviation of the mean determination. By averaging the individual emission rate determinations, we were able to obtain a method precision of 17% and 16% for CO2 and CO, respectively, at the 95%C.L. CH4 emission rates are highly variable day to day, leading to precision of 60%. Our results show that repetitive sampling can enable improvement in precision of the aircraft top-down methods through averaging.",

            "abstract": "Projected responses of forest ecosystems to warming and drying associated with 21st century climate change vary widely from resiliency to widespread dieback. A major shortcoming of current vegetation models is the inability to account for mortality of overstory trees during extreme drought due to uncertainties in mechanisms and thresholds. In this talk, I discuss two modeling efforts to predict drought-induced tree mortality in the western United States. In the first, we identify a lethal drought threshold in the loss of vascular transport capacity from xylem cavitation, which provides insight into what initiates mortality, in Populus tremuloides in the southwestern United States. We then use the hydraulic-based threshold to produce a hindcast of a drought-induced forest dieback and compare predictions against three independent regional mortality datasets. The hydraulic threshold predicted major regional patterns of tree mortality with high accuracy based on field plots and mortality maps derived from Landsat imagery. Climate model simulations project increasing drought stress in this region that exceeds the observed mortality threshold in the high emissions scenario by the 2050s, likely triggering further widespread diebacks. In the second approach, we build a dynamic plant hydraulic model into a land-surface model and compare predictions against observed mortality patterns across multiple species. These methods provide powerful and tractable approaches for incorporating tree mortality into vegetation models to resolve uncertainty over the fate of forest ecosystems in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The devastating 2011 magnitude 9.1 Tohoku earthquake and the resulting shaking and tsunami were much larger than anticipated in earthquake hazard maps. Because this and all other earthquakes that caused ten or more fatalities in Japan since 1979 occurred in places assigned a relatively low hazard, Geller (2011) argued that “all of Japan is at risk from earthquakes, and the present state of seismological science does not allow us to reliably differentiate the risk level in particular geographic areas,” so a map showing uniform hazard would be preferable to the existing map. Defenders of the maps countered by arguing that these earthquakes are low-probability events allowed by the maps, which predict the levels of shaking that should expected with a certain probability over a given time. Although such maps are used worldwide in making costly policy decisions for earthquake-resistant construction, how well these maps actually perform is unknown. We explore this hotly-contested issue by comparing how well a 510-year-long record of earthquake shaking in Japan is described by the Japanese national hazard (JNH) maps, uniform maps, and randomized maps. Surprisingly, as measured by the metric implicit in the JNH maps, i.e. that during the chosen time interval the predicted ground motion should be exceeded only at a specific fraction of the sites, both uniform and randomized maps do better than the actual maps. However, using as a metric the squared misfit between maximum observed shaking and that predicted, the JNH maps do better than uniform or randomized maps. These results indicate that the JNH maps are not performing as well as expected, that what factors control map performance is complicated, and that learning more about how maps perform and why would be valuable in making more effective policy.",

            "abstract": "Health effects studies of aerosol pollution have been extended spatially using data assimilation techniques that combine surface PM2.5 concentrations and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from satellite retrievals. While most of these models were developed for the dark-vegetated eastern U.S. they are being used in the semi-arid western U.S. to remotely sense atmospheric aerosol concentrations. These models are helpful to understand the spatial variability of surface PM2.5concentrations in the western U.S. because of the sparse network of surface monitoring stations. However, the models developed for the eastern U.S. are not robust in the western U.S. due to different aerosol formation mechanisms, transport phenomena, and optical properties. This region is a challenge because of complex terrain, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, secondary organic aerosol formation, smoke from wildfires, and low background aerosol concentrations.\nThis research concentrates on the use and evaluation of satellite remote sensing to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations from AOD satellite retrievals over California and Nevada during the summer months of 2012 and 2013. The aim of this investigation is to incorporate a spatial statistical model that uses AOD from AERONET as well as MODIS, surface PM2.5 concentrations, and land-use regression to characterize spatial surface PM2.5 concentrations. The land use regression model uses traditional inputs (e.g. meteorology, population density, terrain) and non-traditional variables (e.g. FIre Inventory from NCAR (FINN) emissions and MODIS albedo product) to account for variability related to smoke plume trajectories and land use. The results will be used in a spatially resolved health study to determine the association between wildfire smoke exposure and cardiorespiratory health endpoints. This relationship can be used with future projections of wildfire emissions related to climate change and droughts to quantify the expected health impact.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic features aligned along a linear graben in southeastern Mare Serenitatis (19°N, 27.5°E) on the Moon resemble a series of effusive basaltic landforms erupted along the Inferno Chasm rift zone within Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (COTM), Idaho (42°58’00”N, 113°11’25”W). This region in Idaho is the type-locale for terrestrial plains-style volcanism. Examples of lunar plains-style volcanism have previously been described within Orientale Basin at Lacus Veris and Lacus Autumni, but this eruption style has not been used to describe the site in Mare Serenitatis. The SSERVI FINESSE team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Science and Exploration) has documented the features along Inferno Chasm rift using a LiDAR, Differential Global Positioning Systems, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to compare with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow-Angle Camera images and digital terrain models. The region in southeastern Mare Serenitatis provides one of the best concentrations of features representative of lunar plains-style volcanism. On the Moon, these features include a cone (Osiris), a flat-topped dome, a rille-like channel (Isis), a vent, and a possible perched lava pond. In Idaho, the analog features include a dome (Grand View Crater), a rille-like channel (Inferno Chasm), vents (Cottrells Blowout, Horse Butte), and a perched lava pond (Papadakis). Both the scale and morphology of the features on the Moon are similar to the features in Idaho. For example, the channel in Isis is ~3 km long, 283 m-wide, and 25 m deep compared to Inferno Chasm which is ~1.7 km long, 100 m wide, and 20 m deep. The slope of the channel in Isis is -1.2°, while the channel in Inferno Chasm has a slope of -0.33°. The alignment of landforms on the Moon and Idaho are both consistent with dike emplacement. Observations of the flow stratigraphy for features in Idaho will inform the potential eruption conditions of the individual features on the Moon.",

            "abstract": "Canopy reflectance can be useful indicator of crop health status. Canopy stress index (CSI) is usually expressed as canopy temperature minus air temperature, and this value is higher and a positive number in a well irrigated wheat field. Three main environmental variables constructing CSI are: plant canopy temperature (Tc), air temperature (Ta) and atmospheric vapor pressure deficiency (VPD). CSI is effected by biological and environmental factors such as soil water status, wind speed, evapotranspiration, conduction systems, plant metabolism, air temperature, relative humidity, etc. which all influence on final yield. This paper aims to investigate the relation of CSI calculated by Landsat images and wheat yield. So, eighteen wheat fields were selected for two years (2009 and 2010) and 5 Landsat images (TM and ETM+) from April to Jun were used to monitor field status in each year. Tc was calculated by applying single-channel method and VPD was computed from Tc, air temperature and humidity. Each single Landsat bands and CSI were defined as the descriptor variables. Relation between wheat yield and the descriptors was assessed by means of linear correlation. The results of stepwise correlation depicted that band 1 (blue) and 3 (red) had the most correlations to yield until grain filling stage. This reflects the importance of photosynthesis rate which absorb blue and red wavelength during mentioned period. This two bands also could capture yield changes (r2=0.77). However, during grain filling period CSI was the only descriptor determining yield volatility (r2=0.85). Low temperature is one of the key factors which increase remobilization of carbohydrate to grain. Therefore, grain yield in the canopy which has less temperature in compared to air temperature would be higher than others.",

            "abstract": "A lot of efforts have been made over the last few decades to quantify the amount of carbon stored in soils, including in peat-producing systems. Estimates of soil carbon storage at the landscape scale has to take into account all buried carbon pools, including deep-buried lake sediments found under many peatlands that formed by terrestrialization. To illustrate the importance of buried lake sediments in the overall carbon storage of a peatland site, we studied a small peat swamp located in Gatineau Park (Quebec, Canada), the Folly peatland (45°27’18.12”N 75°46’57.38’’W). This 7 ha peatland developed from a small lake that appeared after the postglacial Champlain Sea receded from the region, about 12 200 years ago. Its development followed a classical terrestrialization sequence and its hydrology has been stable since peat inception. A profile of over 8.5 m of organic matter was collected at the site, of which 2.5 m is peat and the rest is composed of lake sediments (gyttja). With the exception of a few tephra layers, the organic matter content exceeds 75 % of dry weight for the entire profile. Although it constitutes only 30 % of the profile depth, peat contains 48 % of the buried carbon because of its higher bulk density, and peat carbon accumulated at a rate of 88 g C m-2 yr-1. Overall, the site carbon density (including buried lake sediments) is 172 kg C m-2, a value comparable to the carbon density of many peatlands with much deeper peat profiles. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of global peatland carbon inventories and peatland biogeochemistry.",

This work compares Hotplate, weighing sensor (ETI NOAH-II) and manual measurements of liquid-equivalent depth. The main field site was at low altitude in western New York; Hotplate and ETI comparisons were also made at two forested subalpine sites in southeastern Wyoming. The manual measurement (only conducted at the New York site) was derived by weighing snow cores sampled from a snow board. The two recording gauges (Hotplate and ETI) were located within 5 m of the snow board. Hotplate-derived accumulations were corrected using a wind-speed dependent catch efficiency and the ETI orifice was heated and alter shielded. Three important findings are evident from the comparisons: 1) The Yes-derived accumulations, recorded in a user-accessible file, were compared to accumulations derived using an in-house calibration and fundamental measurements (plate power, long and shortwave radiances, wind speed, and temperature). These accumulations are highly correlated (N=24; r2=0.99), but the YES-derived values are larger by 20%. 2) The in-house Hotplate accumulations are in good agreement with ETI-based accumulations but with larger variability (N=24; r2=0.88). 3) The comparison of in-house Hotplate accumulation versus manual accumulation, expressed as mm of liquid, exhibits a fitted linear relationship Y (in-house) versus X (manual) given by Y = -0.2 (±1.4) + 0.9 (±0.1) · X (N= 20; r2=0.89).

The BU Mars Ionospheric Model (BUMIM) uses a neutral atmospheric profile and a solar irradiance spectrum to generate ionospheric density profiles [Matta, 2013]. BUMIM simulations, tuned for MAVEN observing conditions, will be compared with IUVS and NGIMS measurements of ion densities. Comparisons of the instrument results are discussed for insights on inter-instrument verification and technique validation. Data-model comparisons will be used to interpret ionospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The topic of extreme weather and climate is very broad. One can easily list a dozen different types of atmospheric extreme phenomena. In addition, some extreme phenomena have multiple types of extremes as well as categories of extremes. The first US CLIVAR working group on extremes (EWG) chose to narrow the extreme phenomena to temperature and precipitation extremes having a time scale of a few days to a week. The primary extremes considered were short term heat waves, cold air outbreaks, and extreme precipitation not from tropical cyclones. All of these have produced multi-billion dollar losses in recent years. Even this subset of extremes is very broad, so additional focus was placed upon the large scale meteorological patterns (LSMPs) that accompany these extremes. This working group was most active from its inception in 2012 until its nominal ending in 2015. Additional work continues, including follow-on activities spawned or informed by the EWG. In this talk, the EWG activities are summarized in four areas: data for extremes, statistical analyses applicable to extremes, synoptic-dynamics of these extremes, and simulation of these extremes in climate models. The emphasis will be upon knowledge gaps and recommended further actions in these four areas. The recommendations span basic science through applications. The EWG participation included input into the US CLIVAR science plan, as one of the four research challenges there being ‘extremes’. A scientific session at this AGU meeting was a direct outgrowth of the EWG 2013 workshop. Other follow-on work includes consultation with various national and international efforts in extremes. Finally, some possible future applications of the EWG efforts, such as adequate datasets and climate model diagnostic tools, will be mentioned that may inform providers of information having direct interest to end-users.",

            "abstract": "Long-lived encrusting coralline algae yield robust reconstructions of mid-to-high latitude environmental change from their annually-banded high-magnesium calcite skeleton. The magnesium to calcium ratio measured in their skeleton reflects ambient seawater temperature at the time of formation. Thus, reconstructions from these algae are important to understanding the role of natural modes of climate variability versus that of external carbon dioxide in controlling climate in data sparse regions such as the northern North Pacific Ocean/southern Bering Sea. Here, we reconstruct regional seawater temperature from the skeletons of nine algae specimens from two islands in the Aleutian Archipelago. We find that seawater temperature increased ~1.4°C degrees over the past 350 years. The detrended seawater reconstruction correlates with storminess because storms moving across the North Pacific Ocean bring warmer water to the archipelago. Comparison of the algal seawater temperature reconstruction with instrumental and terrestrial proxy reconstructions reveals that atmospheric teleconnections to North America via the North Pacific storm tracks are not robust before the 20th century. This indicates that North Pacific climate processes inferred from the instrumental records should be cautiously extrapolated when describing earlier non-analogous climates or future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity is not a problem just for the developing world. In California, legislators are currently proposing a $7.5 billion emergency water plan to their voters; and U.S. federal officials last year warned residents of Arizona and Nevada that they could face cuts in Colorado River water deliveries in 2016.\nIrrigation techniques, industrial and residential habits combined with climate change lie at the root of the problem. But despite what appears to be an insurmountable problem, it is possible to turn the situation around and significantly reduce water scarcity in over next 35 years.\nWe identify outline strategies in six key areas that they believe can be combined in different ways in different parts of the world in order to effectively reduce water stress. (Water stress occurs in an area where more than 40% of the available water from rivers is unavailable because it is already being used – a situation that currently affects about a third of the global population, and may affect as many as half the people in the world by the end of the century if the current pattern of water use continues).\nWe separate six key strategy areas for reducing water stress into “hard path” measures, involving building more reservoirs and increasing desalination efforts of sea water, and “soft path” measures that focus on reducing water demand rather than increasing water supply thanks to community-scale efforts and decision-making, combining efficient technology and environmental protection. While there are some economic, cultural and social factors that may make certain of the “soft path” measures such as population control difficult, the “soft path” measures offer the more realistic path forward in terms of reducing water stress by 2050.",

            "abstract": "Scientific data acquisition in the field is often constrained by data transfer backchannels to analysis environments. Geoscientists are therefore facing practical bottlenecks with increasing sensor density and variety. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, offer promising solutions to key problems in scientific data acquisition, pre-processing, and validation by providing advanced capabilities in the field. This is due to affordable network connectivity options and the increasing mobile computational power.\nThis contribution exemplifies a scenario faced by scientists in the field and presents the \"Mahali TEC Processing App\" developed in the context of the NSF-funded Mahali project. Aimed at atmospheric science and the study of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC), this app is able to gather data from various dual-frequency GPS receivers. It demonstrates parsing of full-day RINEX files on mobile devices and on-the-fly computation of vertical TEC values based on satellite ephemeris models that are obtained from NASA. Our experiments show how parallel computing on the mobile device GPU enables fast processing and visualization of up to 2 million datapoints in real-time using OpenGL. GPS receiver bias is estimated through minimum TEC approximations that can be interactively adjusted by scientists in the graphical user interface. Scientists can also perform approximate computations for \"quickviews\" to reduce CPU processing time and memory consumption. In the final stage of our mobile processing pipeline, scientists can upload data to the cloud for further processing.\nAcknowledgements: The Mahali project (http://mahali.mit.edu) is funded by the NSF INSPIRE grant no.

            "abstract": "Transpiration is commonly conceptualised as a fraction of some potential rate, determined by stomatal or canopy resistance. Therefore, so-called \"atmospheric evaporative demand\" or “potential evaporation” is generally used alongside with precipitation and soil moisture to characterise the environmental conditions that affect plant water use. An increase in potential evaporation (e.g. due to climate change) is generally believed to cause increased transpiration and/or vegetation water stress, aggravating drought effects. In the present study, we investigated the question whether potential evaporation constitutes a meaningful reference for transpiration and compared sensitivity of potential evaporation and leaf transpiration to atmospheric forcing. Based on modelling results and supporting experimental evidence, we conclude that stomatal resistance cannot be parameterised as a factor relating transpiration to potential evaporation, as the ratio between transpiration and potential evaporation not only varies with stomatal resistance, but also with wind speed, air temperature, irradiance and relative humidity. Furthermore, the effect of wind speed in particular implies increase in potential evaporation, which is commonly interpreted as increased “water stress”, but at the same time can reduce leaf transpiration, implying a decrease in water demand at the leaf scale. In fact, in a range of field measurements, we found that water use efficiency (WUE, carbon uptake per water transpired) commonly increases with increasing wind speed, enabling plants to conserve water during photosynthesis. We estimate that the observed global decrease in terrestrial near-surface wind speeds could have reduced WUE at a magnitude similar to the increase in WUE attributed to global rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. We conclude that trends in wind speed and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have to be considered explicitly for the estimation of drought effects on plants.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of organic maturity on the elastic properties of kerogen, and then model its effect on the rock elastic responses. To fulfill this objective, we present a workflow that combines nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (nanoSIMS), nanoindentation, SEM, ex situ maturation experiments, RockEval analysis and Self-Consistent modeling (SC).\nFirst, we used SEM and nanoSIMS to identify the organic rich-kerogen bodies. NanoSIMS provided maps of the secondary ion intensity distribution of H-, C- and O- which show a uniform distribution of these ions within the immature kerogen body. The measured H- /C- and O-/C- ionic intensity ratios range between 1.40 ±0.86 -1.69 ±0.61 and 0.77 ±0.72 - 1.04 ±0.44 respectively.\nNext, we used the nanoindentation technique to measure the elastic properties of an immature Green River kerogen, which had an average bulk modulus (K) of 3.11 ± 0.23 GPa. Then, we induced maturation using a High Temperature-High Pressure vessel that mimics reservoir conditions. Ex situ maturation resulted in a strong hydrocarbon smell, oil staining, and the expulsion of an oil-like viscous fluid. Geochemical analysis confirmed that the sample had successfully matured to the oil window. SEM time-lapse images show porosity (ϕ) development within the kerogen and surrounding matrix as a result of maturation.\nOnce maturation was complete, we re-measured the elastic properties of the kerogen in the sample using the same nanoindentation technique. The average value of K of the mature kerogen (oil window) was 3.65 ±0.67 GPa. Therefore, we conclude that changes in the elastic properties of solid kerogen in the oil window are negligible. However, ϕ development within the kerogen, the shape of kerogen and its pores, and the presence of fluid can affect the composite rock stiffness.\nTherefore, we used SC modeling to investigate the effect of ϕ development within the kerogen associated with ex situ maturation, on the elastic properties of the porous kerogen and the rock composite. Our results show that the increase in kerogen ϕ and the presence of fluid during the oil and gas generation scenarios cause a -6% and -44% change in the kerogen effective K. The model indicates that the increase in kerogen ϕ during oil and gas generation causes the rock\nK to decrease by 2% and 5% respectively.",

            "abstract": "It is now known unambiguously that wind-driven bedform activity is occurring on Mars today. It has also been demonstrated the rapid aeolian abrasion of sedimentary deposits that potentially host ancient habitable environments may provide the best mechanism for exposing samples containing relatively undegraded organics (Farley et al. 2014). Thus, current processes operating on the surface of Mars are highly relevant to our understanding of the past.\nHere, we discuss new sand flux results of active dune across Mars, including several current and candidate landing sites with Meridiani Planum, Gale crater, Valles Marineris, and Mawrth Vallis. For this task, we have utilized multi-temporal images acquired annually by the HiRISE camera (25 cm/pixel) along with co-located HiRISE Digital Terrain Models.\nFalling dunes in Coprates Chasma (Mars 2020 candidate landing site) measuring 6–10 meters in height were detected migrating on average 0.5 m per Earth year, yielding crest fluxes of 3.1 m3 m-1 yr-1 (units hereafter assumed). Barchans near the MSL rover at Gale crater have slightly lower fluxes of 1.2, while earlier work in Endeavour crater, the current site of the Opportunity Rover, showed dome dunes with fluxes as high as 13 (average of 6.8; Chojnacki et al. 2015). New results of Mawrth Vallis (Mars 2020 candidate) dunes suggest these high rates are not uncommon, as barchans there possess average fluxes of 11.5. Assuming ripple reptation rates are 1/10th that of crest fluxes, total flux (saltation plus reptation) would range 3.2 to 12.7 m3 m-1 yr-1 for all sites studied herein.\nActive dunes and the abrasion susceptibility (Sa) of local rocks are relevant to assess how sand fluxes modify the landscape. Using the methodology and assumptions (Sa for basalt, mean trajectory height etc.) described in Bridges et al. (2012), we estimated abrasion rates of local basaltic bedrock. For example, sand blasting at Mawrth Vallis is estimated to produce 2–8 μm/yr for flat ground and 15–75 μm/yr for a vertical rock face. These rates would be even higher for the clay-rich units that have been previously documented there. Understanding these processes may prove vital to locating ancient habitability sites for in situ exploration where organic-bearing material is most likely to be recently exposed and thus not yet broken down by radiation.",

            "abstract": "Climate influences soil weathering via moisture availability and temperatures, but globally physical erosion rate appears to be a more important control on weathering rate than climate. Understanding these links requires investigation into landscapes where the climate’s influence on weathering is discernable despite the signal of physical erosion rate—in kinetically limited regimes. However, in these systems, rapid erosion rates and complex morphologies add complexity and heterogeneity to soil weathering. \nTo investigate the dual controls of landscape morphology and climate on chemical weathering, we quantify soil distribution, thickness, and weathering extent by focusing on catchments within two adjacent mountain ranges in the Northern Rockies. The Bitterroot Mtns present previously-glaciated valleys with steep ridges and high present-day MAP, which contrast with the drier and more gentle, nonglaciated hillslopes of the Sapphire Mtns to the east. We use field and remotely sensed data to quantify soil distribution and thickness, and elemental geochemistry to measure the variability of chemical weathering across these systems.\nMean slopes in the Bitterroots are ~1.3x higher than those in our Sapphire catchment, leading to large differences in soil distribution. Initial mapping of soils using remotely sensed data and rock exposure indices (REI) indicate that ~50% of the Bitterroot system is bare of soil, compared to <5% in the Sapphire system. REIs are distinct between these systems, with ~10˚ difference in slope thresholds for soil cover. Additionally, field data indicate that sparse soils of the Bitterroots are significantly thinner than those in Sapphire system (B=17±2cm, n=161; S=32±3, n=31). Initial XRF data suggest soil weathering intensity is more than two times greater in the Sapphires. These results suggest that the morphologic landscape legacy left by now-extinct glaciers imposes a kinetic limitation on soil weathering, even despite high modern moisture availability.",

            "abstract": "Located within the northern boundary of the Great Sand Dunes National Park is the Crestone Crater, a elliptical bowl-shaped feature consisting of a raised rim surrounding a central depression. The elongate crater has an approximate diameter of 100 m and reaches a depth of 10 m at its center relative to its rim, which rises 10 m above the elevation of the surrounding surface. Its precise origin is largely unknown and has perplexed regional geologists and residents of Crestone, Colorado for more than 80 years. This project used on-site and remote geophysical methods to characterize the processes that led to the geomorphologic surface expression observed today. Formation hypotheses examined encompass extraterrestrial, eolian, and periglacial processes. Field methods included a new gravity survey and reanalysis of gravity data collected in a previous student investigation of the feature. Additionally, a recent LiDAR dataset spanning San Luis Valley was examined to analyze the main structure, similar features in the area, and surrounding eolian and alluvial surfaces. An extraterrestrial origin, as suggested by numerous previous investigators, was deemed unlikely due to the non-unique gravity signature of the crater, its topographic similarity to many other like features identified in San Luis Valley, as well as its failure to excavate below the elevation of the surrounding surface. Furthermore, the expression of confirmed eolian landforms in San Luis Valley indicates that eolian processes alone would not produce such a prominent form in the level of vegetation observed. Proximal glacial deposits in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains show that the windblown sand in which all these features are clustered is adjacent to areas of past glaciations, and thus would have been affected by freeze-thaw cycles and thin, localized permafrost. Ice extent maps provided by the Colorado Geological Survey, as well as research on the timing of the formation of the Great Sand Dunes reinforce this claim. Results indicate that the Crestone Crater and nearby similar structures are relic collapsed hydraulic pingos, formed during Pleistocene periglacial activity. This conclusion provides further insight into periglacial landforms at low latitudes while demonstrating the value of LiDAR analysis of small geologic features on a regional scale.",

            "abstract": "A common student response to quantitative questions in science with no obvious answer is \"I have no idea.\" Often these questions can be addressed by Fermi estimation, in which an apparently difficult-to-estimate quantity for which one has little intuitive sense can be sensibly estimated by combining order of magnitude estimates of easier-to-estimate quantities. Although this approach is most commonly used for numerical estimates, it can also be applied to issues combining both science and policy. Either application involves dividing an issue into tractable components and addressing them separately. To learn this method, our natural hazard policy seminar considered a statement by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency that homeowners should secure water heaters to prevent them from being damaged by earthquakes. We divided this question into subtopics, researched each, and discussed them weekly to reach a synthesis. We used a simple model to estimate the net benefit, the difference between the expected value of damage and the cost of securing a water heater. This benefit is positive, indicating that securing is worthwhile, only if the probability of damage during the heater's life is relatively large, approximately 1 - 10%. To assess whether the actual probability is likely to be this high, we assume that major water heater damage is likely only for shaking with MMI intensity VIII (\"heavy furniture overturned\") or greater. Intensity data for the past 200 years of Illinois earthquakes show that this level was reached only in the very southernmost part of the state for the 1811-1812 New Madrid earthquakes. As expected, the highest known shaking generally decreases northward toward Chicago. This history is consistent with the fact that we find no known cases of earthquake-toppled water heaters in Illinois. We compared the rate of return on securing a water heater in Chicago to buying a lottery ticket when the jackpot is large, and found that the latter would be a better investment. This project gave our seminar an interesting way to explore ideas that might otherwise have seemed abstract and difficult to grasp, and suggests that other classes might consider similar projects.",

Various approaches have been used to upscale flux observations from towers to regions, continents, and the globe during the last several years. These approaches make use of satellite observations and meteorological reanalysis data that are both spatially and temporally continuous. The resulting gridded flux estimates have been used to examine the magnitude, distribution, and interannual variability of fluxes and to evaluate model simulations. This talk will focus on what we have learned from these upscaling efforts from the following aspects: (1) upscaling methods: progress and limitations; (2) representativeness of flux networks and influence on upscaled fluxes; (3) spatial patterns of the resulting gridded fluxes; (4) magnitude of upscaled fluxes; (5) temporal patterns of carbon and water fluxes; (6) interannual variability of fluxes and effects of disturbance and drought; (7) evaluating and informing ecosystem and earth system models; (8) uncertainty of upscaled fluxes; and (9) challenges and future opportunities. Examples will be drawn heavily from the studies that the presenter has led and/or been involved in.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) emission factors were measured for a California commuter rail line fleet of diesel-electric passenger locomotives (Caltrain). The emission factors are based on BC and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the exhaust plumes of passing locomotives, which were measured from pedestrian overpasses using portable analyzers. Each of the 29 locomotives in the fleet was sampled on 4–20 separate occasions at different locations to characterize different driving modes. The average emission factor expressed as g BC emitted per kg diesel consumed was 0.87 ± 0.66 g kg−1 (±1 standard deviation, n = 362 samples). BC emission factors tended to be higher for accelerating locomotives traveling at higher speeds with engines in higher notch settings. Higher fuel-based BC emission factors (g kg−1) were measured for locomotives equipped with separate “head-end” power generators (SEP-HEPs), which power the passenger cars, while higher time-based emission factors (g h−1) were measured for locomotives without SEP-HEPs, whose engines are continuously operated at high speeds to provide both head-end and propulsion power. PM10 emission factors, estimated assuming a BC/PM10 emission ratio of 0.6 and a typical power output-to-fuel consumption ratio, were generally in line with the Environmental Protection Agency's locomotive exhaust emission standards. Per passenger mile, diesel-electric locomotives in this study emit only 20% of the CO2 emitted by typical gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars). However, the reduction in carbon footprint (expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents) due to CO2 emissions avoidance from a passenger commuting by train rather than car is appreciably offset by the locomotive's higher BC emissions.",

            "abstract": "Multiple observations of Blue Jets (BJ) and Gigantic Blue Jets (GBJ) show that BJ emits a fan of streamers similar to a laboratory leader. Moreover, in the exponential atmosphere those long streamers grow preferentially upward, producing a narrow cone confined by the aperture angle. Petrov and Petrova [1999] and Pasko and George [2002] noticed that BJ are similar to the streamer zone of a leader (streamer corona) and conducted modeling studies based on the streamers fractal structure.\nObjective of this paper is to study the fractal dimension of the bunch of streamer channels emitted by BJ, at different altitude and under the varying reduced electric field. This similarity analysis has been done in three steps: First we described the dendritic structure of streamers in corona discharge applying the fractal theory by Popov [2002]. Then using this model and the data from existing laboratory experiments we obtained that the fractal dimension of the branching streamer channels D=2. We estimated next the packing factor of the streamers using the kinetic simulations that describe development of a group of streamers that propagate in a discharge gap while interact with each other. Finally the model was used to analyze some GBJ images available from the literature.\nThe model output includes evaluation of the total number of streamer channels in the GBJs along with estimates of the aperture angle and of the average distance between the brunches. In addition the analysis allows us to obtain the mean streamer velocity for the studied GBJs and check the velocity against the observations.\nV.P. Pasko and J.J. George, J. Geophys.

This study examined the effect of forest management history and hydrologic patterns on DOM chemistry at nine experimental watersheds located in the H.J. Andrews Long Term Ecological Research Experimental Forest of the Oregon Cascades. Stream water samples representing a three-week composite of each watershed were collected between May 2013 and February 2015 (32 events). DOM chemistry was characterized by examining UV and fluorescent properties of stream samples. Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254; Weishaar et al. 2003), generally indicative of aromaticity, showed the lowest value at the high elevation clear-cut site (watershed 6, 1,030 m) and the highest value at the low elevation clear-cut site (watershed 10, 680 m) throughout the study period. DOM fluorescent components, identified by this study using a multivariate statistical model, Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), did not differ significantly among experimental watersheds with varying forest management history. However, a protein-like DOM component exhibited temporal variations. Correlation analysis between the protein-like DOM and hydrologic patterns indicate that stream water during dry seasons come from protein-rich groundwater sources. This study shows UV and fluorescent spectroscopy DOM characterization is a viable finger printing method to detect DOM sources in pristine headwater streams at the western Cascades of Oregon where characterization of the stream water source with low DOC and DON concentrations is difficult.",

            "abstract": "Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) using OH produced from low-pressure Hg lamps at 254 nm (OFR254) or both 185 and 254 nm (OFR185) are commonly used in atmospheric chemistry and other fields. OFR254 requires the addition of externally formed O3 since OH is formed from O3 photolysis, while OFR185 does not. We perform a comprehensive modeling study of OFR chemistry and provide guidelines for OFR operation. OFR radical chemistry is systematically characterized as a function of H2O concentration (H2O), UV intensity (UV), external OH reactivity (OHRext), and initial O3 concentration (only for OFR254). OH suppression due to OHRext can be orders of magnitude, which can be understood in terms of increase in OH loss rate. Parametric uncertainty of modeled OH is ~20%. Using different residence time distributions only changes OH by ~10% on average, compared to plug flow. Calibration experiments with SO2 may introduce an error of a factor of ~2 on OH due to non-plug flow. We also investigate the contribution of non-OH reactants (UV, O(1D), O(3P), and O3) to the VOC fate in OFR. For field studies in forested regions or the Los Angeles urban area, VOCs are predominantly consumed by OH. The impact of O atoms can be neglected under most conditions. At low H2O and/or high OHRext, the importance of non-OH reactants is enhanced. Under these conditions, some biogenics can have substantial contributions from O3. Also, non-tropospheric photolysis (at 185 and 254 nm) of some aromatics may be significant. Non-tropospheric VOC photolysis may have been a problem in some lab and source studies, but can be avoided by humidifying and lowering precursor concentrations. SOA photolysis is insignificant for most functional groups. In OFRs NOx is rapidly oxidized to HNO3, and RO2 fate is similar to the low-NOx atmosphere. A comparison of OFRs with typical chamber studies and with the atmosphere is presented. This study further establishes OFRs’ usefulness and enables better experiment design and interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Forecasters and end users of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasts would greatly benefit from a reliable expectation of model error to counteract the lack of consistency in TC intensity forecast performance. As a first step towards producing error predictions to accompany each TC intensity forecast, Bhatia and Nolan (2013) studied the relationship between synoptic parameters, TC attributes, and forecast errors. In this study, we build on previous results of Bhatia and Nolan (2013) by testing the ability of the Prediction of Intensity Model Error (PRIME) model to forecast the absolute error and bias of four leading intensity models available for guidance in the Atlantic basin. PRIME forecasts are independently evaluated at each 12-hour interval from 12 to 120 hours during the 2007-2014 Atlantic hurricane seasons. The absolute error and bias predictions of PRIME are compared to their respective climatologies to determine their skill. In addition to these results, we will present the performance of the operational version of PRIME run during the 2015 hurricane season.\nPRIME verification results show that it can reliably anticipate situations where particular models excel, and therefore could lead to a more informed protocol for hurricane evacuations and storm preparations. These positive conclusions suggest that PRIME forecasts also have the potential to lower the error in the original intensity forecasts of each model. As a result, two techniques are proposed to develop a post-processing procedure for a multimodel ensemble based on PRIME. The first approach is to inverse-weight models using PRIME absolute error predictions (higher predicted absolute error corresponds to lower weights). The second multimodel ensemble applies PRIME bias predictions to each model’s intensity forecast and the mean of the corrected models is evaluated. The forecasts of both of these experimental ensembles are compared to those of the equal-weight ICON ensemble, which currently provides the most reliable forecasts in the Atlantic basin.",

            "abstract": "We have performed a series of exhaustive experiments to measure the Biot coefficient (α) of the tight cores from the Bakken shale oil play. Five distinct, bedding-normal cores from a vertical well were tested, covering the sequences of Three Forks, Lower, Middle, and Upper Bakken, and Lodgepole. The scope of this laboratory study is two-fold: (1) to obtain realistic Biot coefficient for modeling reservoir stress changes due to depletion and injection; (2) to characterize the poromechanical properties in relation to rock’s mineral composition and microstructure.\nThe experiments were carried out as follows: Argon-saturated specimen (1-inch length, 1-inch diameter) was subjected to hydrostatic confining pressure under drained conditions. Pore pressure was regulated as Argon was injected into both ends of the specimen. We drilled multiple non-through-going boreholes (1-mm diameter) in the specimen to facilitate pressure equilibrium, without compromising its integrity. The specimen was put through a loading path to experience confining pressure and pore pressure up to 70 and 60 MPa, respectively. Axial and lateral strains were recorded and used to calculate the rock’s bulk stiffness, and subsequently the static Biot coefficient, which is related to reservoir deformation and associated stress changes.\nResults of all five cores unanimously show that α is less than unity and is a function of both confining and pore pressure. α generally varies between 0.3 and 0.9 for the pressure levels we applied. This implies that models of reservoir deformation and its stress change using Terzaghi’s simple effective stress law (α = 1) or a constant α less than 1 may be erroneous. Typically, α rises significantly with pore pressure, but declines with confining pressure to the degree that is dependent on rock’s bulk stiffness. We found the stiffness of these rocks does not correlate well with the content of compliant components (e.g., clay and kerogen), and the drastic difference in microstructures appears responsible of disrupting this correlation. The unique mineral composition and microstructure of each core affects the interplay of confining and pore pressure and the dependencies of α on them.",

            "abstract": "The term \"magnetic reconnection\" has been used with several different meanings, and sometimes (particularly in discussions of observations) it is not clear which one of them (if any) is meant. Most common is a more or less literal definition of \"cutting\" and \"reconnecting\" two magnetic field lines (often illustrated by a sketch of field lines in two dimensions, or a perspective drawing of isolated spaghetti-like flux tubes); this concept can be formulated more precisely in terms of plasma flow across (or, equivalently, electric field in) a bounding surface (separatrix) between topologically distinct magnetic fields. The so-called \"generalized reconnection\" invokes only deviations from ideal MHD in a localized region; a more precise formulation is by integrals of the electric field along magnetic field lines. These two definitions can be related to two different physical processes, which I call magnetic reconnection and plasma reconnection, respectively. Magnetic reconnection involves field lines that change from one topological class to another (e.g., between open and closed). Its occurrence, requiring the presence of singular magnetic null points, can be identified (at least in principle, conceptually) from the magnetic field alone. When representing magnetic reconnection graphically, it is important to show all the singular points explicitly and to keep in mind that field lines are a continuum: between any two field lines, there is always another field line (even arbitrarily close to the singular points). Plasma reconnection involves plasma flow in which plasma elements initially located on a single field line do not remain on a field line, and this may occur without any changes in the topology or other properties of the magnetic field. To understand either one, the process must be visualized always in three dimensions and without special symmetries. Prototype of magnetic reconnection is the well-known open-magnetosphere model of Dungey (1961). Prototype of plasma reconnection, earlier still but never called by that name: the recognition by Gold (1959) that plasma flow in the magnetosphere is decoupled from the highly conducting terrestrial interior as a result of poorly conducting atmosphere. Defining reconnection on closed field lines (e.g., plasmoid formation) remains problematic.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient pollution of coastal waters commonly arises from terrestrial non-point sources of N and P such as on-site disposal systems (OSDS) and fertilizer leachate. Elevated nutrient loading of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been documented in the western edge of Maunalua Bay, Oahu, an area with high OSDS density. We examined coastal groundwater and nearshore marine water quality in two adjacent aquifers (Waialae West and Waialae East) within the study region with differing land-use and hydrogeological characteristics to better understand 1) the spatial variability of SGD nutrient and water fluxes and 2) the reasons for this spatial variability. Nutrient concentrations and NO3- stable isotope ratios were measured in coastal and terrestrial groundwater as well as nearshore marine water and integrated with SGD flux, land-use, and recharge data to examine potential nutrient sources in each aquifer. \n\nRegionally-elevated NO3- concentrations (169 µM) and δ15N-NO3- values (10.9 ‰) were apparent in SGD in the Waialae West Aquifer where OSDS density is highest. Coastal sites sampled in the neighboring Waialae East Aquifer exhibited significantly lower values for these parameters, with δ15N-NO3- values ranging from 5.7 – 5.9‰ and NO3- concentrations from 43 - 69 µM. The isotopic composition of NO3- in SGD originating from the Waialae West Aquifer was primarily influenced by mixing of a wastewater source, with wastewater effluent accounting for nearly 4.4% of total recharge and 79 - 97% of total N and P loads within the aquifer. These findings illustrate the utility of synthesizing nutrient concentrations and stable isotope parameters together with SGD flux determination, and aquifer-scale land-use and recharge data in determining the contribution of terrestrial sources to coastal nutrient loading via SGD.",

            "abstract": "The timing of late Miocene to present uplift of the southern margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau (central Tauride Mts) was recently established with biostratigraphic and surface exposure data from Neogene marine sedimentary rocks and Quaternary terraces (Schildgen et al., 2012). The presence of a deeply incised Eocene intrusion (Horoz granitoid) offers the opportunity to use uranium-based low temperature dating techniques to determine the timing and rates of exhumation in response to this uplift.\nThe Horoz granitoid (∼6 x 2 km) has a sharp intrusive contact between the lower Paleozoic to Upper Cretaceous platform carbonates of the Tauride belt (Bolkar Mountains) in the south and the Upper-Cretaceous Alihoca ophiolites and ophiolitic mélanges in the north, and is bounded in the east by the strike-slip Ecemiş Fault Zone. The intrusive body is an ENE–WSW-trending, sill-like shallow-seated pluton that crystallized at 49-55 Ma (zircon U–Pb: Kadioğlu & Dilek, 2010, Parlak et al., 2013).\nThe intrusion is exposed along a steep NE-SW valley and is unconformably covered by slope debris and alluvial terraces along its southern edge. Six samples were collected along an E-W transect over 900m of elevation. Apatite (U-Th)/He ages range from ~16 Ma at the highest elevation sample (1900 m) to ~9 Ma for the lowest (1000 m), following a linear age-elevation trend. Apatite fission track ages show a similar trend, but with older ages from ~38 Ma at the top of the transect to 31 Ma at the bottom. The Horoz granitoid records two main pulses of cooling: (1) an initial stage at ~38-31 Ma, possibly linked with a regional event that is recorded in other crystalline rocks in Central Anatolia; and (2) a later stage that may correspond to at least ~2 km of erosion-related exhumation associated with late Miocene uplift of the southern margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau.",

I also present my current conundrum: with the clear intention of pursuing data science but an academic background in other subjects, where do I go from here? Do I start my education over, pursue professional certification courses and bootcamp programs, or engage in not-very-marketable self study? This career chasm creates a strange environment for aspiring data scientists where we have a destination, but not a clear road to get there.\nI also discuss how joining a data focused interest group called The Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) bridged some of the gap left by Academia in allowing me to network and collaborate with real data scientists from a variety of backgrounds.

            "abstract": "Ice streams are fast-flowing bands of ice separated from the nearly stagnant ice in the adjacent ridge by zones of highly localized deformation known as shear margins. However, it is presently unclear what mechanisms can control the location of shear margins, and possibly allow them to migrate. Within the shear margin, the transition from a freely slipping bed beneath the ice stream to a locked bed beneath the ridge concentrates stresses on the locked bed. We show that subglacial hydrological processes can select the shear margin location by strengthening the subglacial till within the margin, reducing the stress concentration associated with the transition from a slipping to a locked bed.\nOur study uses a two-dimensional thermo-mechanical model in a cross-section perpendicular to the direction of flow. We show that the intense straining at the shear margins can generate large temperate regions within the deforming ice. Assuming that the melt generated in the temperate ice collects in a drainage channel at the base of the margin, we show that the channel locally decreases the pore pressure in the subglacial till. For a Coulomb-plastic rheology, this depressed pore pressure leads to a basal shear strength substantially higher than that inferred under the majority of the stream. Our results show that the additional basal resistance produced by the channel can offset the large stresses concentrated on the locked bed, allowing the drainage channel to select the margin location. Matching the model to surface velocity data near Dragon Margin within Whillans ice stream B2, we show that a stable shear margin occurs when the slipping-to-locked bed transition is less than 500 m away from a channel operating at an effective pressure of 200 kPa if the basal hydraulic transmissivity is equivalent to that of a water-film ~0.2 mm thick. Extending these results we explore how the shear margin location varies with the effective pressure of the channel and hydraulic properties of the bed.",

We have made several improvements to previous algorithms by removing interface segments that are affected by proximity to the solid surface, and by using distance-weighted curvature estimates. The algorithm shows significant improvement over previous quantification and allows for a close match to externally-measured capillary pressure values obtained using pressure transducers.\nThe data also allows us to track the pressure state of trapped nonwetting phase and illustrates the dependence of pressure state of trapped objects (nonwetting phase blobs) on pore morphology as opposed to the bulk fluid pressure when the object is trapped. Individual objects can be followed during several drainage and imbibition cycles, and curvature changes followed as the object expands or contracts. This has important implications for how we understand trapping in multi-phase porous medium systems.",

            "abstract": "Four and a half billion years of geologic activity has overprinted much of the direct evidence for processes involved in Earth’s formation and its initial chemical differentiation. Xenon isotopic ratios [1] and 3He/22Ne ratios [2] suggest that heterogeneities formed during Earth's accretion have been preserved to the present time. New opportunities to learn about early Earth history have opened up with the development of analytical techniques that allow high precision analysis of short-lived isotopic systems. The Hf-W system (t½ = 8.9 Ma) is particularly valuable for studying events that occurred during the first ~50 Ma of Solar System history. Here we report new data for ~ 60 Ma Baffin Bay and ~ 120 Ma Ontong Java Plateau lava samples. Both are large igneous provinces that may have sampled a primitive, less degassed deep mantle reservoir that has remained isolated since shortly after Earth formation [3,4]. Three samples analyzed have 182W/184W ratios that are 10 to 48 ppm higher than our terrestrial standard. These excesses in 182W are the highest ever measured in terrestrial rocks, and may reflect 182W ingrowth in an early-formed high Hf/W mantle domain that was produced by magma ocean differentiation [5]. Long and short-lived Sm-Nd systematics in these samples, however, are inconsistent with this hypothesis. The 182W excessses could rather reflect the derivation of these lavas from a mantle reservoir that was isolated from late accretionary additions [6]. The chondritic initial Os isotopic compositions and highly siderophile element abundances of these samples, however, are inconsistent with this interpretation. Tungsten concentrations for the Baffin Bay and Ontong Java Plateau samples range from 23 ppb to 62 ppb, and are negatively correlated with their 182W/184W ratios. We propose that the source reservoirs for these flood basalts likely formed through Hf/W fractionation caused by core-forming events occuring over a protacted time interval during Earth’s initial growth, and seem to have survived in the mantle to the present.\n[1] Mukhopadhyay, 2012, Nature.

            "abstract": "Isotopic fractionation between U4+ and U6+makes U stable isotopes potential tracers of global paleoredox conditions. In this work [1], we put the U-proxy up to a test against a highly constrained system: the modern ocean.\nWe measured a large number of seawater samples from geographically diverse locations and found that the open ocean has a homogenous isotopic composition at δ238USW= -0.392 ± 0.005 ‰ (rel. to CRM-112a). From our measurement of rock samples (n=64) and compilations of literature data (n=380), we then estimated the U isotopic compositions of the various reservoirs involved in the modern oceanic U budget, as well as the fractionation factors associated with U incorporation into those reservoirs. Using a steady-state model, we compared the isotopic composition of the seawater predicted by the four most recent U oceanic budgets [2-5] to the modern seawater value we measured.\nThree of these budgets [2-4] predict a seawater isotopic composition in very good agreement with the observed δ238USW, which strengthens our confidence in the isotopic fractionation factors associated with each deposition environment and the fact that U is at steady-state in the modern ocean. The U oceanic budget of Henderson and Anderson (2003) does not reproduce the observed seawater composition because the U flux to anoxic/euxinic sediments relative to the total U flux out of the ocean is high in their model, which our analysis shows cannot be correct. The U isotopic composition of seawater is used to constrain the extent of anoxia in the modern ocean (% of seafloor covered by anoxic/euxinic sediments), which is 0.21 ± 0.09 %.\nThis work demonstrates that stable isotopes of U can indeed trace the extent of anoxia in the modern global ocean, thereby validating the application of U isotope measurements to paleoredox reconstructions. Based on the above work, we will present the best estimate of the modern oceanic U budget.\n[1] Tissot F.L.H., Dauphas N. (2015) Geochim Cosmochim Ac 167, 113-143 [2] Barnes C. E., Cochran J. K.

            "abstract": "A large and increasing number of ground-based and satellite-borne instruments has been demonstrated to reliably reveal ionospheric manifestations of natural hazards such as large earthquakes, strong tsunamis, and powerful tornadoes. To transition from detection of ionospheric manifestations of natural hazards to characterization of the hazards for the purposes of improving early warning systems and contributing to disaster recovery, it is necessary to relate quantitatively characteristics of the observed ionospheric disturbances and the underlying natural hazard and, in particular, accurately model propagation of atmospheric waves from the ground or ocean surface to the ionosphere. The ray theory has been used extensively to model propagation of atmospheric waves and proved to be very efficient in elucidating the effects of atmospheric variability on ionospheric signatures of natural hazards. However, the ray theory predicts unphysical, divergent values of the wave amplitude and needs to be modified in the vicinity of caustics. This paper presents an asymptotic theory that describes diffraction, focusing and increased dissipation of acoustic-gravity waves in the vicinity of caustics and turning points. Air temperature, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and wind velocity are assumed to vary gradually with height and horizontal coordinates, and slowness of these variations determines the large parameter of the problem. Uniform asymptotics of the wave field are expressed in terms of Airy functions and their derivatives. The geometrical, or Berry, phase, which arises in the consistent WKB approximation for acoustic-gravity waves, plays an important role in the caustic asymptotics. In addition to the wave field in the vicinity of the caustic, these asymptotics describe wave reflection from the caustic and the evanescent wave field beyond the caustic. The evanescent wave field is found to play an important role in ionospheric manifestations of tsunamis.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed Arctic benthic ostracode assemblages from two piston cores (PC) and their complementary multicores from Herald Canyon in the Eastern Siberian Sea. The cores (SWERUS-L2-2-PC1 [8.1 m], 2-MUC4, 71.7 m water depth, and SWERUS-L2-4-PC1 [6.2 m], 4-MUC4, 119.7 m water depth) were collected during Leg 2 of the 2014 SWERUS-C3 Expedition. Radiocarbon dates on mollusks indicate that sediments from 2-PC1 and 4-PC1 were deposited over the last 5,000 and 10,000 years respectively. The dominant ostracode species include: Acanthocythereis dunelmensis, Cytheropteron elaeni, Elofsonella concinna, Kotoracythere janae, Normanicythere leioderma, Semicytherura complanata. Based on species’ distributions obtained from a 1,200-sample modern ostracode database, these species are known to be typical of shallow mid- to outer-continental shelf environments in the modern Arctic Ocean. The abundant and diverse benthic ostracode assemblages found in these cores suggest the influence of nutrient-rich Pacific water flowing in through the Bering Strait. The faunal assemblages are fairly uniform throughout 2-PC1, suggesting minimal variability in Pacific water inflow since at least 5 ka. In the lower section of 4-PC1, there is a major change to ostracode assemblages containing typical inner shelf, often brackish-water species, such as Cytheromorpha macchesneyi, and associated shallow Arctic shelf species (Sarsicytheridea punctillata and several Cytheropteron species), reflecting a period of lower, deglacial sea level.",

            "abstract": "A novel form of urban development, Low Impact Development (LID), aims to engineer systems that replicate natural hydrologic functioning. LID includes the preservation of near-natural groundwater recharge via infiltration close to impervious surfaces where stormwater is generated. Our study watershed in Clarksburg, Maryland is an instrumented 1.11 km2 watershed developed between 2004 and 2010 with 73 infiltration-focused stormwater facilities, including bioretention facilities, dry wells, and dry swales. We examined changes to annual and monthly streamflow during and after urban development (2004—2014) and compared alterations to nearby forested and urban control watersheds. We show that total flow and base flow increased in the study watershed during development as compared to control watersheds. We also found that the study watershed had slower storm recessions after development and less seasonality in base flow. These changes may be due to a combination of urban processes occurring during development, including reduction in evapotranspiration and the increase in point sources of recharge. Precipitation that may have infiltrated a forested landscape pre-development, been stored in soil moisture, and eventually been transpired by plants may now be recharged to groundwater and become base flow. A transfer of evapotranspiration to base flow is an unintended alteration to the urban water budget, here observed in a watershed using LID.",

            "abstract": "Mapping and hierarchical classification of landforms along the Columbia River estuary provides insight into formative geologic, hydrologic, and biologic processes and their associated ecosystems, thereby aiding assessment of future trajectories and restoration approaches. The Columbia River Estuary Ecosystem Classification includes an inventory of landforms along 230 km of riverine estuary between the Pacific Ocean and Bonneville Dam in Oregon and Washington, USA. Landforms were mapped by interpretation of lidar topography supplemented with high-resolution bathymetry, aerial photographs, soil maps, and historical maps. Groupings of landforms were assigned to formative process regimes. These landform groupings relate ecosystems to geophysical processes. Assessment of historical changes to the processes that form and maintain landforms thus has implications for the types of ecosystems that can form and persist along the estuary.\nThe estuary was historically a complex system of channels with a floodplain dominated by extensive tidal wetlands in the lower reaches and backswamp lakes and wetlands in upper reaches. Natural levees flank most channels in the upper reaches, locally including areas of ridge and swale topography and crevasse splays that intrude into backswamps. Other Holocene process regimes affecting floodplain morphology have included volcanogenic deltas, tributary fans, eolian dunes, and landslides. Pre-Holocene landforms are locally prominent and include ancient fluvial deposits and bedrock. Historical changes to streamflow regimes, floodplain isolation, and direct anthropogenic disturbance have resulted in channel narrowing and limited the amount of floodplain that can be shaped by flowing water. Floodplain isolation has caused relative subsidence of tidal floodplains along much of the lower estuary. Most extant landforms are on trajectories strongly influenced by humans and new landforms are mostly created by humans.",

            "abstract": "Growing supplies of natural gas have heightened interest in the net impacts of natural gas on climate. Although its production and consumption result in greenhouse gas emissions, natural gas most often substitutes for other fossil fuels whose emission rates may be higher. Because natural gas can be used throughout the sectors of the energy economy, its net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions will depend not only on the leak rates of production and distribution, but also on the use for which natural gas is substituted.\nHere, we present our estimates of the net greenhouse gas emissions impacts of substituting natural gas for other fossil fuels for five purposes: light-duty vehicles, transit buses, residential heating, electricity generation, and export for electricity generation overseas. Emissions are evaluated on a fuel cycle basis, from production and transport of each fuel through end use combustion, based on recent conditions in the United States. We show that displacement of existing coal-fired electricity and heating oil furnaces yield the largest reductions in emissions. The impact of compressed natural gas replacing petroleum-based vehicles is highly uncertain, with the sign of impact depending on multiple assumptions. Export of liquefied natural gas for electricity yields a moderate amount of emissions reductions. We further show how uncertainties in upstream emission rates for natural gas and in the global warming potential of methane influence the net greenhouse gas impacts. Our presentation will make the case that how natural gas is deployed is crucial to determining how it will impact climate.",

            "abstract": "Large point sources (electricity generation and large-scale industry) make up roughly one third of all fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) emissions. Currently, these emissions are determined from self-reported inventory data, and sometimes from smokestack emissions monitoring, and the uncertainty in emissions from individual power plants is about 20%. We examine the utility of atmospheric 14C measurements combined with atmospheric transport modelling as a tool for independently quantifying point source CO2ff emissions, to both improve the accuracy of the reported emissions and for verification as we move towards a regulatory environment.\nWe use the Kapuni Gas Treatment Facility as a test case. It is located in rural New Zealand with no other significant fossil fuel CO2 sources nearby, and emits CO2ff at ~0.1 Tg carbon per year. We use several different sampling methods to determine the 14C and hence the CO2ff content downwind of the emission source: grab flask samples of whole air; absorption of CO2 into sodium hydroxide integrated over many hours; and plant material which faithfully records the 14C content of assimilated CO2. We use a plume dispersion model to compare the reported emissions with our observed CO2ff mole fractions. We show that the short-term variability in plume dispersion makes it difficult to interpret the grab flask sample results, whereas the variability is averaged out in the integrated samples and we obtain excellent agreement between the reported and observed emissions, indicating that the 14C method can reliably be used to evaluated point source emissions.",

            "abstract": "Biosphere-atmosphere interactions play a critical role in governing atmospheric composition, mediating the concentration of key species such as ozone and aerosol, thereby influencing air quality and climate. The FORCAsT (FORest Canopy Atmosphere Transfer) one-dimensional model has been developed to study the emission, deposition, chemistry and transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their oxidation products in the atmosphere within and above the forest canopy. Recent field measurements at a variety of forest ecosystems have suggested that many oxygenated VOCs exhibit periods of strongly negative (downward) fluxes, for which current understanding cannot account. We apply FORCAsT to simulate within-canopy processes and elucidate their relative contributions to fluxes of key oxygenated species at the top of the canopy under a range of meteorological and chemical (NOx) conditions in an isoprene-dominated forest ecosystem (Harvard Forest). Modelled concentrations and fluxes of methanol, acetone and acetaldehyde cannot be reconciled with observations made during the growing season in 2012 without the inclusion of primary emissions. We also find clear evidence of light-dependent methanol and acetone emissions, in addition to temperature-dependent releases from storage pools. Furthermore, the deposition of oxygenated VOCs appears to be strongly influenced by relative humidity suggesting enhanced deposition to wet surfaces. Our work highlights the need for better understanding and further targeted measurements to constrain the mechanisms controlling these processes.",

The observations are from the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) Airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) on board the NASA DC-8. Instead of retrieving information about aerosol microphysical properties such as indexes of refraction, we seek information more directly applicable to an aerosol transport model - in our case the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) module used in the GEOS-5 Earth modeling system. A joint atmosphere/aerosol mini-reanalysis was performed for the SEAC4RS period using GEOS-5. The meteorological reanalysis followed the MERRA-2 atmospheric reanalysis protocol, and aerosol information from MODIS, MISR, and AERONET provided a constraint on the simulated aerosol optical depth (i.e., total column loading of aerosols). We focus on the simulated concentrations of 10 relevant aerosol species simulated by the GOCART module: dust, sulfate, and organic and black carbon. Our first retrieval algorithm starts with the SEAC4RS mini-reanalysis and adjusts the concentration of each GOCART aerosol species so that differences between the observed and simulated backscatter and extinction measurements are minimized. In this case, too often we are unable to simulate the observations by simple adjustment of the aerosol concentrations. A second retrieval approach adjusts both the aerosol concentrations and the optical parameters (i.e., assigned mass extinction efficiency) associated with each GOCART species. We present results from DC-8 flights over smoke from forest fires over the western US using both retrieval approaches. Finally, we compare our retrieved quantities with in-situ observations of aerosol absorption, scattering, and mass concentrations at flight altitude.",

            "abstract": "Primarily motivated by applications to hydrocarbon exploration, submarine minibasins have been widely studied during recent decades to understand the physical phenomenon that characterizes their fill process. Minibasins were identified in seismic records in the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Trinidad and Tobago, Ireland, Nigeria and also in outcrops (e.g., Tres Pasos Formation, southern Chile). The filling of minibasis is generally described as the ‘fill-and-spill’ process, i.e. turbidity currents enter, are reflected on the minibasin flanks, pond and deposit suspended sediment. As the minibasin fills the turbidity current spills on the lowermost zone of the basin flank –spill point – and start filling the next basin downdip. Different versions of this simplified model were used to interpret field and laboratory data but it is still unclear how the minibasin size compared to the magnitude of the turbidity currents, the position of each basin in the system, and the slope of the minibasin system affects the characteristics of the deposit (e.g., geometry, grain size). Here, we conduct a numerical study to investigate how the ‘fill-and-spill’ model changes with increase in slopes of the minibasin system. First, we validate our numerical results against laboratory experiment performed on two linked minibasins located on a horizontal platform by comparing measured and simulated deposit geometries, suspended sediment concentration profiles and grain sizes. We then perform numerical simulations by increasing the minibasin system slope: deposit and flow characteristics are compared with the case of horizontal platform to identify how the depositional processes change. For the numerical study we used a three-dimensional numerical model of turbidity currents that solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for dilute suspensions. Turbulence is modeled by a buoyancy-modified k–ε closure. The numerical model has a deforming bottom boundary, to model the changes in the bed deposit due to erosion and deposition. Preliminary two dimensional simulations show that in the early stages of the fill process the suspended sediment concentration is higher in the first basin than in the second one, the coarse grain sizes are preferentially trapped in the updip basins and the fine sediment fractions spill into downdip basins.",

Only anomalies with wavelengths < 215 km were mapped and amplitudes were adjusted for differences in spacecraft altitude using an equivalent source dipole technique. Maps of the radial field component show that the strongest large-scale anomalies are located in the western part of the mapped region just north and northeast of the 1550-km diameter Caloris impact basin centered at 164E, 30N. When adjusted to a common altitude of ~ 40 km, the strongest single anomaly (~170E, 60N; > 6 nT) lies over a smooth plains unit that extends north-northeastward from Caloris. A second anomaly (185E, 53N, > 5 nT) lies on the Odin Formation, interpreted as Caloris ejecta (e.g., Guest and Greeley, USGS, 1983). As previously reported by Johnson et al. (Science, 2015), a third anomaly (~ 212E, 61N, > 5 nT) also lies over a smooth plains unit, Suisse Planitia. Most smooth plains units on Mercury may have a volcanic origin (Denevi et al., JGR, 2013). However, as discussed by the latter authors, a subset of the smooth plains occur in an annulus around Caloris and could have an impact-related origin, involving fluidized basin ejecta deposition (Wilhelms, Icarus, 1976). A similar origin is widely accepted for the lunar Cayley smooth plains, which dominate the geology near the Apollo 16 landing site where the strongest surface magnetic fields were measured and which correlate best with orbital anomalies on the lunar near side (Halekas et al., JGR, 2001). Two of the remaining three anomalies (220E, 68N, > 4 nT; 234E, 77N, > 5 nT) lie over an older intermediate plains unit with an uncertain interpretation, possibly consisting of impact basin and crater ejecta as well as volcanic materials (Grolier and Boyce, USGS, 1984). In view of the proximity of the strongest anomalies to Caloris and their association with either Caloris ejecta or Cayley-like smooth plains units with a possible fluidized ejecta origin, it is proposed that at least some of the Mercurian anomaly sources consist of primary or secondary impact basin ejecta which acquired either thermoremanence or shock remanence or both shortly after deposition.",

            "abstract": "Crystal settling and bubbles migration in magmas have significant effects on the physical and chemical evolution of magmas. The rate of phase segregation is controlled by the force balance that governs the migration of particles suspended in the melt. The relative velocity of a single particle or bubble in a quiescent infinite fluid (melt) is well characterized; however, the interplay between particles or bubbles in suspensions and emulsions and its effect on their settling/rising velocity remains poorly quantified.\nWe propose a theoretical model for the hindered velocity of non-Brownian emulsions of nondeformable droplets, and suspensions of spherical solid particles in the creeping flow regime. The model is based on three sets of hydrodynamic corrections: two on the drag coefficient experienced by each particle to account for both return flow and Smoluchowski effects and a correction on the mixture rheology to account for nonlocal interactions between particles. The model is then extended for mono-disperse non-spherical solid particles that are randomly oriented. The non-spherical particles are idealized as spheroids and characterized by their aspect ratio. The poly-disperse nature of natural suspensions is then taken into consideration by introducing an effective volume fraction of particles for each class of mono-disperse particles sizes.\nOur model is tested against new and published experimental data over a wide range of particle volume fraction and viscosity ratios between the constituents of dispersions. We find an excellent agreement between our model and experiments. We also show two significant applications for our model:\n(1) We demonstrate that hindered settling can increase mineral residence time by up to an order of magnitude in convecting magma chambers.\n(2) We provide a model to correct for particle interactions in the conventional hydrometer test to estimate the particle size distribution in soils. Our model offers a greatly improved agreement with the results obtained with direct measurement methods such as laser diffraction.",

            "abstract": "Electron phase-space holes and double layers are key elements in the dynamics of space plasmas. Double layers in particular play a strong role in particle acceleration, reconnection, and turbulence. The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission expects to see double layers directly related to magnetic reconnection events. Data from previous in-situ measurements has shown that double layers energize electron cyclotron maser emission, the mechanism for Earth’s auroral kilometric radiation. Notably, double layers are a primary generation mechanism for electron phase-space holes. These kinetic plasma structures are also important in astrophysical systems far away from Earth and any possibility of in-situ observations. For example, phase-space holes generated by the two-stream instability are cited as an important component of efficient blazar jet dissipation, and double layers are implicated as an acceleration mechanism for cosmic rays. Using Earth’s magnetosphere as a plasma physics laboratory, we can scale up the physical processes observed by missions like MMS to the magnetospheres of larger planets or more extreme astrophysical systems such as neutron stars. Phase-space holes in these environments are expected to be moving at relativistic speeds. Given the correct frame transformation, the hole’s distribution function may have a positive\ndf/d\np\n⊥\n, and is therefore susceptible to the electron cyclotron maser instability. Relativistic phase-space holes may then produce observable coherent radiation indicative of the plasma’s properties. As a first step in investigating this hypothesis, we have developed a special relativistic, electrostatic Vlasov simulation that can form phase-space holes and double layers in any frame of motion parallel to the flow. When electron holes are produced in a relativistic, counter streaming plasma, we predict distributions that are unstable to the electron cyclotron maser instability.",

            "abstract": "Models simulating both stream flow and conservative tracers can provide a more realistic representation of flow paths, storage distributions and mixing processes that is advantageous for many predictions. Conceptual models with such integration have provided useful insights, but tend to be lumped and thus crude representations of catchment processes. Using tracers to aid spatially-distributed models has considerable potential to improve the conceptualisation of the dynamics of internal hydrological stores and fluxes. Here, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of a data-driven, spatially-distributed tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model. The model structure allows the assessment of the effect of landscape properties on the routing and mixing of water and tracers. The model was applied to an experimental site (3.2 km2) in the Scottish Highlands with a unique tracer data set; 4 years of daily isotope ratios in stream water and precipitation were available, as well as 2 years of weekly soil and ground water isotopes. The model evolved from an empirically-based, lumped tracer-aided model previously developed for the catchment. The best model runs were selected from Monte Carlo simulations based on a dual calibration criterion that included objective functions for both stream water isotopes and discharge at the outlet. Model results were also tested against observed spatially-distributed soil water isotope data. Model performance for both criteria was good and the model could reproduce the variable isotope signals in steeper hillslopes where storage was low and damped isotope responses in valley bottom cells with high storage. The model also allows us to estimate the age distributions of internal water fluxes and stream flow and has substantially improved spatial and temporal dynamics of process representation. This gives a more robust framework for projecting the effects of environmental change.",

IARPC’s approach is to harnesses the talent of the scientific and stakeholder community through Federally-run but broadly open collaboration teams, and an innovative website that expands the frontiers of collaborative research.\nThe Obama Administration released the five-year Arctic Research Plan: FY2013-2017 in February 2013. The Plan focuses on advancing knowledge and sustainability of the Arctic by improving collaboration in seven priority research areas: sea ice and marine ecosystems, terrestrial ice and ecosystems, atmospheric studies, observing systems, regional climate models, human health studies, and adaptation tools for communities. From these seven research areas, 12 collaboration teams were formed to respond to the 145 milestones laid out in the Plan. The collaboration teams are charged with enhancing inter-institutional and interdisciplinary implementation of scientific research on local, regional, and circumpolar environmental and societal issues in the Arctic.\nThe collaboration teams are co-chaired by Federal program managers, and, in some cases, external partners and are open to research and stakeholder communities. They meet on a regular basis by web- or teleconference to inform one another about ongoing and planned programs and new research results, as well as to inventory existing programs, identify gaps in knowledge and research, and address and implement the Plan’s milestones. In-between meetings, team members communicate via our innovative, user-driven, collaboration website. Members share information about their research activities by posting updates, uploading documents, and including events on our calendar, and entering into dialogue about their research activities. Conversations taking place on the website are open to any other member, enabling new talent to enter into conversations and collaborations to form.",

            "abstract": "The onset of substorms is still an unsolved problem in Space Physics even though many physical models explaining the substorm process have been proposed. Distinguishing the processes that occur during first 2 minutes of substorm process depends critically on the correct timing of different signals in the plasma sheet and the ionosphere. This has been difficult to accomplish with data alone, since signals are sometimes ambiguous, or they have not been observed at the right locations. To investigate signal propagation paths and signal travel times, we use OpenGGCM global simulation. By launching impulses from various locations in the tail, we investigate the path taken by the waves and the time it takes for different waves to reach the ionosphere. We find that it takes around 60 seconds for waves to travel from 30 RE to the ionosphere, contrary to many previous reports. We also find that the Tamao path is not generally the preferred path for waves originating in the plasma sheet, and that waves travel faster through the lobes. In addition, we find that a point source in the tail around 10-15 RE leads to spread-out signals in the ionosphere, whereas a point source further down in the tail around 20-30 RE leads to more localized signatures in the ionosphere. We also use the same technique to launch impulses in the dayside magnetosphere, and we find it takes less than 1 minute for wave to travel from the dayside to the nightside.",

            "abstract": "Climate conditions in North America during the past two glacial cycles remain uncertain in part because long, well-dated, continuous paleoclimate records are limited in number and sparsely distributed. Here we present the first continuous, millennial resolution paleoclimate proxy record derived from C, O and U isotopes in mm-thick pedogenic carbonate clast-coatings (pedothems), which are widely distributed in semi-arid to arid regions worldwide. Carbonate 230Th/U ages were obtained from laser ablation ICP-MS spots of 93um diameter size, which also yielded 234U/238Ui proxy values for soil water infiltration and paleoprecipitation. The U-series transects were coupled to δ13C and δ18O values obtained by ion probe on ~10um diameter spots. Modern soil carbonate in the region has δ18O and δ13C values that are similar to the youngest (early Holocene) samples acquired in the laminations, strengthening the interpretation that the carbonate reflects soil isotopic conditions at the time of formation. Our new record from the Wind River Basin in Wyoming spans the last 120,000 years and confirms a previously hypothesized period of increased transport of Gulf of Mexico moisture northward into the continental interior from 70,000 to 55,000 years ago. Such pronounced meridional moisture transport, which contrasts with the dominant zonal transport of Pacific moisture into the North American interior by westerly winds before and after 70,000 to 55,000 years ago, may have resulted from a persistent anticyclone developed above the North American ice sheet during Marine Isotope Stage 4. Subsequently, the carbonate record suggests that climate in mid-latitude central North America became progressively more arid during the onset of the last glaciation (both δ13C and 234U/238Ui values become more positive), culminating in peak aridity during the LGM. We conclude that pedothems, when analyzed using micro-analytical techniques, can provide unique insights into past terrestrial climates.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's oceans have played an important role in the evolution of life and tectonics on Earth, and yet our understanding of basic connections between these remains limited. One of the central, and still unanswered questions, is whether Earth's oceans have been present over all of Earth's history, and how deep were any oceans that may have existed. Global tectonics provides a large influence on the long term fluctuations in sea level through varying the volume of ocean basins. The volume of ocean basins over time can be estimated from the seafloor age distribution as observed in plate reconstructions, which gives the proportion of younger, elevated seafloor to older, subsided seafloor.\nFirst we establish a relationship between sea level and the age-area distribution of oceanic crust using reconstructed oceanic plate age for recent 140 Myr from Müller et al. (2008), accounting for other major contributions such as the volume of ice sheets, the presence of large igneous provinces on the seafloor and thickness of sediments on the seafloor.\nWe then extend this methodology back into earlier times during Earth's history by using synthetic plate reconstructions derived from numerical models of mantle convection in 3D spherical geometry. To approximate conditions for earlier in Earth's history, we consider that the Rayleigh number would have been higher in the past, resulting in faster surface velocities and, on-average, younger seafloor. Thus, we vary the surface velocity from the modern day value of 4 cm/yr to what is predicted for early Earth conditions of 80 cm/yr (corresponding to Rayleigh number of 10^8 to 10^10, respectively). Coltice et al. (2014) showed that the shape of seafloor age distribution is influenced by the growth of continental area over time, with an increasingly younger-aged, triangular shaped distribution favored for increasing continental surface. We vary the amount of continents on Earth from 0, 10%, to 30% of surface area of the Earth. These newer models include 30% basal heating, a viscosity jump of 30 between upper and lower mantle, and more than 6 orders of magnitude of viscosity variations with temperature. Using those, we can calculate the mid-oceanic ridge depth associated using similar principals as for the 140 Myr plate reconstruction models.",

Unraveling this complex molecular mixture gives new insights into key processes such as atmospheric processing, secondary aerosol formation, radiative properties as well as implications for human health. High-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry (HRToF-CIMS) is a powerful technique with the potential to provide many insights into this complex mix of molecules. We have developed new data analysis techniques to identify the most likely ions present in complex mass spectra in which individual peaks strongly overlap. New ancillary algorithms will also be presented to first develop a list of all possible formulas for this particular ion chemistry and then to automatically assign possible ions to the likely peak positions. Spectral simulation experiments confirm that bulk elemental properties such as oxidation state and carbon number can be reliably extracted from this method. Comparison of results from a CIMS operated during the 2011 BEACHON-RoMBAS campaign in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to electrospray-ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry data from compounds measured in another forest in the Rockies allows a comparison of the compounds and compound classes measured by both techniques. We will also address the problem of quantifying ion signals from the organic molecule mix encountered in this study by a new method to calculate approximate sensitivities for acetate ionization chemistry to help quantifying concentrations of atmospheric compounds.\nWe applied the above methods to a dataset from the micro-orifice volatilization impactor (MOVI)-CIMS collected during August 2011 as part of the BEACHON campaign. Calculated atmospheric bulk elemental parameters such as diurnal cycles of carbon number and oxidation state from both gas phase and aerosols from a pine forest environment will be presented and compared to data from other instruments, particularly the AMS. We will also compare the aerosol volatility distributions estimated from the elemental composition of the species detected and from the measured thermograms, which provides insights on oligomer presence and decomposition.",

This requires spectroscopic parameters with accuracies at the 0.1% level. To achieve this it is necessary for line shape models to include deviations from the Voigt line shape, including the collisional effects of Dicke narrowing, speed-dependence, line mixing (LM), and collision-induced absorption (CIA).\nTo measure these effects to high accuracy, new innovative lab measurements are required. LM and CIA in particular are difficult to measure using standard spectroscopic techniques because, while present at atmospheric temperatures, these effects are difficult to quantify. At pressures of several atmospheres these effects contribute several percent to the A-Band absorption. While the O2 A-band is too weak for direct absorption measurements via a diode laser, a very sensitive photoacoustic spectroscopy technique is being used to study the pressure- dependence of the spectral line shape up to pressures of 5 atm. This spectrometer has a high S/N of about 10,000 and an advantageous zero baseline. In addition, temperature effects on the line shape are studied using a newly developed temperature control scheme.

Using several years of satellite retrievals, sun-photometer measurements and global model AOD, we provide an updated estimate of the present-day global dust AOD. A comprehensive uncertainty analysis encompasses the retrieval uncertainty, sampling issues, bias corrections, and different satellite and model combinations. The estimate is significantly higher than the median of the AEROCOM models (0.028) and is also higher than all the models used as part of this study (MERRAero, CESM, GEOS-Chem and WRF-Chem). This suggests a systematic underestimate of the radiative impact of dust in global models, with implications for the estimates of anthropogenic dust forcing. The discrepancy between modeled and observed global dust AOD stems from a lack of dust from Asian deserts, too vigorous removal in key outflow regions, and missing summertime emissions in Africa. This new observationally-derived dataset provides a benchmark for improving model simulations of dust lifecycle and the radiative impacts of mineral dust.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic rocks from Grenada have long been recognized to belong to two distinct magma series: the olivine microphyric M-series and the ankaramitic, calcium-rich C-series. Mafic members of both series are readily distinguished on the basis of both major and trace element compositions and radiogenic isotope ratios, with the M-series having more radiogenic Sr and Pb and less radiogenic Nd than the C-series. The two series evolve along distinct paths to compositionally and isotopically similar silica-rich hornblende andesites and dacites.\nWe report 29 new 40Ar/39Ar dates ranging from 0.06 to 6.06 Ma, which are notably younger than previous K-Ar ages ranging up to 21 Ma, perhaps reflecting non-atmospheric inherited Ar. The two series have erupted contemporaneously and ages of both series tend to cluster in two periods: 0 to 1.7 Ma and 4.8 to 6 Ma. The oldest lavas are located in the northeastern and southwestern ends of the island. There is little or no systematic variation in chemistry with age. A dike intruding Tufton Hall Formation (THF) sediments in the south of the island is much older at 37.8 Ma;\nC-series isotope ratios correlate with MgO, which has previously been interpreted as a consequence of fractional crystallization and assimilation (AFC) of marine sediments. Isotope ratios of M-series lavas, in contrast, show no systematic variation with MgO. We agree that the C-series magmas have experienced AFC, but argue that the assimilant is simply the M-series products that makes up two-thirds of the mass of the island. A variety of evidence supports this interpretation. First, K2O/Na2O ratios decrease with decreasing MgO in the C-series. Second, the THF is volcanogenic likely derived from ancestral volcanoes and also are not a suitable isotopic end-member. Third, O isotope ratios in clinopyroxenes correlate with radiogenic isotope ratios, but not with MgO. Finally, the most differentiated C-series lavas are indistinguishable, isotopically and otherwise, from M-series compositions. Such auto-assimilation may be common in volcanic systems, and may affect the M-series as well, but only becomes apparent in cases such as this where magmas are compositionally distinct from the volcanic edifice they rise through.",

By giving K-12 students Global Positioning System (GPS) units, and allowing them to collect and map their own data, they are being exposed to some of the research methods being used by scientists in the Alaska ACE project. This hands-on, minds-on method has been successfully used in formal education settings such as a Junior High School classroom in Nuiqsut, Alaska as well as in informal education settings such as summer camps in Barrow, Alaska and Kenai, Alaska. The students progress from mapping by hand to collecting location data with their GPS units and cameras, and imputing this information into ArcGIS Online to create map products. The data collected were from sites ranging from important places in the community to sites visited during summer camps, with students reflecting on data and site significance. Collecting data, using technology, and creating map products contribute to science skills and practices students need to conduct research of their own and to understand research being done around them. The goal of this education outreach implementation is to bring students closer to the research, understand the process of science, and have the students continue to collect data and contribute to research in their communities.

            "abstract": "The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a macro-scale semi-distributed hydrologic model. VIC development began in the early 1990s and it has been used extensively, applied from basin to global scales. VIC has been applied in a many use cases, including the construction of hydrologic data sets, trend analysis, data evaluation and assimilation, forecasting, coupled climate modeling, and climate change impact analysis. Ongoing applications of the VIC model include the University of Washington's drought monitor and forecast systems, and NASA's land data assimilation systems. The development of VIC version 5.0 focused on reconfiguring the legacy VIC source code to support a wider range of modern modeling applications. The VIC source code has been moved to a public Github repository to encourage participation by the model development community-at-large. The reconfiguration has separated the physical core of the model from the driver, which is responsible for memory allocation, pre- and post-processing and I/O. VIC 5.0 includes four drivers that use the same physical model core: classic, image, CESM, and Python. The classic driver supports legacy VIC configurations and runs in the traditional time-before-space configuration. The image driver includes a space-before-time configuration, netCDF I/O, and uses MPI for parallel processing. This configuration facilitates the direct coupling of streamflow routing, reservoir, and irrigation processes within VIC. The image driver is the foundation of the CESM driver; which couples VIC to CESM's CPL7 and a prognostic atmosphere. Finally, we have added a Python driver that provides access to the functions and datatypes of VIC's physical core from a Python interface. This presentation demonstrates how reconfiguring legacy source code extends the life and applicability of a research model.",

            "abstract": "The asymmetry between El Nino and La Nina events is a fundamental property of ENSO. Understanding the causes and consequences of this property of ENSO may hold the key to understanding decadal variability in the tropics and beyond. Here we present an analysis of the strength of ENSO asymmetry in two latest NCAR models—CCSM4 and CESM1-- which have the same ocean component. This analysis is aimed to extend a previous study based on CMIP5 models to further explore the impact of atmospheric processes on ENSO asymmetry. Our evaluation shows that, in general, the two NCAR models underestimate the observed ENSO asymmetry measured by Nino3 SST skewness. We find that the weak ENSO asymmetry in these models corresponds to a cold bias in the mean SST climatology. The cold bias in mean SST is larger in CESM1 than in CCSM4, despite an overall improvement in the simulation of ENSO asymmetry in CESM1. Corresponding AMIP runs are analyzed to understand the causes of the underestimate of ENSO asymmetry in these coupled models. The analysis reveals that associated with the bias in mean precipitation, CESM1 AMIP runs have a stronger equatorial mean zonal winds than CCSM4 AMIP runs. Both the CAM4 and CAM5 AMIP models are found to have a weaker skewness of zonal wind stress than observations, but CAM5 shows a broad increase in the simulation of zonal winds stress skewness across the equatorial Pacific in contrast to CAM4. Finally, wind-forced ocean GCM experiments demonstrate that the bias in the simulation of ENSO asymmetry in coupled models can be traced back to the bias in the stand-alone atmosphere models. Our results point toward a pathway to reduce the bias in simulation of ENSO asymmetry in coupled models.",

            "abstract": "The nature and location of the transition between two large crustal blocks that comprise southern and western Alaska is unknown. Oblique subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath Alaska drives counterclockwise rotation of the Southern Alaska Block and clockwise rotation of the Bering Block, indicating crustal strain is occurring in a poorly delineated transition zone in Southcentral Alaska. Previously, no active faults have been identified in this transition zone, south of the Denali Fault and west of Cook Inlet. Near the north shore of Lake Iliamna, over 200 km from the nearest known active fault, we documented an 8 m drop followed by a 2 m rise in a 16,000 year-old abandoned lakeshore, interrupting 10 cm/km isostatic tilting. The deformation is spread over several kilometers. Evidence of dramatic liquefaction exposed in nearby bluffs dates to between 900 and 4200 years ago. These geologic traces tell a story of neotectonic deformation and strong shaking – consistent with a strong earthquake on a blind fault. Nearby geologic mapping and the graben-like depression in paleo-shoreline elevation we documented are consistent with extension accommodated along the Lake Clark Fault. Beyond relevance to regional tectonics, our results show previously undocumented seismic hazard in an area of a potential large-scale mining development (the proposed Pebble Mine), which would require perpetual waste storage.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is at the juncture of air quality and climate. Ozone directly impacts human and plant health, and directly forces the climate system through absorption of thermal radiation. Carbon monoxide is a chemical precursor of greenhouse gases CO2 and tropospheric O3, and is also an ideal tracer of transport processes due to its medium life time (weeks to months).\nThe Aqua-AIRS and Aura-OMI instruments in the NASA “A-Train”, CrIS and OMPS instruments on the NOAA Suomi-NPP, IASI and GOME-2 on METOP and TROPOMI aboard the Sentinel 5 precursor (S5p) have the potential to provide the synoptic chemical and dynamical context for ozone necessary to quantify long-range transport at global scales and to provide an anchor to the near-term constellation of geostationary sounders: NASA TEMPO, ESA Sentinel 4, and the Korean GEMS. We introduce the JPL MUlti-SpEctral, MUlti-SpEcies, MUlti-SatEllite (MUSES) retrieval algorithm, which ingests panspectral observations across multiple platforms in a non-linear optimal estimation framework. MUSES incorporates advances in remote sensing science developed during the EOS-Aura era including rigorous error analysis diagnostics and observation operators needed for trend analysis, climate model evaluation, and data assimilation. Its performance has been demonstrated through prototype studies for multi-satellite missions (AIRS, CrIS, TROPOMI, TES, OMI, and OMPS). We present joint tropospheric ozone retrievals from AIRS/OMI and CrIS/OMPS over global scales, and demonstrate the potential of joint carbon monoxide profiles from TROPOMI/CrIS. These results indicate that ozone can be retrieved with ~2 degrees of freedom for signal (dofs) in the troposphere, which is similar to TES. Joint CO profiles have dofs similar to the MOPITT multispectral retrieval but with higher spatial resolution and coverage. Consequently, multispectral retrievals show promise in providing continuity with NASA EOS observations and pave the way towards a new advanced atmospheric composition constellation.",

            "abstract": "In the search for habitable exoplanets, the planet’s surface temperature plays a crucial role. Unfortunately, direct measurements of surface temperature are not available at this time. Many physical processes influence the surface temperature distribution of a planet. However, the dominating influence is an energy balance between the stellar radiation input and the radiative surface loss of heat. With the further assumptions of a uniform planetary surface temperature, no filtering of the incoming radiation, and black body emission, the only variables are the stellar luminosity and the radial distance of the exoplanet from the star. For the solar system, agreement with observations is quite good except for Venus. The agreement is good for both the inner planets and the outer planets.\nIn this paper we systematically look at methods of improving the zero order approach given above.\nWe consider the filtering of the incoming radiation and the grey body emission. This accounts for the greenhouse effect and can explain the surface temperature of Venus. We systematically vary the filtering of incoming radiation and the emissivities of the daytime and nighttime surfaces. There is evidence that greenhouse heating on the Earth is primarily at nighttime. Different emissivities can explain this effect.\nIt is straightforward to extend the energy balance analysis to include the latitude dependence of surface temperature. Good agreement is obtained at low latitudes but temperature buffering and heat transport by the oceans and atmosphere are clearly important at high latitudes.\nIt is also straightforward to estimate the difference between the daytime and nighttime temperatures. The important parameter is the rotation rate of the exoplanet. The roles of the oceans and the atmosphere in moderating this difference on the Earth will be discussed.\nSome exoplanets are sufficiently close to their star to have temperatures above the melting temperatures and even the vaporization temperatures of silicate rocks. The roles of a global magma ocean and rates of vaporization will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Repeated high-precision gravity measurements made at Mount St. Helens (WA) have revealed systematic temporal variations in the gravity field several years after the end of the 2004-2008 dome-building eruption. Changes in gravity with respect to a stable reference station 36 km NW of the volcano were measured at 10 sites on the volcanic edifice and at 4 sites far afield (10 to 36 km) from the summit in August 2010, August 2012 and August 2014. After simulating and removing the gravity signal associated with changes in mass of the crater glacier, the local hydrothermal aquifer, and vertical deformation, the residual gravity field observed at sites near the volcano’s summit significantly increased with respect to the stable reference site during 2010–2012 (maximum change 48 ± 15 mgal). No significant change was measured during 2012-2014. The pattern of gravity increase is radially symmetrical, with a half-width of about 2.5 km and a point of maximum change centered at the 2004-2008 lava dome. Forward modeling of residual gravity data using the same source geometry, depth, and location as that inferred from geodetic data (a spheroidal source centered 7.5 km beneath the 2004-2008 dome) indicates a mass increase rate of the order of 1011 kg/year. For a reasonable magma density (~2250 kg/m3), the volume rate of magma intrusion beneath the summit region inferred from gravity (~ 0.1 km3/yr) greatly exceeds the volume inferred from inversion of geodetic data (0.001 km3/yr between 2008-2011), suggesting that either magma compressibility or other processes are important aspects of magma storage at Mount St. Helens, or that the data argue for a different source.",

During Arctic springtime, the heterogeneous chemical cycles (often called the “bromine explosion”) produce high levels of bromine monoxide (BrO), through reactions on saline snow, ice, and/or aerosol surfaces. Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measured BrO at Barrow, AK, from 2008-2009 and 2012-2015, as well at various locations above the frozen Arctic Ocean with O-Buoys in 2008 and 2011-2015. Observed BrO levels drop suddenly during late spring (May-June) and generally do not recover, which indicates the bromine explosion cycle can no longer produce significant amounts of BrO. We have established, through an objective algorithm, the local day of year of this drop in BrO as the “seasonal end.” Additionally, in about half of the years, “recurrence” events were observed where BrO levels recover for at least a day. This study investigates the environmental factors influencing seasonal end and recurrence events including: temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and snowmelt. Analysis of BrO and air temperature revealed the temperature reaches 0°C within five days of the seasonal end event; however, temperatures drop below freezing during a recurrence event. In addition, there are periods where the temperature remains below freezing, but no recurrence event is observed. This BrO and temperature analysis indicates above-freezing air temperature prevents reactive bromine release; however, it is not the only environmental factor influencing this heterogeneous recycling. Further analysis of additional environmental influences on the bromine explosion cycle could help to better understand and model bromine chemistry in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) are an important component of atmospheric dynamics. AGW forcing plays a key role in large-scale circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere. From troposphere to mesosphere, wave processes are apparently dominated by those AGWs that are generated by moist convection, shear flow instabilities, jets, atmospheric fronts, and interaction of winds with the Earth’s topography. Recent theoretical analysis of the effects of atmospheric loading on oceanic waves led to suggestion that infragravity waves (IGW), i.e., long surface gravity waves in the ocean with periods longer than 30 s, can radiate AGWs and account for significant part of the wave activity observed in the upper atmosphere at frequencies between about 0.1 and 3.5 mHz, or wave periods between about 5 min and 3 h (Godin et al., Earth, Planets and Space, 2015). AGWs of oceanic origin typically have high horizontal phase speeds and can escape the critical level filtering. While hardly observable in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, AGWs of oceanic origin were suggested to play a much larger role at thermospheric heights and potentially have a significant effect on thermosphere dynamics (Godin et al., Earth, Planets and Space, 2015). In this paper, we report a definitive experimental demonstration of thermospheric waves being driven by the ocean. Bottom pressure recorders of two Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) stations located off the US East Coast have been used to measure IGW spectra. Wave activity in the thermosphere has been quantified using Dynasonde radar system located at Wallops Island, Virginia. Over a 9-month observation period, variations of IGW and AGW spectral amplitudes demonstrate large, statistically significant correlation in a broad range of frequencies (0.2–3.4 mHz) and altitudes (140–290 km). Peak correlation values (~0.55) indicate that waves radiated by the ocean represent a major constituent of the thermospheric wave activity.",

            "abstract": "Low-lying coasts are often characterized by barriers islands, shore-parallel stretches of sand separated from the mainland by marshes and lagoons. We built an exploratory numerical model to examine the morphological feedbacks within an idealized barrier – marshes –lagoon system and predict its evolution under projected rates of sea level rise and sediment supply to the backbarrier environment. Our starting point is a recently developed morphodynamic model, which couples shoreface evolution and overwash processes in a dynamic framework. As such, the model is able to capture dynamics not reproduced by morphokinematic models, which advect geometries without specific concern to processes. These dynamics include periodic barrier retreat due to time lags in the shoreface response to barrier overwash, height drowning due to insufficient overwash fluxes as sea level rises, and width drowning, which occurs when the shoreface response rate is insufficient to maintain the barrier geometry during overwash-driven landward migration. We extended the model by coupling the barrier model with a model for the evolution of the marsh platform and the boundary between the marsh and the adjacent lagoon. The coupled model explicitly describes marsh edge processes and accounts for the modification of the wave regime associated with lagoon width (fetch). Model results demonstrate that changes in factors that are not typically associated with the dynamics of coastal barriers, such as the lagoon width and the rate of export/import of sediments from and to the lagoon, can lead to previously unidentified complex responses of the coupled system. In particular, a wider lagoon in the backbarrier, and/or a reduction in the supply of muddy sediments to the backbarrier, can increase barrier retreat rates and even trigger barrier drowning. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating backbarrier dynamics in models that aim at predicting the response of barrier systems.",

            "abstract": "Bar forms in wide sandy rivers store sediment, control channel hydraulics, and are fundamental units of riverine ecosystems. Bar form height is often used as a measure of channel depth in ancient fluvial deposits and is also a crucially important measure of habitat quality in modern rivers. In the Great Plains of North America, priority bird species use emergent bars to nest, and sandbar heights are a direct predictor of flood hazard for bird nests. Our current understanding of controls on bar height are limited to few datasets and ad hoc observations from specific settings. We here examine a new dataset of bar heights and explore models of bar growth.\nWe present bar a height dataset from the Platte and Niobrara Rivers in Nebraska, and an unchannelized reach of the Missouri River along the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Bar height data are normalized by flow frequency, and we examine parsimonious statistical models between expected controls (depth, stage, discharge, flow duration, work etc.) and maximum bar heights. From this we generate empirical-statistical models of maximum bar height for wide, sand-bedded rivers in the Great Plains of the United States and rivers of similar morphology elsewhere.\nMigration of bar forms is driven by downstream slip-face additions of sediment sourced from their stoss sides, but bars also sequester sediment and grow vertically and longitudinally. We explore our empirical data with a geometric-kinematic model of bar growth driven by sediment transport from smaller-scale bedforms. Our goal is to understand physical limitations on bar growth and geometry, with implications for interpreting the rock record and predicting physically-driven riverine habitat variables.",

            "abstract": "Low-energy (<10 eV) ion upflows associated with ambipolar ion acceleration in the cusp/cleft and polar cap regions are investigated using conjunctions of the Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (e-POP) satellite, the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR-N) and the DMSP satellites in June 2014. e-POP encountered the cusp/cleft ion fountain at 10-14 MLT and around 1000 km altitude during these experiments. Such intermediate-altitude observations of ion upflow have been sampled only rarely by previous satellite missions and ground-based radars. The Suprathermal Electron Imager (SEI) onboard e-POP measures two-dimensional ion distribution functions with a frame rate of 100 images per second, from which, high-precision energy and angle information of entering ions can be inferred. Large field-aligned ion bulk flow velocities (2.5 km/s) are estimated from the angle information with a resolution of the order of 25 m/s. The ion velocities were, in general, upward in the cusp region and downward in the polar cap region. The ion temperatures have been resolved by investigating the slop shape of the distribution function. It has been found that only weak perpendicular (to B) heating occurred during these events, which when combined with the simultaneous soft electron precipitation observed by the DMSP SSJ/4 instrument, suggests that ambipolar electric fields play a dominant role in accelerating ions upward at and below 1000 km. Also, structured DC field-aligned currents derived from the magnetic field instrument (MGF) onboard e-POP are found to be well-correlated with upflow velocities. In addition, ion composition information is available from e-POP’s ion mass spectrometer (IRM). Oxygen ions (O+) were found to dominate (85%) in the identified events, accompanied by a small fraction (15%) of hydrogen ions (H+) and helium ions (He+). We will compare these in situ measurements with RISR-N observations in order to further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for, and the three-dimensional structure of, the cusp ion fountain.\nAcknowledgement: This research is supported by Eyes High Doctoral Recruitment Scholarship at University of Calgary.",

            "abstract": "Discharge of water into ice-covered arctic lakes during snowmelt can be high, but no general framework exists to quantify the pathway of the flow into the lakes and the associated distribution of incoming resources including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or greenhouse gases. In this study, we characterize the fate of the snowmelt water flowing into 1.5 km2 Toolik Lake, Alaska, in 2014 and 2015. We deployed arrays with temperature, conductivity, and oxygen sensors in the water column over the winter, performed high temporal and spatial resolution CTD surveys on four 500 m to 1 km long transect lines during spring, and obtained correlative meteorological and discharge data. During both study spring periods, we observed different snowmelt inflow regimes based on the discharge rate (low and high) which led to differences in the extent of vertical and horizontal dilution of the lake water. Our first estimates of horizontal dispersion of snowmelt water in Toolik Lake under a high discharge regime are in the upper range of values found for ice-covered lakes (O ~ (102) cm2 s-1). In both years, the incoming water spread over ~75% of the basin near the surface with associated loading of DOC and methane. Spring 2014 was typical of other years with a gradual snowmelt and restricted depth of penetration of the incoming water. In fact, the increased density gradient in the upper few meters created conditions which retarded subsequent mixing at ice off. In contrast, persistent high pressures over the Alaskan region caused an exceptionally warm spring and rapid snowmelt in 2015. The subsequent warming of stream waters meant that the within lake vertical density gradient was weakened and facilitated later mixing. The differences in magnitude of discharge and temperature of incoming water during the more average and the warm springs enable interpretations and predictions of the fate of solutes flowing into lakes during snowmelt under variable weather regimes.",

            "abstract": "The 2004–2008 dome-building eruption at Mount St. Helens ended during the winter of 2007–2008 at a time when field observations were hampered by persistent bad weather. As a result, recognizing the end of the eruption was challenging. Also challenging was the fact that signs of continued eruption were increasingly subtle — earthquakes were small, deformation signals tiny, gas content close to background — and observing these phenomena was critically dependent on recordings and measurements made close (< 2 km) to the vent. In hindsight, the end of the eruption was presaged by a slight increase in seismicity in December 2007 that culminated on January 12–13, 2008, with a flurry of more than 500 events, most of which occurred in association with several tremor-like signals and a spasmodic burst of long-period earthquakes. At about the same time, a series of regular, localized, small-amplitude tilt events — thousands of which had been recorded during earlier phases of the eruption — came to an end. Thereafter, seismicity declined to 10–20 events per day until January 27–28, when a spasmodic burst of about 50 volcano-tectonic earthquakes occurred over a span of 3 hours. This was followed by a brief return of repetitive “drumbeat” earthquakes that characterized much of the eruption. By January 31, seismicity had declined to 1–2 earthquakes per day, a rate similar to pre-eruption levels. We attribute the tilt and seismic observations to progressive stagnation of an increasingly stiffened plug of magma in the upper part of the conduit. Upward movement of the plug ceased when the excess driving pressure, which had gradually decreased throughout the eruption as a result of reservoir deflation and increasing overburden from the growing dome, was overcome by increasing sidewall friction as a result of cooling and crystallization of the plug.",

            "abstract": "The planet Mercury is enveloped in a tenuous atmosphere, the result of a delicate balance between poorly understood sources and sinks (Killen et al, 2007). Meteoroid impacts are a contributing source process (eg Wurz et al, 2010), but their importance compared to other production mechanisms is uncertain.\nKillen and Hahn (2015) found that seasonal variations in Mercury's calcium exosphere as observed by the MASCS spectrometer onboard the MESSENGER spacecraft (Burger et al, 2014) may be due to impact vaporization of surface material by the infall of interplanetary dust. However, an additional dust source was required to explain a Ca excess at a True Anomaly Angle (TAA) of 25±5 deg. Killen and Hahn suggested that dust from comet 2P/Encke, crossing Mercury's orbital plane at TAA=45 deg, may be the culprit.\nWe have simulated numerically the stream of meteoroids ejected from Encke to test the Killen and Hahn conjecture. We find that Encke particles evolving solely under the gravity of the major planets and the Sun encounter Mercury at TAA=50-60 deg, well after the peak of the Ca excess emission. However, the addition of Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag in our model couples the age and size of the meteoroids to the TAA at encounter, causing smaller, older particles to encounter Mercury progressively earlier in the Hermean year. In particular, mm-sized grains ejected between 10 and 20 kyr ago impact on the nightside hemisphere of Mercury at TAA = 350−30 deg, near the observed peak time of the exospheric feature.\nDuring this presentation, we will describe our model results and discuss their implications for the physical mechanism that injects impact-liberated Ca into sunlight as well as the origin and evolution of the Encke stream of meteoroids.\nAstronomical research at the Armagh Observatory is funded by the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).

            "abstract": "The measurement of the change in above ground biomass (AGB) is key for understanding the carbon sink/source nature of tropical forests. Interferometric X-band radar from the only orbiting interferometer, TanDEM-X, shows sensitivity to standing biomass up to at least 300 Mg/ha. This sensitivity may be due in part to the propagation of the shorter X-band wavelength (0.031 m) through holes in the canopy. This talk focuses on estimating the change in AGB over time. Interferometric baselines from TanDEM-X have been obtained in Tapajós National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon over a 4-year period, from 2011 to 2015. Lidar measurements were also acquired during this period. Field measurements of height, height-to-base-of-crown, species, diameter, and position were acquired in 2010, 2013, and 2015. We show interferometric phase height changes, and suggest how these phase height changes are related to biomass change. First we show height changes between baselines separated by one month, over which we expect no change in AGB, to evaluate precision. We find an RMS of <2 m for ~85 stands in the phase height over one month, corresponding to about a 10% measurement of change, which suggests we can detect about a 17 Mg/ha change in AGB at Tapajos. In contrast, interferometric height changes over the period 2011 to 2014 have larger RMS scatters of > 3 m, due to actual change. Most stands show changes in interferometric phase height consistent with regrowth (~10 Mg/ha/yr), and several stands show abrupt, large changes in phase height (>10 m) due to logging and natural disturbance. At the end of 2015, we will acquire more TanDEM-X data over Tapajos, including an area subjected to selective logging. We are doing “before” (March 2015) and “after” (October 2015) fieldwork to be able to understand the signature of change due to selective logging in TanDEM-X interferometric data.",

            "abstract": "Accurate prediction of tropical cyclone track is critical for high-impact weather preparedness, especially as the storm is near the coastal region. The track prediction for super typhoon Megi (2010) in the western Pacific was notoriously bad as most operational models predicated a mainly westward movement while Megi actually made a northward turning after it has crossed the Philippines islands. In this study, we try to understand this rather irregular motion for Megi. Examination of NCEP reanalyzed fields indicated that during this period a low-frequency (10-60-day) monsoon gyre in the vicinity of Megi may have interactions with the latter. To understand the effect of the low-frequency mode on the movement of Megi, numerical experiments were designed and conducted. The total flow from the analyzed field is separated into 1) a slowly varying background state, 2) a 10-60-day low frequency component representing the monsoon gyre, and 3) a 10-day high-pass filtered component representing Megi. In the control experiment, the total field containing all three components is used as the initial and lateral boundary conditions, and the WRF model is able to simulate Megi’s sharp northward turning successfully. In the second experiment, the 10-60-day mode is removed from the initial and lateral boundary fields. In the absence of the low-frequency mode, Megi moves westward and only slightly northwestward without turning north. When the vortex representing Megi was removed, the movement of the monsoon gyre was also affected. These experiments indicated strong interactions between Megi and the monsoon gyre. The interactions and the way the monsoon gyre actually affected the track of Megi will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Turbulence has been suggested as one possible mechanism to accelerate the onset of autoconversion and widen the process “bottleneck” in the formation of warm rain. While direct observation of the collision-coalescence process remains beyond the reach of present-day instrumentation, co-located sampling of atmospheric motion and the drop size spectrum allows for comparison of in situ observations with simulation results to test representations of drop growth processes.\nThis study evaluates whether observations of drops in the autoconversion regime can be replicated using our best theoretical understanding of collision-coalescence. A state-of-the-art turbulent collisional growth model is applied to a bin microphysics scheme within a large-eddy simulation such that the full range of cloud drop growth mechanisms are represented (i.e. CCN activation, condensation, collision-coalescence, mixing, etc.) at realistic atmospheric conditions. The spectral resolution of the microphysics scheme has been quadrupled in order to (a) more closely match the resolution of the observational instrumentation and (b) limit numerical diffusion, which leads to spurious broadening of the drop size spectrum at standard mass-doubling resolution. We compare simulated cloud drop spectra with those obtained from aircraft observations to assess the quality and limits of our theoretical knowledge. The comparison is performed for two observational cases from the Physics of Stratocumulus Top (POST) field campaign: 12 August 2008 (drizzling night flight, Rmax~2 mm/d) and 15 August 2008 (nondrizzling day flight, Rmax<0.5 mm/d). Both flights took place off the coast of Monterey, CA and the two cases differ in their radiative cooling rates, shear, cloud-top temperature and moisture jumps, and entrainment rates. Initial results from a collision box model suggest that enhancements of approximately 2 orders of magnitude over theoretical turbulent collision rates may be necessary to reproduce the observations.",

            "abstract": "In weather or climate models, the earth’s surface is the boundary that needs to be resolved physically. The condition of atmosphere aloft (e.g., wind, temperature and humidity) is highly dependent on the momentum, sensible heat and latent heat fluxes at surface. However, parameterization of surface turbulent fluxes under unstably/stably stratified conditions has always been a challenge. Currently, the exchanges of momentum and heat fluxes between the earth’s surface and the atmosphere are usually calculated with various schemes based on Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. These schemes either need iterations or suffer low accuracy, which might consume excessive CPU time or could lead to unrealistic simulation results. In this paper, a non-iterative scheme is proposed to approach the classic iterative computation results using multiple regressions.The range −5 ≤ RiB ≤ 2.5, 10 ≤ z/z0m ≤ 105 and −0.5 ≤ ln(z0m/z0h) ≤ 30 is divided into several regions, and in each of the regions, multiple linear regression is performed to obtain non-iterative solutions for surface fluxes. As compared to the other most recent non-iterative schemes, we show that the suggested scheme has the smallest bias. The maximum relative errors of turbulent transfer coefficients for momentum (CM) and sensible heat (CH), as compared to those obtained from the classic iterative method, are always smaller than 2% in unstable condition and 12% in stable condition from our new non-iterative scheme.",

            "abstract": "Uncovering universal early warning signals for critical transitions has become a coveted goal in diverse scientific disciplines, ranging from climate science to financial mathematics. There has been a flurry of recent research proposing such signals, with increasing autocorrelation and increasing variance being among the most widely discussed candidates. A number of studies have suggested that increasing autocorrelation alone may suffice to signal an impending transition, although some others have questioned this. Here, we consider variance and autocorrelation in the context of sea ice loss in an idealized model of the global climate system. The model features no bifurcation, nor increased rate of retreat, as the ice disappears. Nonetheless, the autocorrelation of summer sea ice area is found to increase with diminishing sea ice cover in a global warming scenario. The variance, by contrast, decreases. A simple physical mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of increasing autocorrelation but not variance in the model when there is no approaching bifurcation. Additionally, a similar mechanism is shown to allow an increase in both indicators with no physically attainable bifurcation. This implies that relying on autocorrelation and variance as early warning signals can raise false alarms in the climate system, warning of “tipping points” that are not actually there.",

            "abstract": "Io, the innermost of the Jupiter's four Galilean moons, is a remarkable object in the Solar System, due to its intense and energetic volcanic activity. The volcanic sulfur and oxygen in Io's tenuous atmosphere escapes forming an extended neutral cloud around Io and Jupiter. Subsequently, by ionization and pickup ions, a ring of charged particles encircling Jupiter is created, forming the Io plasma torus. Considering this scenario, it is reasonable to expect that the Io plasma torus should be affected by changes in Io's volcanism.\nInteractions between Io and the Jovian environment is unique and yet not very well understood. Here we present two sets of observations. One from the Galileo Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (NIMS) instrument, which obtained spectral image cubes between 0.7 and 5.2 microns. The other dataset is from ground-based observations of the [SII] 6731 Å emission lines from the Io plasma torus, obtained at McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope, at Kitt Peak. Our dataset from the [SII] 6731 Å emission lines cover more years than the one from the NIMS data. The years presented in this work for a comparative study are from 1998 through 2001.\nUsing the NIMS instrument we were able to identify which volcanoes were active and measure their level of activity. From the [SII] 6731 Å emission lines we were able to trace the densest part of the torus and also the brightness of both ansa. By comparing the results from the Galileo instrument and the ground-based observations, we are exploring how the Io plasma torus responds to large eruptions from Io. We aim with this study to help improve our understanding of this complex coupled system, Jupiter-Io.",

            "abstract": "Low crystallinity rhyolite lavas and tuffs from the Yellowstone-Snake River plain system were long-thought to erupt at high 800-900 °C temperatures with evidence derived from experimental work and geothermometry (e.g., QUILF, Ti-in-quartz). Despite this evidence, newer experimental phase equilibria studies as well as a reformulation of zircon saturation temperatures support lower temperature magma eruption conditions. Here we present two independent lines of evidence for 850 °C and greater temperatures.\nWe present high precision oxygen isotope thermometry for coexisting quartz, glass, pyroxene, and magnetite in order make temperature estimates independent of phase equilibria. For all analyzed Snake River Plain-Yellowstone rhyolites, we determine 800-1100 °C temperatures for clinopyroxene and 850-1100 °C temperatures for magnetite. Extremely slow oxygen diffusion in pyroxene will preserve oxygen isotope crystal composition for millions of years stored at magmatic temperatures. Interestingly, oxygen in magnetite will reequilibrate in <1000 years, so systematically higher magnetite-quartz temperatures suggests a short lifespan of magmas from liquidus crystallization to eruption.\nIn an alternative approach, we have modeled the physical emplacement of the large volume (up to 70 km3) rhyolite lavas of the recent Central Plateau Member group. Using simple solutions to gravity-driven viscous fluid flow, we have made first-order estimates for extremely high discharge rates in order to enable effusion of sufficient volume in relatively axisymmetric morphologies—where glacial ice caps or prexisiting topography did not otherwise restrict flow. Using these results and simple conductive cooling models, we show that flows erupted at >800 °C and probably ~850 °C in order to be emplaced before cooling below the melt-glass transition and forming a more dome-like and lobate morphology.",

            "abstract": "In southern Africa, both the Archean and Proterozoic blocks have the topography 500-700 m higher than in any other craton worldwide, except for the Tanzanian craton. An unusually high topography may be caused by a low density of the cratonic lithospheric mantle and/or by the dynamic support of the mantle with origin below the depth of isostatic compensation (assumed to be at the lithosphere base). We use free-board constraints to examine the relative contributions of the both factors to surface topography in the cratons of southern Africa and present regional model of density structure of the lithospheric mantle. The results indicate that 0.5-1.0 km of topography requires the dynamic contribution from the sublithospheric mantle because it cannot be explained by the lithosphere structure within the petrologically permitted range of mantle densities.\nThe calculated lithospheric mantle density values are in an overall agreement with xenolith-based data and show an overall trend in mantle density increase from Archean to younger lithospheric terranes. Notable exceptions are the Limpopo belt and the Bushveld Intrusion Complex, which have an increased mantle density, probably as a result of melt-metasomatism. The Western Cape Fold Belt has a moderately depleted mantle with density within the range expected for Phanerozoic mantle, while mantle densities beneath the Eastern Cape Fold Belt require the presence of a significant amount of eclogite in the mantle.\nMantle density structure correlates with distribution of kimberlites and with seismic velocity contrast across the Moho: kimberlite-rich regions have sharp Moho and low-density (3.32-3.33 g/cc) mantle, while kimberlite-poor regions have transient Moho and denser mantle (3.34-3.35 g/cc). We explain this pattern by melt-metasomatism which affects both mantle depletion and the Moho sharpness. We also find that regions with high mantle density host non-diamondiferous kimberlites, while diamondiferous kimberlites are chiefly restricted to regions with low-dense mantle. From comparison of density anomalies in the lithospheric mantle with seismic Vp, Vs velocities at 100-150 km depth we conclude that density-velocity relationship in mantle peridotite is strongly non-unique and cannot be parameterized by one parameter such as Mg#.",

            "abstract": "The effects of climate change are expected to reduce the ability of soil-based onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), to treat domestic wastewater. In the northeastern U.S., the projected increase in atmospheric temperature, elevation of water tables from rising sea levels, and heightened precipitation will reduce the volume of unsaturated soil and oxygen available for treatment. Incomplete removal of contaminants may lead to transport of pathogens, nutrients, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to groundwater, increasing the risk to public health and likelihood of eutrophying aquatic ecosystems. Advanced OWTS, which include pre-treatment steps and provide unsaturated drainfields of greater volume relative to conventional OWTS, are expected to be more resilient to climate change. We used intact soil mesocosms to quantify water quality functions for two advanced shallow narrow drainfield types and a conventional drainfield under a current climate scenario and a moderate climate change scenario of 30 cm rise in water table and 5°C increase in soil temperature. While no fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) was released under the current climate scenario, up to 109 CFU FCB/mL (conventional) and up to 20 CFU FCB/mL (shallow narrow) were released under the climate change scenario. Total P removal rates dropped from 100% to 54% (conventional) and 71% (shallow narrow) under the climate change scenario. Total N removal averaged 17% under both climate scenarios in the conventional, but dropped from 5.4% to 0% in the shallow narrow under the climate change scenario, with additional leaching of N in excess of inputs indicating release of previously held N. No significant difference was observed between scenarios for BOD removal. The initial data indicate that while advanced OWTS retain more function under the climate change scenario, all three drainfield types experience some diminished treatment capacity.",

Threshold friction velocity (u*t ), a necessary parameter to estimate wind erosion potential, is difficult to accurately measure; methods to estimate u*t from alternate measurements would be useful. We measured u*t and sediment production rate with a portable wind tunnel, and quantified relationships between u*t and eleven easier-to-measure soil surface properties for both undisturbed and disturbed lacustrine and alluvial soils in Snake Valley, Utah. Soil surface type and disturbance significantly influenced u*t, sediment production rate, and the relationships between u*t and easier-to-measure soil surface properties. Only soils with surficial rock fragments and weak physical crusts reached u*t before disturbance, whereas all surface types reached u*t following disturbance. Soils with weak physical crusts had the lowest average u*t and highest average sediment production rate before and after disturbance. Surprisingly, however, disturbance reduced sediment production rate. Soils with weak physical crusts and surficial rock cover are likely the most susceptible to wind erosion and subsequent dust generation both before and after disturbance. Silt concentration and penetrometer resistance were significant predictors of u*t in undisturbed soils with weak physical crusts and surficial rock cover. Following disturbance, clay concentration and aggregate stability were significant predictors for soils with hard salt crusts and surficial rock cover. Prediction of u*t using alternate measurements is promising, but measurement uncertainty must be considered.",

Existing models used for lava flow simulation range in assumptions, complexity, and the degree to which they have been validated against analytical solutions, experiments, and natural observations.

Using new benchmark scenarios defined in Cordonnier et al.

Results are compared to analytical theory, analogue and molten basalt experiments, and measurements from natural lava flows. Our study highlights the strengths and weakness of each code, including accuracy and computational costs, and provides insights regarding code selection. We apply the best-fit codes to simulate the lava flows in Harrat Rahat, a predominately mafic volcanic field in Saudi Arabia. Input parameters are assembled from rheology and volume measurements of past flows using geochemistry, crystallinity, and present-day lidar and photogrammetric digital elevation models.

Both SSEs occurred in adjacent regions of the Bungo channel following long-term SSEs in the Bungo channel in 2003 and 2010. The estimated slip was 1-5 cm/year that lasted at least 1 and 1.5 years after 2004 and 2011, respectively. As the low-frequency tremor in the downdip region is activated at the same time as the Bungo channel long-term SSE, a spatiotemporal correlation was observed between the detected SSEs and long-term tremor activity in the downdip region.

            "abstract": "This project investigated the effect of reducing agents on the degradation of tetrachloroethene(PCE) by Fe(II)/Fe(III) catalyzed sodium percarbonate (SPC). SPC possesses similar function as liquid H2O2, such that free H2O2 is released into solution when percarbonate is mixed with water. The addition of reducing agents, including hydroxylamine hydrochloride, sodium sulfite, ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate, accelerated the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redoxcycle, leading to a relatively steady Fe(II) concentration and higher production of free radicals. This, in turn, resulted in enhanced PCE oxidation by SPC, with almost complete PCE removal obtained for appropriate Fe and SPC concentrations.The results of chemical probe tests, using nitrobenzene and carbon tetrachloride, demonstrated that HO● was the predominant radical in the system and that O2●−played a minor role. This was further confirmed by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and salicylic acid hydroxylationanalysis by high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC). PCE degradation decreased significantly with the addition of isopropanol, a strong HO● scavenger, supporting the hypothesis that HO● was primarily responsible for PCE degradation. It should be noted that the release of Cl- was slightly delayed in the first 20 mins, indicating that intermediate products were produced. However, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis did not detect any chlorinated organic compound except PCE, indicating these intermediates were quickly degraded, which resulted in the complete conversion of PCE to CO2. In conclusion, the use of reducing agents to enhance Fe(II)/Fe(III) catalyzed SPC oxidation appears to be a promising approach for the rapid degradation of organic contaminants in groundwater.",

The water-bearing unit is 2.8 to 3.0 m thick Plinian pumice fall from the Holocene eruption of Mount Mazama, Cascade Range. The perched pumice aquifer is underlain by low permeability regolith and bedrock. Disruption of the internal continuity of the Plinian pumice fall by fluvial and lacustrine processes resulted in hydrogeologic environments that include fens, wet meadows, and areas of shallow water table. Slopes are low and surface and groundwater pathways follow patterns inherited from the pre-eruption landscape. Discharge for streams and springs and depth to water table measured in open-ended piezometers slotted in the pumice aquifer have been measured between March and October, WY 2011 through WY2015. Yearly occupation on same date has been conducted for middle April, June 1st, and end of October. WY2011 and WY2012 received more precipitation than the 30 year average while WY2014 was the third driest year in 30 years of record. WY2014 and WY2015 provide an interesting contrast. Drought conditions dominated WY2014 while WY2015 was distinct in that the normal cold-season snow pack was replaced by rainfall. Cumulative precipitation exceeded the 30-year average between October and March. The pumice aquifer of wet meadows and areas of shallow water table experienced little recharge in WY2015. Persistence of widespread diffuse discharge from fens declined by middle summer as potentiometric surfaces lowered into confining peat layers or in some settings into the pumice aquifer. Recharge of the perched pumice aquifer in rain-dominated WY2015 was similar to or less than in the snow-dominated drought of WY2014. Rain falling on frozen ground drove runoff rather than aquifer recharge.",

            "abstract": "The goal of the Lunar Resource Prospector Mission (RPM) is to capture and identify volatiles species within the top meter of the lunar regolith. The RPM drill has been designed to 1. Generate cuttings and place them on the surface for analysis by the the Near InfraRed Volatiles Spectrometer Subsystem (NIRVSS), and 2. Capture cuttings and transfer them to the Oxygen and Volatile Extraction Node (OVEN) coupled with the Lunar Advanced Volatiles Analysis (LAVA) subsystem.\nThe RPM drill is based on the Mars Icebreaker drill developed for capturing samples of ice and ice cemented ground on Mars. The drill weighs approximately 10 kg and is rated at ~300 Watt. It is a rotary-percussive, fully autonomous system designed to capture cuttings for analysis. The drill consists of: 1. Rotary-Percussive Drill Head, 2. Sampling Auger, 3. Brushing station, 4. Z-stage, 5. Deployment stage.\nTo reduce sample handling complexity, the drill auger is designed to capture cuttings as opposed to cores. High sampling efficiency is possible through a dual design of the auger. The lower section has deep and low pitch flutes for retaining of cuttings. The upper section has been designed to efficiently move the cuttings out of the hole. The drill uses a “bite” sampling approach where samples are captured in ~10 cm intervals.\nThe first generation drill was tested in Mars chamber as well as in Antarctica and the Arctic. It demonstrated drilling at 1-1-100-100 level (1 meter in 1 hour with 100 Watt and 100 N Weight on Bit) in ice, ice cemented ground, soil, and rocks. The second generation drill was deployed on a Carnegie Mellon University rover, called Zoe, and tested in Atacama in 2012. The tests demonstrated fully autonomous sample acquisition and delivery to a carousel. The third generation drill was tested in NASA GRC’s vacuum chamber, VF13, at 10-5 torr and approximately 200 K. It demonstrated successful capture and transfer of icy samples to a crucible.\nThe drill has been modified and integrated onto the NASA JSC RPM rover. It has been undergoing testing in a lab and in the field during the Summer of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Despite ample water supply, vegetation dynamics are subject to seasonal water stress in large fraction of tropical forests. These seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) account for over 40% of tropical forests, harbor high biodiversity, have large potential carbon sink due to forest recovery from human disturbance and also play a critical role in global carbon budget and inter-annual variations. Plants in this biome display notably diverse responses to seasonal and inter-annual variations of water availability, especially inter-specific variations in canopy seasonality and biomass growth. Current process-based dynamic vegetation models cannot represent these diversities and are shown to perform poorly on simulating drought responses of tropical forests, calling into question of their ability to accurately simulate future changes in SDTFs. Accumulated field observations, suggest that hydrological niche separation driven by coordinated plant functional traits is associated with plants’ performance under drought. Yet, it remains not clear whether the physiology-level hydrological niche separation can explain the ecosystem-level diversity observed in SDTFs. Here, we test the theory with a model-data fusion approach. We implemented a new plant hydrodynamic module that is able to track leaf water potential at sub-daily scale in ED2 model. We further incorporated a hydrological niche separation scheme based on a meta-data analysis of key functional traits in SDTFs. Simulated ecological patterns with and without hydrological niche separation were then compared with remote-sensing and long-term field observations from an SDTF site in Palo Verde, Costa Rica. Using several numerical experiments, we specifically examine the following questions: (i) Whether hydrological niche separation can explain the diversity in canopy seasonality and biomass growth? (ii) How important are the yet uncertain belowground functional traits, especially root profile in determining canopy seasonality? (iii) Whether the new hydrological niche separation scheme also works in different precipitation regimes? And (iv) how important is functional diversity in plants’ responses to water stress in predicting vegetation dynamics in SDTFs.",

            "abstract": "Saturation excess overland flow generated in near-stream saturated areas is a mixture of rainfall and exfiltrating sub-surface water that can be quickly transported to the stream network during rainfall events. While many isotope hydrograph separation studies have demonstrated generally the dominance of pre-event water in the channel hydrograph, the mixing processes within the saturated area itself are poorly understood. Here, we isolated and measured discharge generated within a 100-m2 saturated area of a headwater reach of the 45-ha Weierbach catchment (Luxembourg). We quantified surface saturation using ground-based thermal infrared imagery and in-site piezometers throughout a series of rainfall events. This, combined with isotope and geochemical tracing enabled us to assess the role of surface saturation dynamics on mixing and storm hydrograph response. Surprisingly, our detailed analysis showed that surface saturation dynamics were weakly correlated to discharge and precipitation; cumulative rainfall on near-stream saturated areas alone was unable to explain the flow generated within this reach. Streamflow isotopic response was essentially unchanging within the 5-week monitoring period (-55 to -58 δ2D and -8.5 to -9 for δ18O ‰) suggesting that well-mixed streamflow sources that were little affected by rainfall sources. While Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ show slight flushing and dilution responses, riparian and streamflow sources responded differently across the event. Overall, groundwater exfiltration within the saturated area appeared to generate streamflow throughout the reach, effectively erasing any rainfall onto saturated area signal.",

            "abstract": "Minor and trace element chemistry, phase relations, rheology, thermal structure and the role of volatiles and their abundance in the deep Earth mantle are still far from fully explored, but fundamental to understanding the processes involved in Earth formation and evolution. Theory and high pressure experiments imply a significant water storage capacity of nominally anhydrous minerals, such as majoritic garnet, olivine, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, composing the Earth’s upper mantle and transition zone to a depth of 660 km. Studying the effect of water incorporation on chemical and physical mineral properties is of importance, because the presence of trace amounts of water, incorporated as OH through charge-coupled chemical substitutions into such nominally anhydrous high-pressure silicates, notably influences phase relations, melting behavior, conductivity, elasticity, viscosity and rheology. Knowledge of absolute water contents in nominally anhydrous minerals is essential for modeling the Earth’s interior water cycle. One of the most common and sensitive tools for water quantification is IR spectroscopy for which mineral-specific absorption coefficients are required. Such calibration constants can be derived from hydrogen concentrations determined by independent techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy or proton-proton(pp)-scattering. Here, analytical advances and mineral-specific IR absorption coefficients for the quantification of H2O in major phases of the Earth’s mantle will be discussed. Furthermore, new data from optical absorption measurements in resistively heated diamond-anvil cells at high pressures and temperatures up to 1000 K will be presented. Experiments were performed on synthetic single-crystals of olivine, ringwoodite, majoritic garnet, and Al-bearing phase D with varying iron, aluminum and OH contents to calculate radiative thermal conductivities and study their contribution to heat transfer in the Earth’s interior. Absorption band assignments, effects of pressure, temperature, iron and hydration on radiative thermal conductivities will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "This work studies Charon’s effects on the Pluto-solar wind interaction using a multifluid MHD model which simulates the interactions of Pluto and Charon with the solar wind and each other. Specifically, it investigates the magnetospheric dynamics of a two body system in which either one or both bodies posses an ionosphere. In order to more accurately capture the behavior of the Pluto-Charon system, ion-neutral interactions, including source and loss processes, have been incorporated into the model. Ion-neutral interactions are important due to the highly extended atmosphere in the system, with pick up ions having been detected several million kilometers upstream of the system by the PEPSSI instrument aboard New Horizons. In order to more fully characterize the system, simulations with various system geometries have been performed, in which Charon’s position relative to Pluto varies. In addition to the New Horizons system encounter geometry, simulations in which Charon is directly upstream and directly downstream of Pluto are considered. Depending on the bow shock stand-off distance upstream of Pluto, Charon could periodically pass outside of the shock. The results of this study demonstrate that in these circumstances Charon modifies the upstream flow, both in the case in which Charon possesses an ionosphere, and in the case in which Charon is without an ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Climate change poses many risks and challenges for the Arctic and sub-Arctic, including threats to infrastructure. The safety and stability of infrastructure in this region can be impacted by many factors including increased thawing of permafrost soils, reduced coastline protection due to declining arctic sea ice, and changes in inland flooding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is coordinating an effort to quantify physical and economic impacts of climate change on public infrastructure across the state of Alaska and estimate how global greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation may avoid or reduce these impacts. This research builds on the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA) project developed for the contiguous U.S., which is described in an EPA report released in June 2015. We are using a multi-model analysis focused primarily on the impacts of changing permafrost, coastal erosion, and inland flooding on a range of infrastructure types, including transportation (e.g. roads, airports), buildings and harbors, energy sources and transmission, sewer and water systems, and others. This analysis considers multiple global GHG emission scenarios ranging from a business as usual future to significant global action. These scenarios drive climate projections through 2100 spanning a range of outcomes to capture variability amongst climate models. Projections are being combined with a recently developed public infrastructure database and integrated into a version of the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) we are modifying for use in the Arctic and sub-Arctic region. The IPSS tool allows for consideration of both adaptation and reactive responses to climate change. Results of this work will address a gap in our understanding of climate change impacts in Alaska, provide estimates of the physical and economic damages we may expect with and without global GHG mitigation, and produce important insights about infrastructure vulnerabilities in response to warming at northern latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photoautotrophs, and arguably the most important primary producers on the planet, fixing carbon from dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the aquatic environment, and directly from atmospheric CO2 in terrestrial systems. Euendolithic cyanobacteria occupy a very specific niche, inside rocks, which can potentially preclude them from easily accessing those carbon pools, and yet, natural euendolithic communities can support food webs in habitats where they are prominent, such as in marine carbonate platforms and desert carbonate outcrops. In a recently proposed model describing the mechanism of cyanobacterial carbonate boring, we postulated that as the organism dissolves the mineral, liberated CO32- anions will be quickly converted to HCO3- and assimilated directly, making the cyanobacterium independent of external DIC pools for autotrophy. We used natural abundance and tracer stable carbon (13C) isotope analyses accompanied by nanoSIMS imaging in model laboratory systems of cultivated cyanobacteria and in natural mixed communities of marine euendoliths to study the ultimate source of carbon in their biomass. Our results clearly demonstrate that endolithic biomass of these cyanobacteria is significantly derived from mineral carbonate, as opposed to free-living or epilithic biomass, where the source is mixed or coming from the dissolved pool, this holds for model cultures as well as natural communities. In fact, we can increase the lifestyle preference of cultures for endolithic growth versus planktonic or benthic growth, by simply imposing an external DIC limitation in the presence of a carbonate substrate. Our results predict that benthic communities (extant or fossil) that rely heavily on primary production by euendolithic primary producers may show 13C signatures that mimic those of the surrounding carbonate substrate rather than from those of the local seawater.",

            "abstract": "A coupled sedimentary and hydrogeological model is used to quantify the impact of sedimentary heterogeneities and sinuosity on groundwater fluxes in an alluvial plain deposited by a meandering fluvial system. A 3D heterogeneous alluvial plain model is built with the stochastic/process-based model FLUMY, that simulates the evolution and the sedimentary processes of a meandering channel and its associated deposits. The resulting sedimentary blocks are translated in terms of hydrodynamic parameters (hydrofacies) and used in the 3D transient water transport model METIS.\nThe simulated domain is 10 m-thick and at a pluri-kilometric horizontal scale, allowing considering several meanders. A head gradient between the upstream and downstream limits is imposed. The river is considered as a constant-head boundary that decreases linearly along the channel centerline. A zero-flux condition is prescribed on the other boundaries. Several cases are studied, including different degrees of sinuosity and different configurations of sediment heterogeneity: (i) a homogeneous sandy aquifer (ii) single mud-filled oxbow lake in a sandy porous media, (iii) several mud-filled oxbow lakes in a sandy porous media, and (iv) “fully” heterogeneous alluvial plain including fine-grained overbank deposits, sandy point bars, mudplugs and sandy crevasse plays. We quantify the exchange rates and directions between the river and the aquifer along the channel centerline, the piezometric evolution and the water residence time in the heterogeneous alluvial plain.\nThis original method can improve our understanding of the functioning of alluvial corridors and evaluate the relevance of taking into account the structural heterogeneity of alluvial plains in larger regional hydrogeological models.",

Three biochars produced from corn stover (Zea mays L.), Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson and C.

The changes in chemical fractionation of soil carbon (soluble C, acid hydrolyzable C, total C, and δ13 C) and nitrogen (soluble N, acid hydrolyzable N, total N, and δ14 N) were monitored for two soil depths (0-7.5 and 7.5 – 15 cm). Soluble and acid hydrolyzable fractions of soil C and N were influenced by soil series and were not significantly affected by incorporation of biochars. Based on soil and plant samples to be collected in the fall of 2015, C and N budgets are being developed using isotopic and non-isotopic techniques. Laboratory studies showed that the mean residence time for biochars used in this study ranged from 400 to 666 years. Laboratory and field studies will be compared in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "We use mainly vertical-component geophone data within 2 km from the epicenter to invert for time-dependent moment tensors of the first four SPE explosions: SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3 and SPE-4Prime. We employ a one-dimensional (1D) velocity model developed from P- and Rg-wave travel times for Green’s function calculations. The attenuation structure of the model is developed from P- and Rg-wave amplitudes. We select data for the inversion based on the criterion that they show consistent travel times and amplitude behavior as those predicted by the 1D model. Due to limited azimuthal coverage of the sources and the mostly vertical-component-only nature of the dataset, only long-period, diagonal components of the moment tensors are well constrained. Nevertheless, the moment tensors, particularly their isotropic components, provide reasonable estimates of the long-period source amplitudes as well as estimates of corner frequencies, albeit with larger uncertainties. The estimated corner frequencies, however, are consistent with estimates from ratios of seismogram spectra from different explosions. These long-period source amplitudes and corner frequencies cannot be fit by classical P-wave explosion source models. The results motivate the development of new P-wave source models suitable for these chemical explosions. To that end, we fit inverted moment-tensor spectra by modifying the classical explosion model using regressions of estimated source parameters. Although the number of data points used in the regression is small, the approach suggests a way for the new-model development when more data are collected.",

            "abstract": "Mars has one of the unique environments in the solar system for the exploration of plasma waves. Mars does not have an intrinsic magnetosphere, but it has an induced magnetosphere due to the interaction of the solar wind with its ionosphere. Mars also possesses an extended exosphere, which spans beyond its bow shock. The interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere and the exosphere leads to excitation of low frequency waves that have frequencies near or below the proton gyro-frequency. MAVEN has been orbiting Mars since the late September of 2014, traversing through various regions of the Martian magnetosphere and the upstream region. MAVEN has a number of particle and field instruments for performing plasma diagnostics. Thus, for the first time at Mars, we have a complete set of plasma instruments for characterizing these low frequency plasma waves. The goal of this work is to distinguish the observed waves as one of the four low frequency wave modes (Alfven, fast, slow, and mirror) and to characterize their occurrence ratios and energy deposition in the various regions of the Martian magnetosphere and in the upstream region. To identify these waves, we use ratios and phase differences among the ion moment fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations. To measure the ion moment fluctuations, in particular, we use two of the MAVEN ion instruments, solar wind ion analyzer (SWIA) and suprathermal and thermal ion composition instrument (STATIC). We use the MAVEN magnetometer for obtaining the magnetic field fluctuations. SWIA and STATIC have sampling cadence of 4s, much higher than that of their predecessors flown to Mars, and this is often adequate to detect the low frequency waves at Mars. We find that the Alfven waves are the most dominant waves in the upstream region and in the Martian magnetosphere. Fast waves, on the other hand, have the second highest occurrence ratio and they are found frequently near the bow shock and near the magnetic pileup boundary. To characterize the energy deposition from these waves to the magnetosphere, we compute the Poynting vector using the ion and magnetic field data. The variability of the low frequency waves and their energy deposition to upstream conditions such as the solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF direction is studied in this work.",

However, while the TRMM mission has now ended, it is now time to change the radiometric transfer standard from the previous TMI to the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI).\nIn this paper, we conduct the inter-calibration between GMI and other imager instruments in its constellation using two different radiative transfer models (RTM), namely XCAL RTM which has been used by XCAL group over the past 10 years, and RSS RTM developed by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS). The main difference between these two RTMs lies in calculating the ocean surface emissivity which is crucial for the measurement of spaceborne microwave radiometers. By comparing the simulated Tb’s from two RTMs applied on 9 microwave channels ranging from 10 to 90 GHz, we are able to evaluate the robustness of our XCAL RTM, especially the Elsaesser Ocean Surface Emissivity model that has been used within this model.\nBesides discussing the reliability of these two RTMs, an XCAL approach known as Double Difference (DD) that has been developed and successfully validated by the Central Florida Remote Sensing Lab will be performed between GMI and its constellation imagers, from which the results will enable us to prescreen the consistency of GMI as the new radiometric transfer standard for imager radiometers as well as assessing the impact of the ocean surface emissivity on radiometric inter-calibration of radiometers at imager channels.\nIndex: Inter-satellite calibration, ocean surface emissivity, radiative transfer model, microwave radiometry",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) emissions in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) has been studied during the last decade. Our investigation, including observational studies using hydrological, biogeochemical, geophysical, geo-electrical, microbiological, and isotopic methods, and modeling efforts to assess current subsea permafrost state and the ESAS’ contribution to the regional CH4 budget, have clarified processes driving CH4 emissions in the ESAS and spilt some light on possible sources involvement. Despite some authors believe that CH4 fluxes from subsea permafrost in the ESAS will depend on rates of CH4 production in gradually thawing sediments while subsea permafrost will remain frozen for millennia, results of our investigation showed the opposite. Permafrost failure caused by long-lasting warming by sea water due to sea level rise, deep/open taliks formation due to combined heating effects of seawater, river runoff, geothermal flux, and pre-existing thermokarst and global-change-induced warming, determines destabilization of massive gas reservoirs, leading to large-scale CH4 releases, including release of pre-formed CH4 long preserved within/beneath subsea permafrost. Resultant rates of CH4 emissions over the ESAS vary spatially by 3-5 orders of magnitude. Re-drilling of subsea permafrost performed from the fast ice 30 years after it was first drilled in 1982-1983, revealed modern rates of subsea permafrost degradation. These results contradict previous hypotheses that: 1) taliks beneath thermokarst lakes always freeze after submergence; 2) rates of permafrost degradation after inundation decrease over time; and 3) thousands of years required to form escape paths for permafrost-preserved gas. Involvement of shallow relic hydrates is suggested based on results of experimental work with sediment cores extracted from the near-shore zone of the ESAS. In-situ investigations revealed that dissolved CH4 could remain in the seawater up to 1000 days, because oxidation rates are low. Storms could release some aqueous CH4 to atmosphere; dissolved CH4, captured beneath ice in winter, can spread via currents and escape to atmosphere through breaks in the ice. Progressive subsea permafrost thawing and decreasing ice extent could significantly increase CH4 emissions from the ESAS.",

            "abstract": "Advances in paleoclimatology in the past few decades have provided opportunities to expand the temporal perspective of the hydrological and climatological variability across the world. The North American region is particularly fortunate in this respect where a relatively dense network of high resolution paleoclimate proxy records have been assembled. One such network is the annually-resolved Living Blended Drought Atlas (LBDA): a paleoclimate reconstruction of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) that covers North America on a 0.5° × 0.5° grid based on tree-ring chronologies.\nHowever, the use of the LBDA to assess North American streamflow variability requires a model by which streamflow may be reconstructed. Paleoclimate reconstructions have typically used models that first seek to quantify the relationship between the paleoclimate variable and the environmental variable of interest before extrapolating the relationship back in time. In contrast, the pre-instrumental streamflow is here considered as “missing” data. A method of imputing the “missing” streamflow data, prior to the instrumental record, is applied through multiple imputation using chained equations for streamflow in the Missouri River Basin. In this method, the distribution of the instrumental streamflow and LBDA is used to estimate sets of plausible values for the “missing” streamflow data resulting in a ~600 year-long streamflow reconstruction.\nPast research into external climate forcings, oceanic-atmospheric variability and its teleconnections, and assessments of rare multi-centennial instrumental records demonstrate that large temporal oscillations in hydrological conditions are unlikely to be captured in most instrumental records. The reconstruction of multi-centennial records of streamflow will enable comprehensive assessments of current and future water resource infrastructure and operations under the existing scope of natural climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Sustained methane (CH4) release from thawing Arctic permafrost to atmosphere may be a positive, major feedback to climate warming. East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) atmospheric CH4 venting was reported as on par with flux from Arctic tundra. Unlike release when ancient carbon in thawed on-land permafrost is mobilized, ESAS CH4 release is not determined by modern methanogenesis. Pre-formed CH4 largely stems from seabed deposits. Our investigation, including observational studies using hydrological, biogeochemical, geophysical, geo-electrical, microbiological, and isotopic methods, and modeling efforts to assess current subsea permafrost state and the ESAS’ contribution to the regional CH4 budget, have clarified processes driving ESAS CH4 emissions. Subsea permafrost state is a major emission determinant; rates vary by 3-5 orders of magnitude. Outer ESAS CH4 emission rates, where subsea permafrost is predicted to be degraded due to long submergence by seawater, in places are similar to near-shore rates, where deep/open taliks can form due to combined heating effects of seawater, river runoff, geothermal flux, and pre-existing thermokarst. Progressive subsea permafrost thawing and decreasing ice extent could significantly increase ESAS CH4 emissions. Subsea permafrost drilling results reveal modern recently submerged subsea permafrost degradation rates, contradicting previous hypotheses that thousands of years required to form escape paths for permafrost-preserved gas. We used a decadal observational ESAS water column and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) data set to define the minimum source strength required to explain observed seasonally-increased ABL CH4 concentration. Modeling results agree with estimates from in-situ sonar data. In <10 m shallow water ≤72% of CH4 remains in surfacing bubbles. Dissolved CH4 fate largely depends on 3 factors: dissolved CH4 water column turnover time, water column stability against vertical mixing, and turbulent diffusion and lateral advection rates. Dissolved outer ESAS CH4 takes ≤1000 days to be oxidized because oxidation rates are low. Storms could release some aqueous CH4 to atmosphere; dissolved CH4, captured beneath ice in winter, can spread via currents and escape to atmosphere through breaks in the ice.",

            "abstract": "Cold region river catchments functioning is permanently altered locally by the anthropogenic changes and at large scale by the climate changes. Anthropogenic changes are represented particularly by reservoirs that affect the hydrology, and thus the ecology and geomorphology of the river catchments. The Peace River Basin and Peace-Athabasca-Delta (PAD), in western Canada have been experiencing similar kind of anthropogenic changes and shifts in the hydrological regime due to the regulation of Peace River in 1960’s. Since then, ice jam floods have reduced in the region, which are a very important source for replenishment of the PAD perched basins. The previous studies have regarded regulation and climate change to have equal contribution on the drying of PAD. In this study, a physically based and distributed model, MESH (Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire), that couples the Canadian Land Surface Scheme model (CLASS) and hydrological routing model (WATFLOOD), has been used to generate the runoff of Peace River under the natural flow scenario from 1970 to 2010. The reduced ice jam flooding of the PAD is mainly due to the higher freeze up stage in the lower reaches of the Peace River and declining peak flows in the spring. The former is caused by the release of water in the winter for hydropower generation and the latter is due to the filling of reservoir in the spring. Although climate variability has caused decline in summer streamflows for most of the Peace River and the PAD tributaries, as identified by the observed runoff data analysis, it is shown that the spring flows and its occurrence time would still be good enough to cause mechanical breakup of ice and overbank flooding of the PAD, if the Peace River flow was not regulated. Our results are based on the long term observed runoff analysis and the unregulated streamflows simulated by a state of the art physically based model developed by the Environment Canada.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of global land CO2 uptake vary widely across Earth system models. This uncertainty around model estimates of land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes may result from differences in how models parameterize and scale photosynthesis from the leaf-to-global level. To test model assumptions about photosynthesis, we derive rates of maximum carboxylation (Vc,max), electron transport (J), and triose phosphate utilization (TPU) from in situ leaf measurements from a forest representative of the Great Lakes region. Leaf-level gas exchange measurements were collected across a temperature range from sun and shade leaves of canopy-dominant tree species typically grouped into the same plant functional type. We evaluate the influence of short-term increases in leaf temperature, nitrogen per leaf area (Narea), species, and leaf light environment on Vc,max, J, and TPU by testing contrasting model equations that isolate the influence of these factors on these rate-limiting steps in leaf photosynthesis. Results indicate that patterns in Vc,max are best explained by a model that includes temperature and Narea. However, J varied with species and leaf light environment in addition to temperature. TPU also varied with leaf light environment and possibly with temperature. These variations in J and TPU with species or between sun and shade leaves suggest that plant traits outside of Narea are needed to explain patterns in J and TPU. This study provides in situ evidence on how Vc,max, J, and TPU vary within a forest canopy and highlight how leaf responses to changes in climate, forest species composition, and canopy structure may alter forest CO2 uptake.",

            "abstract": "Amanda Meyer, Alexa R. Van Eaton, Larry G. Mastin, Amanda B. Clarke\nEvidence for both effusive and explosive volcanism in the geological record of Mars has highlighted questions about the behavior of eruption plumes in the Martian atmosphere. How does the atmospheric structure of Mars (with surface pressures <1% and gravity <40% that of Earth) affect the rise height of volcanic ash and climate-forcing gases? Early modeling studies suggested that Martian plumes may rise significantly higher than their terrestrial equivalents (Wilson and Head, 1994, Rev. Geophys., 32, 221-263), but the validity of these models was called into question by Glaze and Baloga (2002, JGR, 107, 5086). Here we reevaluate the limitations of plume rise models using a steady-state 1-D model for volcanic plumes (Plumeria: Mastin, 2014, JGR, doi:10.1002/2013JD020604). We have used Plumeria to simulate plume heights using a range of atmospheric profiles representing both modern and ‘early’ Mars, and a range of volcanic eruption rates from 1 x 103 to 1 x 1010 kg s-1. The model assumes perfect coupling of particles with the gas phase in the plume (pseudogas assumption), and Stokes number analysis indicates that this is a reasonable assumption for particle diameters less than 5 mm to 1 micron, depending on the eruption rate. Our estimates of local Knudsen numbers support the continuum assumption for this model. Therefore, we suggest that even simplified fluid dynamics models may provide first-order insights into the rise of volcanic gases – and to some extent, fine ash particles – on Mars. Our results show that volcanic plumes in a modern Martian atmosphere may rise three times higher than those from equivalent eruption rates on Earth, potentially reaching 120 km above the surface. We provide a series of new theoretical eruption rate-plume height scaling relationships that may be useful for considering plume injection heights, climate impacts and global-scale ash dispersal patterns (e.g., Kerber et al., 2013, Icarus, 223, 149-156) in Mars’ recent and ancient geological past.",

            "abstract": "Runoff generation in snowmelt-dominated alpine systems predominantly occurs in subsurface, be it in the soil, saprolite, or fractured bedrock zone, and shifts in timing and amount of runoff due to climate change remains an open topic of research. Furthermore, the degree to which subsurface storage offsets the loss of snow storage in porous and fractured alpine terrains, i.e., the hydrogeologic buffering capacity, is still largely unknown. The snowmelt-dominated alpine watersheds in California and Chile are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their Mediterranean climate, where winter snowpack sustains the demand of urban and agricultural needs during the dry summers. The streams draining the western slope of the Sierra Nevada and Andes mountains show a decline in snowmelt runoff, with an earlier shift in spring pulse and center of mass timing over the past 50 years. Following the snowmelt period, summer low flows are sustained by groundwater, and interbasin baseflow trends have been shown to correlate with geology, and to some extent, soil thickness in less permeable basins. However, the interannual (intrabasin) baseflow trends have not been explored with respect to climate change impacts to storage-discharge relationships. Here we estimate long-term groundwater storage trends via baseflow recession analysis for two geologically distinct alpine basins: the granitic Middle Fork Kaweah in the southern Sierra Nevada, California (640 masl, 264.2 km2 with daily data back to 1949) and the volcanic Diguillín in the central Andes, Bío Bío Region, Chile (670 masl and 334 km2 with daily data back to 1959). We employ a simple linear reservoir model for estimating storage from baseflow, and investigate the sensitivity to watershed characteristics, such as depth of groundwater circulation and storage on the results. We supplement these results with numerical experiments conducted using ParFlow-CLM, a fully-integrated hydrologic model coupled to a land surface model for alpine endmember hillslopes.

            "abstract": "Using a coupled ocean-sea ice model (MITgcm), we investigate whether the break-up and mobilization of thick, multiyear, Arctic sea ice might have supplied enough freshwater to the Nordic Seas to reduce North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation and weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Numerical simulations of a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) environment show the potential for sea ice to grow to ~30m thick, storing ~1.41x105 km3 of freshwater as sea ice in the Arctic (this is ~10 times the volume of freshwater stored in the modern-day Arctic). Releasing this volume of sea ice from the Arctic in 1-yr is equivalent to a high-latitude freshwater forcing of ~4.5 Sv, which is comparable (or larger) in magnitude to most meltwater floods emanating from land-based glacial lakes (e.g. Agassiz) during the last deglaciation. Opening of the Bering Strait and Barents Sea are two plausible mechanisms that may have initiated sea ice mobilization. Opening Bering Strait increases sea ice transport through the Fram Strait by 7% and results in a 22% weakening of AMOC for 2000 years and a >3°C warming in the Arctic basin at 800 m depth. Opening Barents Sea to simulate a collapse of the Fennoscandian ice sheet has little impact on Arctic sea ice and freshwater export to the North Atlantic, but weakens AMOC ~8%. In a simulation with both straits open there is a transition to near-modern sea ice circulation pattern and a 24% reduction in AMOC. Experiments with the Bering Strait open and sea ice artificially capped to 10 m show barely any difference to those when sea ice can grow to ~30m, suggesting that changes in topography have a much greater impact on AMOC than the freshwater forcing from sea ice melting in the Nordic Seas.",

We consider both long-term control runs and the idealized 1% per year CO2 doubling experiments. In particular, we focus on the role of three different mechanisms for the transport of heat from the ocean interior onto the continental shelf of Antarctica, which is responsible for the basal melt of ice shelves. Firstly, the southward shift of the westerlies in the doubling CO2 experiments leads to a weakening of the easterlies near the continental edge, thereby decreasing Ekman downwelling. The decreased downwelling allows the transport of heat from the ocean interior onto the continental shelf. Secondly, the increase in surface wind velocity in the CO2 experiments lead to more energetic mesoscale eddies and greater heat transport across the shelf break. Thirdly, the lower salinity of shelf water in the CO2 experiments due to the freshwater addition and a decline in sea ice formation enhances baroclinicity near the shelf break, as well as the heat transport towards the continental shelf.",

            "abstract": "Modern techniques for characterizing tectonic stress orientation and relative magnitude have been successfully used for more than 35 years. Nevertheless, large areas of North America lack high spatial resolution maps of stress orientation, magnitude, and faulting regime. In Texas, for example, <30 A–C-quality stress orientations are currently registered on the World Stress Map and only 7 of these points also describe the stress regime. Stress data are foundational elements of attempts to characterize tectonic driving forces, understand hazards associated with induced seismicity, and optimize production of oil, gas, and geothermal resources.\nThis year, we launched the Texas Stress Map project to characterize tectonic stress patterns at higher spatial resolution across Texas and nearby areas. Following a successful effort just completed in Oklahoma, we will evaluate borehole breakouts, drilling-induced tensile fractures, shear wave anisotropy, and earthquake data. The principal data source will be FMI (fullbore formation microimager), UBI (ultrasonic borehole imager), cross-dipole sonic, density, and caliper logs provided by private industry. Earthquake moment tensor solutions from the U.S. Geological Survey, Saint Louis University and other sources will also be used.\nOur initial focus is on the Permian Basin and Barnett Shale petroleum plays due to the availability of data, but we will expand our analysis across the state as the project progresses. In addition, we hope to eventually apply the higher spatial resolution data coverage to understanding tectonic and geodynamic characteristics of the southwestern United States and northeastern Mexico. Here we present early results from our work to constrain stress orientations and faulting regime in and near Texas, and we also provide a roadmap for the ongoing research.",

The fault vertically offsets the previously mapped Tahoe moraine ~83 m and the Tioga moraine ~23 m, measured from lidar data. Seventeen samples were collected for 10Be cosmogenic age analysis from boulders on both the hanging and footwalls of the fault along the crests of these moraines.We report here the initial analysis of 6 of these boulders and currently await processing of the remainder. The 10Be exposure ages of 3 boulders each on the younger Tioga and older Tahoe moraines range from 12.7 +/- 1.6 to 20.7 +/- 3.3 ka and 13.3 +/- 2.1 to 72.5 +/- 8.8 ka, respectively. Using the oldest ages as minima, these preliminary results suggest that the slip rate has averaged ~1 mm/yr since the penultimate glaciation, in accord with estimates of previous workers, and place additional bounds on the age of glaciation in the Lake Tahoe basin. The Last Glacial Maxima and penultimate glaciation near Lake Tahoe thus appear to coincide with the Tioga and Tahoe II glaciations of the Eastern Sierra.",

Meanwhile, such changes would conversely influence the climate over the adjacent area, Asia or even the global according to the land-atmosphere interactions. This research aims to investigate the mechanisms of land-atmosphere interactions over Tibetan Plateau and their impact on the subsequent climate changes over Asia. Numerical modeling and statistical analysis methods are adopted. Regional climate models (e.g., RegCM4, WRF) as well as kinds of data resources (obeserved data, reanalysis data, remote sensing data) are used. The field experiments and statistical analysis methods are firstly applied to analyze the characteristics of climate changes over Tibetan Plateau to obtain the land-atmosphere interaction mechanisms. Then, the regional climate model and land surface model are coupled to develop the Land-Atmosphere coupling model. To improve the model’s capability over Tibetan Plateau, data assimilation methods are adopted to construct the Land-Atmosphere coupling model data assimilation system with multi-data resources. The land-atmosphere coupling strength over Tibetan Plateau and their impacts on the subsequent climate changes over Asia are diagnosed with numerical sensitivity experiments based on the coupling models. The results would contribute to the improvement of weather and climate extremes prediction over China and the understanding of the influence of human activities on the climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal circulation through the volcanic ocean crust extracts about one fourth of Earth’s lithospheric heat. Most of this advective heat loss occurs through ridge flanks, areas far from the magmatic influence of seafloor spreading, at relatively low temperatures (2-25 degrees Celsius). This process results in a flux of seawater through the oceanic crust that is commensurate with that delivered to the ocean from rivers. Given this large flow, even a modest (1-5 percent) change in concentration during circulation would impact geochemical cycles for many ions. Until recently such fluids that embody this process have not been collected or quantified despite the importance of this process, mainly because no site of focused, low-temperature discharge has been found. In 2013 we used Sentry (an AUV) and Jason II (an ROV) to generate a bathymetric map and locate springs within a geologic context on Dorado Outcrop, a ridge flank hydrothermal system that typifies such hydrothermal processes in the Pacific. Dorado Outcrop is located on 23 M.y. old seafloor of the Cocos Plate, where 70-90 percent of the lithospheric heat is removed. Spring fluids collected in 2013 confirmed small chemical anomalies relative to seawater, requiring new methods to collect, analyze, and interpret samples and data. In 2014 the submersible Alvin utilized these methods to recover the first high-quality spring samples from this system and year-long experiments. These unique data and samples represent the first of their type. For example, the presence of dissolved oxygen is the first evidence of an oxic ridge flank hydrothermal fluid, even though such fluids have been postulated to exist throughout a vast portion of the oceanic crust. Furthermore, chemical data confirm modest anomalies relative to seawater for some elements. Such anomalies, if characteristic throughout the global ocean, impact global geochemical cycles, crustal evolution, and subsurface microbial activity.",

While model results differ, their region spatial distributions from 1971 to 2000 agree reasonably with observed Tas, Pr and proxy LAI and NPP. The climatic variables, LAI and carbon flux vary between two simulations, the ration of NPP to gross primary production (GPP) does not change much in the historical and RCP4.5 scenarios. The linear trends of LAI and carbon flux show an obvious continuous increase from historical climatic period (1971-2000) to the first two climatic periods (2011-2040; 2041-2700) of RCP4.5, then the trends decrease in the third climatic period (2071-2100) of RCP4.5. The cumulative multi model ensemble (MME) net biome production (NBP) is 0.32 kgCm-2yr-1 during 1850 to 2005 and 1.43 kgCm-2yr-1 during 2006 to 2100, the Tibetan Plateau is a carbon sink during the historical scenario, and TP will uptake more carbon from atmosphere during 2006 to 2100 than 1850 to 2005 under RCP4.5 scenario. LAI, GPP, NPP, Ra and Rh appear more related to the Tas than Pr and Rsds, and the Tas is the primary climatic driver for the plant growth and carbon cycle. With the climate change in twenty-first century under RCP4.5 scenario, Tas still is the primary climate driver for the plant growth and carbon cycle, but the effect of temperature on plant growth and carbon cycle gets weaker.",

The differences among those algorithms lead to the difference uncertain in product. In this study, the quantity of retrieval data of each algorithm was analyzed, and the spatial coverage indicated that only one dataset was not enough for XCO2 (column-averaged CO2 dry-air mixing ratio) study. Therefore an ensemble average method that combines four datasets was investigated in this study, which aimed to increasing the data spatial coverage indirectly. The method was mainly about use the frequency of high quality data to decide which algorithm was appropriate in observation of specification time and location. Using the ensemble average, the spatial and temporal distribution of XCO2 in China was studied. The results indicated a strong variation of XCO2 in spatial and temporal. A seasonal trend with maximum and minimum appeared in spring and summer respectively all over the China, and the most of area indicated a large XCO2 (>380ppmv). However there was a significant difference between East and West. In the East of China, strong CO2 source and sink respectively due to strong human activities and large area of vegetation coverage made a large variation of XCO2 (8ppmv). In the West of China, sparsely populated and vegetation covered leaded to a small variation (5ppmv).",

The sites ATTO (T0a) and Embrapa (T0e) are located upwind of Manaus where it is possible to observe very pristine atmospheric conditions in wet season. The site Tiwa (T2) is being operated under the direct influence of the Manaus plume at 5 km downwind of Manaus and, finally, the Manacapuru (T3) site is located at about 60 km downwind of Manaus. The spectral dependence of light absorption and light scattering were measured using Aethalometers (7-wavelengths) and Nephelometers (3-wavelengths), respectively. By calculating the Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE), it was possible to get information about the source of the aerosol whereas the Scattering Angstrom Exponent (SAE) gives information about its size distribution. Sunphotometers from the AERONET network were set up at T3 and T0e sites to measure column Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD).\nFor all the stations, much higher absorption and scattering coefficients were observed during the dry season in comparison to the wet season, as a result of the larger concentration of BC and OC present in the biomass burning events. Additionally, we also observed Manaus plume pollution that alters the BC signal. There is also an increase of the AAE during the dry season due to the larger amount of aerosols from biomass burning compared with urban pollution. High values of AAE are also observed during the wet season, attributed to the presence of long-range transport of aerosols from Africa. The SAE for all the sites are lower during the wet season, with the dominance of large biological particles, and increases during the dry season as a consequence of fine particles emitted from both biomass and fossil fuel burning. The AOD at T0e and T3 (Jan-Jun/2014) showed very similar values ranging from 0.05 to 0.4. The regression coefficient of the T0e vs. T3 correlation was 1.04(4) and R²=0.94, showing similar columnar extinction properties and little influence of the Manaus plume on the total aerosol column.",

However, our current understandings on rifting mechanisms are mostly based on studies of mature rifts. Here we report results from the first teleseismic investigations of the incipient Okavango rift zone (ORZ), which is located at the southwestern terminal of the East African Rift System in northern Botswana. Data used in the study were recorded by the 17 broadband seismic stations deployed along a NW-SE profile traversing the ORZ with a recording duration of 2 years starting in the summer of 2012. Receiver function and shear wave splitting techniques have been employed to explore upper mantle thermal anomalies and anisotropy. The resulting dominantly absolute plate motion-parallel fast polarization orientations and normal mantle transition zone thickness ruled out the possible existence of one or more mantle plumes in the upper mantle or mantle transition zone beneath the ORZ. The Moho beneath the Okavango rift zone is uplifted by 4-5 km and is symmetric with regard to the rift axis, favoring a pure shear model of early-stage continental extension. The observations favor a passive model for rift initiation in which rifts develop inside ancient orogenic zones as the result of relative movements between Archean cratonic blocks.",

Although qualitative assessments that are broadly in agreement with this hypothesis have been derived from numerical convection models, a quantitative assessment has been lacking. We present global convection models constrained by plume motions and subduction history over the last 230 Myr, where plumes emerge preferentially from the edges of thermochemical structures that resemble present-day LLSVPs beneath Africa and the Paciﬁc Ocean. We also present a novel plume detection scheme and derive Monte Carlo-based statistical correlations of model plume eruption sites and reconstructed LIP eruption sites. We show that models with a chemically anomalous lower mantle are highly correlated to reconstructed LIP eruption sites, whereas the conﬁdence level obtained for a model with purely thermal plumes falls just short of 95%. A network of embayments separated by steep ridges forms in the deep lower mantle in models with a chemically anomalous lower mantle. Plumes become anchored to the peaks of the chemical ridges and the network of ridges acts as a ﬂoating anchor, adjusting to subduction-induced flow through time. The network of ridges imposes a characteristic separation between conduits that can extend into the interior of the thermochemical structures. This may explain the observed clustering of reconstructed LIP eruption sites that mostly but not exclusively occur around the present-day LLSVPs.",

            "abstract": "Continental arc volcanoes represent a dramatic expression of a significant and fundamental phenomena in global tectonics: the subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a more buoyant continental plate. The subduction of an oceanic plate results in recycling of crustal material into the convecting mantle, partial melting, and primary basalt production. Moreover, during passage through thick continental crust, subduction zone magmas may substantially differentiate and melt crustal rocks giving rise to the great diversity of igneous lithologies characteristic of earth. These are important processes that must be understood in detail in order to interpret the long-term evolution of the earth and continental crust.\nHere we present variations in the isotopic and trace element composition of volcanic rocks from Bloodgood Canyon and Apache Springs tuffs, and the Fanney Rhyolite located in the western Mogollon-Datil Volcanic Field (MDVF). The project will address several questions. First, are the Bloodgood and Apache Springs tuffs and Fanney Rhyolite petrogenically related, and are these rhyolites expressions of a continental arc ignimbrite flare-up? Second, what petrogenic processes affected differentiation and where is the magma sourced? Finally, to what extent do these units represent a manifestation of the MDVF and the transition from arc magmatism to rifting?\nThe Bloodgood Canyon is a crystal-rich rhyolite tuff containing quartz>k-feldspar>plagioclase>biotite, and pumice and lithic fragments. Rb ranges from 230-330ppm, Sr from 14-83ppm, and 87Sr/86Srm from 0.71619-0.72477.The Apache Springs Tuff is a rhyolite tuff containing quartz>k-feldspar>plagioclase>biotite, and lithics. Rb (228-233ppm) and 87Sr/86Srm (0.71025-0.71056) are restricted, while Sr (105-399ppm) is more variable in composition. The Fanney Creek is a massive rhyolite lava with flow banding and contains quartz phenocryst clusters and k-feldspars. Currently, no data exists for the Apache Springs Tuff.",

            "abstract": "The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) time-dependent iterative kinematic reconstruction technique has been used and expanded upon for over two decades. It currently provides some of the most accurate predictions and three-dimensional (3D) analyses of heliospheric solar-wind parameters now available using interplanetary scintillation (IPS) data. The parameters provided include reconstructions of velocity, density, and magnetic fields. Precise time-dependent results are obtained at any solar distance in the inner heliosphere using current Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory (STELab), Nagoya University, Japan IPS data sets, but the reconstruction technique can also incorporate data from other IPS systems from around the world. With access using world IPS data systems, not only can predictions using the reconstruction technique be made without observation dead times due to poor longitude coverage or system outages, but the program can itself be used to standardize observations of IPS. Additionally, these analyses are now being exploited as inner-boundary values to drive an ENLIL 3D-MHD heliospheric model in real time. A major potential of this is that it will use the more realistic physics of 3D-MHD modeling to provide an automatic forecast of CMEs and corotating structures up to several days in advance of the event/features arriving at Earth, with or without involving coronagraph imagery or the necessity of magnetic fields being used to provide the background solar wind speeds.",

            "abstract": "A standard atmospheric general circulation model is set up in a uniformly-rotating global radiative-convective equilibrium configuration to explore the equilibrium state, including the statistics of its constituent tropical cyclones, and its sensitivity to horizontal resolution. The Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) is run at the conventional resolution of approximately 100 km grid spacing and a high-resolution of 25 km grid spacing globally. The setup utilizes an aquaplanet configuration with spatially-uniform, diurnally-varying insolation, uniform fixed sea surface temperatures and a uniform rotation rate equal to that at 10◦N. The resulting state is one in which tropical cyclones fill the global domain, such that storm count and outer storm size covary strongly. Despite significant changes in the statistics of storm count, intensity, and structure, the mean environment, including the potential intensity, is found to be nearly insensitive to resolution. Results are compared with the non-rotating case from a prior study, and a generalized conceptual framework for the interpretation of aggregation with or without rotation, as well as the respective sensitivity to model parameters, is proposed.",

            "abstract": "Sea level anomaly (SLA) is an important indicator of changes in the Earth's climate system because the oceans have great heat storage capacity. The sea level variation is due to combination of thermosteric and halosteric effects. These two effects play significant roles in the annual cycle of the SLA and maintain the thermohaline circulation. Previous studies only considered the thermosteric effect. The main goal of this study was to determine the regions of the global ocean where the variability induced by halosteric effect is equal or higher than that induced by thermosteric effect. We used temperature and salinity data from World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) with spatial resolution of 1°x1° during the period of 1955 to 2012 to calculate the coefficient of thermal expansion (α), haline contraction (β) and to estimate their contributions to the SLA variation in the global ocean. Our results showed that the thermosteric effect is dominant in the tropical and subtropical regions due to high insolation throughout the year. However, in polar regions, North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans the halosteric effect was the main contributor to SLA variation. In polar regions, the effect occurs because of the lack in temperature variation and the fact that in this region the precipitation rate exceeds evaporation increasing the freshwater input. In the others, the mechanism is still unknown. The linear trend of thermosteric and halosteric components for 1955-2012 is 0.35mm/yr and 0.07mm/yr, respectively. This results shows that halosteric effect should be considered in the heat storage estimation from satellite data, in situ data and numerical modelling contrasting the previous approaches to SLA.",

            "abstract": "Titanite typically contains more non-radiogenic Pb than zircon, nonetheless it can preserve useful age information that complements geochronology from other datable phases. Titanite is more reactive than zircon and it interacts more readily with other major phases. As a result titanite dates frequently indicate the time of cooling below a blocking temperature (in reality an interval). The role of titanite grain size is important as it has a bearing on the extent to which titanite U-Pb ages reflect diffusive Pb loss or pristine formation ages. We demonstrate that titanite collected through the Albany-Fraser Orogen, across an uplifted refractory lower crustal block, can record thermal overprints apparently lacking in the zircon record. Two zones of the Albany-Fraser Orogen are the Biranup and Fraser Zones, each with a distinctive Proterozoic history but unequivocally part of the reworked margin of the Archean Yilgarn Craton. A dichotomy exists in the zircon geochronology record of this area, in that within the older Biranup Zone, Stage II overprinting (1225–1140 Ma) is widespread whereas in the younger Fraser Zone, Stage I (1345–1260 Ma) is dominant, with Stage II apparently absent. Although, most metamorphic titanite in the Fraser Zone records an age of 1307 ± 17 Ma, reflecting closure to radiogenic-Pb mobility after Stage I metamorphism, small titanite grains reveal Stage II overprinting with a mean reset age of 1205 ± 16 Ma. In contrast, titanite from metasediments within the Biranup Zone principally record ages of 1203 ± 6 Ma and 1153 ± 27 Ma reflecting cooling after prolonged Stage II metamorphism. Thermochronological modelling indicates that small titanite grains in the Fraser Zone would be reset during Stage II overprinting at temperatures of 695-725°C. Larger titanite crystals would not be reset by this thermal overprint. This result is similar to phase equilibrium modelling from the Biranup Zone that indicates temperatures of 670–680 °C during Stage II metamorphism. An in-situ U-Pb analysis strategy for titanite that targets a range of grain sizes has the potential to reveal differential resetting and thus place important controls on the thermal history.",

            "abstract": "Spectroscopy of icy satellite surfaces can aid us in understanding sources and sinks of material in the outer solar system. The spectral complexity of the Saturnian satellite system as seen in reflected sunlight suggests additional complexity may be present at mid-infrared wavelengths from which unique compositional information can be gleaned [1]. Yet to date, Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) surface compositional studies have received little attention.\nWe are investigating the value of mid-infrared spectroscopy for identifying non-H2O constituents of icy moon surfaces. On Iapetus’ dark terrain, we find an emissivity feature at ~855 cm-1 and a possible doublet at 660 and 690 cm-1 that do not correspond to any known instrument artifacts [2]. We attribute the 855 cm-1feature to fine-grained silicates, similar to those found in dust on Mars and in meteorites, which are nearly featureless at shorter wavelengths [3]. Silicates on the dark terrains of Saturn’s icy moons have been suspected for decades, but there have been no definitive detections until now. Because peaks can shift depending on temperature, pressure, and grain size, measurements at Iapetus-like conditions are necessary for more positive feature identifications [e.g., 4].\nWe measured the vacuum (P<3x10-8 torr) and low temperature (125 K) mid-infrared spectra of various fine-grained powdered silicates. We find that some of these materials do have emissivity features near 855 cm-1and match the doublet. Identifying a specific silicate would provide clues into the origin and implications of the dark material in the Saturnian system. We also report on our ongoing exploration of the CIRS icy moon dataset and plans for additional future measurements in JPL’s Icy Worlds Simulation Lab.\n[1] Flasar, F. M., et al.

This paper describe the first radiometric characteristics of KOMPSAT-3A by carrying out vicarious calibration with reference to well-known surface tarps. The field campaigns are performed to measure spectral of surface tarps with hand-held ASD spectroradiometer. When performing field measurement, KOMPSAT-3A multispectral images are acquired at same time to reduce atmospheric and observation geometric discrepancies. The estimated spectral of surface reflectance from tarps are used as input values of 6S radiative transfer model to predict radiance at sensor level. The present study, 6S radiative transfer model is used by inputting various initial parameters such as spectral response function of KOMPSAT-3A, atmospheric condition, and relative sensor-target-solar geometry. In the case of atmospheric products, multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) measurements and MODIS atmospheric products such as aerosol optical depth, water vapor and amount of ozone are used for interpreting solar radiation scattering and absorption effects. For first field campaign, the gain coefficients from each of multispectral bands are estimated by comparing predicted radiance at sensor level and digital number (DN) of KOMPSAT-3A based on leaner least square fit. To analysis firstly estimated radiometric calibration, surface reflectance of tarps in second field campaign is used as reference target to validate its radiometric characteristics. And second field campaign measurements are also used to upgrade KOMPSAT-3A DN to radiance coefficients. Reliable radiometric values are suggested by using surface tarps, MFRSR and MODIS products, indicating those information are useful for KOMPSAT-3A user group for continuous variables of quantitative applications.",

            "abstract": "Flood risk reduction strategies such as zoning and land use restrictions reduce exposure by “keeping people away from floods”. However, in many developing countries, benefits provided by floods and use of flood-prone land are essential, particularly where livelihoods are tied to natural hydrologic cycles. We propose integrating coping capacity and benefits of floodplain use into risk assessments in developing countries.\nWe assess flood damages and identify local strategies for living with and benefitting from floods in Candaba, Philippines. We use a physically-based rainfall-runoff model and remotely-sensed data to characterize flooding. At the village scale, we evaluate potential damages to agriculture and fisheries. Through community surveys and focus groups, we identify adaptations that allow people to cope with and benefit from flooding. Seeking to integrate these adaptations into standard risk assessments, we explore valuation methods to appraise floodplain-derived benefits.\nWe find that some communities adapt their livelihoods to seasonal inundation, for instance, by using land alternately for agriculture and wild-catch fisheries during dry and wet seasons respectively. To integrate the role of coping capacity into our assessment, we consider dynamics of seasonal land use and evaluate damages and benefits of adapted (high coping capacity) and non-adapted (low coping capacity) conditions. We find that coping strategies minimize flood losses while allowing valuable flood-related benefit capture.\nWe conclude that neglecting coping capacity and benefits of floodplain use can lead to poor characterization of risk, which may result in misguided management. Acknowledging local capacity to live with and benefit from floods may support flood risk management, sustainable livelihoods and ecosystem services in developing countries.",

We fit RSL histories from near-, intermediate-, and far-field locations with noisy-input Gaussian process models to assess rates of RSL change from selected study areas. Records from near-field regions (e.g., Antarctica, Greenland, Canada, Sweden, and Scotland) reveal a complex pattern of RSL fall from a maximum marine limit due to the net effect of eustatic sea-level rise and glacial-isostatic uplift with rates of RSL fall as great as -69 ± 9 m/ka. Intermediate-field regions (e.g., mid-Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, Netherlands, Southern France, St. Croix) display variable rates of RSL rise from the cumulative effect of isostatic and eustatic factors. Fast rates of RSL rise (up to 10 ± 1 m/ka) are found in the early Holocene in regions near the center of forebulge collapse. Far-field RSL records exhibit a mid-Holocene highstand, the timing (between 8 and 4 ka) and magnitude (between <1 and 6 m) of which varies across South America, Africa, Asia and Australia regions.",

            "abstract": "In South Island, New Zealand, oblique convergence of the Australian and Pacific plates is accommodated in a wide zone, up to 150 km wide, with ~75% of the total motion (~37 mm/yr) taken up on the Alpine Fault. In this study, we examine diffuse shallow crustal (0—20 km) microseismicity in a region up to 100 km to the SE of the Alpine Fault, where most of the remaining relative plate motion is accommodated. In the Central Otago region of southern South Island, focal mechanisms have been determined for 152 events, recorded in a broadband seismic network (COSA) over a 15 month period spanning June 2012—October 2013. One approach is to interpret these mechanisms in the context of a uniform stress field, assuming slip occurs in the direction of maximum shear stress on randomly orientated fractures, with an equal probability of slip on either nodal plane. This way, a stress field inversion of these mechanisms produces an estimate of SHmax oriented at 114°, an orientation inconsistent with estimates of the principal contraction direction derived from GPS (105°) and gravitational stresses due to topography and crustal thickness variations. However, a rose diagram for the dip directions of all nodal planes indicates that slip may be simply occurring subparallel to the plate convergence direction (~070°) on a limited set of linked fractures, organized into strike-slip and thrust segments. In other words, the earthquake slip directions may be kinematically controlled, accommodating the plate convergence, rather than the response of randomly orientated fractures to a uniform stress field. Near-vertical fractures aligned with the plate convergence direction are preferentially slipping and dominate the microseismicity in the Central South Island. We show that both large >M5.5 and small (2 > M < 4) events are controlled by the same kinematic process, using aftershock data from the 04/05/15 ML = 5.8 Wanaka earthquake, with the mainshock occurring on a steeply dipping dextral fault aligned at 070° and subparallel to the plate convergence vector. The segmentation observed in the microseismicity also occurs for neotectonic faulting along the main trace of the Alpine Fault, which is broken up into strike-slip and thrust segments at a 1-10km scale.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake source spectra are useful for characterizing source process. In order to eliminate the path and site effects and extract the source effect, we often take the ratio of the observed spectrum of target event to that of collocated small event (\"EGF\"). The spectral ratio is fit by the omega-square model to estimate the corner frequency of the target event.\nIn general, events two units of magnitude smaller than target event are preferable for EGFs to constrain the corner frequency of the target event. However in case to estimate the entire shape of source spectrum, smaller events are preferable, since small events have higher corner frequencies, below which the source effect of EGF must be negligible. Different purpose prefers different magnitude of EGFs.\nWe propose a spectral ratio analysis to fit the spectral ratios of single target event to multiple EGFs simultaneously to estimate the corner frequency of the target event and those of the EGFs by grid search, and calculate the moment ratios. Larger EGFs are useful to constrain the corner frequency of the target event, and smaller ones work to investigate the shape of the source spectrum of the target event up to high frequencies.\nWe focus on Fukushima Hamadori and northern Ibaraki areas where shallow normal-faulting seismicity was significantly activated after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. We apply this method to earthquakes whose moment magnitudes were estimated by NIED F-net, employing 10-50 EGFs within 0.5 km from each target event.\nOne example is shown in Figure. We observe bumps on the spectral ratios to different EGFs in common. This common feature must be from the source effect of the target event and indicate incoherence in the rupture process. Some of other events have smooth spectra.\nWe investigate the spatial variation in characters of the source spectra. It is difficult to find any spatial tendencies in the amplitude of the spectral bumps. We will compare the results in this region and other region in future. The stress drops inferred from the corner frequencies have some spatial dependence. This fact will be a clue to understand fault properties in the source region.\n[Figure] Spectral ratios normalized by moment ratios.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic tomography can possibly obtain high-resolution hydraulic properties of the heterogeneous aquifer by integrating information collected from a series of cross-hole pumping tests. Typically, the collected data are interpreted by geostatistical models, in which the hydraulic parameters are treated as random fields with specified mean and correlation structures. Under the Bayesian framework, the inverse models start from an initial guess of coarse parameter structure and then obtain reasonable estimates that honor the observed data. Although hydraulic tomography can collect a lot of non-redundant information with a limited number of boreholes, the information may not be sufficient to characterize the complex heterogeneity in some geological formations, especially in fractured medium. In this situation, prior information on geological structures may be important to the quality of the estimates. Yet, conventional geostatistical inverse methods only consider the global structure of the parameter fields and specific geological knowledge available (e.g., geofacies data, fault location) is not fully appreciated. The proposed methodology can flexibly incorporate complex geological structure information and their uncertainties in geostatistical modelling, that are available usually only in a qualitative sense. An illustration example showed that, by integrating fault information from outcrop survey and borehole intersection data, the estimates obtained from hydraulic tomography with four pumping tests at a large-scale fractured granite aquifer can be improved using the proposed method, which lead to better flow prediction.",

            "abstract": "We are completing a regional analysis of Santa Cruz and northern Monterey Counties, CA, to assess the conditions amenable to managed aquifer recharge using stormwater runoff. Communities and water supply agencies across CA are struggling to mitigate the ongoing drought and to develop secure and sustainable water supplies to support long-term municipal, agricultural, environmental and other needs. Enhanced storage of groundwater is an important part of this effort in many basins. This work is especially timely because of the recently enacted \"Sustainable Groundwater Management Act\" (SGMA), which requires the development of groundwater sustainability agencies and implementation of basin management plans in coming decades. Our analysis focuses specifically on the distributed collection of stormwater runoff, a water source that has typically been treated as a nuisance or waste, from drainages having an area on the order of 40-160 hectares. The first part of this project is a geographic information system (GIS) analysis using surface and subsurface data sets. Developing complete and accurate datasets across the study region required considerable effort to locate, assemble, co-register, patch, and reconcile information from many sources and scales. We have complete spatial coverage for surface data, but subsurface data is more limited in lateral extent. Sites that are most suitable for distributed stormwater capture supporting MAR have high soil infiltration capacity, are well-connected to an underlying aquifer with good transmissive and storage properties, and have space to receive MAR. Additional considerations include method of infiltration, slope, and land use and access. Based on initial consideration of surface data and slope, 7% of the complete study region appears to be \"suitable or highly suitable\" for MAR (in the top third of the rating system), but there is considerable spatial heterogeneity based on the distribution of shallow soils and bedrock geology.",

            "abstract": "Jimusar Sag, which lies in the Junggar Basin,is one of the most typical tight oil study areas in China. However, the properties and origin of the crude oil and the geochemical characteristics of the tight oil from the Lucaogou Formation have not yet been studied. In the present study, 23 crude oilsfrom the Lucaogou Formation were collected for analysis, such as physical properties, bulk composition, saturated hydrocarbon gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the calculation of various biomarker parameters. In addition,source rock evaluation and porosity permeability analysis were applied to the mudstones and siltstones. Biomarkers of suitable source rocks (TOC>1, S1+S2>6mg/g, 0.7%<Ro<1%) were analyzed for oil–source correlation. To analyze the hydrocarbon generation history of the Lucaogou source rock, 1D basin modeling was performed. The oil-filling history was also defined by means of basin modeling and microthermometry. The results indicated the presence of low maturity to mature crude oils originating from the burial of terrigenous organic matter beneath a saline lake in the source rocks of mainly type II1kerogen. In addition, a higher proportion of bacteria and algae was shown to contribute to the formation of crude oil in the lower section when compared with the upper section of the Lucaogou Formation. Oil–source correlations demonstrated that not all mudstones within the Lucaogou Formation contributed to oil accumulation.Crude oil from the upper and lower sections originated from thin-bedded mudstones interbedded within sweet spot sand bodies. A good coincidence of filling history and hydrocarbon generation history indicated that the Lucaogou reservoir is a typical in situ reservoir. The mudstones over or beneath the sweet spot bodies consisted of natural caprocks and prevented the vertical movement of oil by capillary forces. Despite being thicker, the thick-bedded mudstone between the upper and lower sweet spots had no obvious contribution to the oil reservoir, because of its low permeability and was located far from the sweet spots, which is consistent with the principle of near-source charging for tight oil accumulation. Lucaogou oil reservoir has been twice charged, once from 235 Ma to 210 Ma and again from 180 Ma to 150 Ma, coincided with oil generation time.",

STATIC’s unique design allows it to measure both a wide range in energy (<1 eV to 30,000 eV) and a large dynamic range in flux. At this interface ion distributions can be quite complex, with multiple ion species containing both cold plasmas (Ti < 0.1 eV) and warm suprathermal tails (1-100 eV). Ion heating at boundaries between different magnetic topologies, both open-closed and open-draped boundaries, is observed. Counterstreaming ions of the same mass, and of different masses, are common at this interface. These unstable distributions should evolve into low energy suprathermal tails that populate the magnetotail and contribute to Martian atmospheric loss. This paper will review the broad range of ion distributions that MAVEN observes escaping down the magnetotail beginning with outflows at the low altitude terminator and their evolution to a warm plasma that forms the tail current sheet. These observations will be used to estimate the atmospheric loss rate of tail outflows.",

During the analysis, different subsets of 15 pumping tests are used to estimate the parameters (hydraulic conductivity and specific storage), ranging from 15 single tests respectively to total number of 15 tests. By interpreting and comparing the results of inversions (L2, big difference of head, head scatter, hydraulic conductivity and specific storage, etc.), we will be able to determine the importance of the number and the locations of pumping tests that are used to both characterize the aquifers well and avoid redundancy.

Both the Areyonga and Olympic Fms. include glacial deposits overlain by cap carbonates, observations that have prompted correlation of these formations with the global Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations, respectively. In this study we focus on the interglacial stratigraphic unit (Aralka Fm.), which is subdivided into the lower Ringwood Mbr. and the upper Limbla Mbr. C isotope values from carbonates within the Limbla Mbr. are particularly large (up to +10 per mil), suggesting that it correlates with the global “Keele Peak” anomaly. The underlying Ringwood Mbr. (the base of which comprises the Sturtian cap carbonate of the Amadeus Basin) varies from thin or non-existent in the northwestern part of the basin to hundreds of meters thick in eastern parts. C isotope values from Ringwood Mbr. carbonates are roughly -5 per mil at its base and rise rapidly up-section. A mid-interglacial negative C isotope excursion to values of approximately -5 per mil in the Ringwood Mbr. may correlate with the Tayshir anomaly of the Mongolian Neoproterozoic succession. Interglacial carbonates of the Aralka Fm. therefore have C isotope compositions that span at least 15 per mil and include both positive and negative isotopic excursions that seem to be globally correlative. Furthermore, detailed field observations from the Ringwood Mbr. suggest that it can be subdivided into three submembers, each of which is marked by stromatolitic intervals. Shallowing-upward parasequences in the Ringwood Mbr., as well as a major change in lithology from siltstones and microbialites of the Ringwood Mbr. to dominantly coarse-grained, cross-stratified sandstones of the Limbla Mbr., suggest that the interglacial strata of the Amadeus Basin were deposited during a period of significant and repeated changes in relative sealevel.",

            "abstract": "Because of its ability to intercept a portion of rainfall, vegetated canopies can play substantial role in modulating the urban hydrological cycle. However, canopy interception research has historically been focused to forest canopies.\nThe goal of our research is to quantify rainfall partitioning by isolated evergreen shrub canopies in an ultra-urban setting. The three year field experiment involved three exemplars of cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus 'Otto Luyken'.) Ten rain gauges positioned under each plant were used to measure throughfall with a sampling frequency of five seconds. A number of specific techniques were implemented to minimize error associated with the gauges, e.g., splash-in, splash-out and excessive wetting.\nThe cumulative throughfall deficit (i.e., gross precipitation minus throughfall within the canopy projected area and minus stemflow) for the periods of August-December 2013, April-December 2014 and April-July 2015 was 39%. Spatial variability of throughfall was large (coefficient of variation up to 1.5.) Stable areas of preferential throughfall flux were observed. Stemflow showed a high variability (1.4 - 24%) between rain events.\nThe relationship between throughfall and precipitation intensity was strongly linear (adjusted coefficient of determination R2 0.79) throughout the entire range of observed rainfall intensities. The overall ratio of throughfall to precipitation intensity was 0.48:1. The observations suggest that reduction of throughfall intensity by the canopy during a rainstorm determines the aggregate interception depth. In contrast, the amount of water stored on the canopy and evaporated between and after rain events contributes minimally to interception loss.\nPenman-Monteith estimates of wet canopy evaporation cannot account for the throughfall deficit. Lateral displacement of microdrops beyond the canopy projected area is another phenomenon that will be discussed and most recent observations of an extended gauge network will be presented.",

This range is nearly as large as seen within tectonically active regions. Yet both North America and Australia have large Precambrian regions unaffected by significant thermotectonic activity in the past 109 years. We examine the heat flow and elevation—corrected for crustal composition—for North America and Australia and interpret deviations from a predicted thermal isostatic relationship (calibrated to North America). Deviations from the thermal isostatic relationship can be in excess of ±1 km with many Australian regions exhibiting significant negative deviations from the thermal isostatic relationship, with the largest deviations occurring in regions with high heat flow (>60 mW m2). This observation is consistent with studies suggesting high heat production within the Australian upper crust. Our analysis provides a way to estimate the average upper crustal heat production and basal heat flow for these regions. In the most extreme case, we predict the average upper crustal heat production must be ~2.3 times higher than with sublithospheric heat flow similar to many other Precambrian regions. Analysis of additional Precambrian regions may help shed light on the global distribution of heat producing elements and conditions required for the stability and longevity of Precambrian lithosphere.",

The characteristics and the analyzing methods of the EUVC images are introduced in detail in this report. The plasmapause locations on the magnetic equator are reconstructed with the Minimum L Algorithm and are quantitatively compared with those extracted from in-situ observations by DMSP, THEMIS, and RBSP satellites. Then the plasmapause evolutions during substorms on February 21 2014 and April 21 2014 are investigated. It is found that the evolutions of plasmapause correlate well in both universal time and magnetic local time with the equatorial boundaries of auroral oval during substorms. During these two cases, the solar-wind-driven convection and the geomagnetic activity are relatively weak and steady, and the plasmapause motions can reliably be attributed to the substorms. It is proposed that correlations between the auroral signatures and the plasmapause motions may be due to the generation and Earthward-propagation of dipolarization front and resultant pitch angle scattering. In future work, we will search more in-situ and remote sensing data in both the plasmasphere and the magnetotail regions to investigate the correlations between the plasmaspheric erosions, the dipolarization fronts, and the energetic ions injections.",

The prior geo-investigations suggest that the main recharge region of the fan is at an apex along the river.\nThe distribution of soil hydraulic diffusivity was estimated by fusing naturally recurring stimulus provided by river and groundwater head. Specifically, the variance and power spectrum provided by temporal and spatial change of groundwater head in response to river stage variations are analyzed to estimate hydraulic diffusivity distribution. It is found that the hydraulic diffusivity of the fan is at the range from 0.08 to 16 m2/s. The average hydraulic diffusivity at the apex, middle, and tail of the fan along the river is about 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 m2/s, respectively.",

Climate forcing data is one of those key inputs of crop models. This study evaluated the performance of AgMERRA climate forcing dataset to fill gaps in historical in-situ meteorological data for different climatic regions of Iran. AgMERRA dataset intercompared with in- situ observational dataset for daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation during 1980-2010 periods via Root Mean Square error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Bias Error (MBE) for 17 stations in four climatic regions included humid and moderate, cold, dry and arid, hot and humid. Moreover, probability distribution function and cumulative distribution function compared between model and observed data. The results of measures of agreement between AgMERRA data and observed data demonstrated that there are small errors in model data for all stations. Except for stations which are located in cold regions, model data in the other stations illustrated under-prediction for daily maximum temperature and precipitation. However, it was not significant. In addition, probability distribution function and cumulative distribution function showed the same trend for all stations between model and observed data. Therefore, the reliability of AgMERRA dataset is high to fill gaps in historical observations in different climatic regions of Iran as well as it could be applied as a basis for future climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The Harrat Rahat volcanic field in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers ~20,000 km2 and has a volume of ~2,000 km3, making it the largest intraplate volcanic field in that country. The vast majority of this field is rural and uninhabited land. However, sitting on basalt flows at the northernmost limit of this volcanic field is a city that is home to >1.5 million people and ~3 million pilgrims annually. Over the centuries, population growth and city expansion have led to levelling of and construction atop the surrounding lava flows. Although mapped previously, none of these basalt flows have been dated, and hence, it is unknown how many times the area encompassed by this city has been inundated by these lava flows. As part of an ongoing collaboration between the USGS and the Saudi Geological Survey, which allowed access throughout, we have conducted new field mapping, petrography, 40Ar-39Ar dating, paleomagnetism, and geochemistry studies to define the number, age, and areal extent of basaltic lava flows that have reached areas that are now populated. More than 50 samples have been collected from within the city and analyzed. New ages on five of the flows range from ~340 to 100 ka, a sharp contrast with previous age estimates that extended as far back as 2.5 Ma. In addition, paleomagnetic, petrographic, and geochemical analyses indicate that four basalt flows within the western half of the city are from individual eruptions. At least five flows underlie the eastern half of the city, and several of these flows may be from a single eruptive episode. The youngest flow (part of the 1256 AD eruption) came within ~5 km of the city center. Our results indicate that pre-1256 AD basalt flows inundated the populated areas more frequently, and are younger than previously thought. This new temporal and geochemical record will help improve the accuracy and precision of future modeling and quantitative hazard assessments.",

The variation of concentration and degradation of lignin phenols in sediments presents three stages, with higher concentration and lower degradation in the first 80 cm from the surface, lower concentration and higher degradation in the middle of the core (80cm ~ 170cm) and higher concentration and lower degradation from 170cm to 270cm, which are related to different periods affected by human activities respectively. Moreover, the flooding events of the Yangtze River in 1954 and 1998 also could be recognized through the sediment core samples. After the mid 1980s, sediment load of the Yangtze River has become an essential factor in affecting the discharge of terrigenous organic carbon, due to the building of dams. However, when comparing with other researches, owing to complicated sediment burial speeds and hydrodynamic conditions, as well as influences brought by vertical mixing in the Yangtze estuary, the effect of terrigenous organic carbon to the carbon cycle in this region should be further studied.",

As a consequence, adiabatic ascent predicts that the growth rate of these drops is inversely proportional to their radius, and consequently that the drop spectrum will narrow with altitude.\nHere we demonstrate that drop growth on giant sea-salt aerosol particles (GCCN, dry radius > 0.5 μm) behaves very differently. For typical marine stratocumulus updrafts (0.4 m s-1), and for dry radius > 2 μm, these drops typically remain concentrated solution drops, and their condensational growth is so fast that they accelerate away from the main drop peak, and thus very rapidly attain precipitation drop sizes through condensation only. We show how many studies, that have attempted to include the effects of GCCN by initiating large pure water drops at cloud base, may have seriously underestimated the effects of GCCN on warm rain formation. We also speculate on possible solutions to this issue.",

The evolution of the Neo-Tethyan Ocean prior to India-Asia collision remains unclear. To explore this period of history, we investigate zircon U-Pb geochronology, geochemistry and Nd-Hf isotopes of the Early Jurassic bimodal-like volcanic sequence around Dagze area, south Tibet. The volcanic sequence comprises calc-alkaline basalts to rhyolites whereas intermediate components are volumetrically restricted. Zircons from a basaltic andesite yielded crystallization age of 178Ma whereas those from 5 silicic rocks were dated at 183-174Ma, which suggest that both the basaltic and the silicic rocks are coeval. The basaltic rocks are enriched in LREE and LILE, and depleted in HFSE, with Epsilon Nd(t) of 1.6-4.0 and zircon Epsilon Hf(t) of 0.7-11.8, which implies that they were derived from a heterogenetic mantle source metasomatized by subduction components. Trace element geochemistry shows that the basaltic rocks are compositionally transitional from normal mid-ocean ridge basalts (N-MORB) to island arc basalts (IAB, e.g. Zedong arc basalts of ~160-155Ma in the south margin of Lhasa Terrane), with the signature of immature back-arc basin basalts. The silicic rocks display similar Nd-Hf isotopic features of the Gangdese batholith with Epsilon Nd(t) of 0.9-3.4 and zircon Epsilon Hf(t) of 2.4-17.7, indicating that they were possibly generated by anatexis of basaltic juvenile lower crust, instead of derived from the basaltic magma. These results support an Early to Middle Jurassic (183-155Ma) model that the back-arc extension tectonic setting were existing in the active continental margin in the south Lhasa Terrane.",

The main objective of this paper is to introduce a first-order moment analysis to investigate the pressure head variability within a hypothetical hillslope, induced by steady rainfall infiltration. This approach accounts for the uncertainties and spatial variation of the hydraulic conductivity, and is based on a first-order Taylor approximation of pressure perturbations calculated by a variably saturated, finite element flow model. Using this approach, the effects of variance (σ2lnKs) and spatial structure anisotropy (λh/λv) of natural logarithm of saturated hydraulic conductivity, and normalized vertical infiltration flux (q/ks) on the hillslope pore-water pressure are evaluated. We found that the responses of pressure head variability (σ2p) are quite different between unsaturated region and saturated region divided by the phreatic surface. Above the phreatic surface, a higher variability in pressure head is obtained from a higher σ2lnKs, a higher λh/λv and a smaller q/ks; while below the phreatic surface, a higher σ2lnKs, a lower λh/λv or a larger q/ks would lead to a higher variability in pressure head, and greater range of fluctuation of the phreatic surface within the hillslope. σ2lnKs has greatest impact on σ2p within the slope and λh/λv has smallest impact. All three variables have greater influence on maximum σ2p within the saturated region below the phreatic surface than that within the unsaturated region above the phreatic surface. The results obtained from this study are useful to understand the influence of hydraulic conductivity variations on slope seepage and stability under different slope conditions and material spatial distributions.",

This program employed the NSF/NCAR GV (NGV) research aircraft from a base in New Zealand in a 6-week field measurement campaign in June-July 2014. During the field phase, the NGV was equipped with new lidar and airglow instruments, as well as dropwindsondes and a full suite of flight level instruments including the microwave temperature profiler (MTP), providing temperatures and vertical winds spanning altitudes from immediately above the NGV flight altitude (~13 km) to ~100 km. The region near New Zealand was chosen since all the relevant GW sources (e.g., mountains, cyclones, jet streams) occur strongly here, and upper-level winds in austral winter permit gravity waves to propagate to very high altitudes.\nThe COAMPS adjoint modeling system provided forecast sensitivity in real time during the six-week DEEPWAVE field phase. Five missions were conducted using the NGV to observe regions of high forecast sensitivity, as diagnosed using the COAMPS adjoint model. In this presentation, we provide a summary of the sensitivity characteristics and explore the implications for predictability of low-level winds crucial for gravity wave launching, as well as predictability of gravity wave characteristics in the stratosphere. In general, the sensitive regions were characterized by localized strong dynamics, often involving intense baroclinic systems with deep convection. The results of the adjoint modeling system suggest that gravity wave launching and the characteristics of the gravity waves can be linked to these sensitive regions near frontal zones within baroclinic systems. The predictability links between the tropospheric fronts, cyclones, jet regions, and gravity waves that vertically propagate upward through the stratosphere will be addressed further in the presentation. We examine RF23 during DEEPWAVE, which sampled deep propagating gravity waves over Auckland and Macquarie Islands. We provide insight into the gravity wave dynamics through applying the COAMPS and its adjoint at high resolution.",

            "abstract": "Mercury's hollows are shallow depressions, often with high-reflectance interiors and haloes. The fresh appearance of hollows indicates that they are relatively young features. Their morphology is suggestive of formation via sublimation-like loss of a volatile-bearing phase through solar heating, destruction by UV photolysis, contact with molten rock, or bombardment by micrometeoroids and/or ions. Hollows are found within the low-reflectance material (LRM) color unit. Following an examination of all MESSENGER images with pixel sizes <20 m and incidence angles <85°, shadow-length measurements made on 905 images yielded the depths of 2608 hollows. The mean depth is 24 ± 16 m. The narrow range of depths, despite formation within LRM units that are of much greater and more variable thickness, could result from development of a protective lag as the volatile-bearing phase is lost. The rate at which hollows form may be estimated as follows. The size–frequency distribution of Mercury rayed craters >4 km in diameter gives absolute model ages of 110 to 689 Ma, depending on the crater production model. The 41-km-diameter rayed crater Balanchine has a density of superposed craters similar to the average for all rayed craters, so we take Balanchine's age to be the population average. Hollows on Balanchine's floor are ~300 m wide. The average rate of hollows formation by horizontal scarp retreat for a 110 Ma model age would be 1 cm per 3700 Earth years. If Balanchine formed 689 Ma ago, then the average growth rate would be 1 cm per 23,000 yr. We also consider the mechanisms by which hollows form bright haloes. Calculations show that comet-style lofting of dust by sublimating gas is not important given Mercury's high surface gravitational acceleration. Instead, the bright haloes may form by condensation of sublimated material or by physical modification or chemical alteration of the surface by re-deposited sublimation products.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forest soils store large quantities of carbon (C) as soil organic matter (SOM), a substantial proportion of which is stored deep (> 30 cm) in the soil profile. Characterization of tropical SOM remains difficult, in part due to the analytical challenges associated high iron and low C concentrations. In this study, we combined solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with analytical thermal analysis (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC; evolved CO2 gas analysis, CO2-EGA) to explore patterns in SOM composition in deep soil profiles from two contrasting soil types at the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO) in northeast Puerto Rico. Prior to 13C NMR, soils were repeatedly demineralized with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove paramagnetic compounds and concentrate organic matter. Given the scant information on tropical subsoil OM, we also sought to evaluate the effect of HF acid treatments on tropical subsoil SOM. HF treatments effectively enriched sample C and removed paramagnetic compounds, allowing us to obtain high-quality NMR spectra for low-C subsoils. C:N ratios before and after HF treatment were nearly identical (mean = 16.6 ± 0.8), suggesting that the SOM pool was not substantially fractionated, though C recoveries were low and variable. Thermal analyses confirmed the loss of a substantial fraction of the soil mineral matrix, however, retention of several endothermic regions in post-HF Inceptisol soils indicated that not all minerals were completely solubilized. In addition, important differences in the DSC and CO2-EGA thermograms were observed in comparing samples before versus after HF treatments. These results suggest that the organo-mineral associations were substantially altered, though it is not immediately clear the degree to which alterations in chemical composition versus binding association have changed. In addition to these qualitative changes, quantitative interpretations of 13C-NMR results from low-C and high-Fe soils should be based on spin-counting experiments in conjunction with estimates of signal relaxation parameters.",

However, controversial results have been obtained: Gross [2000] and Gross et al. [2003] suggested oceanic processes are more efficient to excite the CW than atmospheric ones during 1980 – 2000. Brzezinski and Nastula [2002] concluded that their contributions are almost the same, and they can only provide ~80% of the power needed to maintain the CW observed during 1985 – 1996.\nPolar motion excitations involve not only the perturbations within the Earth system (namely, mass redistributions and motions of relative to the mantle), but also the Earth’s responses to those perturbations (namely, the rheology of the Earth). Chen et al. [2013a] developed an improved theory for polar motion excitation taking into account the Earth’s frequency-dependent responses, of which the polar motion transfer functions are ~10% higher than those of previous theories around the CW band. Chen et al. [2013b] compared the geophysical excitations derived from various global atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological models (NCEP, ECCO, ERA40, ERAinterim and ECMWF operational products), and found significant and broad-band discrepancies for models released by different institutes. In addition, the atmosphere, ocean and hydrology models are usually developed in a somewhat independent manner and thus the global (atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological) mass is not conserved [e.g., Yan and Chao, 2012]. Therefore, the matter-term excitations estimated from those models are problematic. In one word, it is unlikely to obtain reliable conclusions on meteorological excitations of CW on the basis of the original meteorological models.\nSatellite gravimetry can measure mass transportations caused by atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological processes much more accurately than those provided by the original meteorological models, and can force the global (atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological) mass to be conserved. Therefore, it might be promising to obtain better understanding on meteorological excitations of CW by assimilating the time-variable gravity data from GRACE and SLR to improve the matter terms of the meteorological excitations, and adopting the new polar motion theory of Chen et al. [2013a].",

            "abstract": "We evaluated fault activity in northeast– southwest Japan based on the regional stress and the fault orientation field for both active faults and inactive faults (here, an inactive fault is a fault which activity has not been identified in Quaternary). The regional stress field was calculated using the stress inversion method [Hardebeck and Michael, 2006] applied to earthquake focal mechanisms in the northeast–southwest Japan. The locations and orientations (i.e., strike and dip, assuming a planar fault geometry) of active faults in the study area were obtained from the Active Fault Database of Japan and inactive faults from a database compiled by Kosaka et al. [2011]. We employed slip tendency analysis [Morris et al., 1996] to evaluate the likelihood of fault slip. The values of the slip tendency is generally higher along active faults than along inactive faults. The difference between the slip tendencies of active and inactive faults reflects the difference in their activities. Furthermore the high slip tendency observed for some inactive faults suggests their high activity. These high slip tendencies imply that they have potential to be active. We propose the temporal evolution from inactive to active faulting during long-term crustal deformation to explain the potential for fault activity along inactive faults. When a region undergoes the transition from inactive to active faulting, potential active faults are observed as inactive faults with a high Part of this findig have been submitted to Tectonics (AGU Journal) (2015-07-27). We will presentate some new findings.slip tendency. The average slip tendency of inactive faults gradually increases from northeast to southwest Japan, because a relatively large number of inactive faults in southwest Japan have a high slip tendency. The representative deformation zones in Japan shows a relationship with the observed spatial variations in the evolution from inactive to active faulting.

In the segment, ridge-parallel abyssal hills are mostly recognized at the northern section while the disturbed flank fabrics are limited in the south inside corner where ocean core complex is located. Spreading center represents a narrow and shallow valley floor at the middle of the segment but becomes wide and deep at the ends of segment. The shallow valley in middle of the segment is indicative of abundant magmatic upwelling. The ocean core complex in the southern end of the segment rises to ~1000 m from the valley floor and extends tens km perpendicular to the axial ridge, displaying the gentle dome structure with corrugations well traced. In the axial valley, light scattering anomalies are observed at both the middle and southern end of the segment but the significant methane anomalies are merely detected at the southern end of segment. At off-axis, the ocean core complex reveals both light scattering and methane anomalies. Considering the methane anomalies over the core complex where mantle rocks expose by long detachment faults, plumes at this region seems to be derived by tectonic and amagmatic processes. Whereas the particulate anomalies with few methane anomaly in the middle of segment implies plumes appears to be created by magmatism.",

The D* tectonic phase is marked by the rifting of the original Gyeonggi Massif into North Gyeonggi Massif (NGM: present Gyeonggi Massif) and South Gyeonggi Massif (SGM: Bakdallyeong and Busan gneiss complexes). Its associated bimodal type volcano-plutonism occurred at least four times, two times at Neoproterozoic, a Early Paleozoic, a Late Paleozoic ages. The lower (quartzose psammitic, pelitic, calcareous and basic rocks) and upper (conglomerate and pelitic rocks and acidic rocks) units of Ogcheon Supergroup (OSG) were deposited in the Ogcheon rift basin (ORB) during Early and Late Paleozoic times, respectively. The D1 phase is characterized by the coupling of NGM and SGM with closing of ORB and the M1 metamorphism of OSG at its earlier phase, and by the coupling of South China block (Gyeonggi Massif and Ogcheon Zone) and North China block (Yeongnam Massif and Taebaksan Zone) and Cheongsan dextral strike-slip shearing and formation of Middle Triassic Dadong basin in its later phase. The D2 is marked by Honam dextral strike-slip shearing and the M2 metamorphism of OSG by the intrusion of Daebo granitoids at the inter-tectonic phase. The D3 is by NNE-trending sinistral strike-slip shearing and the M3 retrograde metamorphism of OSG. The D4 occurred along Geumgang fault, and formed a giant-scale Geumgang drag fold intruded by Late Cretaceous acidic dykes.",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous measurements of new particle formation (NPF) events were conducted during two cruises over China Seas and at a coastal site. NPF events occurred in thirteen days out of 38 sampling days over China Seas, and the NPF events in eleven days were confirmed to be regional occurred with the spatial scale at least 47 km-475 km. The formation rates of new particles were 5.3±5.0 particles cm-3s-1 in marine NPF events while 2.4±1.2 particles cm-3s-1 in coastal NPF events. The reason for the lower formation rates in coastal atmosphere might be the higher number concentration of pre-existing particles and larger condensation sinks. However, the growth rates of new particles in marine NPF events (3.3±2.2 nm h-1) were lower than in coastal NPF events (4.3±2.2 nm h-1), which might be caused by more precursors for new particles growth in the coastal city. In the marine atmosphere, new particles can grow from nucleation mode (<30 nm) to Aitken mode (30-100 nm) in seven days. However, the largest geometric median diameter of new particles (Dpg) was 50 nm in two days with the low number concentration, indicating the negligible contribution of marine new particles to CCN production. In the coastal atmosphere, new particles can grow to about 100 nm in two days, but the second-stage growth of new particles seemed to be generated from mixing process with pre-existing particles rather than gas-particle condensation. The measurement of particular chemical composition during the marine NPF days showed the important role of organic acids in new particles.",

            "abstract": "The Tian Shan range is an inherited intracontinental structure reactivated by the far-field effects of India-Asia collision. A growing body of thermochronology and magnetostratigraphy datasets shows the range grew through several tectonic pulses since ~25 Ma, however the early Cenozoic history remains poorly constrained. Particularly enigmatic is the time-lag between the Eocene India-Asia collision and the Miocene onset of Tian Shan exhumation. This peculiar period is potentially recorded along the southwestern Tian Shan piedmont. There, recently dated late Eocene marine deposits of the proto-Paratethys epicontinental sea transition to continental foreland basin sediments of unknown age. We provide magnetostratigraphic dating of these continental sediments from the 1700-m-thick Mine section integrated with previously published detrital apatite fission track and U/Pb zircon ages. The most likely correlation to the geomagnetic polarity time scale indicates an age span from 20.8 to 13.3 Ma with a marked accumulation rate increase at 19-18 Ma. This implies the entire Oligocene period is missing between the last marine and first continental sediments, as suggested by previous southwestern Tian Shan results. This differs from the southwestern Tarim basin where Eocene marine deposits are continuously overlain by late Eocene-Oligocene continental sediments. This supports a simple evolution model of the western Tarim basin with Eocene-Oligocene foreland basin activation to the south related to northward thrusting of the Kunlun Shan, followed by early Miocene activation of northern foreland basin related to overthrusting of the south Tian Shan. Our data also support southward propagation of the Tian Shan piedmont from 20-18 Ma that may relate to motion on the Talas Fergana Fault. The coeval activation of a major right-lateral strike-slip system allowing indentation of the Pamir Salient into the Tarim basin, suggest far-field deformation from the India-Asia collision zone affected the Tian Shan and the Talas Fergana fault by early Miocene.",

With the inherently 1-dimensional sampling, however, those studies could not confirm whether (1) the electric and magnetic field fluctuations are spatial structures rather than temporal variations, and (2) horizontal shapes of the field fluctuation regions generally have mirror symmetry with respect to the magnetic equator, just as MSTIDs do. In this presentation we analyze magnetic field data sampled by three identical Swarm satellites. The results support the idea of a close connection between mid-latitude magnetic fluctuations (MMFs) and MSTIDs in the nighttime sector. Combined with the relationship between MMFs and MSTIDs, the MMF climatology can be used for extending that of MSTIDs, which has been poorly investigated over oceans. In addition, we have conducted a scale size analysis and found that coherence lengths of MMFs are typically shorter than 150 km. We also discuss the possibility that the MMF regions are aligned with the background magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "The Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB hereafter) in the northern margin of the South China Sea has attracted great attention not only because of its special tectonic location but also for its abundant hydrocarbon resources. Tectonic evolution controls the petroleum geological condition of hydrocarbon-bearing basins. Efforts have been made to understand the tectonic evolution of this basin. However, many issues about the tectonic features and the evolution process of this basin, such as the age of the breakup unconformities and the anomalously accelerated subsidence during the post-rifting stage, remain controversial.\nHere we employ tectonic subsidence analysis of sedimentary basins, a technique of removing isostatic loading and compaction effects by back-stripping, to investigate the tectonic controls on the basin formation of the PRMB. We performed the analysis on 4 drill wells and 43 synthetic wells constructed based on recently acquired seismic profiles. The result shows that tectonic subsidence in the eastern sags of the PRMB began to decrease at ~30Ma while in the western sags the onset was ~23.8Ma. This suggests that the break-up time i.e. the end of rifting in the PRMB is earlier in the eastern sags than in the western sags. Abnormally accelerated tectonic subsidence occurred between 17.5-16.4Ma during the post-rifting stage, at an average subsidence rate as high as 301.9m/Ma. This phenomenon discriminates the PRMB from the category of classical Atlantic passive continental marginal basins, of which the tectonic subsidence during the post-rifting stage decays exponentially. The main objective of this paper is to provide insights into the geological and geodynamic evolution of the PRMB. The result bears significance to hydrocarbon exploration in this region.",

It has been widely analyzed using field observation, wind tunnel experiments and wind erosion models at arid and semi-arid agricultural areas in North China. It was seldom studies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) yet because of the cold environment and fewer human activities over there. However, the desertification has been reported intensified and expanded in recent decades over central and eastern QTP [\nDong et al., 2009\n]. Land surface models are useful tool in land processes simulation, and underwent several generations with various progresses in geophysical and geochemical processes. For instance, the new generation community Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) has been worldwide implied and performs well in simulating the land surface conditions in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, none of the land surface models involves the wind erosion process. In this study, a wind erosion model -- Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) is coupled with the Noah-MP. According to Li et al. (2015), the majority land cover type over the QTP is grassland, meadow and bare land. Thus the concerning of crop and cultivated lands are not included in the coupling. The coupled model is called Noah-MPES in which Noah-MP serves as the basic system providing the climate and land surface variables for wind erosion calculation. The coupled Noah-MPES was implemented and tested at five stations near the Qinghai-Tibet Railway: BJ, Anduo, D66, from GAME-Tibet, Tanggula and Xidatan, where Noah-MP simulation shows well performance in soil temperature and soil water content at upper soil levels. The wind erosion will be validated by comparing to the results from 137Cs tracer method [\nYan et al., 2001\n]. Wind erosion along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway will be simulated and investigated then.\n",

By comparing weather station data with the reanalysis data, the lowest bounds of high winds and heavy rainfall are set at 11.2 m s-1 and 1.38 mm hr-1, respectively; these correspond to the 99th percentiles of the observed daily maximums of winds and accumulated rainfall. The number of grids in which wind speed and rainfall exceed these threshold values is regarded as the high winds and heavy rainfall extent, respectively. Analysis results show that both of the high winds and heavy rainfall extent are positively correlated with the TC landfall intensity while the ratio of the high winds extent to the total TC-influence extent is negatively correlated with the ratio of the heavy rainfall extent to the total TC-influence extent. Accordingly, the heavy rainfall dominated TC generally shows weaker winds and heavier rainfall than high winds dominated TC. This negative relationship between the relative extent of high wind and heavy rainfall becomes more noticeable as TC weakens. A composite analysis on large-scale environments revealed that the presence of anomalous upper tropospheric trough and jet flow over the Korean peninsula appears to be responsible for heavy rainfall dominated TC, and vice versa for high winds dominated TC.",

A significant positive correlation is found between the EU pattern and OSJ with the EU leads the OSJ by about 5 days. There is no obvious correlation between the EU pattern and PSJ. The positive EU phase is accompanied by a weakened and poleward shifted PFJ, which coincides with an intensified OSJ. Meanwhile, the PFJ also moves westward while the OSJ migrates eastward. In negative EU phase, the PFJ is unusually strong and moves more southward, merging with the PSJ. A possible mechanism for the variation of EAJS during different EU phases is explored via analyzing the effects of 10-day high- and low-frequency eddy forcing. The zonal wind tendency due to high-frequency eddy forcing contributes to the simultaneous negative correlation between the EU and PFJ as well as the northward/southward shift of PFJ. Low-frequency eddy forcing is responsible for the westward/eastward shift of PFJ in company with the evolution of EU. High- and low-frequency eddy forcing are both responsible for the positive correlation between the EU and OSJ but only high-frequency eddy contributes to the lagged variation of the OSJ relative to EU. The negative correlation between the EU and temperature/precipitation anomalies in northern/eastern China sustains only when the PFJ and OSJ are out of phase with each other. Thus, the EAJS plays an important role in transmitting the EU signal to temperature and precipitation anomalies in East Asia.",

            "abstract": "It has been paid more and more attention for forecasting sunspot maximum of future solar cycle in recent decades, and a variety of forecasting methods have been studied. However, to make an accurate prediction is still very difficult due to the complexities of the characteristics of solar activity. Some authors summerized a variety of methods for the maximum predictions of 22nd, 23rd, 24th solar cycles, the incomplete statistics are 63, 54 and 75 cases respectively, results of the methods, which the difference between forecasting and observed values within the range of ±15%, are 27.0%, 25.9% and 24.3% respectively. Using the 13 points smoothed value of monthly sunspot numbers, we studied correlation between sunspot number rising rate of the first 24 months of the solar cycle and the coming cycle maximum, published forecasting result that the maximum value was 139.2 ± 18.8 for 23rd solar cycle (Han et al., 2000), and the observed value is 120.8, the error is about 15.2%. The present paper describes our improved forecasting methods. First, Vondrak smoothing method is used to deal with the monthly sunspot numbers. It is studied that the relationship between the rise rate of earlier months of sunspot numbers of this smoothed sequence and the coming maximum value in each solar cycles. The results show that the first 22, 23, 24 months rise rate of sunspot numbers are highly related with the coming maximum values, and simulated prediction of maximum for 22~24 cycles show that using the 22-month rise rate of three solar cycles, the maximum forecasting error is about 13.2%, using 23-month rise rate, the maximum error is about 11.2%, while using 24-month rise rate, the maximum error is only about 9.3%. The new method not only improves the forecasting accuracy but also can make the forecasting time in advance at least half a year than the common method using 13 points monthly smoothed value.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip on the Cascadia megathrust accommodates a significant portion of Juan de Fuca plate convergence with North America at depths between 25 and 40 km. Very high Vp/Vs values along the megathrust and tremor modulation by tidal forces indicate high fluid pressures in the tremor source region. Tremor density (number of events; i.e., five-minute windows during which coherent tremor is locatable)/km2) varies along strike and with plate depth. We show that variations in tremor density correlate with large faults in the forearc of the overlying plate. Strong gradients in tremor density outline a ~20 km-wide band of maximum tremor along the forearc that is segmented by transverse zones of lower tremor occurrence. These transverse zones coincide with isostatic gravity gradients caused by large forearc faults. The faults accommodate northward motion and rotation of forearc blocks in part driven by Pacific-North America dextral shear and oblique convergence. Short tremor bursts lasting hours to days commonly terminate at or near a block boundary and appear compartmentalized beneath fault-bounded forearc blocks. Some faults appear to be barriers to large-scale tremor migration, but others appear to have little effect on migration. Seismicity, seismic velocity tomography, potential fields, and structural geology indicate the faults extend deep into the forearc. If the faults extend to the megathrust, they could provide fracture pathways for fluids to escape from the over-pressured megathrust. We hypothesize that fluid pressure on the megathrust is reduced by the escape of fluids along the crustal faults and into the overlying plate, thus locally reducing tremor occurrence. The damping of tremor and related slow slip caused by fluid escape into upper plate faults could affect deep strain accumulation and fault properties along the megathrust, possibly influencing the behavior of great earthquakes.",

As a consequences, the carbon budget balance between the grassland ecosystem and the atmosphere may altered. Our research indicated that the GEP of cultivated steppe was enhanced significantly, in comparison with adjacent grazed steppes. However, with a significant rise of the respiration of the crops (Ra) and of heterotrophic respiration of the cultivated ecosystem (Rh), the NEP of the steppes cultivated to cropland is significantly lower than that of the grazed or grazing excluded steppes. The respiration of the aboveground part of ecosystem (Rab) and of the underground part (Rb) both contributes to the dramatic increase of the ecosystem respiration (Re) in cultivated steppe. The steppes under three different management types show a significant difference on the underground root biomass, but the difference on the root respiration (Rr) is not significant. This phenomenon is due to the negative exponential relationship between the root-top ratio and the root respiration activity. The communities on the grazed and grazing excluded steppes have a significantly higher carbon fixation efficiency than the steppes cultivated to cropland (wheat fields). The heterotrophic respiration (Rh) of the ecosystem explains to the maximum extent the carbon use efficiency (CUE) of the vegetation (95%). Long term grazing exclusion or cultivation reduces the net photosynthesis ,NEE and CUE of the steppe ecosystem and weakens the carbon sink function of the vegetation, while enhancing the soil respiration CO2 release with different respiration sources composition.",

With species-based equations of state, density of a phase in the system is obtained by summing up concentrations of all species. This circumvents the problem of having to use empirical functions. Moreover, reaction rates of all species are incorporated in mass conservation equation for fluid flow. Formation enthalpy of all species is included in the law of energy conservation as a source-sink term. Finite element methods are used to discretize the governing equations.

            "abstract": "Impact of anthropogenic activities on water cycle and water supply has different effects at global and regional spatial scales, ensuing the need for a design and water management approach that considers anthropogenic inputs. One of the major inputs in local-to-regional availability of water and the water cycle are land use land cover change as a result of urbanization, artificial reservoirs and irrigation activity. This study employed a multi-factorial approach involving population trends, water use (and demand), streamflow; and various satellite derived water-relevant variables. These variables are: daily precipitation (from TRMM, 3B42.V7), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI (from MODIS-MOD13A1), land surface temperature-LST (from MODIS-MOD11A2), and land cover (MODIS-MCD12Q1). Long terms exhibited by such data were used to understand temporal and spatial trends in impounded watersheds hosting a large and growing city in its proximity. The selected cities are: City of Atlanta-Georgia and Buford dam; Columbia-South Carolina and Saluda dam; Columbus-Ohio and Alum Creek dam; Montgomery-Alabama and Jordan dam; Tulsa-Oklahoma and Keystone dam; Tuscaloosa-Alabama and Tuscaloosa dam were selected. our study reveals that daily mean stream flow has been decreasing in all but one (Tulsa) of the areas selected. Satellite data trends between 2000 and 2012 showed a steady decrease in precipitation and NDVI; while LST has gradually increased. We attribute the NDVI (i.e., gradual decrease in vegetation cover) to LST rather than precipitation trends. The results of this research suggested that future temperature projection from climate models can be used in understanding vegetation activity and water availability over the study areas. Cities with larger upstream watershed area are potentially more sustainable and resilient (than those with small watersheds) as a result of spatial variability of water resources’ response to climate change. Inter-basin water resources transfer is a possible solution to vulnerable cities in the future. The study results stressed the need to establish a sustainable and resilient water resources management system that includes narrowing information and perception gap between the engineering community and the general public.",

However, our understanding about the vegetation seasonality is mostly confined to some phenological timings such as spring emergence and fall senescence. This study assessed large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VGrate), which indicates the rate of canopy development from winter dormancy to summer maturity, and its relationship over Northern Hemisphere temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. VGrate and local temperature changes show a positive correlation over the region of interest, and it indicates that a temperature increase during green-up period leads to faster canopy development. The responses of VGrate tend to be more sensitive to positive temperature anomalies than negative anomalies despite same magnitude of the temperature changes. These nonlinear responsiveness of VGrate to local temperature change is clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests over Eurasia compared to woodlands over North America. These results suggest that anomalous warming in green-up period would make canopy developments faster over wide temperate and boreal forest areas.",

            "abstract": "The Pliocene Epoch is regarded as a time of great surface ocean warming in the Northern Hemisphere, but the thermal history in the Southern Hemisphere, where a large ice sheet prevailed, remains unknown. DSDP Site 594 monitors subantarctic surface waters at present and as such, sea surface temperature (SST) at this site may provide our best quantitative indication to date of Pliocene ocean temperatures in the vital region that interacted with the Antarctic ice sheet.\nWe present a continuous, high resolution (~2 kyr) SST record for the time span from ~5.6 to 2.6 Ma, based on alkenone unsaturation from deep sea drilling project Site 594. The SST record from Site 594 allows us to investigate the Southern Ocean thermal history (magnitude and timing) for the whole Pliocene Epoch for the first time. Average long-term SST at Site 594 is only slightly above present day SST at this location, in agreement with sparse available SST reconstructions in other regions of the Southern Ocean. Our findings suggest that the Southern Hemisphere mid to high latitudes were on average contrastingly colder than the rest of the Pliocene world. This \"average Pliocene coolness\" may be related to the Antarctic cryosphere, suggesting Antarctic ice volume similar to late Pleistocene.\nWe also find important trends in this SST record, which include a distinct long-term (≥ orbital) long wave pattern of pronounced warming and cooling events along a gradual cooling background (~1 °C/Myr). The evolution of long wave patterns shown here is connected to pervasive eccentricity-related changes, contrasting previous assumptions of obliquity dominance during the Pliocene Epoch. The eccentricity response we find clearly dominates the variance of not only Site 594, but also other available reconstructions, and is likely related to non-linear feedbacks triggered by precession. The long wavelength features shown in this work suggest that the time leading up to a bipolar cryosphere was not dominated almost monocyclically by the 41-kyr variance in the Pliocene.",

            "abstract": "Severe water scarcity and unreasonable allocation are threatening the eco-environment in the Heihe River basin (HRB), an arid and semi-arid watershed in Northwest China. The water use in the middle oasis accounts for about 70% of the total water use in the HRB, in which over 85% are consumed by irrigated agriculture. Thus the regional assessment and improvement of irrigation water use are quite essential for water-saving and eco-environmental sustainability. This paper applied a distributed agro-hydrological model (SWAP-EPIC) integrated with ArcGIS to investigate the irrigation water use efficiency (WUE) in the middle oasis. The detailed distributed data in 2012, including soil properties, irrigation schedules, crop pattern and calendar, were collected and used in the regional simulation. The spatial-temporal distribution of LAI and evapotranspiration (ETa) from remote sensing were used as observations to calibrate the model. Results showed that the simulation data was in a good agreement with the observation one. The relative WUE (i.e. divided by the mean value) ranged from 0.77 to 1.33 in different canal command areas. Large spatial variations of WUE were mainly caused by the non-uniform distribution of irrigation water. The present irrigation performance was poor, and only 50% of total irrigation amount was finally utilized through evapotranspiration in the whole district. While nearly 24% of the irrigation water were lost through field deep percolation and 26% were wasted in canal conveyance. Further analysis of water-saving scenarios was conducted through applying the improved irrigation schedule for each crop-soil unites and increasing the canal conveyance efficiency. Prediction showed that 15% of total irrigation amount can be saved without reduction of crop yield.",

            "abstract": "The strength of the hydrological cycle is a critical component to understand in predicting climate change. A closely connected variable is the moisture content of the subtropical free troposphere. Here, the idealized Held-Suarez (HS) dynamic core is utilized to study moisture effects through controlled experiments (Held and Suarez, 1994, BAMS). The HS core involves a spherical rotating planet with a dry atmosphere forced by a Newtonian relaxation of temperature toward a prescribed zonally symmetric equilibrium temperature as well as planetary boundary layer drag represented by Rayleigh damping.\nWith fixed temperature and circulation patterns, clouds can be isolated. To this end, the HS model is run as a base case with a passive water tracer (no clouds) as well as with a cloud scheme used in comprehensive climate models. Without clouds, water is precipitated whenever saturation is reached, but with a cloud scheme, cloud formation and precipitation is influenced by microphysical factors as well as processes such as re-evaporation.\nIn the base case, the HS model yields a global average precipitation value of 2.39 mm/day. With clouds, the value increases to 3.10 mm/day. While both these values are relatively proximate to observations, the difference in the values suggests that cloud processes have an important bearing on the strength of the hydrological cycle (in the absence of radiative balance).\nThe idealized HS model yields a qualitatively realistic relative humidity distribution, but the most noticeable climatological discrepancy is the subtropics which are too dry. However, with the introduction of a cloud scheme, these dry values improve noticeably, implying that missing cloud microphysics are a contributing factor to the base case’s dry bias.\nThrough various sensitivity studies and an analysis of the moisture budget, implications are drawn for a broader understanding of what controls subtropical relative humidity and thus the strength of the hydrological cycle.",

The migration and attenuation of NO3-N and NH4-N during river bank filtration were investigated. The quality of river water in the monitoring section showed a seasonal variation, with the highest NO3-N concentration 18.7 mg/L during autumn season. The results also indicated that NO3-N removal mainly occurred in the riverbed sediment during river filtration into the saturated zone, with a removal rate approximately 73%. While an evident NH4-N accumulation was found in the riverbed sediment pore water. The average NO3-N concentration decreased to 1.2 mg/L in the saturated aquifer, and the removal rate was approximately 88%. It showed that NO3-N in the reclaimed water can be effectively removed by denitrification during the filtration process. While, NH4-N concentration in river bank filtration was found to slightly increase from 0.18 mg/L to 0.31mg/L, thus showed a potential threat to groundwater pollution.

Tree-ring widths provide a strong indicator of the occurrence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. We are measuring physiological processes, including carbon uptake and loss, leaf-scale gas exchange and sap flow together with meteorological data to explore the mechanisms of the climate response of this iconic and culturally significant species. In this continuous 15 min time interval sap flow dataset spanning four years, we have captured very wet and very dry summer periods. Winter flow rates peaked lower than summer flow rates and winter flow also started later and finished earlier in the day, resulting in less water use. Larger, canopy dominant trees (DBH up to 176 cm) had large sapwood area (sapwood depth up to 18 cm) and faster flow rates and therefore dominated stand water use. During dry periods, smaller trees (DBH 20-80 cm) were more responsive to dry soils than larger trees, suggesting access to deeper soil water stores. Leaf-scale gas exchange rates were low with very low stomatal conductance values reflecting known vulnerability to xylem embolism. Night-time refilling of sapwood was particularly evident during the summer drought with evidence that refilling was incomplete as the drought progressed. Photosynthetically active radiation and vapour pressure deficit are strongly correlated with sap flow across all seasons, a promising indicator for future modelling work on this dataset. Water saving strategies and stand-scale water budgets are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The northern plain is the important food production region in China. However, due to the lack of surface water resources, it needs overmuch exploitation of groundwater to maintain water use in agriculture, which leads to serious environmental problems. Based on the assumption that the reserves of groundwater matches the statistics and keeps on stable, the author explores the reasonable agricultural water and its spatial distribution based on the principle of sustainable utilization of water resources. According to the priorities of water resources allocation (domestic water and ecological water＞industrial water＞agricultural water), it is proposed to reduce agricultural water use to balance the groundwater reserves on condition that the total water supply is constant. Method: Firstly, we calculate annual average of northern groundwater reserves changes from 2004 to 2010, which is regarded as the reduction of agricultural water; Then, we estimate the food production changes using variables of typical crop water requirements and unit yields assuming that the efficiency of water use keeps the same during the entire study period; Finally, we evaluate the usage of sustainable agricultural water. The results reveal that there is a significant reduction of groundwater reserves in Haihe river basin and Xinjiang oasis regions; And the annual loss of the corn and wheat production is about 1.86 billion kg and 700 million kg respectively due to the reduction of agricultural water; What’s more, in order to ensure China's food security and sustainable agricultural water use, in addition to great efforts to develop water-saving agriculture, an important adjustment in the distribution of food production is in need. This study provided a basis to the availability of agricultural water and a new perspective was put forth for an estimation of agricultural water.",

            "abstract": "The high-sensitive seismograph network Japan (Hi-net) operated by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) has about 800 stations with average separation of 20 km. We can observe long-period seismic wave propagation as a 2D wavefield with station separations shorter than wavelength. In contrast, short-period waves are quite incoherent at stations, however, their envelope shapes resemble at neighbor stations. Therefore, we may be able to extract seismic wave energy propagation by seismogram envelope analysis. We attempted to characterize seismic waveform at long-period and its envelope at short-period as 2D wavefield by applying seismic gradiometry.\nWe applied the seismic gradiometry to a synthetic long-period (20-50s) dataset prepared by numerical simulation in realistic 3D medium at the Hi-net station layout. Wave amplitude and its spatial derivatives are estimated by using data at nearby stations. The slowness vector, the radiation pattern and the geometrical spreading are extracted from estimated velocity, displacement and its spatial derivatives.\nFor short-periods at shorter than 1 s, seismogram envelope shows temporal and spatial broadening through scattering by medium heterogeneity. It is expected that envelope shape may be coherent among nearby stations. Based on this idea, we applied the same method to the time-integration of seismogram envelope to estimate its spatial derivatives. Together with seismogram envelope, we succeeded in estimating the slowness vector from the seismogram envelope as well as long-period waveforms by synthetic test, without using phase information.\nOur preliminarily results show that the seismic gradiometry suits the Hi-net to extract wave propagation characteristics both at long and short periods. This method is appealing that it can estimate waves at homogeneous grid to monitor seismic wave as a wavefield. It is promising to obtain phase velocity variation from direct waves, and to grasp wave packets originating from scattering from coda, by applying the seismic gradiometry to the Hi-net.",

            "abstract": "The Malawi Rift (MR) is an immature rift located at the southern tip of the Western branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). Pronounced border faults and tectonic segmentation are seen within the upper crust. Surface volcanism in the region is limited to the Rungwe volcanic province located north of Lake Malawi (Nyasa). However, the distribution of extension and magma at depth in the crust and mantle lithosphere is unknown. As the Western Rift of the EARS is largely magma-poor except for discrete volcanic provinces, the MR presents the ideal location to elucidate the role of magmatism in early-stage rifting and the manifestation of segmentation at depth. This study investigates the shear velocity of the crust and mantle lithosphere beneath the MR to constrain the thermal structure, the amount of total crustal and lithospheric thinning, and the presence and distribution of magmatism beneath the rift. Utilizing 55 stations from the SEGMeNT (Study of Extension and maGmatism in Malawi aNd Tanzania) passive-source seismic experiment operating in Malawi and Tanzania, we employed a multi-channel cross-correlation algorithm to obtain inter-station phase and amplitude information from Rayleigh wave observations between 20 and 80 s period. We retrieve estimates of phase velocity between 9-20 s period from ambient noise cross-correlograms in the frequency domain via Aki’s formula. We invert phase velocity measurements to obtain estimates of shear velocity (Vs) between 50-200 km depth. Preliminary results reveal a striking low-velocity zone (LVZ) beneath the Rungwe volcanic province with Vs ~4.2-4.3 km/s in the uppermost mantle. Low velocities extend along the entire strike of Lake Malawi and to the west where a faster velocity lid (~4.5 km/s) is imaged. These preliminary results will be extended by incorporating broadband data from seven “lake”-bottom seismometers (LBS) to be retrieved from Lake Malawi in October of this year. The crust and mantle modeling will be extended by integrating constraints from broadband body-wave studies and the ongoing analysis of refraction data collected on 27 short-period LBS during the active-source portion of the SEGMeNT.",

            "abstract": "Since the first deep biosphere-dedicated Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 201 using the US drill ship JOIDES Resolution in 2002, scientific ocean drilling has offered unique opportunities to expand our knowledge of the nature and extent of the deep biosphere. The latest estimate of the global subseafloor microbial biomass is ~1029cells, accounting for 4 Gt of carbon and ~1% of the Earth’s total living biomass. The subseafloor microbial communities are evolutionarily diverse and their metabolic rates are extraordinarily slow. Nevertheless, accumulating activity most likely plays a significant role in elemental cycles over geological time.\nIn 2010, during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 329, the JOIDES Resolutionexplored the deep biosphere in the open-ocean South Pacific Gyre—the largest oligotrophic province on our planet. During Expedition 329, relatively high concentrations of dissolved oxygen and significantly low biomass of microbial populations were observed in the entire sediment column, indicating that (i) there is no limit to life in open-ocean sediment and (ii) a significant amount of oxygen reaches through the sediment to the upper oceanic crust. This “deep aerobic biosphere” inhabits the sediment throughout up to ~37 percent of the world’s oceans. The remaining ~63 percent of the oceans is comprised of higher productivity areas that contain the “deep anaerobic biosphere”.\nIn 2012, during IODP Expedition 337, the Japanese drill ship Chikyu explored coal-bearing sediments down to 2,466 meters below the seafloor off the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan. Geochemical and microbiological analyses consistently showed the occurrence of methane-producing communities associated with the coal beds. Cell concentrations in deep sediments were notably lower than those expected from the global regression line, implying that the bottom of the deep biosphere is approached in these beds. Taxonomic composition of the deep coal-bearing communities profoundly differs from those in shallower marine sediments and instead resembles organotrophic communities in forest soils. These findings suggest that the terrigenous microbial ecosystem has been partly retained from the original depositional setting over 20 million years and contributed to deep carbon cycling ever since.",

            "abstract": "Precise identification of major processes that influe\nnce groundwater flow system is of fundamental importance for the performance assessment of waste disposal in subsurface. In the characterization of groundwater flow system, gravity- and pressure-driven flows have been conventionally assumed as dominant processes. However, recent studies have suggested that argillites can act as semipermeable membranes and they can cause chemically driven flow, i.e., chemical osmosis, under salinity gradients, which may generate erratic pore pressures in argillaceous formations. In order to identify the possibility that chemical osmosis is involved in erratic pore pressure generations in argillaceous formations, it is essential to measure the semipermeability of formation media; however, in the measurements of semipermeability, little consideration has been given to the stresses that the formation media would have experienced in past geologic processes. This study investigates the influence of stress history on the semipermeability of an argillite by an experimental approach. A series of chemical osmosis experiments were performed on Wakkanai mudstones to measure the evolution of semipermeability during loading and unloading confining pressure cycles. The osmotic efficiency, which represents the semipermeability, was estimated at each confining pressure. The results show that the osmotic efficiency increases almost linearly with increasing confining pressure; however, the increased osmotic efficiency does not recover during unloading unless the confining pressure is almost relieved. The observed unrecoverable change in osmotic efficiency may have an important implication on the evaluation of chemical osmosis in argillaceous formations that have been exposed to large stresses in past geologic processes. If the osmotic efficiency increased by the past stress can remain unchanged to date, the osmotic efficiency should be measured at the past highest stress rather than the current in-situ stress. Otherwise, the effect of chemical osmosis on the pore pressure generation would be underestimated.",

Thresholds of liquid water potential temperature difference ΔθL < 0.5 K (>0.5 K) and total water mixing ratio difference Δqt < 0.5 g/kg (> 0.5 g/kg) below the cloud base were used for selecting the coupled (decoupled) cases. A schematic diagram was given to demonstrate the coupled and decoupled MBL vertical structures and how they associate with non-drizzle, virga and rain drizzle events. Out of a total of 2676 5-min samples, 34.5% were classified as coupled and 65.5% as decoupled; 36.2% as non-drizzle and 63.8% as drizzle (47.7% as virga, 16.1% as rain); 33.4% as daytime and 66.6% as nighttime. The decoupled cloud layer is deeper (0.406 km) than coupled cloud layer (0.304 km), and its liquid water path (LWP) and cloud-droplet effective radius (re) values (122.1 gm-2 and 13.0 µm) are higher than coupled ones (83.7 gm-2 and 10.4 µm). Conversely, decoupled stratocumuli have lower cloud-droplet number concentration (Nd) and surface cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration (NCCN) (74.5 cm-3 and 150.9 cm-3) than coupled stratocumuli (111.7 cm-3 and 216.4 cm-3). The linear regressions between re and Nd with NCCN have demonstrated that coupled re and Nd strongly depend on NCCN and have higher correlations (-0.56 and 0.59) with NCCN than decoupled results (-0.14 and 0.25). The MBL cloud properties under non-drizzle and virga drizzle conditions are similar to each other, but significantly different to those of rain drizzle.",

            "abstract": "In our search for habitable exoplanets, it is important to understand how planetary habitability is influenced by orbital configurations that differ from those of the terrestrial planets in our Solar system. In particular, observational surveys have revealed the prevalence of planetary systems around binary stars. Within these systems, the gravitational influence of a companion star can induce libration in the eccentricity of the planet's orbit (referred to as Kozai Cycles) on timescales as short as thousands of years. The resulting fluctuations in stellar flux at the top of the atmosphere can potentially induce dramatic variations in surface temperatures, with direct implications for the planet's habitability prospects. We investigate this research problem using two steps. First, we utilize the MERCURY N-body integrator in order to calculate the eccentricity of a hypothetical Earth-analogue under the gravitational influence of a stellar companion. Second, we run a coupled Global Climate Model (GCM) at various stages of a cycle provided by the MERCURY runs in order to examine if the increase in insolation renders the planet uninhabitable. This work will allow us to better understand how Kozai cycles influence the boundaries of a planet's habitable zone.",

In the case of an antelope, in the wild it's an animal, in a zoo it's a document. It is the primary source of information, specifically when it is made an object of study.\nWhen discussing earth science data, we may think about numbers in a spreadsheet or verbal descriptions of a rock. But what about physical materials such as cores, cuttings, fossils, and other tangible objects? The most recent version of the American Geophysical Union’s data position statement states data preservation and management policies should apply to both “digital data and physical objects”[1]. If an antelope is a document, than isn’t a rock a form of data?\nLike books in a library or items in a museum, these objects require surrogates (digital or analog) that allow researchers to access and retrieve them. Once these scientific objects are acquired, researchers can process the information they contain. Unlike books, and some museum materials, most earth science objects cannot yet be completely replaced by digital surrogates. A fossil may be scanned, but the original is needed for chemical testing and ultimately for ‘not yet developed’ processes of scientific analysis.\nThese objects along with their metadata or other documentation become scientific data when they are used in research. Without documentation of key information (i.e. the location where it was collected) these objects may lose their scientific value. This creates a complex situation where we must preserve the object, its metadata, and the connection between them. These factors are important as we consider the future of earth science data, our definitions of what constitutes scientific data, as well as our data preservation and management practices.\nThis talk will discuss current initiatives within the earth science communities (EarthCube’s EC3 and iSamples; USGS’s data preservation program; etc.) and within the communities of information science. As practitioners, these librarians, information scientists, and archivists work on similar issues and can offer practices and theories that might help us ‘future proof’ physical earth science records.\n[1] http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/draft-data-position-statement-comment",

Through a re-examination of the conceptual framework of ecosystem productivity and the integration of multi-source data, we assumed that the entire terrestrial ecosystems in China to be a large-scale regional biome-society system. We approximated the carbon fluxes of key natural and anthropogenic processes at a regional scale, including fluxes of emissions from reactive carbon and creature ingestion, and fluxes of emissions from anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in China were 7.78, 5.89 and 1.89 PgC a–1, respectively, during the period from 2001 to 2010. After accounting for the consumption of reactive carbon and creature ingestion (0.078 PgC a–1), fires (0.002 PgC a–1), water erosion (0.038 PgC a–1) and agricultural and forestry utilization (0.806 PgC a–1), the final carbon sink in China was about 0.966 PgC a–1; this was considered as the climate-based potential terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink for the current climate conditions in China. The carbon emissions caused by anthropogenic disturbances accounted for more than 42% of the NEP, which indicated that humans can play an important role in increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration and mitigating global climate change. This role can be fulfilled by reducing the carbon emissions caused by human activities and by prolonging the residence time of fixed organic carbon in the large-scale regional biome-society system through the improvement of ecosystem management.",

            "abstract": "Coping with droughts are one of the most important issues in arid and semi-arid regions. Mongolia, where are located in central Asia, are concerned the increase of droughts in the future (IPCC 2014). Mongolia has long history of livestock grazing. Herders have developed the mobile grazing systems to use spatiotemporal variable vegetation. Especially, they often take a rapid and long-distant movement to avoid drought condition (“otor” in Mongolia). The movement is a main adaptation measure to droughts for herders, and it would be applicable to other regions where will be increase the frequency of droughts in the future. However there are few knowledge about processes and actual conditions of the long-distant movement of herders and livestock across Mongolia. Therefore our objective is to discuss the long-distance movement as adaptation measures to droughts.\nMongolia has a climatic gradient along the latitude; rainfall variability in southern regions are higher than that in northern regions. Previous theoretical studies predicted that rainfall variability affect the grazing strategies. Based on them, we established two hypotheses about the relationship between climatic variability and the form of long distant movement.

            "abstract": "Mount Pagan is the currently active vent on the north end of Pagan Volcano, Mariana Islands. A persistent degassing plume, LP seismicity, and VLP infrasound (iVLP) have dominated activity since at least 2013, when ground-based geophysical sensors were first installed. Direct gas sampling with a Multi-GAS sensor indicates a plume generated by a shallow magmatic system. Here we present an analysis of coupled LP and iVLP events in order to reveal the details of their source processes and how the signals are related to shallow magmatic degassing.\nThe LP and iVLP waveform characteristics were highly stable from July 2013 – January 2014. Both events have durations of 5-20 s, occur every 1-2 minutes, and have emergent onsets. The LP events have a dominant frequency of 0.54 Hz, while the dominant frequency of the iVLP is 0.32 Hz. The delay times between the LP and iVLP arrivals show little variation during the 7-month study, indicating a stable, shallow, and nearly co-located source. Full waveform inversion of a master LP event reveals a volumetric source 60 m below and 180 m west of the summit vent. Inverting Green’s functions of different geometric combinations results in a 2-crack model dominated by a subhorizontal crack intersecting a NW-SE trending dike. The extension of the modeled crack intersects the surface near the vent location. The nearly horizontal orientation of the dominant crack is likely controlled by the orientation of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits that are observed in the western wall of the cone at the LP depth. We propose that the LP seismicity is crack resonance triggered by collapse of the gas-charged upper conduit system following periodic venting. Measured and modeled pressure-velocity (P/Vz) ratios for the seismoacoustic events indicate that elastodynamic processes associated with the seismic LP cannot generate the iVLP. Thus, we model the iVLP as volume resonance of an exponential horn, based on the shape of the crater and the wavelength of the iVLP. We find that periodic injection of warm magmatic gas into the crater causes the iVLP resonance.",

A flux-force relationship diagram is figured out across different time scales of hydrological processes, based on which a MEP optimization model is developed and its optimal conditions are derived. The three empirical data-based models at varying time scales, i.e., the Budyko-type model at long-term average scale, the abcd model at monthly scale, and the SCS model at event scale, are directly derived from the optimal conditions of the MEP model. The relationships of the three model at varying time scales are discussed based on the derivations, it is concluded that the Budyko-type model and the SCS model are all special cases of the abcd model. In this way, the three models at varying time scales are unified with a common thermodynamc basis, providing a holistic image from basic statistic physics to empirical runoff generation models for catchment hydrology. These findings offer a new evidence to the governance of the MEP principle in catchment hydrology, as well as provides theoretical foundations to empirical models.",

Quantification and attribution of the uncertainties of global land surface models are important for the next phase of model improvement and development, is therefore the focus of this study. There are three sources of model uncertainties: model inputs, parameter values and model structure. Here we focus on the errors in model parameters by comparing the differences between the simulated global gross primary productivity (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) by two global land surface models and model-data products of global GPP and LE from 1982-2005. We found that the performance of simulated annual GPP or LE by both models is most sensitive to 2 to 9 model parameters screened out by Morris method for each plant functional type (PFT). Using ensemble simulations, we applied RS-HDMR method to verify the Morris sensitivity results, and implied that about 60% of the variances of model errors in some PFTs are attributed to the sensitive parameters. We selected the combination of key parameter values that minimized the monthly errors of GPP and LE for each. Our study shows that significant improvement of model predictions can be made through parameter optimization using observations.",

Complicated waveforms with multiple reflections observed in a finite-scaled medium kept us away from the full wave utilization, while wave transmission experiment is a popular technique to estimate the characteristics of a sample. In this study, we utilize a numerical simulation to evaluate the 3D boundary effect of a cylindrical sample, in particular the reflected waves from top/bottom boundaries.\nWe considered a model including a homogeneous cylindrical sample with a diameter of 50 mm and length of 100 mm which was discretized into two billion grid points. A single force was added on the vertical center of the model sample as a virtual transducer. The simulated wavefield in the sample demonstrated the development of many reflections and conversions of P and S waves at the top/bottom boundaries as well as the side boundary. In addition, Rayleigh waves propagated along sample side surface exposed much large amplitude than the body waves.\nTo focus on the reflection from the boundaries, we applied absorbing boundary conditions at the top/bottom end of the model sample for reflection inhibition. After subtracting the obtained reflection-free wavefield from the former simulation, the reflected waves at the top/bottom ends were clearly appeared. The visualized wavefield revealed many reflections and conversions of body waves at the top/bottom ends. The Rayleigh waves were developed by conversion from S wave after it reached the boundary, and multi-reflected S waves generated Rayleigh waves one after another propagating to the vertical direction. Laboratory-scale simulation is a good way to estimate the hidden wave propagation process in a sample, and would help to design proper experimental conditions, such as for sample geometry and for observation layout.",

            "abstract": "Resonance interactions of waves play a prominent role in energy share among the different wave types involved. Such interactions may significantly contribute, among others, to the evolution of the ocean energy spectrum by exchanging energy between surface-gravity waves; surface and internal gravity waves; or even surface and compression-type waves, that can transfer energy from the upper ocean through the whole water column reaching down to the seafloor.\nA resonant triad occurs among a triplet of waves, usually involving interaction of nonlinear terms of second order perturbed equations. Until recently, it has been believed that in a homogeneous fluid a resonant triad is possible only when tension forces are included, or at the limit of a shallow water, and that when the compressibility of water is considered, no resonant triads can occur within the family of gravity–acoustic waves. However, more recently it has been proved that, under some circumstances, resonant triads comprising two opposing surface-gravity waves of similar periods (though not identical) and a much longer acoustic–gravity wave, of almost double the frequency, exist [Kadri and Stiassnie 2013, J. Fluid Mech.735 R6].\nHere, I report on a new resonant triad involving a gravity wave and two acoustic waves of almost double the length. Interestingly, the two acoustic waves propagate in the same direction with similar wavelengths, that are almost double of that of the gravity wave. The evolution of the wave triad amplitudes is periodic and it is derived analytically, in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. The physical importance of this type of triad interactions is the modulation of pertinent acoustic signals, leading to inaccurate signal perceptions.\nEnclosed figure: presents an example spatio-temporal evolution of the wave triad amplitudes. The gravity wave (top) remains almost unaltered, while the envelope slowly displaces to the left. However, the prescribed acoustic envelope (middle) travels relatively fast to the right minimising the interaction time. Consequently, the resultant acoustic wave envelope (bottom) might be significantly smaller. As the two acoustic beams concurrently move away from the gravity wave, with disparate group velocities, the resonant interaction gradually vanishes.",

            "abstract": "To understand the processes involved in rheological weakening due to phase mixing, we conducted torsion experiments on samples composed of iron-rich olivine + orthopyroxene at a temperature of 1200°C and a pressure of 300 MPa using a gas-medium apparatus. The samples were deformed to total shear strains up to γ ≈ 26.\nThe stress exponent of n ≈ 3 and grain size exponent of p ≈ 1 at lower strain (1.9 ≤ γ ≤ 4.2) and n ≈ 2 and p ≈ 2.5 at larger strain (γ ≥ 26) were determined from a linear least-squares fit to the strain rate, stress, and grain size data using a power-law creep equation assuming a single power-law equation with a grain size dependence. These values of n and p indicate that our samples deformed primarily by dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding at lower strain, with an increased contribution of diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding at higher strain. Dynamic recrystallization occurred with significant grain size reduction of both phases. In samples deformed to low strain (1.9 ≤ γ ≤ 4.2), olivine and pyroxene grains are elongated sub-parallel to the shear direction. In contrast, in samples deformed to higher strains (γ ≥ 26), olivine and pyroxene are rounded and small. Orthopyroxene grains pin olivine grain boundaries and inhibit grain growth, and thereby keep deformation in a grain-size sensitive region. The microstructure and mechanical properties observed in this study are an important step toward understanding dynamical processes of strain localization and rheological weakening under upper mantle conditions",

            "abstract": "Diurnal hysteresis between soil temperature (Ts) and both CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and soil respiration rate (Rs) were reported across different field experiments. However, the causes of these hysteresis patterns remain a subject of debate, with biotic and abiotic factors both invoked as explanations. To address these issues, a CO2 gas transport model is developed by combining layer-wise mass conservation for subsurface gas-phase CO2, Fickian diffusion for gas transfer, and a CO2 source term that depends on soil temperature, moisture, and photosynthetic rate. Using this model, a hierarchy of numerical experiments were employed to disentangle the causes of the hysteretic [CO2]-Ts and CO2 flux-Ts (i.e., F -Ts) relations. Model results show that gas transport alone can introduce both [CO2]-Ts and F-Ts hysteresis, and also confirm prior findings that heat flow in soils lead to [CO2] and F(z) being out of phase with Ts, thereby providing another reason for the occurrence of both hysteresis. The area (Ahys) of the [CO2]-Ts hysteresis near the surface increases, while the Ahys of the Rs-Ts hysteresis decreases as soils become wetter. Moreover, a time-lagged carbon input from photosynthesis deformed the [CO2]-Ts and Rs-Ts patterns, causing a change in the loop direction from counterclockwise to clockwise with decreasing time lag. An asymmetric 8-shaped pattern emerged as the transition state between the two loop directions. Tracing the pattern and direction of the hysteretic [CO2]-Ts and Rs-Ts relations can provide new ways to fingerprint the effects of photosynthesis stimulation on soil microbial activity and detect the corresponding time lags.\nKey words: Hysteresis; Photosynthesis; Soil CO2 concentration; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Soil moisture",

These maps do not provide the spatial resolution needed to examine differences in drought severity across the vast Nation.

The tool and geodatabase use TRMM and GPM observed precipitation data, and Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) modeled historical precipitation data.

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) loading in aquatic ecosystems can have a multitude of effects. Increased N availability often elevates primary production, but typically also alters community composition and trophic structure. How all the myriad impacts of N loading conspire to produce whole ecosystem responses to perturbation is not well understood. To characterize how whole ecosystems response to perturbation along a gradient of N loading, we added nitrate (and phosphate) to large in situ aquatic mesocosms at different rates over the course of three months and quantified biomass distributions across multiple size classes, plankton community composition (including functional traits), and N flow among size classes in both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion prior and subsequent to a one week shading perturbation. Increased N loading resulted in greater rates of light attenuation with depth, which in turn selected for species with higher tolerance to light limitation and low inorganic C availability, but also resulted in increased rates of primary production and top-down grazing pressure. Different degrees of N loading resulted in different rates of nitrate uptake and trophic transfer, as calculated from 15N pulse-chase additions, both prior and subsequent to the shading pertubation, with the loading effect diminished after the perturbation. N loading was positively associated with the rate of N transfer between the epilimnion, where the N was added, and the hypolimnion. A complex picture of whole ecosystem response to perturbation along a gradient of N loading emerges. N loading appears to simplify resource competition among phytoplankton by alleviating N limitation to an extent, and at the same time supports elevated production across trophic levels. Nitrate uptake rate is contingent on standing stock phytoplankton biomass and resource limitation status. Rates of nitrate removal from the water column depend on how N loading alters the abiotic environment (primarily light availability), which selects for particular functional trait combiations that influence uptake rates, and on overall rates of production. Thus, intermediate levels of N loading, which more likely result in co-limitation and moderate productivity, appear to stimulate the highest rates of nitrate uptake and trophic and vertical transfers.",

The ecosystems over the TP are rather fragile. Studies show the terrestrial changes in the TP in recent decades including desertification (Dong et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2014, 2015a, 2015b; Li et al. submitted; Gao et al. submitted). Arid climate plays a vital role in the presence of desertication. Aridity, as defined by the shortage of moisture, is a climatic phenomenon that is based on average climatic conditions over a region. Numerous indices have been proposed to quantify the degree of dryness of a climate at a given location. Ratio of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P/PET) describing the degree of moisture deficiency at a given location is worldwide used.\nIn this study, P/PET was calculated to explore the aridity changes over the TP (Gao et al. 2015a). PET in 1979-2011 was calculated using the Penman-Monteith formulation based on the observed meteorological records at 83 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations in the TP. And the dominate factors on P/PET change are analyzed. The results indicate that stations located in the northwestern TP are becoming wetter and half of the stations in the eastern TP are becoming drier in recent three decades. The change patterns of precipitation, sunshine duration and diurnal temperature range have great influences on aridity change pattern especially precipitation. Precipitation is the dominant factors that affect aridity change on TP.\nHow the aridity will change in the future under the warming has drawn great attention given the importance of the TP in the water resources in the Asia. GCMs output from CMIP5 could do the projection but with spread biases. Dynamic downscaling (DDM) could somehow reduce the local biases of the GCMs (Gao et al. 2011, 2015c). P/PET projections will be calculated through the bias corrected GCMs and DDM outputs.",

            "abstract": "Major priorities for Mars science include assessing the preservation potential and impact of diagenesis on biosignature preservation in aqueous sedimentary environments. We address these priorities with field and lab studies of playa evaporites of the Verde Formation (upper Pliocene) in Arizona. Evaporites studied include bottom-nucleated halite and displacive growth gypsum in magnesite-rich mudstone. These lithotypes are potential analogs for ancient lacustrine habitable environments on Mars. This study aimed to understand organic matter preservation potential under different diagenetic histories. Methods combined outcrop-scale field observations and lab analyses, including: (1) thin-section petrography to understand diagenetic processes and paragenesis; (2) X-ray powder diffraction to obtain bulk mineralogy; (3) Raman spectroscopy to identify and place phases (and kerogenous fossil remains) within a microtextural context; (4) Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyses to estimate weight percentages of preserved organic carbon for each subfacies endmember; and (5) electron microprobe to create 2D kerogen maps semi-quantifying kerogen preservation in each subfacies. Results revealed complex diagenetic histories for each evaporite subfacies and pathways for organic matter preservation. Secondary gypsum grew displacively within primary playa lake mudstones during early diagenesis. Mudstones then experienced cementation by Mg-carbonates. Displacive-growth gypsum was sometimes dissolved, forming crystal molds. These molds were later either infilled by secondary sulfates or recrystallized to gypsum pseudomorphs with minor phases present (i.e., glauberite). These observations helped define taphonomic models for organic matter preservation in each subfacies. This work has the potential to inform in situ target identification, sampling strategies, and data interpretations for future Mars Sample Return missions (e.g., sample caching strategies for NASA’s Mars 2020 mission).",

            "abstract": "Remotely sensed data can provide information on river morphology useful for examining channel change at yearly-to-decadal time scales. Although the need to distinguish true geomorphic change from errors associated with image registration has been identified, methods such as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) used to assess and summarize these errors fail to incorporate the spatial structure of uncertainty. Here we assess whether observations of lateral channel migration along a meandering channel are significant given the spatial distribution of registration error. An iterative cross-validation approach was used to produce a local measure of error for images in a time series from Savery Creek, Wyoming, USA, and various transformation methods, interpolation methods, and ground control point (GCP) placement were evaluated. Interpolated error surfaces were then used to produce error ellipses that represent spatially variable buffers for the threshold of detectable change. Our results suggest that spatially distributed estimates of registration error allow for detection of more subtle channel changes than using the RMSE or 90th percentile of error in areas where registration is more accurate. Conversely, spatially distributed error prevents changes from mistakenly being regarded as true in areas of greater registration error. Results also support previous findings that second-order polynomial functions on average yield the lowest RMSE and that placing GCPs on the floodplain rather than on hillslopes reduces error. This study highlights the importance of characterizing the spatial distribution of image registration errors in the analysis of channel change.",

            "abstract": "Research in porous media is often hampered by the difficulty in making pore-scale observations. By selecting porous media that is refractive index matched (RIM) to the pore fluid, the media becomes transparent. This allows optical imaging techniques such as static light scattering (SLS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), confocal microscopy, and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to be employed. RIM is particularly useful for research concerning contaminant remediation in the subsurface, permitting visual observation of plume dynamics at the pore scale. The goal of this research is to explore and assess candidate combinations of porous media, fluid, and fluorescent dye. The strengths and weaknesses of each combination will then be evaluated in terms of safety, cost, and optical quality in order to select the best combination for use with PLIF. Within this framework, top-ranked RIM combinations include Pyrex glass beads, water beads, or granular Nafion saturated in vegetable glycerin, deionized water, and an aqueous solution of 48% isopropanol, respectively. This research lays the groundwork for future efforts to build a flow chamber in which the selected RIM porous media, solution, and dye will be used in evaluating subsurface pumping strategies designed to impose chaotic plume spreading in porous media. Though the RIM porous media explored in this research are selected based on the specifications of a particular experiment, the methods developed for working with and evaluating RIM porous media should be of utility to a wide variety of research interests.",

            "abstract": "Mitigating agricultural diffuse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is a complicated task due to tempo-spatial lags between the field practices and the watershed responses. Spatially-distributed modeling is essential to the implementation of cost-effective and best management practices (BMPs) to optimize land uses and nutrient applications as well as to project the impact of climate change on the watershed service functions.\nCNMM (the Catchment Nutrients Management Model) is a 3D spatially-distributed, grid-based and process-oriented biophysical model comprehensively developed to simulate energy balance, hydrology, plant/crop growth, biogeochemistry of life elements (e.g., C, N and P), waste treatment, waterway vegetation/purification, stream water quality and land management in agricultural watersheds as affected by land utilization strategies such as BMPs and by climate change. The CNMM is driven by a number of spatially-distributed data such as weather, topography (including DEM and shading), stream network, stream water, soil, vegetation and land management (including waste treatments), and runs at an hourly time step. It represents a catchment as a matrix of square uniformly-sized cells, where each cell is defined as a homogeneous hydrological response unit with all the hydrologically-significant parameters the same but varied at soil depths in fine intervals. Therefore, spatial variability is represented by allowing parameters to vary horizontally and vertically in space. A four-direction flux routing algorithm is applied to route water and nutrients across soils of cells governed by the gradients of either water head or elevation. A linear channel reservoir scheme is deployed to route water and nutrients in stream networks. The model is capable of computing CO2, CH4, NH3, NO, N2O and N2 emissions from soils and stream waters.\nThe CNMM can serve as an idea modelling tool to investigate the overwhelming critical zone research at various catchment scales.",

Here we analyze the upper-ocean response to TCs using a high resolution Earth system model, in which a 0.5° atmosphere is coupled to an ocean with two different horizontal resolutions: 1° and 0.1°. We use these runs to examine the potential sensitivity of the TC-induced model responses to ocean grid resolution, and we explore key climate connections including TC-induced cool wakes and recovery, latent heat budgets, and basin-scale ocean heat convergence. We find that sea surface cooling and basin-scale aggregated ocean heat convergence are relatively insensitive to the horizontal ocean grid resolutions considered here, but we find key differences in the post-storm restratification processes related to mesoscale oceanic eddies. We estimate the annual basin-scale TC-induced latent heat fluxes for both model simulations to be roughly 45% of the total TC-induced ocean heat loss from the upper ocean. Results suggest that coupled modeling approaches capable of capturing ocean-atmosphere feedbacks are important for developing a complete understanding of the relationship between TCs and climate.",

            "abstract": "Projection-based techniques, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), are a common approach to surrogate high-fidelity process-based models by lower order dynamic emulators. With POD, the dimensionality reduction is achieved by using observations, or ‘snapshots’ – generated with the high-fidelity model –, to project the entire set of input and state variables of this model onto a smaller set of basis functions that account for most of the variability in the data. While reduction efficiency and variance control of POD techniques are usually very high, the resulting emulators are structurally highly complex and can hardly be given a physically meaningful interpretation as each basis is a projection of the entire set of inputs and states. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) that combines the several assets of POD methods with the potential for ex-post interpretation of the emulator structure. SPCA reduces the number of non-zero coefficients in the basis functions by identifying a sparse matrix of coefficients. While the resulting set of basis functions may retain less variance of the snapshots, the presence of a few non-zero coefficients assists in the interpretation of the underlying physical processes. The SPCA approach is tested on the reduction of a 1D hydro-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) used to describe the main ecological and hydrodynamic processes in Tono Dam, Japan. An experimental comparison against a standard POD approach shows that SPCA achieves the same accuracy in emulating a given output variable – for the same level of dimensionality reduction – while yielding better insights of the main process dynamics.",

For the earth gravity filed related researches, it is irreplaceable by technologies like GNSS、VLBI、SLR, etc. However, classical astrometric instruments have some major drawback, such as low efficiency, low automation, more operating observers, and individual error in some visual instruments. In 2011, The National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) successfully developed the new digital zenith telescope prototype (DZT-1), which has the ability of highly automatic observation and data processing, even allowing unattended observation by remote control. By utilizing CCD camera as imaging terminal and high-accuracy tiltmeter to replace mercurial plate, observation efficiency of DZT is improved greatly. According to the results of data obtained from test observations, single-observation accuracy of DZT-1 is 0.15-0.3″ and one night observation accuracy up to 0.07-0.08″, which is better than the observation accuracy of classical astrometric instruments.\nThe observations of DZT can be used to obtain the plumb line variations and the vertical deflections, which can be used for carrying out seismic, geodetic and other related geo-scientific researches. Especially the collocated observations with gravimeters and the conjoint analysis of the observation data will be helpful to recognize the anomalous motion and variation of underground mass over time, and maybe provide significant information for estimating the scale of underground anomalous mass. The information is valuable for determining the three key factors of earthquake possibly.\nMoreover, the project team is carrying out the development of new DZT with better performance and studying the key techniques for new instrument to make DZT play a more significant role in the astronomy and geoscience fields.",

The current waveforms are different depending on instruments. Rectangle is the most widely used excitation current source especially in ground TEM. Triangle and half sine are commonly used in airborne and semi-airborne TEM investigation. In most instruments, only the off time responses are acquired and used in later analysis and data inversion. Very few airborne instruments acquire the on time and off time responses together. Although these systems acquire the on time data, they usually do not use them in the interpretation.\nThis abstract shows a novel full waveform time domain electromagnetic method and our recent modeling results. The benefits comes from our new algorithm in modeling full waveform time domain electromagnetic problems. We introduced the current density into the Maxwell’s equation as the transmitting source. This approach allows arbitrary waveforms, such as triangle, half-sine, trapezoidal waves or scatter record from equipment, being used in modeling. Here, we simulate the establishing and induced diffusion process of the electromagnetic field in the earth. The traditional time domain electromagnetic with pure secondary fields can also be extracted from our modeling results. The real time responses excited by a loop source can be calculated using the algorithm. We analyze the full time gates responses of homogeneous half space and two layered models with half sine current waveform as examples. We find the on time responses are quite sensitive to resistivity or depth changes. The results show the potential use of full waveform responses in time domain electromagnetic surveys.",

            "abstract": "Northern Peru will face critical water resource issues in the near future as permanent ice retreats. Much of current global and regional climate research neglects the meteorological forcing of lapse rates and valley wind dynamics on critical components of the Peruvian Andes’ water-cycle. In 2004 and 2005 we installed an autonomous sensor network (ASN) within the glacierized Llanganuco Valley, Cordillera Blanca (9°S), consisting of discrete, cost-effective, automatic temperature loggers located along the valley axis and anchored by two automatic weather stations. Comparisons of these embedded atmospheric measurements from the ASN and climate modeling (CM) by dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model elucidate distinct diurnal and seasonal characteristics of the mountain valley winds and lapse rates. Wind, temperature, humidity, and cloud simulations by WRF suggest that thermally driven valley winds converging with easterly flow aloft enhance late afternoon and evening cloud development which helps explain detected nocturnal precipitation maxima measured by the ASN. We attribute sustained evapotranspiration (ET), as estimated by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model, to an abundance of glacial melt-water during the dry season and strong pre-noon solar heating during the wet season. Furthermore, the extreme diurnal variability of along-valley-axis lapse rates and valley wind detected from ground observations and confirmed by dynamical downscaling demonstrate the importance of realistic scale parameterizations of the boundary layer to improve regional CM projections in mountainous regions. Our findings portray ET as an integral yet poorly represented process in Andean hydroclimatology. We show that coupling ASN and CM can improve understanding of multi-scale atmospheric and associated hydrological processes in mountain valleys.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between wildfire activity and soil moisture in the United States has been difficult to assess, with limited ability to determine areas that are at high risk. This limitation is largely due to complex environmental factors at play, especially as they relate to alternating periods of wet and dry conditions, and the lack of remotely-sensed products. Recent drought conditions and accompanying low Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) have led to disastrous wildfire outbreaks causing economic loss, property damage, and environmental degradation. Thus, developing a programmed toolset to assess the relationship between soil moisture, which contributes greatly to FMC and fire severity, can establish the framework for determining overall wildfire risk. To properly evaluate these parameters, we used data assimilated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and data from the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD) to determine the extent soil moisture affects fire activity. Through these datasets, we produced correlation and regression maps at a coarse resolution of 0.25 degrees for the contiguous United States. These fire-risk products and toolsets proved the viability of this methodology, allowing for the future incorporation of more GRACE-derived water parameters, MODIS vegetation indices, and other environmental datasets to refine the model for fire risk. Additionally, they will allow assessment to national-scale early fire management and provide responders with a predictive tool to better employ early decision-support to areas of high risk during regions’ respective fire season(s).",

In contrast, many rock mechanics experiments are conducted on experimental faults made of rough, solid blocks without fault-rock zones. We experimentally compare the frictional strength of solid experimental faults with fault-zones made of granular material in high-velocity/long-distance runs.\nThe frictional evolution of solid and granular dolomite fault was tested in a rotary apparatus at slip velocity up to 1 m/s and normal stress up to 7 MPa. The granular samples were composed of the 125-250 microns fraction of the crushed dolomite. They were sheared in a confined, rotary cell with continuous monitoring of CO2 and H2O and mechanical data. The tests showed that the granular samples required longer slip-distances and higher velocities to evolve to a frictional strength similar to the solid samples. Yet, both sample types display similar evolution trends, including slip-weakening at velocities above ~0.05 m/s, and drastic velocity-weakening as slip velocity approached 1 m/s. At velocity above 0.3 m/s, a shining principal-slip-zone developed spontaneously with identical microstructure in both solid and granular sample: thickness < 1 micron and sintered, 20-40 nm nano-grains. This development was associated with intense emission of CO2 (Fig. 1). In a similar testing approach and conditions, we tested the friction evolution of granular granite from the San-Andreas fault-zone at Tejon-Pass, CA. These samples remained strong, μ =0.8-0.9, at velocities up to 0.8 m/s and slip–distances up to 3 m, in contrast to known frictional evolution of solid faults made of granite and tonalite. We envision that at the present slip-velocity/normal-stress, the dolomite samples reached a stage of thermally activated phase-transition and associated weakening, whereas the granitic samples were below such transition.\nFig. 1.

            "abstract": "One of the principal redox exchange reactions at the slab-mantle interface during subduction is CaCO3–Fe0 interaction. Using uniaxial press multianvil apparatus, we investigate this reaction at temperatures from 650 to 1400 °C, and pressures from 4 to 16 GPa. These conditions are representative for the PT path of the slab from the surface to the mantle transition zone. Based on our results, redox reaction can be written as: 3 CaCO3 (aragonite) + 13 Fe0 (metal) = Fe7C3 (carbide) + 3 CaFe2O3 (Ca-wüstite). It is a diffusion-controlled process with the reaction rate constant (k) being log-linear in 1/T.\nThe experimental results allow to calculate the length scale over which the reaction kinetics between aragonite and metallic iron is likely effective. Using relatively simple relationship between the characteristic distance of diffusion as a function of k and duration of the process, we estimate the length scale of the reaction for time scales 4-16 Myr, which corresponds to subduction rates of 2-8 cm/year from 250 km (metal-saturation boundary) to 470 km, for different slab PT-profiles. Assuming that carbonates are in a direct contact with iron, the maximum degree of carbonate reduction can be evaluated using the results of our study and the data on CO2 distribution in altered oceanic basalts. The estimates suggest that up to 0.5, 12, and 20 vol. % of carbonates can be reduced in such case during subduction down to the mantle transition zone at the conditions of cold, medium and hot geotherms, respectively. The sluggish kinetics of established CaCO3–Fe0 interaction suggests that even over the entire history of the Earth, carbonates could survive during subduction from metal saturation boundary near 250 km depth, down to the transition zone, and presumably to the lower mantle.",

This flooding event and the uncharacteristic weather in spring 2015 prompted a study by the NASA DEVELOP team to address community concerns regarding water quality. DEVELOP worked with Denver Water, the city’s primary water supplier, to determine erosion mitigation sites in the Ralston Creek Watershed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). This model combines rainfall, slope, land cover, and conservation practices to predict soil loss. This research integrated land cover maps derived from NASA’s Landsat 8 with a high resolution airborne LiDAR digital elevation model, which provided Denver Water with a fine scale map detailing potential mitigation sites. Mitigation sites were determined based on RUSLE outputs and accessibility.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake had caused great human and financial loss, and it had induced two major earthquake surface rupture zones, including the Yingxiu-Beichuan earthquake fault (Y-B F.) and Guanxian-Anxian earthquake fault (G-A F.) earthquake surface rupture zones. After main shock, the Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project (WFSD) was co-organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Land and Resources and China Bureau of Seismology, and this project focused on earthquake fault mechanics, earthquake slip process, fault physical and chemical characteristics, mechanical behavior, fluid behavior, fracture energy, and so on. Fault-rocks magnetism is an effective method for the earthquake fault research, such as earthquake slip dynamics. In this study, the fault-rocks from the drilling-hole cores and close to the Wenchuan Earthquake surface rupture zone were used to do the rock-magnetism and discuss the earthquake slip dynamics. The measurement results of magnetic susceptibility (MS) show that the relative high or low MS values are corresponded to the fault-rocks from the Y-B F. and G-A F., respectively. Other rock-magnetism gives more evidence to the magnetic mineral assemblage of fault-rocks from the two earthquake fault zones. The relative high MS in the drilling-holes and trench along the Y-B F. was caused by the new-formed ferrimagnetic minerals during the high temperature and rapid speed earthquake slip process, such as magnetite and hematite, so the Y-B F. had experienced high temperature and rapid speed thermal pressurization earthquake slip mechanism. The relative low MS in the trench along the G-A F. was possible caused by high content of Fe-sulfides, and the G-A F. had possibly experienced the low temperature and slow speed mechanical lubrication earthquake slip mechanism. The different earthquake slip mechanism was possibly controlled by the deep structure of the two earthquake faults, such as the fault occurrence. The steep dip character of the Y-B F. could be easy to induce high temperature and rapid speed earthquake slip mechanism, while the low dip angle feature of the G-A F. could be easy to induce low temperature and slow speed earthquake slip mechanism.",

JPSS satellites carry sensors which collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological, and solar-geophysical observations of the earth, atmosphere, and space. The first JPSS satellite was launched in 2011 and is currently NOAA’s primary operational polar satellite. The JPSS ground system is the Common Ground System (CGS), and provides command, control, and communications (C3) and data processing (DP). A multi-mission system, CGS provides combinations of C3/DP for numerous NASA, NOAA, DoD, and international missions. In preparation for the next JPSS satellite, CGS improved its multi-mission capabilities to enhance mission operations for larger constellations of earth observing satellites with the added benefit of streamlining mission operations for other NOAA missions.\nCGS’s multi-mission capabilities allows management all of assets as a single enterprise, more efficiently using ground resources and personnel and consolidating multiple ground systems into one. Sophisticated scheduling algorithms compare mission priorities and constraints across all ground stations, creating an enterprise schedule optimized to mission needs, which CGS executes to acquire the satellite link, uplink commands, downlink and route data to the operations and data processing facilities, and generate the final products for delivery to downstream users.\nThis paper will illustrate the CGS’s ability to manage multiple, enterprise-wide polar orbiting missions by demonstrating resource modeling and tasking, production of enterprise contact schedules for NOAA’s Fairbanks ground station (using both standing and ad hoc requests), deconflicting resources due to ground outages, and updating resource allocations through dynamic priority definitions.",

            "abstract": "This project partnered with the National Park Service (NPS) to help analyze the correlation between mesquite trees and the salinity of the Laguna Madre of Padre Island National Seashore. The lagoon is a hypersaline estuary; however, there is historical evidence that this was not always the case. It is hypothesized that the increase in the number of honey mesquite trees (Prosopis grandulosa var. glandulosa) in the area has contributed to the Laguna Madre’s increased salinity by decreasing the groundwater inflow to the lagoon. These mesquite trees have long taproots capable of extracting significant amounts of groundwater. This project utilized Earth observation data in ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software to create map time series and analyze the data. Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data were used to create land use/land cover (LULC) maps in order to analyze the change in the occurrence of mesquite trees over time. Thermal maps of the lagoon were generated using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data to understand changes in groundwater inflow. In addition, TRMM and GRACE derived changes in root zone soil moisture content data were compared over the study period. By investigating the suspected positive correlation between the mesquite trees and the salinity of the Laguna Madre, the NPS can improve future land management practices.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, several advances have been made in incorporating anthropogenic impacts such as reservoir operation in global hydrological models. However, detailed examination of their performance in regional or large river basins is still lacking. The Chao Phraya River Basin in Thailand is a good site for a case study because of the availability of detailed and long-term hydrological records which include the operation of two huge reservoirs, the Bhumibol and Sirikit Reservoirs, in the basin.\nThe ensemble means of the simulation results using eight bias-corrected CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs), selected based on the availability of the atmospheric forcing inputs needed in a water balance model with human activities, the H08 model, under two representative concentration path scenarios (RCP), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, for the near future from 2041 to 2059 were compared with the base period simulation from 1981 to 1999.\nThe estimates projected an increase in runoff of 10-15% in RCP4.5 and 40-50% in RCP8.5. While the change in dry season ranges from -10mm to 10mm, the wet season runoff could increase by as much as 160mm in RCP8.5. Hence, the frequency of reservoir emptying will decrease while spilling will increase by as much as 5 times of that of the base period in RCP8.5. In RCP4.5, the frequency of reservoir emptying will not significantly change while spilling will most likely double. Consequently, flooding in the basin will be more frequent and more severe. It was found that the mean inundated area downstream of the two reservoirs, simulated by CaMa-Flood, will increase by approximately 30% in RCP4.5 and about 130% in RCP8.5. At flood inundation depth greater than 1.00m, flooded area will increase by about 95% and 460% in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Possible reservoir operation rules adapting to these changes are examined to minimize flooded area and inundation depth in the downstream area, and to avoid full water levels of the reservoirs. It is demonstrated how the use of an advanced river routing with a hydrological model that includes anthropogenic effects can be useful in elucidating the changes in water management which might be necessary in order to adapt to the changing climate.",

Dominant modes of the EASM are revealed from the variability of large-scale air masses discerned by equivalent potential temperature, and are found to be dynamically connected with the anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the three major oceans of the world and their counterparts of prevailing atmospheric oscillation or teleconnection patterns. Precipitation over Northeast Asia (NEA) during July is enhanced by the tropical central Indian Ocean warming and central Pacific El Niño-related SST warming, the northwestern Pacific cooling off the coast of NEA, and the North Atlantic Ocean warming. Using these factors and data from the preceding spring seasons, the authors build a multiple linear regression model for seasonal forecasting. The cross-validated correlation skill predicted for the period 1994 to 2012 is up to 0.84, which far exceeds the skill level of contemporary climate models.",

Data for individual countries are poorly tracked, but hotspots for devastating landslides occur throughout Rwanda and Uganda due to the local topography and soil type, intense rainfall events, and deforestation. In spite of this, there has been little research in this region that utilizes satellite imagery to estimate areas susceptible to landslides. This project utilized Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and Google Earth to identify landslides that occurred within the study area. These landslides were then added to SERVIR’s Global Landslide Catalog (GLC). Next, Landsat 8 OLI, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Version 2 (SRTM V2) data were used to create a Landslide Susceptibility Map. This was combined with population data from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) to create a Landslide Hazard map. A preliminary assessment of the relative performance of GPM and TRMM in identifying landslide conditions was also performed. The additions to the GLC, the Landslide Susceptibility Map, the Landslide Hazard Map, and the preliminary assessment of satellite rainfall performance will be used by SERVIR and the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) for disaster risk management, land use planning, and determining landslide conditions and moisture thresholds.",

A regional air quality model is applied to simulate the physical and chemical processes of various pollutants in the atmosphere. The resultant health outcome, such as premature death, is estimated by using the concentration-response functions reported in the literature.\nWe anticipate that our results would serve as a critical reference for research community and policy makers to mitigate the air quality and health impacts of emissions in China.",

Using multiple lines of evidence, we test the sensitivity and resilience of Lake Colac to independently reconstructed drought history. The sedimentary archive shows that Lake Colac appears to be sensitive to periods of drought. Following drought conditions c. CE 1390, the lake ecosystem indicates signs of recovery. A succession of droughts in the early 1500s initiates a change in the diatom flora, with freshwater species declining and replaced by saline tolerant species, though there is little interpretable change in aquatic palynomorphs. An inferred drought, around CE 1720 appears to precede a major switch in the lake’s ecosystem. The lake became increasingly turbid and saline and there is a distinct switch from a macrophyte-dominated system to an algal-dominated system. The arrival of Europeans in Victoria (CE1840) appears to have little effect on the lake’s ecosystem, but the terrestrial vegetation indicates regionally established changes including declines in native trees, especially Casuarina, and arrival and expansion of exotic shade or plantation trees Pinus and Cupressus as well as native and introduced weeds. As European impact in the catchment increases, nutrients appear to play a role in the modification of the lake’s ecosystem. A long-term drying trend from c. CE 1975 is evident, culminating in the Millennium Drought, which suggests unprecedented conditions in the ecological history of the Lake.",

The results highlight the major role of mass convergence driven by low-frequency (with periods .1 week) atmospheric disturbances during both the development and decay stage of a block. Specifically, low-frequency eddies are responsible for the accelerated mass buildup 4 days prior to the peak intensity of a block, and they also account for the rapid mass loss afterward. High-frequency, subweekly scale disturbances have statistically significant positive contributions to the mass loss during the decay stage, and also show weak negative contributions to the development of the blocking high prior to the peak of the high. The majority of the mass convergence (divergence) responsible for the intensification (decay) of the blocking high occurs in the middle-to-lower troposphere and is largely attributed to mass flux driven by low-frequency meridional (zonal) winds. Also discussed are the implications of this new mass perspective of atmospheric blocks for understanding dynamics of blocking highs and for model bias detection and attribution.",

By applying a cluster analysis to daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, present study found that the AO pattern can be resolved into two families with five family members and each member has a timescale of one week or so. One family takes a form of mixed NAO and Pacific center, and another takes a form of double-wavetrain which has a projection of PNA over Pacific-North America and of NAO over North Atlantic. Different family members have different influence on northern Hemisphere surface temperature, which should be taken into consideration when one makes weather prediction based on AO. Due to the projection of family members on PNA and NAO, AO shows somehow correlation with PNA or NAO. It is also shown that one of the members is strongly modulated by the El Nino-Southern oscillation (ENSO) and shows an upward (downward) trend in its frequency of occurrence between 1958-2005.",

            "abstract": "It is generally believed that current global warming is due to the persistent rise of atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2. The consensus is based mostly on the observational data of past decades and the polar ice core records. To understand the relationship between climate change and atmospheric CO2, their behaviors over a longer interval at different time scales need to be appreciated. Here, we collect and analyze past 500 Ma records of atmospheric CO2 and temperature in six time periods, namely Phanerozoic, Cenozoic, middle Pleistocene, last deglaciation, past millennium, and recent decades. According to the carriers and time spans, we divide these records into three categories: 1.The millionaire and longer records from model calculation and paleosols/paleobotany proxies. Although the trends of both variables are generally consistent on this time scale, it is difficult to establish a clear causal relationship because of great uncertainties and low resolutions of both sets of data. 2.The orbital scale mainly from the polar ice core. High precise CO2 and temperature reconstructions allow for an examination of the possible role of atmospheric CO2 in the glacial-interglacial transformation. 3.The records at centennial and shorter time scales over the past millennium from ice, snow, and instrumental data. The past millennium records are most abundant and accurate, especially CO2 has been measured directly in recent decades. However, due to the difficulties in distinguishing the effect of CO2 from other factors, there are great uncertainties in the interpretation of climate change versus CO2. Overall, we come to the following conclusions:1.Paleoclimatic reconstructions show that both temperature and atmospheric CO2 have generally decreased over the past 500 Ma. However, there are no consistent sequential orders in the changes between these two variables. 2.The Earth’s atmospheric CO2 has a drastic oscillation history. There were many high CO2 periods when the values were higher than 5000 ppm, and there are several low CO2 periods when the values dropped to less than 100 ppm. 3.According to global observational data, atmospheric CO2 has recently exceeded 400 ppm. Although there is no conclusive evidence that shows this value has a special significance, it is the highest since the last 800 ka, and rare over the Quaternary.",

The Luzon volcanic arc converged toward Taiwan Island and formed Hengchun Ridge south offshore Taiwan. Thus, Taiwan mountain belt developed from north to south as the Backbone Range, so that we can infer the incipient feature structure from the topography and outcrop study of southern Taiwan.\nOur field survey of this study concentrated at the southeast coastline of Taiwan, also known as A-Lan-Yi Trail. According to previous study, the deformational structures such as faults and folds are consistent with regional kinematic processes, and the preserved transpression structure is the most important evidence of incipient collision. In this study, we use the sedimentary sequences of study area to trace the regional tectonics from north to south. Discovered structures in this area show the similar kinematic history as the eastern flank of Backbone Range, so that we suggest they are at the same series of a tectonic event.\nTo complete the regional structure mapping in this accessible area, besides the field geological data, we also applied the LiDAR-derived DTM which is a 3D visualization technology to improve our topography information. In addition, we use the sandbox modeling to demonstrate the development of structures in the eastern flank of Backbone Range. After combining the results of field observation and regional structure mapping, this study provides a strong evidence of backthrusting and backfolding deformation during the incipient oblique collision stage.",

            "abstract": "1. Introduction\nI investigate the depth of the seismogenic layer in order to estimate the lower limit of the seismogenic fault plane since this depth is related to the size of the earthquake caused by the active fault. I have indexes D10 and D90 as the upper and lower limits of the seismogenic layer defined as the depth above which 10 % and 90 % of the whole crustal earthquakes occurred from the surface, respectively. The difference between the D10 and D90 is the thickness of the seismogenic layer.\n2. Data and method\nThe NIED Hi-net has a catalog of hypocenters determined with one-dimensional　velocity (1D) structure (Ukawa et al., 1984) and I estimated the D10 and D90 with this catalog at first. I construct the system to relocate the hypocenters from 2001 to 2013 with magnitude greater than 1.5 on the Japan Sea side shallower than 50 km depth with the three-dimensional velocity (3D) structure (Matsubara and Obara, 2011) obtained by seismic tomography. I estimate the D10 and D90 from the hypocenter catalog with 3D structure.\n3. Result\nMany earthquakes shallower than 5 km with 1D structure are relocated to deeper with 3D structure and the earthquakes deeper than 15 km are relocated to about 5 km shallower. With 3D structure D10 deepens and D90 shallows from 1D structure. D90 beneath the northern Honshu is deeper than the other area and D90 beneath the Japan Sea is much deeper than the inland area. The thickness of the seismogenic layer beneath the Japan Sea is also thick from 8-16 km. D90 on the Japan Sea side of the southwestern Japan on the west side of the Itoigawa Shizuoka Tectonic Line is very shallow as 11-16 km and the thickness of the seismogenic layer is also thin as 2-7 km.\n4. Discussion\nOmuralieva et al. (2012) relocated the JMA unified hypocenters with 3D structure and estimated shallower D90 than that from the JMA catalog. Very deep D90 beneath the northern Hokkaido and northern Honshu is consistent with our result.\n5. Conclusion\nUsing 3D velocity structure D10 deepens, D90 shallows, and the thickness of the seismogenic layer becomes thinner. The thickness of the seismogenic layer is thick beneath the northern Honshu, however, that is very thin beneath southwestern Japan on the Japan Sea side.",

The fault is spectacularly exposed where it juxtaposes ultramafic parts of the ophiolite belt (e.g. peridotite, serpentinite) against quartzofeldspathic rocks of the continental Caples Terrane. In such areas, the fault consists of a 50-400 m-wide foliated serpentinite shear zone entraining competent pods of massive serpentinite, Caples Terrane rocks and various volcanic rocks. The Livingstone Fault provides an excellent example of deformation styles (e.g. distributed vs. localized) and chemical reactions where peridotite, serpentinite and quartzofeldspathic rocks are juxtaposed, a common situation in many plate tectonic settings (e.g. portions of the San Andreas Fault, central and southern sectors of the Alpine Fault). We will present some initial results of fieldwork carried out in the Olivine Wilderness Area (NE of Milford Sound) focusing on: 1) the transition from intact peridotite to partly serpentinized peridotite to a fully serpentinized shear zone, 2) the distribution of strain within the serpentinite shear zone, 3) the significance of highly localized slip within entrained pods of peridotite and serpentinite, and 4) the nature and possible mechanical effects of talc-forming metasomatic reactions between serpentinite and quartzofeldspathic rocks.",

The KISOS consists of an acoustic positioning system (USBL), altimeter, still camera, video camera, water sampler, measuring devices (dissolved methane, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, and currents) mounted on the unmanned ROV, and a seafloor sediment collecting device.\nThe ultimate goals of the seafloor monitoring are to assess environmental risks (gas leakage and production water/drilling discharge, and so on) which may occur during and after the gas hydrate test production drilling. The KISOS was applied to solely conduct baseline studies during the last three years. We will conduct the KIGAM seafloor monitoring system (KIMOS) of the Korean gas hydrate program in the future. The large scale of environmental monitoring program includes the environmental impact assessments such as seafloor disturbance and subsidence, detection of methane gas leakage around well and cold seep, methane bubbles and dissolved methane, change of marine environments, chemical factor variation of water column and seabed, diffusion of drilling mud and production water, and biological factors of biodiversity and marine habitats before and after production drilling test well and nearby areas.\nTopics that will cover include:1) configuration of KISOS and general layout/operational design of KIMOS, 2) numerical simulation of gas and materials transport using SIMAP/CHEMMAP + MUDMAP softwares, 3) sensitivity analysis such as gas leakage modeling, operational produced water discharge, and 4) modeling of drilling discharge with cuttings and mud.\nKey words: gas hydrate, environmental monitoring, KISOS, KIMOS, Ulleung Basin",

Elemental maps of Fe, Si, Ti, Al, Cr etc. were used to highlight texture and mineral distribution.\nThe Ajali sands are locally topped by iron rich hardpans. These hardpans consist of rock fragments up to several cm in length in a primary matrix and locally large pores. Besides laminated sandstone fragments, highly altered porphyritic volcanic rocks can be observed. The latter in the SEM appear highly spongeous, and show relics of phenochryts such as biotite, hornblende and pyroxene, corroded magmatic quartz, magnetite, Ilmenite, zircon or voids of former crystals in an almost entirely altered matrix\nLarge pores show several generations of periodic infill of quartz sand / soil mixtures alternating with multiple layers of Fe rich precipitates, locally enriched in Al, P, S, Mn or Sr agglutinating the fines. Volcanic fragments show rims of elevated Cr content, and Cr and V-rich precipitates may separate generations of infill. A number of large open pore channels rimmed by Fe-rich matrix might act as water channels. They are coated by Al, K rich precipitates.\nAjali sands can hardly be considered as the source for the agglutination of the hardpan cap. The source of Fe and other elements such as Al, K, Cr, V has to be attributed to the volcanic fragments, mainly to the matrix, but to the altered phenocrysts, too. Toxic elements such as Cr being mobile in the system are in part stabilized as precipitates. EDXRF-micro mapping provides excellent textural, chemical and even mineralogical information to get better insight into the sedimentation and agglutination history of the hardpan cap.\nKey words: Hardpan Cap, Ajali Sands, Anambra Basin, Agglutination, Volcanic Fragment.",

The QPM condition is produced to use periodically poled ferroelectric crystals. An optical parametric oscillator (OPO), amplifier (OPA), and generator (OPG) devices are widely recognized as versatile coherent tunable spectroscopic sources. Many applications of PPLN-parametric radiation sources, such as laser remote sensing and molecular spectroscopy, require broadly tunable and narrow linewidth operation in the infrared region. We developed an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) transmitter for the first 1.6 μm CO2 DIAL. In order to improve the measurement accuracy of CO2 profiles, development of high power and wavelength stabilized laser system has been conducted. We have developed a new high-power 1.6 μm laser transmitter based on a parametric master oscillator-power amplifier (MOPA) system pumped by a LD-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG laser which has the injection seed laser locked to the iodine absorption line. The master oscillator is the OPG transmitter and the amplifier is the OPA transmitter. Since the OPO transmitter has a cavity mirror, running the system without mode hopping requires complex control of cavity length. By contrast, the OPG transmitter has no cavity mirror, so there is no need to control cavity length. We report detail characteristics of the direct detection 1.6 μm CO2 DIAL with the OPG transmitter. Moreover, we report the technique of the simultaneously measurement temperature profiles with the CO2 concentration profiles using a CO2 absorption profile because of improvement of measurement accuracy of the CO2 concentration.\nThis work was financially supported by the System Development Program for Advanced Measurement and Analysis of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic plates are underlain by a low viscosity layer of the mantle, the asthenosphere, which flows. Flow in the asthenosphere may be induced by motion of the overriding plate, or by deeper mantle convection. Measurement of seismic anisotropy, the directional dependence of seismic wave speed, is an important tool in understanding mantle structure and dynamics, and is often used to infer information about asthenospheric flow geometry. However, isolation of asthenospheric signals is challenging because most seismometers are located on the continents, whose complex structure influences seismic waves en-route to the surface. Thus the challenge is to record seismic data on oceanic lithosphere, which is much thinner and simpler. We present stacked shear wave splitting results from phases 1 to 3 of the Cascadia Initiative: An ambitious, large-scale deployment of offshore seismometers across the Gorda and Juan-de-Fuca plates. Fast splitting directions (FSD) can approximate mantle flow geometry, thus for the first time allowing an interpretation of flow beneath an ocean basin from ridge to trench. The Juan-de-Fuca plate appears able to influence mantle flow: FSD rotate towards the absolute plate motion direction (APM) with increasing distance from the ridge. In contrast, Gorda FSD align with the motion of the adjacent Pacific plate rather than Gorda APM. These observations suggest that drag caused by motion the Pacific plate controls asthenospheric flow beneath Gorda, and thus that the Gorda plate may be decoupled from the asthenosphere. We also construct a simple geodynamic model of this situation, which supports its plausibility. Our findings imply that tectonic plates must reach a minimum size and speed before they are able to exert influence on asthenospheric flow.",

            "abstract": "Under ideal circumstances, generating electricity from natural gas releases approximately half the carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions of coal. However, because the primary component of natural gas (i.e., methane) is a potent greenhouse gas, accounting for leakage is crucial when considering natural gas as a bridge fuel. This presentation answers the question: How much leakage renders the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of natural gas equivalent to coal? To answer this question, we present a simple model that assumes the GHG footprint for each fuel is the sum of emissions from (1) electricity generation and (2) natural gas leakage. Emissions resulting from electricity generation are taken from published life-cycle assessments (LCAs). Emissions from natural gas leakage are estimated assuming that natural gas is 80% methane, which is converted to carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) global warming potential (GWP). One complication in using the GWP is its dependence on time horizon, where shorter time horizons penalize methane emissions more, and longer time horizons less. Specifically, the IPCC considers time horizons of 20, 100 and 500 years for comparison between the differing greenhouse gases. To explicitly account for the effect of time horizon, the results presented here are shown on a straightforward plot of GHG footprint versus time horizon for natural gas leakage rates of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8%. This plot shows that natural gas leakage of 2.0% or 4.8% eliminates half of natural gas’s GHG footprint advantage over coal at 20- or 100-year time horizons, respectively. Leakage of 3.9% or 9.1% completely eliminates the GHG footprint advantage over coal at 20- and 100-year time horizons, respectively. Results indicate that leakage control is essential for the electricity generated from the combustion of natural gas to create a smaller GHG footprint than the electricity generated from the combustion of coal.",

            "abstract": "The collision and suturing of Indian plate about 50Ma ago resulted in closure of Tethyan ocean basin, commencement of Himalayan orogen and subsequent formation of foreland basin towards south. This last phase of marine sedimentation in India during Paleocene-Eocene is represented by deposition of Subathu Formation which is overlain by continental Dagshai sediments. The contact between Subathu and Dagshai remains controversial and is described as ‘passage beds’. Further, it is poorly understood both in terms of depositional environment and age. Surprisingly, these passage beds show evidences of pedogenesis but no such palaeopedological studies have been reported so far.\nWe explored that the passage beds exposed along Koti road (30051’, 77000’) in Himachal Pradesh state of India are pedogenically modified and show conspicuous colour change from greenish-grey to reddish-brown as one goes stratigraphically up. Pedons vary in thickness from a few centimeters to tens of centimeters. Structure largely comprises sub-angular to sub-rounded blocky peds. Though horizonation is not very prominent but a suite of pedogenic features include burrows, root traces, infillings, mottling, cutans, segregations, and nodules with varying dominance within passage beds from greenish-grey lower/older pedons to reddish-brown upper/younger pedons. Biogenic features, like root traces are common and largely filled with carbonates in reddish-brown upper pedons whereas mottling is prominent in greenish-grey lower pedons. Likewise, greenish-grey pedons are dominated by Fe-Mn oxide segregations and nodules whereas the reddish-brown pedons are dominated by presence of carbonate segregations with some nodules and cutans. Detailed field and laboratory studies at various local and regional exposures can reveal the nature and extent of pedogenesis which will be significant to enact depositional environment as well as stratigraphic position, nature and chronology of these passage beds.",

            "abstract": " The extensive hydrothermal vent field was discovered at TA25(\"V18s-HR\" in the SO-167 cruise) caldera in the Tonga arc, southwest Pacific. The TA25 caldera is a submarine volcano of dacitic composition and hosts the NE- and NW-trending hydrothermal vent on the western caldera wall. These active hydrothermal crusters are mostly small (chimney: <0.5m in tall; sulfide mound: <3m in diameter) and immature, and emit the transparent fluids of which temperature range from 150℃ to 242℃ (average = 203℃). The hydrothermal sulfide ores, recovered by ROV and/or TV-grab, are mainly composed of sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite, galena, chalcopyrite, covellite, tennantite, enargite and sulfates such as barite, gypsum/anhydrite. It is observed that three distinct mineralogical zonation from exterior to interior of the chimneys: (1) barite-gypsum/anhydrite-pyrite-sphalerite; (2) sphalerite-pyrite-galena±chalcopyrite; (3) sphaleirte-pyrite-chalcopyrite-enargite-tennantite±galena±covellite. FeS content in sphalerite increases from chimney exterior to interior. Chalcopyrite is more abundant in the mound than in the chimney, implying fluid temperatures in mound are greater than in the chimney. The enargite assemblage (pyrite-chalcopyrite-enargite-tennantite) is indicative of high-sulfidation epithermal deposits. Fluid inclusions on barite crystals from mound samples show mono-type inclusion (two-phase liquid-rich inclusions) which is less than 20㎛ in diameter. Homogenization temperatures and salinities from fluid inclusion study range from 148℃ to 341℃ (average = 213℃) and 0.4 to 3.6 equiv. wt.% NaCl, respectively. The main mineralization temperature in mound might be greater than 200℃ since barite on fluid inclusion is early stage mineral.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeologic properties of fault zones are critical to the faulting processes; however, they are not well understood and difficult to measure in situ. Recording the tidal response of water level is a useful method to measure the in-situ properties. We utilize an array of wells near the San Andreas Fault zone in the Logan Quarry to study the fault zone hydrogeologic architecture by measuring the water tidal response. The measured specific storage and permeability show that there is a localized zone near the fault with higher specific storage and larger permeability than the surrounding region. This change of properties might be related to the fault zone fracture distribution. Surprisingly, the change of the specific storage is the clearest signal. The inferred compliance contrast is consistent with prior estimates of elastic moduli change in the near-fault environment, but the hydrogeologic effects of the compliance change have never before been measured on a major active fault. The observed specific storage structure implies that the fault zone plays an important role in permeability enhancement by seismic shaking. In addition, the measured diffusivity is about 10-2 m2/s, which is comparable to the post-earthquake hydraulic diffusivity measured on the Wenchuan Earthquake Fault. This observed high diffusivity with little variability inside the fault zone might suggest the accumulated pore pressure during interseismic period distributes over a broad region.",

            "abstract": "Gravity survey is one of powerful methods to obtain density structure in crust, especially for exploration of underground deposits. Recent technology of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enables us measure gravity in underwater environment. Measurement of both gravity and gravity gradient is useful to estimate structure. From a model calculation, resolution of 0.1 mGal for gravity and 10 Etoves (E) for gradient measurement is needed for detection of seafloor deposits. From these objectives and specification, we have developed an underwater gravity measurement system for exploration below a seafloor using an AUV. For the gravimeter system, a gravimeter is mounted on a levelling mechanism to keep vertical. Depth rating of the system is 4,200 m. We confirmed that our gravity measurement system has an accuracy of less than 0.04 mGal on a land experiment. The gradiometer has two identical gravimeter aligned vertically 44 cm apart. Difference between two gravimeters is calculated for gravity gradient and a levelling system is also used to keep vertical. We estimate accuracy of 10 E from background noise spectra. We chose AUV Urashima belonging to JAMSTEC, because stable navigation is possible. All the power is supplied from the Urashima and acoustic communication system enables real-time monitoring of the system. The first observation was carried out in September 2012 in Sagami-Bay, Japan. The Urashima made round trip along a single profile. We succeeded in obtaining gravity data and other data for compensation. Information to measure gravity gradient is also obtained. After the data processing, our gravity system is estimated to have accuracy of 0.1 mGal. In August 2014, we carried out the second gravity survey using our system in Izena caldera, the middle Okinawa Trough, where seafloor deposits had been found. The Urashima was navigated on 15 profiles in the survey area at constant speed and depth. We obtained the data from both the gravimeter and gradiometer with good quality for all the profiles. Because the profiles were laid within the survey area, a gravity anomaly map was obtained. We have a plan to carry out a third observation using our system in August 2015. A purpose of the third observation is to obtain spatially higher-resolution image of the Izena caldera.",

            "abstract": "The ocean covers 71% of the Earth’s surface and plays a pivotal role in the earth radiation energy balance. The ocean surface albedo(OSA) is a deciding factor on ocean net surface shortwave radiation(ONSSR) estimation. Several OSA schemes have been proposed successively, but there is not a conclusion for the best OSA scheme of estimating the ONSSR. This study, on the base of analyzing currently existing OSA parameterization, including Briegleb et al.(B), Taylor et al.(T), Hansen et al.(H), Jin et al.(J), Preisendorfer and Mobley(PM86), Feng’s scheme(F), discusses the difference of OSA’s impact on ONSSR estimation in condition of actual downward shortwave radiation(DSR). Then we evaluate the necessity and applicability for the climate models to integrate the more complicated OSA scheme.\nWe got some conclusions: The SZA and the wind speed are the two most significant effect factor to broadband OSA, thus the different OSA parameterizations varies violently in the regions of both high latitudes and strong winds. In the summer, the Northern Hemisphere(NH) is high ONSSR, but small deviations compared with Northern Hemisphere(SH),and contrary in the winter. The OSA schemes can lead the ONSSR results difference of the order of 20 w m-2 by the analysis of the ONSSR reanalysis dataset, the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA).The simple scheme of Taylor and the more complicate schemes of Jin and Feng is very similar, and the scheme B and H is close to each other, the PM86 is more close to MERRA. We use the COVE ocean platform observation data to validate the several scheme result, and the RMSE is 10.96 w m-2, 5.24 w m-2, 12.88 w m-2, 6.52 w m-2, 6.33 w m-2, 6.30 w m-2 for B,T,H,J,PM86,F, respectively. The Taylor’s scheme shows the best estimate, and Feng’s result just following Taylor’s. However, the accuracy of the estimated instantaneous OSA changes at different local time. Jin’s scheme has the best performance generally at noon and in the afternoon, and PM86’s is the best of all in the morning, which indicate that the more complicated OSA schemes reflect the temporal variation of OWA better than the simple ones.",

            "abstract": "Aluminosilicate hollandite, with the chemical formula of (K,Na)AlSi3O8, is a potential host mineral of K and Na in the deep Earth [1,2]. The Na hollandite end member is called lingunite, and the K hollandite end member was named liebermannite recently. Phase relations in the system KAlSi3O8-NaAlSi3O8 under conditions of the Earth mantle transition zone and uppermost lower mantle [3,4] are essential to understanding the behavior of the liebermannite-lingunite solid solution under high pressure and high temperature, however, it is still not clear whether or not the end members can form complete solid solutions with the hollandite structure under some conditions. Previous high pressure experiments obtained the K hollandite with the limited Na content up to 50 mol % [3,4], while the Na-rich hollandite with the Na content of about 80 mol % was discovered in some meteorites [5,6]. Here we report our successful synthesis of the Na-rich hollandite with the Na content of 78 mol % at 22 GPa, 2273 K, the same condition under which the Na-rich hollandite found in the meteorite was inferred to be formed during the shock event [5]. Phase relations around 22 GPa at 1873 and 2273 K determined by our experiments indicate the solubility of NaAlSi3O8 in K hollandite is sensitive to both pressure and temperature, especially around the pressure corresponding to the dissociation of jadeite into the calcium ferrite type NaAlSiO4and stishovite, and there may be a stability region for the Na hollandite end member at temperatures slightly higher than 2273 K. Our improved phase relations provide a reasonable access to estimate the composition of hollandite in the Earth’s interior and a supportive evidence to interpret the formation of the Na-rich hollandite found in meteorites via phase equilibria.\n[1] Irifune T., Ringwood A.E. and Hibberson W.O.

            "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that as the magma ocean crystallized in the Hadean, volatiles such as CO2 and H2O were released to the surface culminating with the formation of a liquid ocean by about 4.4 Ga [1] and hot CO2-rich atmosphere [2]. The resulting late Hadean atmospheric pCO2 may have been as high as 100 bars [3] with corresponding surface temperatures ~500 K [4]. Geological evidence suggests that by the early-to-mid Archean, atmospheric pCO2 became less than 1 bar [5]. However, the mechanisms responsible for the great amount of CO2 drawdown in a relatively short period of time remain enigmatic. To identify these possible mechanisms, we have developed a box model during the CIDER 2015 Summer Program that takes into account geological constraints on basalt alteration [6, 7] and possible rate of new oceanic crust formation [8] for the Archean. Our model integrates geodynamic and geochemical approaches of interaction between the Hadean atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceanic crust, and mantle to drawdown CO2. Our primary assumption for the Hadean is the absence of the continental crust and thus continental weathering. Therefore in the model we present, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is regulated by the formation of oceanic crust (OC), rate of the interaction between the ocean and OC, and carbonate subduction/CO2 degassing. Preliminary results suggest that it would take about 1 billion years for the atmospheric CO2 to decrease to 1 bar if the production of oceanic crust was 10 times more than today and the pH of the ocean was less than 7, making the basalt alteration more efficient. However, there is evidence that some continental crust began to form as early as 4.4 Ga [9] and therefore the role of continental weathering and its rate of CO2 drawdown will need to be further explored.\n",

            "abstract": "Lau basin is located in the South Pacific Ocean, forming a triangle shaped oceanic rift basin. It has been made by the collision between the Indian-Australian and Pacific plate, and is producing the specific kind of basalt characterized by intermediate chemistry between the MORB and the IAB. In particular, there is a tear along the northern boundary of the basin, by which the fertile plume can inflow to the mantle wedge beneath the basin. We conducted the petrological study intended to the Back-Arc Basin Basalt in the North Lau basin. There are a total 23 samples from the Fonualei Rift and Spreading Center (FRSC) and 9 samples from the Northeast Lau Spreading Center (NELSC) that were collected. In the spider diagram for trace elements, there is successive change from the Tofua arc through FRSC to NELSC, while the Samoa Island has a different pattern. This tendency presents itself in the diagram for Rare-earth elements as well. The fertility enhances from south to north, having more distinct variations in NELSC compared with FRSC. The degree of melting calculated by fractionation-corrected Na and Fe contents has no significant range in accordance with the assumption that the fertility variations are caused by the melt input, not a degree of melting. Isotope modeling by end-members used in previous studies in this area indicates that NELSC has a 10% more intense influence than FRSC in regards to the fertile plume, itself corresponds with the edifices and previous studies. Influence of subduction-induced fluid indicate that NELSC is less affected by both shallow and deep subduction fluids than FRSC, the subduction input from the northern boundary of the two plates therefore does not contribute to the North Lau basin distinctively. We also plotted the contributions of two main factors, plume (fertile melt input) and fluid (subduction-induced input). The plots show that the plume dominates in the northern part and the fluid dominates in southern part relatively. So, we conclude that NELSC located in the northernmost part of Lau basin is mainly affected by fertile plume, yet further studies are necessary to whether the derivation of this plume is the Samoan Island or not.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a fundamental role in the tropospheric chemistry as key precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and many VOC species have an adverse impact on human health. Therefore, VOCs are of great concern. Biomass burning, which is recognized as an important source of\nVOCs in China, has a significant effect on air pollution and climate change. Recent studies have reported some source profiles of VOCs emitted from biomass burning in China, and emission inventories have also been developed to estimate the biomass burning emissions. Nevertheless, very little is known about the emission characteristics of biomass burning, nor its contributions to ambient VOCs. This work presents the results from a continuous measurement of 108 VOC compounds by an online GC-MS/FID system at a receptor site in Beijing from October 1-14, 2014. Several biomass burning plumes were identified by extremely high level of acetonitrile, which is an excellent signature of biomass burning. The emission ratios of six VOCs species relative to acetonitrile were determined by enhancement ratio method. The contributions of biomass burning to ambient VOCs were also explored. Results show that the mixing ratios of ambient VOCs in biomass burning days were over twice as that in non-burning days. And biomass burning accounted for 25.1% (benzene), 24.6% (toluene), 18.8% (acetone), 24.9% (MEK), 29.4% (MVK), and 18.2% (n-hexanal) of the ambient mixing ratios, respectively. PMF analysis indicated that the contributions of biomass burning to VOCs increased from 5.5% to 12.7% on average in biomass burning days, which revealed that the high level of ambient VOCs in Beijing during this period can be partly attributed to extensive biomass burning. Our study will be helpful to better understand biomass burning emissions in China, as well as to explore the contributions of biomass burning to haze formation in the harvest season.",

            "abstract": "To gain better insights into the competition between functionalization and fragmentation pathways for oxygenated organic compounds, we investigate the OH-radical initiated oxidation of aqueous tartaric acid (C4H6O6) droplets using an aerosol flow tube reactor. The molecular composition of reaction products is characterized by an atmospheric pressure ionization source (Direct Analysis in Real Time, DART) coupled with a high resolution mass spectrometer. The reaction produces four major products: a functionalization product (C4H4O6) and three fragmentation products (C3H4O4, C3H2O4 and C3H2O5), with a predominance of the functionalization product which supports the literature result that only less than 10% of carbon loss was observed for the OH oxidation of tartaric acid. The formation of the functionalization product (2-hydroxy-3-oxosuccinic acid, C4H4O6) can be attributed to that the tertiary alkyl radical, formed after hydrogen abstraction, reacts with an O2 molecule to form a hydroxyperoxyl radical which tends to quickly undergo intramolecular HO2 elimination without fragmentation. The molecular transformation of aqueous tartaric acid droplets is stimulated using the kinetic multi-layer model of gas-particle interactions in aerosols and clouds (KM-GAP) and the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model in order to take into account the change in particle-phase water and activities of reaction products during the oxidation. Results suggest that aqueous tartaric acid droplets become slightly less hygroscopic after oxidation due to the formation of less polar products. The formation of products with different hygroscopicities and volatilities largely determine the amount of particle-phase water, which in turn governs the size of the aqueous droplets and the concentration of the reactants. Consideration of the variation in water content in response to the chemical evolution in the aerosol is needed to better understand the heterogeneous oxidation of aqueous organic droplets, especially under humid environments. We will present the aerosol-DART mass spectrometric data, reaction pathways, and model results to address the role of water in the heterogeneous OH oxidation of this highly oxygenated organic compound.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has developed a new inversion system of atmospheric CO2 mole fraction and flux for better understanding of global carbon budget and contribution to global carbon cycle studies. The new system introduces a newly developed on-line atmospheric tracer transport model (GSAM-TM). Its tracer transport process is directly coupled with a low resolution version (TL95) of JMA's operational global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model (JMA_GSM), using mass conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme and Arakawa-Shubert mass flux scheme for vertical convective transportation. It represents mass transportation, mass conservation, and structures of tracer distribution more precisely than JMA's previous transport model (CDTM), which is off-line tracer transport model using semi-Lagrangian scheme and Kuo-based convection scheme with multiplying globally uniform coefficient for mass conservation. The new system also introduces new a priori fluxes for fossil fuel consumption and oceanic CO2 exchange.\nIn this study, we compare CO2 mole fraction field and flux estimates of the new system against that of current annual JMA analysis with CDTM. The new system represents better atmospheric CO2 distribution structure than the current system does especially vertical gradient around tropopause. Due to improvement of fossil fuel CO2 diffusion estimates, analyzed regional budget over Eurasian Continent changed clearly. Budgets for less observation area (South America and Africa) are also changed. Globally averaged atmospheric CO2 budget is not changed significantly.\nThis new system is planned to be operationally implemented in 2016, and we will further improve the CO2 inversion analysis for understanding of carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "To find an evidence of earthquake-related geomagnetic changes is a challenging work. Some earlier studies have reported pre- or co-seismic changes in the geomagnetic field with sizable amplitudes (~10 nT). However the rarity of large earthquakes, combined with the sparsity of continuous geomagnetic stations, means that there are few opportunities to reach a reliable conclusion on the existence of earthquake-related geomagnetic changes.\nAs an alternative approach, I focus on geomagnetic secular variation (SV) anomalies that are NOT related to earthquakes or other prominent events. SV anomalies up to few nT are reported in several areas in Japan. On the other hand, anomalies in absolute values of the geomagnetic field in the same area are up to 100 nT. If the reported SV anomalies are persistent during several decades, a contradiction arises unless there are “counter changes” which possibly related to earthquakes. Therefore precise analysis of the SV anomalies may provide an evidence of the existence of earthquake-related changes in the geomagnetic field, although indirect.\nTo determine SV anomalies, the 1st geomagnetic survey’s data at about 100 sites provided by the GeoSpatial Authority of Japan (GSI) during 1970–2000, together with observatories data provided by GSI and the Japan Meteorological Agency, are analized. Spatio-temporal variations in the geomagnetic field in the region are approximated by the Spherical Harmonic functions with low degrees, and the differences between the observed and approximated values are regarded as the SV anomalies.\nIn many sites, persistent SV anomalies of the order of 0.1 nT/yr are determined. Although they are smaller than those reported by an earlier study, it still suggest the SV cannot continue for several 1000 years unless “counter changes” in values exists, at least in each 100 years. To find generation mechanism(s) of the SV is a future challenge, which possibly leads to an insight on the relationship between the geomagnetic SV and tectonic processes.",

            "abstract": "Huge quantities of small rivers derived suspended particles are exporting to the ocean from oceanic islands at the present time. Depending on location and proportion of shelf/slope area, a major fraction of small river particles may by-pass the shelf region, transport and deposit on the deep ocean basin. Major mechanisms driving those huge quantities of small river derived particles to the ocean are quantity of precipitation from monsoon and those from short period of tropical cyclone. Although data demonstrate that deeper part of the South China Sea, SCS, is the major final burial location of the river derived particles from the island of Taiwan, it is not sure if this was the same during the glaciation when monsoon and climatic conditions were drastic different from the present time. The purpose of this study is to understand history of small river derived sediment export and deposition during climatic change. A long piston core with length of ~35 meter was taken on r/v Marion DuFresne on a slope basin offshore SW Taiwan. We have measured density, magnetic susceptibility with multi-sensor core logger, MSCL, and organic, inorganic carbon, C/N ratio, biogenic silica as well as grain sizes. Foraminifera (Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides sacculifer and Globigerinoides conglobatus) were picked and measured carbon 14 for age determination.\nTwo different types of processes control sediment deposition in our study site, steady state and event driven sedimentation. Our results demonstrated that sedimentation rates were consistent during each major periods, the Holocene (present to 10k year) and the transition (10-20 k year) period, but, difference existed in between the two. Sedimentation rate was about twice faster during the transition period (20-10k year) than that at the Holocene (10-present time) at our study site. A number of spikes existed in our study site, probably a result of turbidite overflow from the adjacent canyon. Frequency and total thickness of event driven deposition indicated that climatic condition during the transition period may deliver more terrigenous materials to the ocean.",

            "abstract": "The M6.4 earthquake that took place on the 20th April 2015 off the shore of eastern Taiwan was the largest event that occurred in the vicinity of Taiwan during 2015. The mainshock located in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone, which is the interface between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. People in Taipei experienced strong ground shaking for more than 40 s, even though the epicenter was located more than 150 km away. In order to understand the origin of this earthquake and how it caused such strong shaking in Taipei, a numerical earthquake model is analyzed, including models of source rupture and wave propagation. First, a joint source inversion is performed using teleseismic body wave and local ground motion data. Source inversion results show that a large slip occurred near the hypocenter, which rapidly released seismic energy in the first 2 s. Then, the rupture propagated toward the shallow fault plane. A large amount of seismic energy was released during this rupture stage that slipped for more than 8 s before the end of the rupture. The estimated stress drop is 2.48 MPa, which is consistent with values for subduction zone earthquakes. Forward simulation using this inverted source rupture model based on the spectral-element method is then performed. Results indicate that the strong ground motion in Taipei resulted from two factors: (1) the Taipei basin amplification effect and (2) the specific source radiation pattern. The results of this numerical earthquake model imply that future subduction zone events that occur in offshore eastern Taiwan are likely to cause relatively strong ground shaking in northern Taiwan, especially in the Taipei metropolitan area.",

            "abstract": "Dominant canopy tree species have strong effects on the composition and function of understory species. In boreal forests, forest floor bryophytes and their associated microbes are a primary source of ecosystem nitrogen (N) inputs, and thus an important process regulating ecosystem productivity. Bryophyte composition and abundance varies with forest composition, yet how such changes can affect ecosystem processes such as N fixation is still poorly understood. Our goal is to investigate how cyanobacteria-based N fixation occurring in the two most common feather mosses in the Alaskan boreal forest (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens) varies among coniferous and deciduous forest types, over the growing season, and across a nutrient availability gradient. Twelve patches of H. splendens and P. schreberi were identified in three pairs (blocks) of adjacent stands of paper birch (Betula neoalaskana) and black spruce (Picea mariana) near Fairbanks, interior Alaska. Sampling occurred in one block in June, July, August, and September 2014, and in the three blocks once in August 2014. Moss leaf area, moisture and weight, as well as environmental variables such as air temperature and canopy cover were recorded. Fixation rates were consistently higher for P. schreberi than for H. splendens. Overall, N fixation rates were lower in birch than in spruce stands and peaked in August, or July for P. schreberi in birch stands. Moreover, fixation rates varied along the nutrient availability gradient, with fixation rates higher where nutrient availability was lower. This difference was especially clear in spruce stands. Our preliminary results suggest that moss species, canopy type, and environmental factors all influence N fixation rates in Alaskan boreal forests. Our results will enhance the knowledge of the processes that drive N fixation in boreal forests, which is important for predicting ecosystem consequences of changing forest composition.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the effect of climate change at regional scales remains a topic of intensive research. Though computational constraints remain a problem, high horizontal resolution is needed to represent topographic forcing, which is a significant driver of local climate variability.\nAlthough regional climate models (RCMs) have traditionally been used at these scales, variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) have recently arisen as an alternative for studying regional weather and climate allowing two-way interaction between these domains without the need for nudging.\nIn this study, the recently developed variable-resolution option within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) is assessed for long-term regional climate modeling over California. Our variable-resolution simulations will focus on relatively high resolutions for climate assessment, namely 28km and 14km regional resolution, which are much more typical for dynamically downscaled studies. For comparison with the more widely used RCM method, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used for simulations at 27km and 9km. All simulations use the AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) protocols. The time period is from 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC), and year 1979 was discarded as spin up time.\nThe mean climatology across California's diverse climate zones, including temperature and precipitation, is analyzed and contrasted with the Weather Research and Forcasting (WRF) model (as a traditional RCM), regional reanalysis, gridded observational datasets and uniform high-resolution CESM at 0.25 degree with the finite volume (FV) dynamical core. The results show that variable-resolution CESM is competitive in representing regional climatology on both annual and seasonal time scales. This assessment adds value to the use of VRGCMs for projecting climate change over the coming century and improve our understanding of both past and future regional climate related to fine-scale processes. This assessment is also relevant for addressing the scale limitation of current RCMs or VRGCMs when next-generation model resolution increases to ~10km and beyond.",

            "abstract": "The frontal part of the southwestern Alpine belt is characterized by important compressional deformation marked by the emplacement of the Digne nappe and the formation of the Valavoire thrust-sheet. The final emplacement of this nappe is dated Late Miocene thanks to Tertiary continental molasses of the foreland basin that are involved in the famous Vélodrôme recumbent syncline and exposed in erosional windows. The stratigraphic series of the Digne nappe is made of ~5000 m thick Liassic to Eocene deposits, which overthrust the vélodrôme syncline. We performed a low temperature apatite fission tracks (AFT) and (U-Th)/He (AHe) study on detrital grains of Tertiary molasses in order to (i) characterize the thermal conditions during burial and exhumation and to (ii) propose a late tectonic evolution in the front of the European Alpine foreland. Tertiary molasses were sampled in two sites of the erosional windows at different elevations. Samples present dispersed AHe and AFT ages due to an incomplete resetting of both thermochronometers, expected for the lowest elevation samples. In detail, AHe ages ranges from 2±0.2 to 60.4±5.4 Ma, whereas central AFT ages range from 11±1 to 67±16 Ma. On both sites, the total and partial reset of the thermochronological data suggests a heating event after the sediment deposition. Using QTQt inverse modeling and He damage codes, we determined the samples thermal history. The results implied a common burial temperature at 110±5°C during ~5Ma and a similar exhumation starting at 6±1 Ma. From these results, we conclude that the thermal conditions during burial associated with the Digne nappe thrusting were sufficient to reset the detrital apatites. Using mean surface temperature of 10°C and typical thermal gradient from 25°C/km, our new data show that the Digne Nappe reached at least 4.5 to 3.6 km-thick on both sites before further erosion. We propose that the late exhumation occurred at ~6 Ma ago, before the Messinian incision, is due to tectonic processes compensated by erosion. The link between exhumation and erosion is compatible with the outward propagation of the alpine deformation in the frontal part of the European foreland. This deformation results of sedimentary cover stacking, and / or of deep-seated basement shortening.",

            "abstract": "Historically, only the thermodynamic processes (e.g., water vapor, cloud, surface albedo, and atmospheric lapse rate) that directly influence the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative energy flux balance are considered in climate feedback analysis. One of my recent research areas is to develop a new framework for climate feedback analysis that explicitly takes into consideration not only the thermodynamic processes that the directly influence the TOA radiative energy flux balance but also the local dynamical (e.g., evaporation, surface sensible heat flux, vertical convections etc) and non-local dynamical (large-scale horizontal energy transport) processes in aiming to explain the warming asymmetry between high and low latitudes, between ocean and land, and between the surface and atmosphere.\nIn the last 5-6 years, we have developed a coupled atmosphere-surface climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) as a new framework for estimating climate feedback and sensitivity in coupled general circulation models with a full physical parameterization package. In the CFRAM, the isolation of partial temperature changes due to an external forcing alone or an individual feedback is achieved by solving the linearized infrared radiation transfer model subject to individual energy flux perturbations (external or due to feedbacks). The partial temperature changes are addable and their sum is equal to the (total) temperature change (in the linear sense).\nThe CFRAM is used to isolate the partial temperature changes due to the external forcing, due to water vapor feedback, clouds, surface albedo, local vertical convection, and non-local atmospheric dynamical feedbacks, as well as oceanic heat storage. It has been shown that seasonal variations in the cloud feedback, surface albedo feedback, and ocean heat storage/dynamics feedback, directly caused by the strong annual cycle of insolation, contribute primarily to the large seasonal variation of polar warming. Furthermore, the CO2 forcing, and water vapor and atmospheric dynamics feedbacks add to the maximum polar warming in fall/winter.",

            "abstract": "Understanding chemical cycling of mercury in the Antarctic plateau can provide important constraints on the global biogeochemical cycling of mercury, but there remain numerous uncertainties in mercury chemistry and behavior in remote Polar Regions. Recent research has recognized the atmosphere of the Antarctic plateau as a highly oxidizing area with elevated concentrations of hydroxyl radicals (OH ~ 3 × 106 molecule cm-3 during austral summer) and other atmospheric oxidants. Some chemical species (e.g. NOx) may undergo multiple recycling between the atmospheric boundary layer and the underlying snowpack.\nWe use a box model along with measurements of mercury to investigate the chemistry and dynamics of mercury in the boundary layer of Concordia station (3320 m above sea level). Information on atmospheric dynamics (e.g. atmospheric boundary layer height) is obtained from a regional climate model which has been validated against meteorological observations at the same station. We evaluate the proposed two-step oxidation mechanism of Hg0 in which HgBr is the intermediate, as well as several other oxidation mechanisms used in current chemical transport models. The deposition of oxidized Hg and its subsequent photoreduction in the surface snow increase the snowpack pool of Hg0 and serve as an important step in the atmosphere-snow mercury recycling.\nWe constrain our box model with measurements of mercury from the Antarctic plateau. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM, Hg0) has been continuously measured at Concordia station in the past several years. In 2013, measurements of Hg0, ozone and NOx were conducted in both snow interstitial air and the overlying atmosphere. Hg0 concentrations were found to slowly decrease during the austral winter (perpetual night); whereas during the austral summer (perpetual day), Hg0 concentrations showed a clear diurnal cycle and high day-to-day fluctuations. This suggests that photochemistry plays an important role in controlling the reactivity of mercury on the Antarctic plateau.",

            "abstract": "Long-lived anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns are often associated with surface weather extremes. This is particularly true from a hydroclimatic perspective in regions that have well-defined “wet seasons,” where atmospheric anomalies that persist on a seasonal scale can lead to drought or (conversely) increase the risk of flood. Recent evidence suggests that both natural variability and global warming may be responsible for spatially and temporally heterogeneous changes in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric conditions over the past several decades. In this investigation, we assess observed trends in cool-season (Oct-May) circulation patterns over the northeastern Pacific Ocean which have historically been associated with precipitation and temperature extremes in California. We find that the occurrence of certain extreme seasonal-scale atmospheric configurations has changed substantially over the 1948-2015 period, and also that there has been a trend towards amplification of the cool-season mean state in this region. Notably, patterns similar to the persistent anticyclone associated with the extremely warm and dry conditions experienced during the ongoing 2012-2015 California drought occur more frequently in the second half of the observed record. This finding highlights the importance of examining changes in extreme and/or persistent atmospheric circulation configurations, which may exhibit different responses to natural and anthropogenic forcings than the mean state.",

            "abstract": "The ~M7.5 southern California earthquake of 8 December 1812 ruptured the San Andreas Fault from Cajon Pass to at least as far north as Pallet Creek (Biasi et al., 2002). The 1812 rupture has also been identified in trenches at Burro Flats to the south (Yule and Howland, 2001). However, the lack of a record of 1812 at Plunge Creek, between Cajon Pass and Burro Flats (McGill et al., 2002), complicates the interpretation of this event as a straightforward San Andreas rupture. Paleoseismic records of a large early 19th century rupture on the northern San Jacinto Fault (Onderdonk et al., 2013; Kendrick and Fumal, 2005) allow for alternate interpretations of the 1812 earthquake.\nI use dynamic rupture modeling on the San Andreas-San Jacinto junction to determine which rupture behaviors produce slip patterns consistent with observations of the 1812 event. My models implement realistic fault geometry, a realistic velocity structure, and stress orientations based on seismicity literature. Under these simple assumptions, joint rupture of the two faults is the most common behavior. My modeling rules out a San Andreas-only rupture that is consistent with the data from the 1812 earthquake, and also shows that single fault events are unable to match the average slip per event for either fault. The choice of nucleation point affects the details of rupture directivity and slip distribution, but not the first order result that multi-fault rupture is the preferred behavior.\nWhile it cannot be definitively said that joint San Andreas-San Jacinto rupture occurred in 1812, these results are consistent with paleoseismic and historic data. This has implications for the possibility of future multi-fault rupture within the San Andreas system, as well as for interpretation of other paleoseismic events in regions of complex fault interactions.",

            "abstract": "In the Upper Colorado River Basin episodic deposition of mineral dust onto mountain snow cover frequently occurs in the spring when wind speeds and dust emission peaks on the nearby Colorado Plateau, and deposition rates have increased since the intensive settlement in the western USA in the mid 1880s. Dust deposition darkens the snow surface, and accelerates snowmelt through reduction of albedo and further indirect reduction of albedo by accelerating the growth of snow grain size. Observation and modeling of dust-on-snow processes began in 2005 at Senator Beck Basin Study Area (SBBSA) in the San Juan Mountains, CO, work which has shown that dust advances melt, shifts runoff timing and intensity, and reduces total water yield. The consistency of deposition and magnitude of impacts highlighted the need for more detailed understanding of the radiative impacts of dust-on-snow in this region. Here I will present results from a novel, high resolution, daily snow property dataset, collected at SBBSA over the 2013 ablation season, to facilitate physically based radiative transfer and snowmelt modeling. Measurements included snow albedo and vertical profiles of snow density, optical snow grain size, and dust/black carbon concentrations. This dataset was used to assess the relationship between episodic dust events, snow grain growth, and albedo over time, and observe the relation between deposited dust and melt water. Additionally, modeling results include the determination of the regionally specific dust-on-snow complex refractive index and radiative forcing partitioning between dust and black carbon, and dust and snow grain growth.",

Key ecophysiological properties, such as photosynthesis biochemistry, are most times merely averaged and trade-off with other plant traits is often neglected. Validation of a PFT framework based in photosynthetic process is crucial to improve reliability of DGVMs. We present 431 leaf-biochemical and wood level measurements in evergreen angiosperm trees of tropical forests in Australia and China that were divided in four spectrums of plant trait variation: metabolic, structural, hydraulic and height dimensions. Plant traits divided in each of these dimensions adopt survival strategies reflected more clearly by trade-off within each spectrum, and in some extent across spectrums. Co-ordination theory (that Rubisco- and electron-transport limited rates of photosynthesis are co-limiting) and least-coast theory (that intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration minimizes the combined costs per unit carbon assimilation, regulating maximum height and wood density) expectations matched PFT (which takes in account canopy position and light access, and life spam) variation. Our findings suggest that climate (air moisture, air temperature, light) has lower power representing these dimensions, in comparison to the PFT framework.",

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is equipped with 1km resolution thermal sensor andcapable of observing the earth surface at least once per day.\nThermal infrared bands cannot penetrate cloud, which means we cannot get consistency drought monitoring condition at one area. However, the cloudy-sky conditions represent more than half of the actual day-to-day weather around the global. In this study, we developed an LST filled model based on the assumption that under good weather condition, LST difference between two nearby pixels are similar among the closest 8 days. We used all the valid pixels covered by a 9*9 window to reconstruct the gap LST. Each valid pixel is assigned a weight which is determined by the spatial distance and the spectral similarity. This model is applied in the Middle-East of China including Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi province. The terrain is complicated in this area including plain and hill. The MODIS daily LST product (MOD11A3) from 2000 to 2004 is tested. Almost all the gap pixels are filled, and the terrain information is reconstructed well and smoothly. We masked two areas in order to validate the model, one located in the plain, another located in the hill. The correlation coefficient is greater than 0.8, even up to 0.92 in a few days. We also used ground measured day maximum and mean surface temperature to valid our model.  Although both the temporal and spatial scale are different between ground measured temperature and MODIS LST, they agreed well in all the stations. This LST filled model is operational because it only needs LST and reflectance, and does not need other auxiliary information such as climate factors. We will apply this model to more regions in the future.",

Using a combination of vibrational (2) and photo-absorption spectroscopies (3), we show that nitric acid is mostly dissociated upon its adsorption onto, and its dissolution within ice at temperatures as low 20K. Using amorphous solid water as a model substrate for the disordered surface layer at the interstitial air-ice interface, UV irradiation in the environmentally relevant n-π* transition uncovers the fact that the photolysis rates are significantly higher for surface-bound nitrates compared to those dissolved within the bulk. The complex coupled interfacial transport and reaction kinetics result in the formation of a thin photochemically active layer at the surface of ice which may magnify the impact of surface-enhanced nitrates photolysis rates on ice thereby providing a significant contribution to the intense photochemical NOxfluxes observed to emanate from the sunlit snowpack upon polar sunrise.(4)\n(1) F.

            "abstract": "In porous media multiple pathways may exist between different locations. The length and strength of these pathways vary significantly, and the total flow at a given location is composed of contributions from both very short and long paths. If a pore network representation of such a medium is considered, there exist pores which get bypassed by long tubes. A local single continuum model can only capture the contributions from all paths properly, if the computational cells are larger than the longest connections. However, depending on the density and the lengths of these bypassing connections, choosing appropriately coarse grid blocks might be in conflict with the desired resolution.\nIn order to capture these non-local effects present due to long bypassing connections, a non-local continuum model has been proposed. Here, it is explained how the model can be derived from the fine-scale description of a porous medium, and it is shown that in the limit where the longest connections are much smaller than the size of the computational cells, the model is consistent with Darcy's law. The non-local model was applied to pore-networks generated from a Berea sand stone sample, and the results were compared with corresponding pore-network simulations. It is shown that the resulting pressure solutions are in very good agreement, yet differ significantly from the Darcy solution. At the field-scale, this method is relevant in connection with fracture networks.",

Preliminary heliosheath observations by Voyager 2 (V2) indicate that the magnetic field strength (B) began to increase in mid-2011, possibly reaching 0.3 nT during mid-2012. A similar increase in B was observed by V1 shortly before it crossed the heliopause.

The plasma speed was lowest during the middle of 2012, but there was no clear relationship between V and B.

And the horizontal length of a recognizable geological anomalous body is measured by the lateral variation of S-wave velocity. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method is an efficient tool to determine near-surface shear-wave velocities. The acquisition of the MASW method involves the same source-receiver configuration moved successively by a fixed distance interval (a few to several stations) along a linear survey line, which is called a roll-along acquisition geometry. A pseudo-2D S-wave velocity section is constructed by aligning 1D models, and each inverted 1D S-wave velocity model reflects the vertical S-wave velocity variation at the midpoint of each geophone spread. Although the MASW method can improve the horizontal resolution of S-wave velocity sections to some degree, the amount of fieldwork is increased by the roll-along acquisition geometry. We propose surface-wave tomography method to investigate horizontal resolution of surface-wave exploration. Phase-velocity dispersion curves are calculated by a pair of traces within a multichannel record through cross-correlation combined with a phase-shift scanning method. Then with the utilization of travel-time tomography, we can obtain high resolution pure-path dispersion curves with diverse sizes of grids at different frequencies. Finally, the pseudo-2D S-wave velocity structure is reconstructed by inverting the pure-path dispersion curves. Travel-time tomography of surface waves can extract accurate dispersion curves from a record with a short receiver spacing, and it can effectively enhance the ability of random noise immunity. Synthetic tests and a real-world example have indicated that travel-time tomography has a great potential for improving the horizontal resolution of surface waves.\nKeywords: Travel-time tomography of surface waves, Horizontal resolution, Dispersion curves, Pseudo-2D S-wave velocity section.",

A number of long-term (~10 years) Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments have now been carried out, providing significant new understanding of system responses to increased CO2 concentrations. Recently, these data have been successfully used to examine the underlying hypotheses in a series of state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). However, these comparisons are limited in a number of ways: (i) experiments on forests, have predominantly been focussed in the temperate zone; (ii) stands are often limited to young or plantation forests; and (iii) model-data comparisons have occurred after the conclusions of these experiments. The Eucalyptus Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment, which has recently been established in a nutrient-limited woodland in Sydney, Australia, thus presents a unique opportunity to address all of these issues. We applied 7 TBMs that incorporate contrasting hypotheses about nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) cycling, to make predictions before the experiment commenced, with particular focus on the role of potential drought. The aim was both to examine the likely model responses from the experiment and to identify key areas of model uncertainty where additional measurements could constrain models.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Changes in vegetation activity are driven by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from satellite. In this paper, NDVI trends from 1982 to 2012 are first estimated by the Theil-Sen median slope method to explore their spatial and temporal patterns. Then the impact of climate variables and human activity on the observed NDVI trends is analyzed. Our results show on average NDVI increased by 0.46×10-3 per year from 1982 to 2012 globally with decadal variations. For most regions of the world, a greening (increasing) – browning(decreasing) – greening (G-B-G) trend is observed over the periods 1982-2004, 1995-2004, and 2005-2012, respectively. A positive partial correlation of NDVI and temperature is observed in the first period but it decreases and occasionally becomes negative in the following periods, especially in the Humid Temperate and Dry Domain Regions. This suggests a weakened effect of temperature on vegetation growth. Precipitation, on the other hand, is found to have a positive impact on the NDVI trend. This effect becomes stronger in the third period of 1995-2004, especially in the Dry Domain Region. Anthropogenic effects and human activities, derived here from the Human Footprint Dataset and the associated Human Influence Index (HII), have varied impacts on the magnitude (absolute value) of the NDVI trends across continents. Significant positive effects are found in Asia, Africa, and Europe, suggesting that intensive human activity could accelerate the change in NDVI and vegetation. A more accurate attribution of vegetation change to specific climatic and anthropogenic factors is instrumental to understand vegetation dynamics and requires further research.",

Similar magnitudes (weekly average of daily integrated values) of NEE (10-11 g C m-2 d-1), gross primary production (GPP, 19-20 g C m-2 d-1), ecosystem respiration (ER, 10-12 g C m-2 d-1), and evapotranspiration (ET, 6.2-6.7 mm d-1) were observed in both ecosystems. Carbon and water vapor fluxes of both ecosystems had similar response to air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). An optimum Ta was slightly over 30 °C for NEE and approximately 35 °C for ET, and an optimum VPD was approximately 3 kPa for NEE and ET in both ecosystems. The switchgrass field was a larger carbon sink, with a cumulative seasonal carbon uptake of 406-490 g C m-2 compared to 261-330 g C m-2 by the sorghum field. Despite similar water use patterns during the active growing period, seasonal cumulative ET was higher in switchgrass than in sorghum. The ratio of seasonal sums of GPP to ET yielded ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE) of 9.41-11.32 and 8.98-9.17 g CO2 mm-1 ET in switchgrass and sorghum, respectively. The ratio of seasonal sums of net ecosystem production (NEP) to ET was 2.75-2.81 and 2.06-2.18 g CO2 mm-1 ET in switchgrass and sorghum, respectively. The switchgrass stand was a net carbon sink for four to five months (April/May-August), while sorghum was a net carbon sink only for three months (June-August). Our results imply that the difference in carbon sink strength and water use between two ecosystems was driven mainly by the length of the growing season.",

            "abstract": "Depletion-induced faulting in hydrocarbon reservoirs has mostly been attributed to poroelastic effects: in-situ stresses are coupled with a pore pressure change according to a stress path. As a result, for a fault of certain orientation, the shear stress and normal stress resolved on the fault increase in a manner such that the stress state exceeds the shear failure envelop. An underlying assumption associated with this mechanism is that homogeneous pore pressure depletion occurs on both sides of the fault.\nThis study addresses an additional mechanism for depletion-induced faulting in cases where the pore pressure reduction is bounded by a hydraulically impermeable fault. We assume that the overburden and shear stresses are decoupled from pore pressure, while the two horizontal principal stresses are coupled with pore pressure by their respective stress paths (we show that the poroelastic coupling effect is anisotropic). Unbalanced pore pressure changes on the two sides of the fault, in conjunction with the poroelastic response, cause redistribution of the stress state. Given a fault that is arbitrarily oriented with respect to the original stress field, we derive a generalized 3D analytical solution for the new state of stress after depletion. We then quantify the magnitude change and the rotation of the three principal stresses. Finally, we compare the corresponding Coulomb Failure Functions and Mohr circles before and after depletion. For demonstration purposes, we determine the stress path tensor using poroelastic plane strain solutions in conjunction with frictional equilibrium for three different stress regimes. Our hypothetical case studies show that, for bounded reservoirs, depletion-induced principal stress rotation and magnitude changes have a significant impact on fault stability, and are a complex function of fault orientation, the original in-situ stress state and pore pressure, the degree of depletion, and the degree of poroelastic coupling.",

            "abstract": "Complex-fault system containing bending, step-overs, and multiple fault segments can bring about the heterogeneous distribution of stress and strength during dynamic rupture propagation, and contribute to an irregularity of rupture propagation. Theoretical studies show that the irregularity of rupture propagation generates high-frequency (HF) waves. Thus tracking HF radiation sources at high-resolution is a key to understand earthquake source physics especially in complex-fault systems.\nThe 2008 Wenchuan, China earthquake occurred along multiple fault segments consist of steps and sub-parallel faults. Kinematic waveform inversions from low frequency waveforms have detected several sub-events and changes in slip motion from thrust to right-lateral motion. Backprojection (BP) of HF (~1 Hz) waveforms have also reported several sub-events of HF bursts at the devastating damaged area, while the detailed role of HF radiation related to the fault geometry or variations in slip motions has not been well documented.\nHere we tracked the spatiotemporal distributions of HF (0.5–2.0 Hz) sources during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake by using a hybrid backprojection (HBP) method. The HBP method extracts signals of HF radiation by cross-correlating observed waveforms and Green’s functions including P-phase and depth phases (pP, and sP). Thus HF radiation depth and variations in focal mechanisms (fault geometry and slip motions) can be resolved by the HBP method. We used 52 teleseismic waveforms observed at GSN stations, and constructed the fault geometry with nine fault segments based on field measurements of surface rupture and focal mechanisms of aftershocks.\nRupture initiates at the hypocenter and propagates unilaterally toward northeast. Variations in rake angles among the HF radiation are generally similar to that obtained by slip inversion, indicating that the HBP method can also be used as a tool to grasp the variable slip motions. Strong HF radiations distribute around the boundary of fault segments (around the Xiaoyudong fault and steps at the middle of the Beichuan fault), indicating that the HF bursts may result from the perturbations of rupture velocity and/or slip-rate at the fault discontinuities that work as geometrical barriers.",

The governing equations for variably saturated flow and reactive chemical transport are obtained based on the mass conservation principle of species transport supplemented with Darcy's law, constraint of species concentration, equation of states, and constitutive law of K-S-P (Conductivity-Degree of Saturation-Capillary Pressure). The thermal transport equation is obtained based on the conservation of energy. The geo-mechanic displacement is obtained based on the assumption of equilibrium. Conventionally, these equations have been implicitly coupled via the calculations of secondary variables based on primary variables. The mechanisms of coupling have not been obvious. In this paper, governing equations are explicitly coupled for all primary variables. The coupling is accomplished via the storage coefficients, transporting velocities, and conduction-dispersion-diffusion coefficient tensor; one set each for every primary variable. With this new system of equations, the coupling mechanisms become clear. Physical interpretations of every term in the coupled equations will be discussed. Examples will be employed to demonstrate the intuition and superiority of these explicit coupling approaches.\n Keywords: Variably Saturated Flow, Thermal Transport, Geo-mechanics, Reactive Transport.\n ",

            "abstract": "The debate about how speleothem δ13C to reflect paleoclimate and paleovegetation changes calls for understanding of δ13C behavior in a cave system. We have conducted a monitoring study in Furong Cave, Chongqing, China since 2005 involving multiple sites in the overlying soil and inside the cave. The measured proxies include pCO2 of the atmosphere, soil and cave air; dripping rate, pH, electronic conductivity, Ca2+, HCO3-, d13CDIC of the dripwaters; and deposition rate, d13C of seasonally selected carbonate deposits. The many observations from this study are: (1) Soil pCO2 is close to the atmospheric pCO2 in winter and reaches >10000 ppm during the summer due to high productivity under warm and wet climates. (2) The pCO2 in cave air is slightly higher than Soil pCO2 and atmospheric pCO2 in winter (400~900 ppm), but elevates up to ~2000 ppm around October due to seepage of soil CO2 into the cave. The cave air pCO2 exhibits double peaks following the seasonal rainfall (1st peak in April-June controlled by Indian monsoon and 2nd peak in July-September influenced by the North Western Pacific monsoon). The cave air pCO2 has about 2-3 month lag to the soil pCO2. (3) Under the influence of soil CO2 and rainfall, the d13CDIC of drpiwaters are depleted in the summer and enriched during the winter. During 2009-2011, southwestern China experienced extremely drought due to summer monsoon failure. The d13CDIC of dripwater in Furong Cave was strongly enriched because of low soil CO2 productivity, less transportation of soil CO2 into the cave, and high CO2 ratio from bedrock input. Dripping rate does not affect the d13CDIC significantly. (4) The d13C of speleothems is controlled by the open/closed system of the seepage pathway on the first order. Monitoring site MP1 owns a relatively open system shown by fast dripping rates, low Ca and HCO3- contents, and low carbonate deposition rate. The d13C of modern deposits from this site not only shows the seasonal variation following that of soil pCO2 with heavier values in the winter and lighter values in the summer, but also heavier than these in the other sites. This open system has more efficiency to exchange CO2 with the atmosphere. Such an exchange will lead to d13C enrichment and D14C close to that of the atmosphere. Sites MP4 and MP5 in Furong Cave have more closed pathway systems, showing opposite to MP1.",

GeoJS has a convenient application programming interface (API) that enables users to harness the fast performance of WebGL and Canvas 2D APIs with sophisticated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) features in a consistent and convenient manner. We started the project in response to the need for an open-source JavaScript library that can combine traditional geographic information systems (GIS) and scientific visualization on the web. Many libraries, some of which are open source, support mapping or other GIS capabilities, but lack the features required to visualize scientific and other geospatial datasets. For instance, such libraries are not be capable of rendering climate plots from NetCDF files, and some libraries are limited in regards to geoinformatics (infovis in a geospatial environment). While libraries such as d3.js are extremely powerful for these kinds of plots, in order to integrate them into other GIS libraries, the construction of geoinformatics visualizations must be completed manually and separately, or the code must somehow be mixed in an unintuitive way.\nWe developed GeoJS with the following motivations:\n• To create an open-source geovisualization and GIS library that combines scientific visualization with GIS and informatics\n• To develop an extensible library that can combine data from multiple sources and render them using multiple backends\n• To build a library that works well with existing scientific visualizations tools such as VTK\nWe have successfully deployed GeoJS-based applications for multiple domains across various projects. The ClimatePipes project funded by the Department of Energy, for example, used GeoJS to visualize NetCDF datasets from climate data archives. Other projects built visualizations using GeoJS for interactively exploring data and analysis regarding 1) the human trafficking domain, 2) New York City taxi drop-offs and pick-ups, and 3) the Ebola outbreak. GeoJS supports advanced visualization features such as picking and selecting, as well as clustering. It also supports 2D contour plots, vector plots, heat maps, and geospatial graphs.",

The shape distributions of some boulders on asteroid Eros, the small- and fast-rotating asteroids (diameter < 200 m and rotation period < 1 h), and asteroids in young families, are similar to those of laboratory fragments in catastrophic disruption. However, the shapes of laboratory fragments were obtained from the experiments that　resulted in catastrophic disruption, a process that is different from impact cratering. In order to systematically investigate the shapes of fragments in the range from impact cratering to catastrophic disruption, impact experiments for basalt targets 5 to 15 cm in size were performed. A total of 28 impact experiments were carried out by a spherical nylon projectile (diameter 7.14 mm) perpendicularly into the target surface at velocities of 1.6 to 7.0 km/s. More than 13,000 fragments with b ≥ 4 mm generated in the impact experiments were measured. In the experiments, the mean value of c/a in each impact decreases with decreasing impact energy per unit target mass. For instance, the mean value of c/a in an impact cratering event is nearly 0.2, which is less than that c/a in a catastrophic disruption (~0.5). To apply the experimental results to real collisions on asteroids, we investigated the shapes of 21 arbitrarily selected boulders (> 8 m) on asteroid Itokawa. The mean value of c/a of these boulders is 0.46, which is similar to the value for catastrophic disruption. This implies that the parent body of Itokawa could have experienced a catastrophic disruption.",

The CO2-flooding experiments revealed that once CO2 is injected into a storage formation, the vertical migration of CO2 is driven by combination of pressure gradient and buoyancy force. The buoyancy force was significant in our experimental conditions. The dimensionless CO2 migration rate at vertical core setting was 36% greater than that in horizontal setting under the terrestrial condition. Experiments under both reservoir conditions showed that the injected CO2 tended to find preferential flow path (low capillary entry pressure and high-k path) and bypass the unfavorable pathways leaving the low CO2 saturation in the low-k layers. The liquid CO2 intruded the low-k layers more than supercritical CO2. Multiphase flow simulations have shown that the presence of low-k layers plays a role in CO2 storage capacity though flow perpendicular to low-k layers will deteriorate the injectivity. The CO2 saturation increased logarithmically with the corresponding increase in permeability modification coefficient while it decreased with capillary entry pressure. The scaled CO2 flux showed the effect of heterogeneity was greater with high gravity number (Ngr) and decreased with small Ngr as the viscous force increased. The heterogeneity of the medium as well as Ngr caused the spatial variation of pressure, CO2 saturation and CO2 flux.",

            "abstract": "A number of exoplanets have been described as “Earth-like” planets (or even exo-earths) based on the mass-radius relations. Yet, significant variations have been documented in elemental abundances of planet-hosting stars, which will result in very different structures and processes in the interiors of rocky exoplanets. Recent data suggest that the Mg/Si ratio can be as small as less than 1 and as large as more than 2, opening the possibilities for the upper mantles to be dominated by pyroxene and olivine, respectively, and the lower mantles to be dominated by bridgmanite and ferropericlase, respectively. The changes in mineralogy will alter key properties, such as discontinuity structures (and therefore scale of mantle mixing), viscosity, and volatiles storage, of the mantle. Partial melting of such mantles would result in different compositions of the crusts, affecting the tectonics. However, the prediction should be made carefully because oxygen fugacity and contents of volatiles can change the mineralogy even for the same bulk composition. In extremely reducing proto-planetary disks, carbides will form instead of oxides and silicates, and become main constituents of planets in the system. Because carbides have high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansivity, internal heat transport of such planets may be dominated by conduction and mantle mixing would be much more limited than that of the Earth. However, the behaviors and properties of carbides need to be understood better at high pressure and high temperature. Some rocky exoplanets may have very thick layers of water and other icy materials. Interactions between ice (or fluid) and rock at extreme conditions would be the key to understand dynamics and habitability of such exoplanets.",

The latest IPCC AR5 WGI reports that there are many impact assessments of large scale changes in coastal and ocean environments but few studies on regional scale changes. We analyzed global and regional near-sea surface physical changes based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data. The downscaling of regional ocean targeting the semi-enclosed Seto-Inland Sea of Japan by Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) considering the results of CMIP5. We analyzed the future projection of thermal environmental changes of the Seto-Inland Sea based on the downscaling results.\nRegional analysis of CMIP5\nAnalysis of CMIP5 was conducted for the historical climate and future climate at the end of 21st century considering two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All available 61 GCMs in CMIP5 were considered for analysis and the future changes of 11 atmospheric and oceanic variables were computed in detail. Spatial distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) showed a consistent increase overall, with local non-homogeneity. For example, an increase SST more than 4 degrees in the Northwest Pacific against to global mean SST increase of 2.6 degrees.\nThe projection of the Seto-Inland Sea environment\nDynamical downscaling for Seto-Inland Sea was calculated for the year 2093 forcing future changes from CMIP5 analysis results to project future regional environmental changes in West-Japan. The results of hindcast were compared with observed results and future climate conditions were added to hindcast results. The SST shows a remarkable increase of about 3.6 degrees in the summer but it is less in the future winter. The major change of water temperature change is increasing trend in upper 20m layer, and thermal e-folding depth in the future climate becomes shallower. The warming tendency decreases with depth in shallow water region but is different in deep water.\nConclusions\nCMIP5 analysis projected an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of SST future change. Using ROMS with forcing from CMIP5 analysis, we project an SST increase of 3.6 degrees in the summer.

            "abstract": "Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula is, along with lakes Baikal and Elgygytgyn in Russia and Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana, one of the very few lakes in the world that provides a continuous and high resolution record of environmental change of >1 Ma. With >300 endemic taxa, Lake Ohrid has the fourth highest degree of endemism in the world, being exceeded only by lakes Baikal, Tanganyika and Malawi. The combination of its long existence and high endemism makes Lake Ohrid a unique target to study the drivers of speciation and endemism. For this purpose, a 569 m long sediment sequence was recovered from the central part of the lake in spring 2013 within the scope of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) and the Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid (SCOPSCO) project.\nHere, we present the results to date of analysis of the upper 248 m of this sequence, which covers the last ca. 640 ka according to an age model based on tephrostratigraphy as well as tuning of in situ physical and biogeochemical proxy data to orbital parameters and to the global benthic isotope stack. The sedimentological, physical, and geochemical data from the sediment sequence indicate changes in primary productivity, water column stratification, and water depth of the lake, and in weathering and erosion processes in the catchment. These changes can be clearly correlated with the intensity of glacial and interglacial periods as well as stadials and interstadials. However, paleontological and molecular clock analyses indicate that these changes and also the tephra deposition from eruptions of Italian volcanoes apparently did not lead to significant extinction events in the endemic species community. The lack of such catastrophic extinction events is probably due to the buffering capacity of the deep lake, possibly enhanced by the continuous existence of subaquatic karst springs with relatively stable habitats in the surroundings. This would enable the survival of species over time and the unusual stability of Lake Ohrid is regarded as one of the main drivers for the high endemism in the lake.",

            "abstract": "Methane is an important atmospheric pollutant that contributes to global warming and tropospheric ozone production. Methane mitigation could reduce near term climate change and improve air quality, but is hindered by a lack of knowledge of anthropogenic methane sources. Recent work has shown that methane emissions are not evenly distributed in space, or across emission sources, suggesting that a large fraction of anthropogenic methane comes from a few “super-emitters.” We studied the distribution of super-emitters in California’s southern San Joaquin Valley, where elevated levels of atmospheric CH4 have also been observed from space. Here, we define super-emitters as methane plumes that could be reliably detected (i.e., plume observed more than once in the same location) under varying wind conditions by airborne thermal infrared remote sensing. The detection limit for this technique was determined to be 4.5 kg CH4 h-1 by a controlled release experiment, corresponding to column methane enhancement at the point of emissions greater than 20% above local background levels. We surveyed a major oil production field, and an area with a high concentration of large dairies using a variety of airborne and ground-based measurements. Repeated airborne surveys (n=4) with the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer revealed 28 persistent methane plumes emanating from oil field infrastructure, including tanks, wells, and processing facilities. The likelihood that a given source type was a super-emitter varied from roughly 1/3 for processing facilities to 1/3000 for oil wells. 11 persistent plumes were detected in the dairy area, and all were associated with wet manure management. The majority (11/14) of manure lagoons in the study area were super-emitters. Comparing to a California methane emissions inventory for the surveyed areas, we estimate that super-emitters comprise a minimum of 9% of inventoried dairy emissions, and 13% of inventoried oil emissions in this region.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is warming streams across the western U.S. and threatens billions of dollars of investments made to conserve valuable cold-water species like trout and salmon. Efficient threat response requires prioritization of limited conservation resources and coordinated interagency efforts guided by accurate information about climate at scales relevant to the distributions of species across landscapes. To provide that information, the NorWeST project was initiated in 2011 to aggregate stream temperature data from all available sources and create high-resolution climate scenarios. The database has since grown into the largest of its kind globally, and now consists of >60,000,000 hourly temperature recordings at >20,000 unique stream sites that were contributed by 100s of professionals working for >95 state, federal, tribal, municipal, county, and private resource agencies. This poster shows a high-resolution (1-kilometer) summer temperature scenario created with these data and mapped to 800,000 kilometers of network across eight western states (ID, WA, OR, MT, WY, UT, NV, CA). The geospatial data associated with this climate scenario and thirty others developed in this project are distributed in user-friendly digital formats through the NorWeST website (\nhttp://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.shtml\n). The accuracy, utility, and convenience of NorWeST data products has led to their rapid adoption and use by the management and research communities for conservation planning, inter-agency coordination of monitoring networks, and new research on stream temperatures and thermal ecology. A project of this scope and utility was possible only through crowd-sourcing techniques, which have also served to engage data contributors in the process of science creation while strengthening the social networks needed for effective conservation.",

            "abstract": "We assess the influence of storage dynamics and non-linearities in hydrological connectivity on runoff generation and stream water ages, using a long-term record of daily isotopes in precipitation and stream flow. These were used to test a parsimonious tracer-aided runoff model for a Scottish catchment. The model tracks tracers and the ages of water fluxes through and between conceptual stores representing steeper hillslopes, dynamically saturated riparian peatlands and deeper groundwater (i.e. the main landscape units involved in runoff generation). Storage is largest in groundwater and on the steep hillslopes, though most dynamic mixing occurs in smaller stores in the riparian peat. The model also couples the ecohydrological effects of different vegetation communities in contrasting landscape units, by estimating evaporation, resulting moisture deficits and the ages of evaporated waters, which also affect the generation and age of runoff. Both stream flow and isotope variations are well-captured by the model, and the simulated storage and tracer dynamics in the main landscape units are consistent with independent measurements. The model predicts the mean age of runoff as ~1.8 years. On a daily basis, this varies from ~1 month in storm events, when younger waters draining the riparian peatland dominate, to around 4 years in dry periods, when groundwater sustains flow. Hydrological connectivity between the units varies non-linearly with storage which depends upon antecedent conditions and event characteristics. This, in turn, determines the spatial distribution of flow paths and the integration of their contrasting non-stationary ages. Improving the representation of storage dynamics and quantifying the ages of water fluxes in such models gives a more complete conceptualisation of the importance of the soil water fluxes in critical zone processes and a framework for tracking diffuse pollutants in water quality assessment.",

            "abstract": "Ambient aerosol particles can take up water and thus change their optical properties depending on the hygroscopicity and the relative humidity (RH) of the surrounding air. Knowledge of the hygroscopicity effect is of importance for radiative forcing calculations but is also needed for the comparison or validation of remote sensing or model results with in situ measurements. Specifically, the particle light scattering depends on RH and can be described by the scattering enhancement factor f(RH), which is defined as the particle light scattering coefficient at defined RH divided by its dry value.\nHere, we will present insights from measurements of f(RH) across Europe (Zieger et al., 2013) and will demonstrate why the coarse mode is important when modeling or predicting f(RH) from auxiliary aerosol in-situ measurements. We will show the implications by presenting the results of a recently performed columnar optical closure study (Zieger et al., 2015). This study linked ground-based in-situ measurements (with the help of airborne aerosol size distribution measurements) to columnar aerosol optical properties derived by a co-located AERONET sun photometer. The in situ derived aerosol optical depths (AOD) were clearly correlated with the directly measured values of the AERONET sun photometer but were substantially lower compared to the directly measured values (factor of ∼ 2–3). Differences became greater for longer wavelengths. The disagreement between in situ derived and directly measured AOD was hypothesized to originate from losses of coarse and fine mode particles through dry deposition within the forest’s canopy and losses in the in situ sampling lines. In addition, elevated aerosol layers from long-range transport were observed for parts of the campaign which could have explained some of the disagreement.\nZieger, P., Fierz-Schmidhauser, R., Weingartner, E., and Baltensperger, U.: Effects of relative humidity on aerosol light scattering: results from different European sites, Atmos.

            "abstract": "Being the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere, Titan possesses an ionosphere that acts as a conducting obstacle to the incoming plasma from Saturn's magnetosphere. This creates a mass-loading of the magnetic field lines with freshly picked up ions from Titan's atmosphere on a process similar to that observed in comets (e.g. Coates et al. (1993), Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 98, No. A12, 20985-20994) and other moons like Jupiter's Io (e.g. Russell et al. (2003), Planetary and Space Science, Vol. 51, 233-238). However, while at other celestial bodies ion cyclotron waves arise as one of the main signatures of this process, this is not the case at Titan, with e.g. Cowee et al. (2010) (Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 115, A10224) attributing this to the local orientation of the magnetic field and the plasma flow preventing the waves to grow to levels detectable by the instruments on-board Cassini.\nFor the reason above, the detection of pickup ions signatures needs to be approached through other methods. For this study, we analyze data from the CAPS/IMS instrument on-board Cassini. IMS is an ion mass spectrometer capable of detecting ion fluxes with energies from 1 eV to 50 keV with an atomic resolution of M/ΔM ~ 70. During many of the dedicated Titan flybys by Cassini, IMS was able to distinguish between ions of magnetospheric origin and of ionospheric origin, the latter being freshly picked up ions from Titan's ionosphere. With the help of ion spectrograms and time of flight (TOF) information, we carried out a survey of all the flybys for which IMS has data (the CAPS instrument was switched off after the 83th. dedicated flyby, named in the project as T83) in order to obtain information about the location and frequency of occurence for the signatures.",

Here we apply numerical simulations to assess the potential of gas hydrate dissociation and methane release from the East Siberian slope over the next 100 years. Simulations are based on a hypothesized bottom water warming of 3 °C, and an assumed starting distribution of gas hydrate. The simulation results show that methane hydrate dissociation in these sediments is relatively slow, and that gas fluxes toward the seafloor are limited by low sediment permeability. The latter is true even when sediment fractures are permitted to form through overpressure. With an initial gas hydrate distbution dictated by present-day pressure and temperature conditions, nominally 0.35 gigaton of CH4 are released from the East Siberian slope during the first 100 years of the simulation. However, this methane discharge is reduced significantly (to ~0.05 Gt) if Arctic Ocean history is considered. This is because a lower sea level during the last glacial maximum must result in depleted gas hydrate abundance within the most sensitive region of the modern gas hydrate stability zone. In any case, even if methane reached the atmosphere, amounts coming from East Siberian slopes would be minimal compared to present-day atmospheric methane inputs from other sources.",

            "abstract": "Polar the ice-sheets mass balance largely depends on the flow of ice-streams. Rapid basal motion generally accounts for most of the velocities. In flow models, the conditions at the base of the ice in contact with the bedrock are generally parameterised using a friction law that relates the sliding velocity to the basal shear stress. The most common law has two poorly constrained parameters, the basal slipperiness c and the stress exponent m. The basal slipperiness is expected to depend on local unobservable quantities and is routinely tuned from observed surface velocities using inverse methods. Different values for m are expected depending on the processes, from hard-bed sliding to soft bed deformation, and no consensus has emerged so far for its value that range from 1 to infinity. However, several studies have shown that the transient response of the ice-sheet models to external forcing is highly sensitive to m. Therefore, the uncertainty attached to the friction law is an important limit to our ability to evaluate future dynamical evolution of coastal regions.\nCalibrating m can be done only if either basal stresses and/or velocities have changed significantly while c can be assumed constant in time. Here, we use Elmer/Ice to model the flow of Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Antarctica, sufficiently far upstream of the grounding line so that we can assume no change in c. Observations show an increase of surface velocities by up to 50% between 1996 and 2010, associated with an important dynamical thinning. Using a control inverse method and different values of m, we tune a spatially varying basal slipperiness field that best fit, in the same time, observed surface velocities for years 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. These years correspond to the MeaSUREs project velocity datasets that have the best spatial coverage for our model domain. Surface elevations for the corresponding years are constructed using ERS and Envisat radar altimetry data.\nWe show that the substantial ice flow acceleration shown by the data can be reproduce by the model only for high values of m. We interpret this result as the sign that basal motion in the upstream part of PIG is mostly govern by plastic deformation of the underlying sediments. This means that the bedrock can not deliver higher resistive stresses to compensate increased longitudinal and driving stresses.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2). Its mole fraction has increased from around 722 ppb in pre-industrial times to 1824 ppb in 2013 and the anthropogenic fraction is estimated to be 60 % of the total emissions. A promising approach to improve the understanding of the CH4 budget is the use of isotopologues to distinguish between various CH4 source processes.\nIn the presented study in situ and simultaneous measurement of the three most abundant isotopologues of methane using mid-infrared laser absorption spectroscopy is demonstrated. A field-deployable, autonomous platform is realized by coupling a compact quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCLAS) to a preconcentration unit, called TRace gas EXtractor (TREX). This unit enhances CH4 mole fractions by a factor of up to 500 above ambient levels and quantitatively separates interfering trace gases such as N2O and CO2. The analytical precision of the QCLAS isotope measurement on the preconcentrated (750 ppm, parts-per-million, mmole/mole) methane is 0.1‰ and 0.5 ‰ for δ13C- and δD-CH4 at 10 min averaging time. [1]\nBased on replicate measurements of compressed air during a two-week intercomparison campaign, the repeatability of the TREX-QCLAS was determined to be 0.19 ‰ and 1.9 ‰ for δ13C and δD-CH4, respectively. In this intercomparison campaign the new in situ technique is compared to IRMS based on glass flask and bag sampling and real time CH4 isotope analysis by two commercially available laser spectrometers (Figure). Both laser-based analyzers were limited to methane mole fraction and δ13C-CH4 analysis, and only one of them, a cavity ring down spectrometer, was capable to deliver meaningful data for the isotopic composition. After correcting for scale offsets, the average difference between TREX–QCLAS data and bag/flask sampling–IRMS values are within the extended WMO compatibility goals of 0.2 and 5 ‰ for δ13C- and δD-CH4, respectively. Thus, the intercomparison also reveals the need for reference air samples with accurately determined isotopic composition of CH4 to further improve the interlaboratory compatibility. [1]\n",

            "abstract": "Direct sampling is an efficient and effective method for studying the local neutral interstellar matter. With first measurements performed in the 1990s by GAS experiment onboard Ulysses, followed by IBEX observations since 2009, we have now a ~20 year long coverage. These observations provide a unique sample of interstellar matter from a spatial region with the dimensions close to the mean free path for atom-ion and atom-atom collisions in the local interstellar medium. Recent analyses of available GAS and IBEX data have resulted in a consolidation of the flow velocity vector and gas temperature of ISN He ahead of the heliosphere. The present GAS and IBEX velocity vectors are in agreement with the determination based on the first two Ulysses ISN observation seasons, but the temperature is markedly higher, by at least 1000 K, than the original determination. In addition, IBEX observations revealed the existence of an additional population of neutral He, dubbed the Warm Breeze, which is likely the secondary population of He produced in the outer heliosheath. We will briefly present the analysis of GAS observations from all three Ulysses orbits and focus on a detailed analysis of IBEX observations from the first six ISN He observation seasons. The velocity vector and temperature obtained from individual IBEX observation seasons vary around the global best-fit values, which is most likely due to statistical fluctuations in the data. An important aspect of the ISN gas studies is the Warm Breeze, which partly overlaps with the ISN population on the sky. Therefore it must be studied in parallel with the ISN gas. Observations of ISN He could provide insight into various hypothetical departures of ISN He from the ideal Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, but a significant portion of the sky most interesting in this respect is blocked by the local magnetospheric signal, which will not interfere with the observations planned for the IMAP mission.",

            "abstract": "In order to support decision makers in solving hydrological problems, detailed high-resolution models are often needed. These models typically consist of a large number of computational cells and have large memory requirements and long run times.\nAn efficient technique for obtaining realistic run times and memory requirements is parallel computing, where the problem is divided over multiple processor cores. The new Parallel Krylov Solver (PKS) for MODFLOW-USG is presented. It combines both distributed memory parallelization by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and shared memory parallelization by Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). PKS includes conjugate gradient and biconjugate gradient stabilized linear accelerators that are both preconditioned by an overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner in a way that: a) subdomains are partitioned using the METIS library; b) each subdomain uses local memory only and communicates with other subdomains by MPI within the linear accelerator; c) is fully integrated in the MODFLOW-USG code. PKS is based on the unstructured PCGU-solver, and supports OpenMP. Depending on the available hardware, PKS can run exclusively with MPI, exclusively with OpenMP, or with a hybrid MPI/OpenMP approach.\nBenchmarks were performed on the Cartesius Dutch supercomputer (https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) using up to 144 cores, for a synthetic test (~112 million cells) and the Indonesia groundwater model (~4 million 1km cells). The latter, which includes all islands in the Indonesian archipelago, was built using publically available global datasets, and is an ideal test bed for evaluating the applicability of PKS parallelization techniques to a global groundwater model consisting of multiple continents and islands. Results show that run time reductions can be greatest with the hybrid parallelization approach for the problems tested.",

            "abstract": "About half Greenland’s mass loss results from iceberg calving, but the physical mechanisms of calving are poorly known and in situobservations are sparse. Glacial earthquakes, globally detectable seismic events, are associated with calving and are occurring at increasing numbers of outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. However, the processes causing them have not been clear.\nWe installed a wireless network of on-ice GPS sensors at the calving margin of Helheim Glacier for 55 days during summer 2013. The glacier is a major SE Greenland tidewater outlet and during our observations retreated ~1.5 km in a series of calving events. Our GPS sensors captured glacier motion with cm-level accuracy at locations very close to the calving front with a high temporal sampling rate. Calving causes a minutes-long reversal of the glacier’s horizontal flow and a downward deflection of its terminus seen on multiple GPS sensors. Each major calving event is associated with a glacial earthquake.\nFor example, a glacial earthquake / calving event on day 206 produced an iceberg of volume 0.36 km3and aspect ratio 0.23. A GPS sensor close to the front showed a pre-earthquake speed of 29 m/day. Immediately prior to the earthquake centroid time, the sensor reversed its direction and moved upglacier at ~40 m/day and downward 10 cm. The reversed motion was sustained for ~200 s and was followed by downglacier rebound and upward movement.\nThe reverse motion of the glacier results from the horizontal force caused by iceberg capsize and acceleration away from the front. We use analog laboratory experiments to demonstrate that the downward motion results from hydrodynamic pressure drop behind the capsizing berg, which also causes an upward force on the solid Earth. We show that these horizontal and vertical forces are the source of glacial earthquakes. Proper interpretation of the earthquake events should allow remote sensing of calving processes at the margins of Greenland and Antarctic glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms governing water flow and evaporation in unsaturated layered soils are relevant to study hillslope dynamics and to design landfill covers. The latter are often based on capillary barrier effects to reduce vertical flow and enhance lateral flow. Vapor fluxes can become especially relevant for water redistribution in arid regions where liquid water fluxes are small. This work presents the results of a study of liquid and vapor fluxes in layered slopes. Two pilot covers were built including a capillary barrier. We analyzed their performance for two years by means of a thorough monitoring system. Lateral water flow confirmed the capillary barrier effectiveness in reducing vertical flow depending on the granulometry of the underlying layer and highlighted the importance of the slope to enhance lateral drainage. The detailed study of the daily and annual variations of vapor fluxes shows that there is a relevant vapor flux and contrary to intuition: downwards during the summer and upwards during the winter, with a downward net annual vapor flux. Finally, how rainfall events can be the cause of the vapor fluxes reversing is discussed and an analytical solution to calculate diffusive vapor fluxes at any depth is presented and compared with field data.",

            "abstract": "Noise-based seismology is proving to be a complementary approach to active source or earthquake-based methods for imaging and monitoring the Earth’s interior and in particular volcanoes and active faults. Until recently, noise-based imaging and monitoring relied only on the inversion of surface waves reconstructed from correlations of mostly microseismic seismic noise. Compared to body-wave tomography, surface wave tomography succeeds in retrieving lateral sub-surface velocity contrasts but is less efficient in resolving velocity perturbations at depth. Moreover reflected body-waves can carry direct information about sharp interfaces at depth. Extracting body-waves from noise correlations is challenging and the use of Large-N seismic arrays proves to be of great benefit for extracting noisy body-waves from noise-correlations by stacking over a large number of receiver pairs and by applying array processing.\nThe purpose of VolcArray Large-N seismic experiment on Piton de la Fournaise Volcano is to extract body-waves travelling directly through the active magma reservoir located at ~2.5 km depth below the summit crater using noise correlations between arrays of seismic nodes. By beamforming noise on individual arrays, we found an unusual strong directional source of body-wave noise. This is thus a favorable context for retrieving the body-wave component of the Green’s function between arrays. However, standard correlation techniques between nodes do not allow deciphering between the reconstructed Green’s function and artifacts from the correlation of the strong directional source of body-waves. By applying double beamforming to the noise correlations between arrays, we are able to isolate ballistic body-waves travelling across the magma storage zone at depth. The stability of these reconstructed waves over time is encouraging in the perspectives of high resolution monitoring of the volcano feeding system.",

In nature, this translates to changes in sealevel and/or ocean water temperature fluctuations. When hydrates outcrop the seafloor, however, they could also be sensitive to physical disturbances, such as earthquakes, and microbial processes (such as sulfate reduction and/or methane oxidation), both of which could lead to their dissolution. To address these factors controlling hydrate stability, we will present in situ methane, sulfate, and chloride concentrations over time, in pore-waters of shallow sediments near gas hydrates in seep systems. Datasets presented will include one 4-month time series from the Northern Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi Canyon 118, and two 9-month records from offshore Vancouver Island, Barkley Canyon and Bubbly Gulch at Bullseye Vent. We will address the following questions: Does regional scale oceanography affect methane flux from the hydrate-containing sediments, are microbial processes playing a role in hydrate stability, and what are in situ hydrate dissolution rates? We will also discuss challenges faced with collecting such data, and ways to move forward. We will show that in some systems, methane is nearly saturated within a few cm of the overlying water, thus stabilizing the hydrate. Yet in other systems, methane is undersaturated with respect to methane hydrate which suggests hydrates will dissolve. We will also present laboratory rates of hydrate dissolution to compare to those gained from the field.",

            "abstract": "Economic welfare under enhanced anthropogenic carbon emissions and associated future warming poses a major challenge for a society with an evolving globally connected economy. Unabated climate change will impact economic output for example through heat-stress-related reductions in productivity. Since meteorologically-induced production reductions can propagate along supply chains, structural changes in the economic network may influence climate-related losses. The role of the economic network evolution for climate impacts has been neither quantified nor qualitatively understood. Here we show that since the beginning of the 21st century the structural change of the global supply network has been such that an increase of spillover losses due to unanticipated climatic events has to be expected. We quantify primary, secondary and higher-order losses from reduced labor productivity under past and present economic and climatic conditions and find that indirect losses are significant and increase with rising temperatures. The connectivity of the economic network has increased in such a way as to foster the propagation of production loss. This supply chain connectivity robustly exhibits the characteristic distribution of self-organized criticality which has been shifted towards higher values since 2001. Losses due to this structural evolution dominated over the effect of comparably weak climatic changes during this decade. Our finding suggests that the current form of globalization may amplify losses due to climatic extremes and thus necessitate structural adaptation that requires more foresight than presently prevalent.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff modeling is a basic tool for assessing hydrological processes where natural features (geology and geography) play a pivotal role. Due to global warming, the trends of torrential rainfall and typhoon events have been found to increase spontaneously in Jeju Island of Korea. As such, the island has been shown distinctive hydrologic characteristics. The study therefore, attempts to analyze the diversified rainfall-runoff characteristics of Jeju Island during extreme hydrologic events. The study domain covers mostly the urban areas of island and the most prominent Hancheon Stream which restrains most of its overland runoff during rainfall. For watershed delineation, 30-m resolution’s digital elevation model (DEM) generated from contours and 50 years’ (1964-2013) historical rainfall data from the Korea meteorological administration (KMA) were used. Furthermore, geo-spatial data collected from the Korean society of agriculture engineers (KSAE) has been used for soil texture and land use classification. Some identical studies implied to predict semi-distributed (e.g. SWAT and WMS) watershed model runoff in the island. However, the significance of this study is that it considers a GIS semi-distributed model to imply NRCS curve number technique and predict accurate results for unique runoff characteristics, by considering high catchment slope. Rainfall data from 2009 to 2013 has been used as baseline information to estimate annual runoff variations, which has been used in the spatial and statistical analyses. The study infers that the simulated runoff percentages varied from 18% to 44%, accounting for the temporal fluctuations of rainfall.  Afterwards, to assess the ten year interval relationship between rainfall-runoff, the study uses historical rainfall data of Jeju-si meteorological station and four rainfall station. Lastly, the ongoing rainfall-runoff analysis will be concluded by comparing the runoff result with SWAT model result.\nKeywords: NRCS curve number, Semi-distributed model, GIS, Jeju Island",

            "abstract": "Equatorial noise (EN) emissions are electromagnetic waves at frequencies between the proton cyclotron frequency and the lower hybrid frequency routinely observed in the equatorial region of the inner magnetosphere. They propagate in the extraordinary mode nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, and they exhibit a harmonic structure related to the ion cyclotron frequency in the source region. We analyze more than 2000 EN events observed by the wave instruments on board the Cluster spacecraft, and we find that about 5% of EN events are not continuous in time, but exhibit a quasi-periodic (QP) modulation of the wave intensity. Typical modulation periods are on the order of minutes. The events predominantly occur in the noon-to-dawn local time sector, and their occurrence is related to the periods of increased geomagnetic activity and higher solar wind speeds. We suggest that the QP modulation of EN events may be due to compressional ULF pulsations, which periodically modulate the wave growth in the source region. These compressional ULF pulsations were identified in about half of the events. Finally, we demonstrate that EN emissions with QP modulation of the wave intensity can propagate down to altitudes as low as 700 km.",

            "abstract": "Granular media are amorphous materials, which differs from traditional solid or liquid. In different circumstance, granular behavior varies from solid-like to liquid-like, and the transitions between these regimes are always related to many complex natural progresses such as the failure of soil foundation and the occurrence of landslide and debris flow. The mechanic of elastic instability during the transition from solid-like to liquid-like regime, and the quantitative description of irreversible deformation during flow are the key problems to interpret these transition phenomena. In this work, we developed a continuum model with elastic stable condition and irreversible flow rule of granular material based on a thermal dynamical model, the Two-Granular-Temperature model (TGT). Since infinitesimal elastic deformation in solid-like regime and significant plastic large deformation in liquid-like regime can coexist in the granular solid-liquid transition process, the material point method (MPM) was used to build an effective numerical model. Collapse of rectangular granular pile contains both the transition from granular solid to granular liquid and the inverse process, thus in this work we carried out collapse experiment with clay particles, and simulated the experiment with our continuum model and an open-source DEM model YADE to study the transition processes. Results between experiment and simulations were compared and good agreements on collapse shape and velocity profiles were achieved, and the new model proposed in this work seems to work well on the description of granular solid-liquid transition.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing global warming may cause an increasing supply of permafrost-derived organic carbon through both river discharge and coastal erosion to the Arctic shelves where it can be either degraded to CO2 and outgassed, buried in sediments or transported to the deep sea. Here we assess the balance between burial and lateral transport on the fate of terrestrial organic carbon (TerrOC) by exploring how it changes in concentration, composition and degradation status during both cross-shelf transport and burial. We analyzed a suite of terrestrial biomarkers as well as source-diagnostic bulk carbon isotopes (δ13C, Δ14C) in sediments from the wide Siberian Arctic Shelf and found contrasting trends for the operationally-defined carbon pools.\nTerrOC concentrations and degradation status vary noticeably more during cross-shelf transport than after burial. The concentrations of lignin phenols, cutin acids and high-molecular weight (HMW) wax lipids (tracers of vascular plants) do not display clear changes over time during sediment accumulation, while they significantly decrease along the transect. Molecular-based degradation proxies for TerrOC (e.g., CPI of HMW lipids, the HMW acids/alkanes ratio and the acid/aldehyde ratio of lignin phenols) do not suggest extensive down-core mineralization, but there appears to be a trend to more degraded TerrOC with increasing distance from the coast. We infer that the degree of degradation of permafrost-derived TerrOC is a function of the time spent under oxic conditions (oxygen exposure time, OET). Specifically, one possible explanation for these patterns could be protracted OETs during cross-shelf transport compared to rather short in situ OETs after burial. To test this hypothesis we estimate lateral transport times using compound-specific radiocarbon analysis for terrestrial OC biomarkers (HMW fatty acids) and compare these with in situ OETs calculated from measured oxygen penetration depths and 210Pb-derived sedimentation rates.",

            "abstract": "The presence of light elements alloyed to iron in the Earth’s core is well established, and many studies point at silicon as the major light element in the inner core. However, attempts to constrain Si abundance on the basis of comparison of measured velocities in Fe-Si alloys at high pressure with seismic observations do not provide a unique answer. Available data obtained in the 40-100 GPa range are indeed limited in number and, more importantly, in open disagreement.\nHere we present new data on pure Fe and on Fe-Si alloys in the hcp structure at pressure exceeding 100 GPa, obtained by inelastic x-ray scattering and by picosecond acoustic measurements. The comparison of measurements by these complementary techniques provides reliable relations for the pressure and density evolution of the compressional sound velocity of the investigated alloys. These results are compared to results in literature and allow us to model the effect of Si content on the velocity-density relationship in the Fe-FeSi system and to constrain the Si abundance in the Earth’s inner core.",

            "abstract": "This study evaluates the relative contributions to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode of interannual variability from the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing and ocean-atmosphere feedbacks internal to the Indian Ocean. The ENSO forcing and internal variability is extracted by conducting a 10-member coupled simulation for 1950-2012 where sea surface temperature (SST) is restored to the observed anomalies over the tropical Pacific but interactive with the atmosphere over the rest of the world ocean. In these experiments, the ensemble mean is due to ENSO forcing and the inter-member difference arises from internal variability of the climate system independent of ENSO. These elements contribute one third and two thirds of the total IOD variance, respectively. Both types of IOD variability develop into an east-west dipole pattern due to Bjerknes feedback and peak in September-November. The ENSO forced and internal IOD modes differ in several important ways. The forced IOD mode develops in August with a broad meridional pattern, and eventually evolves into the Indian Ocean Basin mode; while the internal IOD mode grows earlier in June, is more confined to the equator and decays rapidly after October. The internal IOD mode is more skewed than the ENSO forced response. The destructive interference of ENSO forcing and internal variability can explain early-terminating IOD events, referred to IOD-like perturbations that fail to grow during boreal summer. Our results have implications for predictability. Internal variability, as represented by pre-season sea surface height anomalies off Sumatra, contributes to predictability considerably. Including this indicator of internal variability, together with ENSO, improves the predictability of IOD.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the processes behind magma flow structures and complex sheeted zones within otherwise near-homogeneous shallow plutons is fundamental in order to understand the mechanisms of melt transport, magma differentiation, crustal recycling and growth of mid-upper crustal plutons. The Cretaceous gabbro-diorite pluton of Fisher Lake, Northern Sierra Nevada (USA), contains multiple m-sized orbicule and magma-breccia bodies as well as orbicule- and comb layer-bearing dikes. Olivine-bearing norites, hornblende diorites and gabbros which have crystallized at low pressure (2kbar) from hydrous basaltic-andesite melts form texturally diverse orbicule cores which act as nuclei for comb layers. Rising hydrous mafic melts remobilizing low pressure cumulates and/or crystal mushes are injected at the contact between cooling plutons prior to the initiation of comb layer growth. Multiple generations of melt injections are attested by the presence of magma-breccia bodies which incorporate fractured, disaggregated fragments of pre-existing orbicule and comb layer bodies. The cumulate signature of the orbicule-bearing matrix indicates that interstitial melt was extracted towards shallower depth. Though orbicule and comb layer bodies have been variously ascribed to melt migration within cooling plutons, magma mixing or fluid flow, we propose an alternative interpretation where these m-scale features represent localized subvertical channels formed during the extraction of multiple batches of hydrous melts within a volcanic plumbing system or shallow plutonic feeder zone. These features thus preserve unique evidence of upper-crustal melt migration processes during the transfer of hydrous mafic melts towards shallower depth. Geochemical gradients between decompressing liquids and crystallizing cumulates are the main driving force for crystallization. We will illustrate examples of this process on the basis of field observations, textural data, whole rock and mineral geochemistry.",

(2009, JGR 114) analyzed surface radiation data spanning 1995 through 2007 from several ARM and six SURFRAD sites across the continental US, and showed an average 8 Wm-2/decade brightening in all-sky downwelling SW. The study also showed a 5 Wm-2/decade increase in the clear-sky downwelling SW, an expected result of decreasing aerosol optical depths during the same time period (Augustine et al., 2008, JGR 113). However, the unexpected result of the Long et al. study is that the 5 Wm-2/decade increase occurred in the diffuse SW, while the direct SW remained virtually unchanged...opposite what is expected for aerosol direct effect due to decreases in aerosols. With detailed radiative transfer modeling and correlation with US FAA commercial flight hours through the same years, Long et al. suggested that while the decreased aerosols did increase the total SW, an increase in high, sub-visual contrail-generated ice haze repartitioned the increase into the diffuse SW component through large-mode particle scattering.\nSubsequent attempts to investigate the veracity of this speculation using long time series of ARM Micropulse and Raman lidars data proved untenable due to instrument limitations and continuity issues. However, similar to using the red/blue ratio of pixel color amounts in processing color sky images to infer clouds, we have used clear-sky diffuse SW irradiance measurements from the Multi-Frequency Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) 870, 500, and 415 nm spectral channels to look at any possible trends suggesting \"whitening\" of the cloud-free skies over the ARM SGP site.

            "abstract": "The permanent activity at Yasur (Vanuatu), characterised by a close series of Strombolian explosions, is analysed using simultaneous infrasonic and seismic recordings (6-25 Nov 2008) close to the vents. The RMS amplitudes per hour, the number of explosions and the peak-to-peak amplitudes of each signal show that the initial quiet phase (11 days) is followed by a precursory phase (7 days) prior to an enhanced activity (17 hours). Three periods exist during the strong activity: (1) a rapid increase leading to the paroxysm (3 hours), (2) a first (5 hours) and (3) a second decrease (9 hours), each having an excellent correlation between seismic and infrasonic RMS amplitudes per hour (correlation coefficient > 0.96) when using the band associated to explosions (1-5 Hz and 1.8-4 Hz for seismic and infrsonic recordings, respectively).\nThe ratio between infrasonic and seismic RMS amplitudes, assumed to be a proxy for the magma level, increases strongly during the week before the paroxysm. This is explained by the arrival of an additional gas flux at the top of the reservoir. The foam accumulated there, whose partial coalescence and spreading towards the conduit are responsible for the permanent Strombolian activity, thickens. This enhances both the viscous massive foam coalescence and the foam spreading. This leads to an increase in the gas flux in the conduit, ultimately responsible for the formation of a shallow foam at the surface. This foam acts as a viscous cap overlying the magma column, thereby increasing the radiated infrasonic pressure and the strength of the explosions. The first decrease in the relationship between infrasonic and seismic RMS amplitudes is associated with the stopping of the additionnal gas flux in the magma reservoir and the rapid decrease of the top of the magma column due to the previous intense degassing. The second decrease corresponds to the time neccessary to restore the convective motions in the conduit at their normal velocities.",

            "abstract": "The feasibility of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) applications has revived the discussion on whether earthquake rupture development follows deterministic principles or not. If it does, it may be possible to predict final earthquake magnitudes while the rupture is still developing. EEW magnitude estimation schemes, most of which are based on 3-4 seconds of near-source p-wave data, have been shown to work well for small to moderate size earthquakes. In this magnitude range, the used time window is larger than the source durations of the events. Whether the magnitude estimation schemes also work for events in which the source duration exceeds the estimation time window, however, remains debated.\nIn our study we have compiled an extensive high-quality data set of near-source seismic recordings. We search for waveform features that could be diagnostic of final event magnitudes in a predictive sense. We find that the onsets of large (M7+) events are statistically indistinguishable from those of medium sized events (M5.5-M7). Significant differences arise only once the medium size events terminate. This observation suggests that EEW relevant magnitude estimates are largely observational, rather than predictive, and that whether a medium size event becomes a large one is not determined at the rupture onset. As a consequence, early magnitude estimates for large events are minimum estimates, a fact that has to be taken into account in EEW alert messaging and response design.",

            "abstract": "Drinking-water well catchments include many potential sources of contaminations like gas stations or agriculture. Finding optimal positions of early-warning monitoring wells is challenging because there are various parameters (and their uncertainties) that influence the reliability and optimality of any suggested monitoring location or monitoring network.\nThe overall goal of this project is to develop and establish a concept to assess, design and optimize early-warning systems within well catchments. Such optimal monitoring networks need to optimize three competing objectives: a high detection probability, which can be reached by maximizing the “field of vision” of the monitoring network, a long early-warning time such that there is enough time left to install counter measures after first detection, and the overall operating costs of the monitoring network, which should ideally be reduced to a minimum. The method is based on numerical simulation of flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media coupled with geostatistics and Monte-Carlo, scenario analyses for real data, respectively, wrapped up within the framework of formal multi-objective optimization using a genetic algorithm.\nIn order to speed up the optimization process and to better explore the Pareto-front, we developed a concept that forces the algorithm to search only in regions of the search space where promising solutions can be expected. We are going to show how to define these regions beforehand, using knowledge of the optimization problem, but also how to define them independently of problem attributes. With that, our method can be used with and/or without detailed knowledge of the objective functions.\nIn summary, our study helps to improve optimization results in less optimization time by meaningful restrictions of the search space. These restrictions can be done independently of the optimization problem, but also in a problem-specific manner.",

This data can be difficult to obtain, and if made available often lacks spatial information and might only be provided in the local language. This makes analyzing forests in Europe difficult. The reporting systems of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the European Forestry Institute (EFI) permit several acquisition and calculation methodologies which lead to difficulties in comparing country level data. We have collected spatially explicit national forest inventory (NFI) data from 13 countries in Europe and harmonized these datasets. Using this data along with remote sensing data products we have derived spatially explicit forest characteristics maps of Europe on a 0.017o resolution representing the time period 2000-2010. We have created maps for every NFI variable in our dataset including carbon stock, forest age, forest height, volume, basal area, etc. Cross-validating this data shows that this method produces accurate results for most variables while variables pertaining to forest cover type have lower accuracy. This data is in line with data from FAO and EFI in most cases. However, our dataset allows us to identify large incongruities quickly in FAO and EFI data. Our spatially explicit data is also accurate at predicting forest characteristics in areas where we have no NFI data. This data set provides a consistent harmonized view of the state of European forests in a way hitherto not possible, giving researchers the ability to analyze forests spatially across the entire continent. This method can also be useful for those researching areas that have little or no NFI data or areas where data acquisition is difficult or impossible. This data can also quickly give policy makers a greater view of how forest management practices have shaped our current European forests.",

During this same period the sea ice has thinned, however the impact of snow depth changes on the overall state of the sea ice pack are relatively uncertain. In this study we use Lagrangian tracking ice type data along with IceBridge and CryoSat sea ice thickness and snow depth data products and surface temperature to examine the changes in the multi-year and first year ice regimes in March between 2009-2015. We will show the regional and annual changes in ice thickness and snow depth on multi-year and first year sea ice (as well as their locations) in the Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea. We will also anlalyze links in snow depth and thickness changes based on AIRS 925 hPa air temperature, 925 hPa geopotential height, precipitable water and Calipso cloud fraction in DJF, and changes in mixed layer temperatures to freeze-up dates. Lastly, we will analyze melt onset differences between multi-year and first- year sea ice to see how snow thickness and ice type play a role.",

            "abstract": "Development of very high-resolution data from polar ice cores over the last decade reveals a rich spectrum of greenhouse gas variability and its relationship to both tropical and subtropical hydroclimate and high-latitude abrupt climate change. The well-known atmospheric methane variations associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events are now strongly linked to enhanced wetland emissions in the northern tropics based on recent work on the interpolar methane gradient. An increase in tropical rainfall associated with ITCZ migration is consistent with these observations. In addition, small, on order 5-10 ppm, changes in carbon dioxide accompany at least some Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Changes in terrestrial carbon storage, possibly in the tropics, are one explanation, but new stable isotope measurements indicate that this cannot be the only source for these events, and suggest that rising sea surface temperature must contribute.\nVery detailed recent data reveal variability during Greenlandic stadial periods that add to the potential links between greenhouse gases and tropical hydroclimate. During the last ice age and deglaciation, small, but rapid increases in atmospheric methane during some “Heinrich Stadials” suggest increases in methane emissions from the southern tropics associated with Heinrich events, possibly due to extreme southerly migration of rainfall belts associated with the ITCZ. Abrupt increases in carbon dioxide occur at precisely the same time as many of these Heinrich Stadial methane events. Stable isotopic data related to two of these abrupt carbon dioxide changes (during HS1 and preliminarily for HS 4) implicate an isotopically depleted source. Rapid release of terrestrial carbon (possibly due to drying in the northern tropics) is a possible explanation, although release of respiratory carbon dioxide from an ocean source (for example, due to increases in southern ocean upwelling) is another plausible alternative, albeit one that requires a fast oceanic mechanism.",

            "abstract": "We explore the sensitivity of surface mass loading displacement response to perturbations in elastic structure, with the goal to refine profiles of elastic moduli and density through the crust and upper mantle. Examples of surface mass loads include tidal and non-tidal ocean loads, atmospheric loads and hydrological loads. Using software developed in-house (LoadDef), we derive sensitivity kernels for Love numbers and load Green’s functions (LGFs) using calculus of variations and finite difference methods. Perturbations to the two elastic moduli and density exhibit unique LGF sensitivity patterns, retaining the possibility that the material parameters may be independently constrained given a spatially distributed set of sufficiently accurate loading response observations. To further elucidate the ability to invert for structure in a particular region, a thorough investigation into model resolution must also be performed. We garner a more palpable sense for the effects of structural variations on the response to surface mass loading by calculating and comparing sets of predicted ocean tidal loading (OTL) displacement responses across a global network of land-based locations, generated from convolutions of an ocean tide model with LGFs derived from a variety of reference Earth models. We find that discrepancies between predictions for the M2 harmonic differ by less than 0.2 mm at over 95% of the locations considered, a value generally exceeded, albeit not substantially, by current observational and forward modeling errors. Although predicted discrepancies can reach 2 mm or more at some coastal locations, errors in the ocean tide models and convolution algorithms are also largest near the coasts. As a case study, we examine the residuals between Global Positioning System (GPS) observations and modeled predictions of OTL response across the South American continent. A comparison of ocean models suggests that a common mode (mean displacement) accounts for a dominant portion of the prediction residuals, perhaps due to larger modeling uncertainties at the polar regions. Removing the network mean reduces the sensitivity to a particular ocean model significantly, except at a few coastal stations. Preliminary examinations of the observational residuals show only limited spatial and inter-harmonic coherency.",

            "abstract": "The impact of evaporation of rainwater on tropical cyclone (TC) intensity and structure is revisited in this study. Evaporative cooling can result in strong downdrafts and produce low–equivalent potential temperature air in the inflow boundary layer, particularly in the region outside the eyewall, significantly suppressing eyewall convection and reducing the final intensity of a TC. Different from earlier findings, results from this study show that outer rainbands still form but are short lived in the absence of evaporation. Evaporation of rainwater is shown to facilitate the formation of outer rainbands indirectly by reducing the cooling due to melting of ice particles outside the inner core, not by the cold-pool dynamics, as previously believed. Only exclusion of evaporation in the eyewall region or the rapid filamentation zone has a very weak effect on the inner-core size change of a TC, whereas how evaporation in the outer core affects the inner-core size depends on how active the inner rainbands are. More (less) active inner rainbands may lead to an increase (a decrease) in the inner-core size.",

Our investigation will a) analyse major drivers of the generation of extremes and b) investigate major responsible modes of variability for the occurrence of extremes. Firstly, we present a systematic analysis of station based observations of the most relevant extreme events (1985-2013) for 5 stations (Gizan, Makkah, Jeddah, Yenbo and Wejh). Secondly, we investigate the responsible mechanism on the synoptic to large-scale leading to the generation of extremes and will analyse factors for the time variability of extreme event occurrence. Extreme events for each station are identified in the wet season (Nov-Jan): 122 events show intensity above the respective 90th percentile. The most extreme events are systematically investigated with respect to the responsible forcing conditions which we can identify as: The influence of the Soudan Low, active Red-Sea-Trough situations established via interactions with mid-latitude tropospheric wave activity, low pressure systems over the Mediterranean, the influence of the North Africa High, the Arabian Anticyclone and the influence of the Indian monsoon trough. We investigate the role of dynamical forcing factors like the STJ and the upper-troposphere geopotential conditions and the relation to smaller local low-pressure systems. By means of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis based on MSLP we investigate the possibility to objectively quantify the influence of existing major variability modes and their role for the generation of extreme precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "Accurately predicting the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to the Earth based on remote images is of critical significance for the study of space weather. Here we make a statistical study of 21 Earth-directed CMEs, specifically exploring the relationship between CME initial speeds and transit times. The initial speed of a CME is obtained by fitting the CME with the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model and is thus free of projection effects. We then use the drag force model to fit results of the transit time versus the initial speed. By adopting different drag regimes, i.e., the viscous, aerodynamics, and hybrid regimes, we get similar results, with a least mean estimation error of the hybrid model of 12.9 hr. CMEs with a propagation angle (the angle between the propagation direction and the Sun–Earth line) larger than their half-angular widths arrive at the Earth with an angular deviation caused by factors other than the radial solar wind drag. The drag force model cannot be reliably applied to such events. If we exclude these events in the sample, the prediction accuracy can be improved, i.e., the estimation error reduces to 6.8 hr. This work suggests that it is viable to predict the arrival time of CMEs to the Earth based on the initial parameters with fairly good accuracy. Thus, it provides a method of forecasting space weather 1–5 days following the occurrence of CMEs.",

            "abstract": "In the tropics, the acquisition of high-resolution geospatial data of high-mountain glacial and periglacial systems presents unique challenges due to remote site access and very high elevations. For glaciers and hydrologic systems, a key variable of interest is surface temperature as it constrains glacier melt rates, traces hydrologic processes, and is needed for the calibration of energy budget models. We present results from two studies that acquired high resolution temperature data from the Cuchillacocha Glacier, Peru (9.24°S, 77.21°W). The glacier resides on the western drainage of the Cordillera Blanca with an elevation range of 4700 to 6096 m. In the first study we use high resolution time-lapse infrared imagery (5-10 minute interval over 3 days; 0.6 m2 pixel size) to observe diel changes in the surface energy budget of the glacier and to demonstrate how radiation from bare rock adjacent to the glacier may affect melt rates. In the second study we use a newly developed, inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for high resolution multispectral mapping of the glacier (2 cm resolution orthomosaic and 5 cm resolution DEM). We present results showing how the time-lapse and the high-resolution UAV imagery can be combined to further strengthen our understanding of the Cuchillacocha Glacier’s energy budget and possible insights about turbulent heat fluxes. While the new instruments provide unprecedented data acquisition capabilities, there is an outstanding need for proper data correction. Spatial/thermal control points and post-processing algorithms are needed to produce quantifiable datasets. For example, our post-processed time-lapse imagery has an r2 > 0.9 after emissivity, transmissivity and offset corrections.",

            "abstract": "The West Coast of North America is the gateway to winter storms forming over the Pacific Ocean that deliver most of the precipitation and water supply to the region. Satellites are capable of detecting the concentrated water vapor in these storms (a.k.a. atmospheric rivers) over the oceans, but because of the complex emissivity of land surfaces, fail to do so over land. In addition, these storms often are accompanied by a baroclinically induced low-level jet that drives the moisture up the windward slopes of coastal and inland mountain ranges and produces orographically enhanced precipitation. To date, satellites cannot resolve this important feature. NOAA’s Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT; hmt.noaa.gov) has developed the concept of an atmospheric river observatory (ARO); a collection of ground-based instruments capable of detecting and monitoring the water vapor transport in the low-level jet region. With funding provided by the California Department of Water Resources and U.S. Department of Energy, HMT has installed a picket fence of AROs along the U.S. West Coast. In addition, HMT has developed an award-winning water vapor flux tool that takes advantage of the data collected by the AROs to provide situational awareness and decision support for end users. This tool recently has been updated to include operational weather prediction output. The ARO network and water vapor flux tool will be described in this presentation.",

In particular, localized and fast plasma transport in a global scale has been recognized to play a fundamental role in regulating evolution of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling. Those results call for coordinated measurements multi-missions and facilities in a global scale for understanding global coupling processes in a system level. In fact, the National Research Council recommends to use NASA's existing heliophysics flight missions and NSF's ground-based facilities by forming a network of observing platforms that operate simultaneously to investigate the solar system. This array can be thought of as a single observatory, the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO).\nMotivated by the successful launch of MMS and the healthy status of THEMIS, Van Allen Probes and other missions, we plan a strategic use of existing and upcoming assets in space and ground in the next two years. In the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 northern winter seasons, MMS will be in the dayside over northern Europe, and THEMIS will be in the nightside over North America. In the 2016 and 2017 southern winter seasons, THEMIS will be in the dayside over the South Pole, and MMS will be in the nightside in the Australian sector. These are favorable configurations for simultaneous day-night coupling measurements of magnetic reconnection and related plasma transport both in space and on the ground, and also provide excellent opportunities for cross-scale coupling, global effects of dayside transients, tail-inner magnetosphere coupling, and other global processes.

Simultaneous with the inward displacement of the magnetopause produced by an increase in solar wind dynamic pressure, we observe the generation of a pair of traveling convection vortices (TCVs) in both polar ionospheres. The TCV events are characterized by their single or twin vortex, of which the centers are located approximately at 72-76 degrees magnetic latitudes, propagating either dawnward or duskward away from local noon. ULF Pc1 waves identified as electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in association with the initiation of the TCVs were also observed on the ground. It appears that the waves are generated by the increased instability caused by the compression of the magnetosphere during the transient events. We discuss the spatiotemporal structures of the transient phenomena near the magnetopause and their magnetospheric and ionospheric responses, concluding that the signatures are closely associated with the sudden increase of solar wind dynamic pressure.",

            "abstract": "River deltas are highly dynamic, often fan-shaped depositional systems that form when rivers drain into a standing body of water. They host over a half billion people and are currently under threat of drowning and destruction by relative sea-level rise, subsidence, and anthropogenic interference. Deltas often develop planform fan shapes through avulsions, whereby major river channel shifts occur via “channel jumping” about a spatial node, thus determining their fundamental length scale. Emerging theories suggest that the size of delta lobes is set by backwater hydrodynamics; however, these ideas are difficult to test on natural deltas, which evolve on centennial to millennial timescales. In this presentation, I will show results from the first laboratory delta built through successive deposition of lobes that maintain a constant size that scales with backwater hydrodynamics. The characteristic size of deltas emerges because of a preferential avulsion node that remains fixed spatially relative to the prograding shoreline, and is a consequence of multiple river floods that produce persistent morphodynamic river-bed adjustment within the backwater zone. Moreover, river floods cause erosion in the lowermost reaches of the alluvial river near their coastline, which may leave erosional boundaries in the sedimentary record that may appear similar to those previously interpreted to be a result of relative sea-level fall. I will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of sustainability management of deltas, decoding their stratigraphic record, and identifying ancient standing bodies of water on other planets such as Mars. Finally, I will place this delta study in a broader context of recent work that highlights the importance of understanding and quantifying variability in sedimentology and geomorphology.",

            "abstract": "The US Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 has contributed to widespread changes in agricultural land uses. The impact of these land use changes on regional water resources could also be significant. Agricultural land use changes were evaluated for the Red River of the North Basin (RRNB), an international river basin shared by the US and Canada. The influence of the land use changes on spring snowmelt flooding and downstream water quality was also assessed using watershed modeling. The planting areas for corn and soybean in the basin increased by 62% and 18%, while those for spring wheat, forest, and pasture decreased by 30%, 18%, and 50%, from 2006 to 2013. Although the magnitude of spring snowmelt peak flows in the Red River did not change from pre-EISA to post-EISA, our uncertainty analysis of the normalized hydrographs revealed that the downstream streamflows had a greater variability under the post-EISA land use scenario, which may lead to greater uncertainty in predicting spring snowmelt floods in the Red River. Hydrological simulation also showed that the sediment and nutrient loads at the basin’s outlet in the US and Canada border increased under the post-EISA land use scenario, on average sediment increasing by 2.6%, TP by 14.1%, nitrate nitrogen by 5.9%, and TN by 9.1%. Potential impacts of the future biofuel crop scenarios on watershed hydrology and water quality in the RRNB were also simulated through integrated economic-hydrologic modeling.",

Similar anomalies exist over exposed volcanic rocks bordering the WAIS in places.\nRecent papers (e.g. Wouters et al., 2015; Paolo, et al.; 2015 and others) based on satellite altimetry have shown dramatic thinning and retreat of ice shelves, particularly those bordering the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, caused by melting from circulation of warming sea water. Previous workers have shown that when ice shelves collapse, the ice streams previously dammed by them accelerate an order of magnitude higher velocity, and surface elevation decreases. GRACE satellite interpretations (e.g. Velicogna et al., and others) indicate mass loss of WAIS in recent years.\nThe bed elevation beneath the WAIS deepens inland from the Amundsen and Bellingshausen coasts, although high relief volcanic topography is present in a number of areas beneath the ice.\nCrowley et a. (2015) have shown that glacial cycles may drive production of oceanic crust by lowering pressure in the mantle resulting in increased melting and magma production. Increased volcanism due to deglaciation in Iceland has apparently produced increased in volcanic activity there. Deglaciation of the Norwegian continental shelf has resulted in faulting of the sea floor and similar faulting has been reported of the Ross Sea shelf following deglaciation there.\nI suggest here that as the WAIS collapses in the future resulting from climate change, an increase in volcanic activity beneath the ice might be expected. This may provide a feedback mechanism for increase in ice melting.",

            "abstract": "Demand is growing for global inventories and valuations of ecosystem services, and several studies have attempted this quantification. Most have used land cover as a proxy, identifying wetlands, for example, as providers of clean water. In response, it has been argued that the value of hydrologic services rests in their additionally – the ecosystem service value of a watershed lies not in the value of the water captured by it but in the change in water quantity, quality, or timing if the watershed ecosystem were to change. Determining value is thus challenging, because hydrologic response to vegetation varies based on state factors such as climate and geology. In addition, value stems from the demand for water-related services, not only from the supply of those services, so beneficiaries must be accounted for. A set of criteria were identified with the aim of identifying places where hydrologic services are likely to be valuable. The primary biophysical criterion is that vegetation be an important control on hydrologic processes. Based on a set of ecohydrologic processes known to affect potentially valuable hydrologic attributes, characteristics of places where those processes are important were identified. Proxies for likelihood of land use change are an attempt to account for additionally. Density and development status of potential downstream water users were considered as a proxy for likely ecosystem service use. Preliminary mapping of these characteristics indicates regions likely to benefit from management of hydrologic ecosystem services. The overlap between areas likely to have high-value services and regions where Watershed Investment programs are active is evaluated.",

            "abstract": "The Sun produces intense radio emissions by collective processes and by incoherent single-particle processes, both of which depend sensitively on the electron distribution function present. Examples of the former include metric type II and III bursts produced by the so-called plasma emission processes, while examples of the latter include decametric and metric continua produced by the bremstrahlung and gyrosynchrotron processes. Kappa electron distributions, which appear power-law at high energies, qualitatively alter the spectral shape for the incoherent processes and increase the total flux (due to the increased number of high energy electrons). Kappa distributions are also vital for collective processes, due to the increased number of fast electrons (and so energy available) again and also due to the greatly ncreased level of the nonthermal background distribution onto which is superposed the distribution function of fast particles responsible for the collectively-produced waves and radio emissions. Two examples are presented, one for each reason. For type II bursts the level and frequency-time structures (above background) of predicted radio emission change qualitatively when kappa rather than Maxwellian background electrons are assumed, due to the increased numbers of fast electrons reflected by the type II shock. While this effect is also important for type III bursts produced by fast electron beams, our simulations show that the crucial qualitative change is that beam speeds above 0.3 c only develop in the simulations when kappa background electrons are present, due to the high level of the kappa tail preventing quasilinear relaxation of the beam electrons to smaller speeds.",

The Forest Carbon Accounting Framework (FCAF) is comprised of a forest dynamics module and a land use dynamics module. Together these modules produce data-driven estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes in forest ecosystems that are sensitive to carbon sequestration, forest aging, and disturbance effects as well as carbon stock transfers associated with afforestation and deforestation. The new accounting system was used in the 2016 NGHGI report and research is currently underway to incorporate emerging non-live tree carbon pool data, remotely sensed information, and auxiliary data (e.g., climate information) into the FCAF.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we study the evolution and distribution of the stress tensor within the northwest part of The Geysers geothermal field during 9 years of injection (from 2003 to 2012). Based on a refined 3D structural model, developed by Calpine Corporation, where the horizon surfaces are mapped, we use the GMS™ GUI to construct a realistic three-dimensional geologic model of the Northwest Geysers geothermal field. This model includes a low permeability graywacke layer that forms the caprock for the reservoir, an isothermal steam zone (the Normal Temperature Reservoir) within metagraywacke, a hornfels zone (the High Temperature Reservoir), and a felsite layer that is assumed to extend downward to the magmatic heat source. This model is mapped into a rectangular grid for use with the TOUGH-FLAC numerical simulator. Then, we reproduce the injection history of seven active wells between 2003 and 2012. Finally, our results are compared with previous works where the stress tensor was studied from the inversion of focal plane mechanism in the same area and during the same period. As in these publications we find that: (1) changes in the orientation of principal horizontal stress are very small after one decade of injection, and (2) at injection depth significant rotations of the initially vertically oriented maximum compressive principal stress occur in response to changes in the fluid injection rates. As observed in the field, we found that σ1 tilted towards the σ2 direction by approximately 15° when injection rates were at their peak level. Such a rotation consequently results in a local change in the state stress from a normal stress regime (Sv > SHmax> > Shmin) to a strike slip regime (SHmax> Sv > > Shmin) above and below the injection zone. Our results show that thermal processes are the principal cause for the stress tensor rotation.",

The urbanized corridor in northern Utah along the Wasatch Front, anchored by Salt Lake City, is undergoing rapid population growth that is projected to double in the next few decades. The Wasatch Front offers multiple advantages as an unique “urban laboratory”: urban regions in multiple valleys spanning numerous orders of magnitude in population, each with unique airsheds, well-defined boundary conditions along deserts and tall mountains, strong signals during cold air pool events, seasonal contrasts in pollution, and a legacy of productive partnerships with local stakeholders and governments.\nWe will show results from GHG measurements from the Wasatch Front, including one of the longest running continuous CO2 records in urban areas. Complementing this record are comprehensive meteorological observations and GHG/pollutant concentrations on mobile platforms: light rail, helicopter, and research vans.\nVariations in the GHG and pollutant observations illustrate human behavior and the resulting “urban metabolism” taking place on hourly, weekly, and seasonal cycles, resulting in a coupling between GHG and criteria pollutants. Moreover, these observations illustrate systematic spatial gradients in GHG and pollutant distributions between and within urban areas, traced to underlying gradients in population, energy use, terrain, and land use. Over decadal time scales the observations reveal growth of the “urban dome” due to expanding urban development.\nUsing numerical models of the atmosphere, we further link concentrations of GHG and air quality-relevant pollutants to underlying emissions at the neighborhood scale as well as urban planning considerations.",

All the measurements show enhancements at very high latitude poleward of 80° MLAT implying that substantial heating is supplied to the polar cap during storms. The neutrals at all altitudes respond very quickly to the magnetospheric energy input, indicating quick and strong vertical ion-neutral coupling in polar cap regions. It also suggests that the energy is mainly dissipated at altitudes below 250 km. The neutral temperature changes simulated by NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) are much lower than the observed changes by Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) at Resolute Bay, which indicates the lack of polar cap heating in the model. Based on these results, we conclude that the polar cap may be essential to energy input and dissipation in the MIT system and more improvements are needed to capture the strong heating in models.",

The new geophysical data make one revise the underlying mechanism of geomechanical processes taking place in fault zones. Conditions for generating different slip modes are still unclear. The most vital question is whether a certain slip mode is intrinsic for a fault or may be controlled by external factors.\nThis work presents the results of two and a half year deformation monitoring of a discontinuity in the zone of the Main Sayanskiy Fault. Main Sayanskiy Fault is right-lateral strike-slip fault. Observations were performed in the tunnel of Talaya seismic station (TLY), Irkutsk region, Russia. Measurements were carried out 70 m away from the entrance of the tunnel, the thickness of overlying rock was about 30 m. Inductive sensors of displacement were mounted at the both sides of a discontinuity, which recorded three components of relative fault side displacement with the accuracy of 0.2 mcm. Temperature variation inside the tunnel didn't exceed 0.5oC during the all period of observations.\nImportant information about deformation properties of an active fault was obtained. A pronounced seasonality of deformation characteristics of discontinuity is observed in the investigated segment of rock. A great number of slow slip events with durations from several hours to several weeks were registered. Besides that alterations of fault deformation characteristics before the megathrust earthquake M9.0 Tohoku Oki 11 March 2011 and reaction to the event itself were detected.\nThe work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant no. 14-17-00719).",

            "abstract": "For 14 years the SABER instrument on the NASA TIMED satellite has been observing the radiative cooling of the thermosphere-ionosphere system associated with infrared emission by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). From these observations a very clear picture of fundamental processes that control the thermal structure above 100 km has emerged. The radiative cooling is modulated by variations in solar UV irradiance and geomagnetic effects. A pronounced solar cycle variation in both NO and CO2 cooling is observed, and CO2 cooling dominates during solar minimum. Radiative cooling in the current maximum peaked in December 2014, nine months after the sunspot peak. On average, solar ultraviolet irradiance provides about 70% of the energy that results in cooling by NO and the remaining 30% arises from geomagnetic processes. The relative roles of irradiance and geomagnetism vary strongly over a solar cycle. Of particular interest are the large, short-term increases in radiative cooling associated with intense geomagnetic storms. The large energy deposition heats the atmosphere and the infrared cooling increases non-linearly, helping the atmosphere to shed the storm energy and rapidly return to pre-storm conditions. This “natural thermostat” effect of infrared radiation will be shown in detail in this talk, as a function of latitude and altitude for a number of different geomagnetic storms. The relative roles of radiative cooling by NO and CO2 will also be investigated, to see if there is any storm-dependent preference. Finally, the sensitivity of the NO cooling to geomagnetic processes suggests that near real time observations of NO emission may serve as a forecasting tool for space weather. Increases in NO infrared emissions are associated with energy deposition and heating of the atmosphere. Observations of NO emission may then identify regions in which atmospheric drag is increasing, and thus may be a tool for now casting of drag for space operations.",

            "abstract": "The early bombardment of the inner solar system played a critical role in planetary evolution, but there is still considerable uncertainty about what happened when. Dynamical models suggest two major bombardment phases may have taken place: (i) a post-accretionary period where newly-formed worlds were struck by leftover planetesimals, and (ii) a late heavy bombardment period, possibly produced by conditions related to a violent reshuffling of the planets ~4.1-4.2 Gyr ago (Ga). If valid, a relative impact lull took place between the two bombardment phases. We explore the evidence for such doldrums in this talk. Consider:\na) Mars. Geochemical and meteorite evidence indicates the giant 10,600 × 8,500 km Borealis basin formed > 4.5 Ga. Many postulated basins forming afterwards, however, can be ruled out by the surprisingly pristine nature of the Borealis boundary in topography and gravity. Three of the four largest remaining basins, Hellas, Isidis, and Argyre, have superposed craters counts indicating they are < 4.1 Ga.\nb) Asteroids. The oldest and most extensive sets of 39Ar-40Ar shock degassing ages, found within meteorites that were heavily shocked, shock-melted, or otherwise showed some evidence for having been part of a large collision, show age clusters between ~3.5-4.1 Ga and ~4.4-4.54 Ga. Using dynamical/impact heating models, it can be argued that relatively few projectiles were on planet-crossing orbits between ~4.1-4.4 Ga.\nc) Moon. The Moon is probably 4.47 Ga, yet most sample evidence for basin-sized impacts may be < 4.2 Ga. The age gap is curious unless many basins were created close in time to the solidification of the lunar crust. Using collisional/dynamical models, it can be shown that many early basins and craters formed > 4.4 Ga. Here the early impactors may be surviving debris from the Moon-forming giant impact event; note that ejecta initially escaping the Earth-Moon system can come back over many tens of Myr. This would leave doldrums between ~4.2-4.4 Ga.\nd) Earth. Early impacts may provide the means to indirectly make Hadean-era zircons (via burial of terrains by impact-derived melt). This could mean the paucity of > 4.2 Ga zircons is not solely a survival bias, but instead are doldrums. The zircon age distribution peak near ~4.15 Ga would then tell us about the onset of the late heavy bombardment.",

A regionally developed greenschist facies normal-sense shear zone system along the southern margin of the BR suggests that extensional faulting had an influential role in the exhumation of the metamorphic core. To better constrain the exhumation history of the metamorphic core of the BR, samples were collected from a N-S transect through the metamorphic core of the orogen. Electron microprobe (EMP) analyses of white micas reveal that they are composed of phengite (Si > 3.0 pfu) or a combination of phengite + paragonite. Si-content of phengites reveal a southward increase in Si from 3.1 to 3.4 pfu (corresponding to an increase in pressure). Si-contents in higher-P phengites are scattered, reflecting subsequent muscovite growth. The Si trend is matched by a southward increase in the 40Ar/39Ar total gas ages of white micas. Phengite from the north are characterized by younger ages (~115 Ma) and flatter 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Farther south, phengites and paragonites yield older 40Ar/39Ar ages. These samples yield convex, staircase 40Ar/39Ar spectra that initiate ~115-120 Ma and flatten-out ~130-138 Ma. Modeling using MacArgon proposes that an initial cooling of HP/LT metamorphism occurred ~130-138 Ma, recorded in the high-Si phengites and paragonites. Following initial cooling, modeling suggests HP/LT rocks stalled in the greenschist facies field before subsequent exhumation, resulting in the staircase 40Ar/39Ar spectra. Flatter 40Ar/39Ar spectra recorded by the northern samples and modeling of 40Ar/39Ar results from the southern samples suggest that these rocks from metamorphic core of the BR were exhumed to temperatures < 300°C by ~115 Ma.",

            "abstract": "We present measurements from the Van Allen Probes, in the  near Earth tail, at the outer boundary of the plasma sheet, of a magnetic dipolarization/injection event characterized by unusually strong earthward poynting flux flowing along magnetic field lines with amplitudes of 200 mW/m2 lasting ~ 1 minute. The Poynting flux was conjugate to a 30 km wide discrete auroral arc observed by the THEMIS auroral array. The observations were obtained at 5.8 Re in the pre-midnight sector during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm on 5/01/2013. This brief interval transferred more electromagnetic energy (at the spacecraft position) than that transferred during entire remainder of the main phase of the storm. The parallel Poynting flux coincided with a local section of the “cross tail current sheet” which generated the dipolarization signature. The latitudinal width of the arc, mapped along magnetic field lines, provides an estimate of the spatial scale of the Poynting flux, the electric fields, and the current sheets (parallel and perpendicular). It is estimated that the latitudinal width of the Poynting flux “sheet” was ~600 km or ~1-2 H+ inertial lengths. An estimate of the ∫E·dl across the current sheet along the direction normal to the plasma sheet is ~20-40 kilovolts. The \"normal\" to the plasma sheet component of the electric field (~70 mV/m) strongly dominated the azimuthal component(which is reponsible for drift energetization). The dipolarization event resulted in the local dispersion-less injection of electrons between 50 keV and ~2 MeV at the Van Allen Probe position. The injection event involved brief (factor of two) local spike in ~2 MeV electron fluxes. Measurements from the Los Alamos geosynchronous spacecraft, displaced eastward from the Van Allen probes, provided evidence for dispersive energy-time electron signatures consistent with injection and energization at the RBSP position. The Poynting flux also coincided with the energy peak in the up-flowing dispersive ion energy-time profile and the onset of earthward ExB convection. A similar injection event during the storm on 6/1/2013 will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We employ 130 low-frequency-earthquake (LFE) templates representing tremor sources on the plate boundary below southern Vancouver Island to examine LFE magnitudes. Each template is assembled from 100's to 1000's of individual LFEs, representing over 300,000 independent detections from major episodic-tremor-and- slip (ETS) events between 2003 and 2013. Template displacement waveforms for direct P- and S-waves at near epicentral distances are remarkably simple at many stations, approaching the zero-phase, single pulse expected for a point dislocation source in a homogeneous medium. High spatio-temporal precision of template match-filtered detections facilitates precise alignment of individual LFE detections and analysis of waveforms. Upon correction for 1-D geometrical spreading, attenuation, free-surface magnification and radiation pattern, we solve a large, sparse linear system for 3-D path corrections and LFE magnitudes for all detections corresponding to a single ETS template. The spatio-temporal distribution of magnitudes indicates that typically half the total moment release occurs within the first 12-24 hours of LFE activity during an ETS episode when tidal sensitity is low. The remainder is released in bursts over several days, particularly as spatially extensive RTRs, during which tidal sensitivity is high. RTR's are characterized by large magnitude LFEs, and are most strongly expressed in the updip portions of the ETS transition zone and less organized at downdip levels. LFE magnitude-frequency relations are better described by power-law than exponential distributions although they exhibit very high b-values ≥ 6. We examine LFE moment-duration scaling by generating templates using detections for limiting magnitude ranges MW<1.5, MW≥ 2.0. LFE duration displays a weaker dependence upon moment than expected for self-similarity, suggesting that LFE asperities are limited in dimension and that moment variation is dominated by slip. This behaviour implies that LFEs exhibit a scaling distinct from both large-scale slow earthquakes and regular seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Among the broad range of magmatic processes observed in the Overlook pit crater in Kilauea Caldera are recurring episodes of gas-piston activity. This activity is accompanied by repetitive seismic signals recorded by a broadband network deployed in the summit caldera. We use the seismic data to model the source mechanism of representative gas-piston events in a sequence that occurred on 20-25 August 2011 during a gentle inflation of the Kilauea summit. We apply a new waveform inversion method that accounts for the contributions from both translation and tilt in horizontal seismograms through the use of Green’s functions representing the seismometer response to translation and tilt ground motions. This method enables a robust description of the source mechanism over the period range of 1 – 10,000 s. Most of the seismic wave field produced by gas-pistoning originates in a source region ~1 km below the eastern perimeter of Halema’uma’u pit crater. The observed waveforms are well explained by a simple volumetric source with geometry composed of two intersecting cracks featuring an east-striking crack (dike) dipping 80° to the north, intersecting a north-striking crack (inclined sheet) dipping 65° to the east. Each gas-piston event is characterized by a rapid inflation lasting a few minutes trailed by a slower deflation ramp extending up to 15 minutes, attributed to the efficient coupling at the source centroid location of the pressure and momentum changes accompanying the growth and collapse of a layer of foam at the top of the magma column. Assuming a simple lumped parameter representation of the shallow magmatic system, the observed pressure and volume variations can be modeled with the following attributes: foam thickness (10 – 50 m), foam cell diameter (0.04 – 0.10 m), and gas-injection velocity (0.01 – 0.06 m s-1). Based on the change in the period of very-long-period oscillations accompanying the onset of the gas-piston signal and tilt evidence, the height of the magma column is inferred to have risen by up to ~23 m by the end of the 5-day-long sequence.",

            "abstract": "Following a significant disaster event, a wide range of resources and science teams are leveraged to aid in the response effort. Often, these efforts include the acquisition and use of non-traditional data sets, or the generation of prototyped products using new image analysis techniques. These efforts may also include acquisition and hosting of remote sensing data sets from domestic and international partners – from the public or private sector – which differ from standard remote sensing holdings, or may be accompanied by specific licensing agreements that limit their use and dissemination. In addition, at time periods well beyond the initial disaster event, other science teams may incorporate airborne or field campaign measurements that support the assessment of damage but also acquire information necessary to address key science questions about the specific disaster or a broader category of similar events.\nThe immediate need to gather data and provide information to the response effort can result in large data holdings that require detailed curation to improve the efficiency of response efforts, but also ensure that collected data can be used on a longer time scale to address underlying science questions. Data collected in response to a disaster event may be thought of as a “field campaign” – consisting of traditional data sets managed through physical or virtual holdings, but also a larger number of ad hoc data collections, derived products, and metadata, including the potential for airborne or ground-based data collections. Appropriate metadata and documentation are needed to ensure that derived products have traceability to their source data, along with documentation of algorithm authors, versions, and outcomes so that others can reproduce their results, and to ensure that data sets remain available and well-documented for longer-term analysis that may in turn create new products relevant to understanding a type of disaster, or support future recovery efforts. The authors will review some activities related to recent data acquisitions for severe weather events and the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, discuss challenges and opportunities for geocuration, and suggest means of improving the management of data and scientific collaboration if applied to future events.",

            "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in assigning \"habitability\" to terrestrial planets is to define a circumstellar habitable zone: the locus of orbital radii in which the planet is neither too hot nor too cold for life as we know it. One dimensional climate models have put theoretically impressive boundaries on this: a runaway greenhouse or water loss at the inner edge (Venus), and low-latitude glaciation followed by formation of CO2 clouds at the outer edge. A cottage industry now exists to \"refine\" the definition of these boundaries each year to the third decimal place of an AU. Using exactly that kind of model, I'll show that the different climate states can overlap very substantially and that \"snowball Earth\", temperate climate and a post-runaway climate can all be stable under the same solar flux. Furthermore, the radial extent of the temperature climate band is very narrow for pure water atmospheres. The width of the habitable zone is determined by the atmospheric inventories of di-nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Yet Earth teaches us that these abundances are very heavily influenced (perhaps even controlled) by biology. This is paradoxical: the habitable zone seeks to define the region a planet should be capable of harbouring life; yet whether the planet is inhabited will determine whether the climate may be habitable at any given distance from the star. This matters, because future life detection missions may use habitable zone boundaries in mission design. A historical view of solar system exploration helps frame the problem; robotic exploration of the outer solar system revealed the un-imagined nature of the Jovian and Saturnian moons, whilst showing that the Venusian jungle died long ago. Prediction will fall to data but the unexpected may emerge. To soften that fall we should revise the paradigm of habitability to acknowledge that habitability depends on inhabitance; for life as we know it is a planetary scale--and planet dominating--phenomenon.

            "abstract": "The enrichment of LREE in clinopyroxenes in abyssal peridotites has often been attributed to shallow level melt refertilization. Here we show an alternative mechanism that involves diffusive fractionation of REE during disequilibrium mantle melting. We present a simple model for trace element fractionation during disequilibrium melting in an upwelling steady-state column. We use linear kinetics to approximate crystal-melt mass exchange rate and obtain analytical solutions for cases of perfect fractional melting and batch melting. A key parameter determining the extent of chemical disequilibrium during partial melting is an element specific dimensionless ratio (ε) defined as the melting rate relative to the solid-melt chemical exchange rate for the trace element of interest. In the case of diffusion in mineral limited exchange, ε is inversely proportional to diffusivity of the element of interest. Disequilibrium melting is important for the trace element when e is comparable to or greater than the bulk solid-melt partition coefficient for the element (k). The disequilibrium fractional melting model is reduced to the equilibrium perfect fractional melting model when e is much smaller than k. Hence highly incompatible trace elements with slower mobilities in minerals are more susceptible to disequilibrium melting than moderately incompatible elements. Effect of chemical disequilibrium is to hinder the extent of fractionation between residual solid and partial melt, making the residual solid less depleted and the accumulated melt more enriched in incompatible trace element abundances relative the case of equilibrium melting.\nApplication of the disequilibrium fractional melting model to REE abundances in clinopyroxene in abyssal peridotites from the Central Indian Ridge and the Vema Lithospheric Section, Mid-Atlantic Ridge revealed a positive correlation between the disequilibrium parameter ε and the degree of melting, which can be explained by an increase in melting rate and a decrease in REE diffusion rate in the upper part of the melting column. Small extent of disequilibrium melting for LREE and equilibrium melting for HREE in the upper part of the mantle column can explain the elevated LREE abundances REE patterns in clinopyroxenes in more refractory abyssal peridotites.",

In this study, NAVGEM analyses are used to diagnose the spatial and temporal evolution of the main dynamical drivers in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) before, during, and after specific SSW events during the 2009-2013 period when large disturbances were observed in the thermosphere/ionosphere (TI) region. Preliminary findings show strong modulation of the semidiurnal tide in the MLT during the onset of an SSW. To assess the impact of the neutral atmosphere dynamical variability on the TI system, NAVGEM analyses are used to constrain simulations of select SSW events using the specified dynamics (SD) configuration of the extended Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM-X).",

(2013) from Voyager 1 (V1) that resemble the densities expected in the interstellar medium; (2) the direction of the magnetic field, which does not change at the heliocliff, where the ACRs escape; (3) the full IBEX ENH spectra observed in the directions of V1 and Voyager 2 (V2), particularly the low-energy ENH measurements, for which no other explanation is available; (4) the magnetic field strength observed by V1 in a region where the components of the solar wind velocity normal to the magnetic field become very small; (5) the escape of ACRs and the entry of GCRs beyond the heliocliff. The F&G model thus provides a context in which to interpret current and future Voyager observations, such as the lack of turbulence in the region currently being explored by V1, or the source of the IBEX ribbon.

            "abstract": "In boreal forests, the growing season is short, and winter temperature is low and fluctuates from considerably below freezing point to intermittent warm spells. Under such conditions, it is important for plants to retain their photosynthetic capacity throughout the winter. To understand the importance of wintertime photosynthetic activity for evergreen boreal coniferous species, the light response curve of black spruce (Picea mariana) was monitored in Fairbanks, interior Alaska (64°86′N, 147°84′W) throughout the winter, and compared with those in the summer. Cuttings of black spruce were collected, and gas exchange of their needles was measured in the incubator set to 0 °C using a gas analyzer (LI-6400, Li-Cor Inc.). A non-rectangular hyperbolic model was fitted to these data, and physiological parameters such as the maximum photosynthesis rate, dark respiration rate and quantum yield of photosynthesis were extracted.\nThe apparent quantum yield of photosynthesis remained low throughout the winter for black spruce. The maximum photosynthesis rate was downregulated as air temperature fell in early winter, but did not increase in March when air temperature rose. This suggests that photoinhibition may occur more strongly in March than in early winter. The average maximum rates of photosynthesis in winter were almost 10％ of the value measured in summer. On the other hand, the dark respiration rate did not considerably differ between seasons. These results provide new insights into winter photosynthetic activity and its role in boreal forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The likely duration of ongoing volcanic eruptions is a topic of great interest to volcanologists, volcano observatories, and communities near volcanoes. Lava dome forming eruptions can last from days to centuries, and can produce violent, difficult-to-forecast activity including vulcanian to plinian explosions and pyroclastic density currents. Periods of active dome extrusion are often interspersed with periods of relative quiescence, during which extrusion may slow or pause altogether, but persistent volcanic unrest continues. This contribution focuses on the durations of these longer-term unrest phases, hereafter eruptions, that include periods of both lava extrusion and quiescence.\nA new database of lava dome eruptions, DomeHaz, provides characteristics of 228 eruptions at 127 volcanoes; for which 177 have duration information. We find that while 78% of dome-forming eruptions do not continue for more than 5 years, the remainder can be very long-lived. The probability distributions of eruption durations are shown to be heavy-tailed and vary by magma composition. For this reason, eruption durations are modeled with generalized Pareto distributions whose governing parameters depend on each volcano’s composition and eruption duration to date.\nBayesian predictive distributions and associated uncertainties are presented for the remaining duration of ongoing eruptions of specified composition and duration to date. Forecasts of such natural events will always have large uncertainties, but the ability to quantify such uncertainty is key to effective communication with stakeholders and to mitigation of hazards. Projections are made for the remaining eruption durations of ongoing eruptions, including those at Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat and Sinabung, Indonesia.\nThis work provides a quantitative, transferable method and rationale on which to base long-term planning decisions for dome forming volcanoes of different compositions, regardless of the quality of an individual volcano’s eruptive record, by leveraging a global database.",

            "abstract": "The late stage of the Late Jurassic English Peak pluton is inwardly-zoned from tonalite to granite with magnesiohornblende and biotite as principal mafic phases. The late stage is subdivided into three inward-younging units: border, Yellow Jacket Ridge (YJR), and interior Chimney Rock (CR) units. Contacts are gradational and bulk-rock data support either batch-wise emplacement or inward differentiation.\nHornblende (hbl) has olive-brown cores surrounded and embayed by green rims. Al2O3 and TiO2 decrease (9.0–4.5 and 2.5–0.5 wt%, respectively) and MgO increases (10–14 wt%) from cores to rims, with a distinct gap at ~1.5% TiO2, corresponding to the core-rim boundary. Al-in-hbl barometry suggests core crystallization at ~4.2 kbar and rim growth at ~2.4 kbar, probably in a sub-volcanic reservoir.\nMost trace element abundances decrease from cores to rims, with Sr, Ba, Hf, and Cr showing linear variation with Zr, with a distinct gap at ~1.5% TiO2 (50-55 ppm Zr). Nb is ~ constant within olive-brown cores and decreases in green rims. In contrast, most 3+ cations (Sc, V, Y, REE) show initial rim-ward decrease, but reach constant values at ~80 ppm Zr, within olive-brown cores. At the core-rim transition in YJR and CR hbl, these elements then increase in abundance. Zoning patterns of hbl from each unit are distinct in terms of Sc, Y, Mn, and REE; each late-stage magma evolved separately, even if they shared a common source.\nTrace element modeling using a narrow range of bulk D and hbl/melt d values indicate fractional crystallization explains near-linear core–rim decreases in most trace elements. Bulk partition coefficients were constant or increased sympathetically. Slope changes at ~80 ppm Zr can be modeled as increases in hbl/melt partition coefficients as T decreased. This change occurs within the core zones, presumably prior to rise to the level of emplacement. The abrupt increases in 3+ cation abundances in green rims can be modeled as the result of core resorption accompanied by overgrowth of green rims.\nThe three late-stage units represent distinct magma pulses into a shallow crustal reservoir, potentially from a common, mid-crustal reservoir. The pluton is likely to have fed a composite volcano with multiple dacitic/rhyodacitic domes fed from the shallow reservoir.",

A new operational mode was designed to specifically look at the outflowing gas composition as a function of position along the tiger stripes. This open ion source beaming mode was used in the design to unambiguously determine the composition of the plume gases without the concern of instrument wall effects that have previously been shown to occur in the closed ion source during high velocity flybys (>16 km s-1). Of particular interest was the H2 content of the plume gas due to its importance for verifying the existence of hydrothermal processes in the internal sea. The existence and quantity of H2 taken together with the plume abundance of methane and the Cosmic Dust Analyzer measurement of silicon dioxide nanoparticles will provide conclusive evidence of the existence of extant hydrothermal activity thus setting the stage for future missions to verify the habitability and conditions of the internal sea and to search for life therein.",

            "abstract": "During the CalWater-2014 Early Start winter field campaign, the wettest period occurred with a long-lived, intense atmospheric river (AR) impacting California on 7-10 February. SSMIS satellite imagery of integrated water vapor (see figure) provides a large-scale overview of the event. Based on Lagrangian trajectories, the AR tapped into the tropical water-vapor reservoir, and the water vapor subsequently advected to California. Widespread heavy precipitation (200-400 mm) fell across the coastal mountain ranges northwest of San Francisco and across the northern Sierra Nevada, although only modest flooding ensued due to anomalously dry antecedent conditions. The NOAA G-IV aircraft – which represents the cornerstone observing platform for this study – flew through two mesoscale frontal waves in the AR environment offshore in a ~24-h period. Parallel dropsonde curtains documented key three-dimensional thermodynamic and kinematic characteristics across the AR and frontal waves prior to landfall. Different AR characteristics were evident, depending on the location of the cross section through the frontal waves. A newly-implemented tail-mounted Doppler radar on the G-IV simultaneously captured coherent precipitation features. Along the coast, a 449-MHz wind profiler and collocated global positioning system (GPS) receiver monitored tropospheric winds and water vapor during the AR landfall. These instruments also observed the transient frontal waves – which prolonged AR conditions and heavy precipitation – and highlighted the orographic character of the rainfall in the coastal mountains. A vertically pointing S-PROF radar in the coastal mountains provided detailed information on the bulk microphysical characteristics of the rainfall. Farther inland, a pair of 915-MHz wind profilers and GPS receivers quantified the orographic precipitation forcing as the AR ascended the Sierra Nevada, and as the terrain-induced Sierra barrier jet ascended the northern terminus of California’s Central Valley. We look forward to sharing detailed results of this study with colleagues at the AGU Fall Meeting.",

These measurements, made by the Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSUs) yield one of the longest truly global records of Earth’s climate. To be useful for climate studies, measurements made by different satellites and satellite systems need to be merged into a single long-term dataset. Before and during the merging process, a number of adjustments made to the satellite measurements. These adjustments are intended to account for issues such as calibration drifts or changes in local measurement time. Because the adjustments are made with imperfect knowledge, they are therefore not likely to reduce errors to zero, and thus introduce uncertainty into the resulting long-term data record. In this presentation, we will discuss a Monte-Carlo-based approach to calculating and describing the effects of these uncertainty sources on the final merged dataset. The result of our uncertainty analysis is an ensemble of possible datasets, with the applied adjustments varied within reasonable bounds, and other error sources such as sampling noise taken into account. The ensemble approach makes it easy for the user community to assess the effects of uncertainty on their work by simply repeating their analysis for each ensemble member.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods have the potential to detect and monitor free-phase organic contaminants in sediments, both in the laboratory and in the field. NMR directly detects signal from hydrogen-bearing fluids; the signal amplitude is proportional to the total amount of hydrogen present, while the signal decay rate provides information about fluid properties and interactions with the surrounding sediments. Contrasting relaxation times (T2) or diffusion coefficients (D) allow the separation of water signal from contaminant signal.\nIn this work, we conduct a laboratory study to assess the use of NMR measurements to detect and quantify diesel, gasoline, crude oil, and tri-chloroethylene in sediments. We compare the T2 distributions for sediments containing only water, only contaminant, and both water and contaminant, confirming that the identification and quantification of contaminants using T2 data alone is limited by overlapping water and contaminant T2 distributions in some sediments. We leverage the contrast between the diffusion coefficient of water and that of diesel and crude oil to separate contaminant signal from water signal in D-T2 maps. D-T2 distributions are measured both using a pulsed gradient method and a static gradient method similar to methods used with logging tools, allowing us to compare the ability of each method to quantify diesel and crude oil when water is also present. There is the potential to apply these methods to characterize and monitor contaminated sites using commercially available NMR logging tools.",

The surface expression of the fault zone as well as patches of especially rough seafloor texture on both flanks of the fault are distinctively recognized in 1-m resolution bathymetry. On the SW side of the fault, apparently accreted ovoid mounds 10 to 30 meters in diameter and up to 11 m high cover up to 50% of the seafloor within a restricted 0.43 km2 area. In contrast, on the NE side similar mounds are identified along outcropping bedding planes, suggesting that on the NE side mound formation and distribution is stratigraphically controlled. On a dive with the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Doc Ricketts we observed variably colored ~1 m-sized material clusters accreted onto the sides and top of the mounds. Some clusters consist of white, fragile, vertical spires, suggesting active upward growth of chemical precipitates. The lightly colored clusters are partially covered with gelatinous and filamentous bacterial mats on their uppermost surfaces. The mounds broke easily when prodded with the ROV arm. X-ray powder diffraction analyses show the mounds are composed of barite. Black varnish variably covers the mounds and may be related to time since the last episode of barite precipitation in a particular area. Except for thickets of tubeworms, mounds are notably devoid of attached fauna. Concentration of methane in sediment pore fluids extracted from push cores collected at the base of a tubeworm thicket was low, in the order of micromolar to undetectable Sulfur isotopic compositions of seven rock samples range between δ34S +20.1‰ to +27.5‰, indicating the sulfate in barite is mainly seawater-derived (δ34S +21) which has undergone a small degree of sulfur reduction. Overall, barite deposits covered 14% of the area within a 500 m wide band along the SW side of the fault, and 22% within a 650 m wide band on the NE side. This pattern may suggest that massive barite deposits along the San Clemente Fault could be a frequent occurrence given their high abundance on this randomly sampled short section of the fault zone.",

The objective is to develop a clear and consistent spatiotemporal description of poleward auroral features associated with poleward boundary intensifications and auroral streamers and of the equatorward auroral arc associated with substorm onset. By using quantitative analysis we determine an occurrence rate for high-speed auroral forms associated with high-speed ionospheric flow channels during the substorm growth phase and how many of these auroral forms can be associated with substorm onset. Our new method allows progression from qualitative analysis of the aurora and substorms towards reproducible, quantitative studies of substorm aurora.",

This has coined the popular phrase “If you've seen one storm, you've seen one storm”. Here we investigate the response of energetic electrons in the outer radiation belt to geomagnetic storms driven by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) during the SAMPEX era through solar cycle 23 (1994-2004). We demonstrate that the outer radiation belt responds consistently and predictably to external solar wind energy input and magnetospheric wave dynamics such that larger geomagnetic storms are associated with both increased loss and acceleration. In particular, we demonstrate that the amount of electron loss in the outer radiation belt and subsequent acceleration during a geomagnetic storms is very well characterised by the total energy input from the solar wind, the minimum location of the magnetopause, minimum Dst, and ULF wave power within the inner magnetosphere. Finally we demonstrate that CMEs and CIRs have different external and internal driving conditions that produce distinct belt morphologies. However, a simple ULF wave diffusion model can reproduce both morphologies. This demonstrates how the radiation belts respond predictably for different storm drivers and magnetospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The northwest-striking Furnace Creek – Fish Lake Valley (FC-FLV) fault system stretches for >250 km from southeastern California to western Nevada, forms the eastern boundary of the northern segment of the Eastern California Shear Zone, and has contemporary displacement. The FC-FLV fault system initiated in the mid-Miocene (10-12 Ma) and shows a south to north decrease in displacement from a maximum of 75-100 km to less than 10 km. Coeval elongation by extension on north-northeast striking faults within the adjoining blocks to the FC-FLV fault both supply and remove cumulative displacement measured at the northern end of the transcurrent fault system. Elongation and displacement transfer in the eastern block, constituting the southern Walker Lane of western Nevada, exceeds that of the western block and results in the net south to north decrease in displacement on the FC-FLV fault system. Elongation in the eastern block is accommodated by late Miocene to Pliocene detachment faulting followed by extension on superposed, east-northeast striking, high-angle structures. Displacement transfer from the FC-FLV fault system to the northwest-trending faults of the central Walker Lane to the north is accomplished by motion on a series of west-northwest striking transcurrent faults, named the Oriental Wash, Sylvania Mountain, and Palmetto Mountain fault systems. The west-northwest striking transcurrent faults cross-cut earlier detachment structures and are kinematically linked to east-northeast high-angle extensional faults. The transcurrent faults are mapped along strike for 60 km to the east, where they merge with north-northwest faults forming the eastern boundary of the southern Walker Lane. The west-northwest trending transcurrent faults have 30-35 km of cumulative left-lateral displacement and are a major contributor to the decrease in right-lateral displacement on the FC-FLV fault system.",

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are highly dependent on rainfall, more sensitive, and have a lower adaptive capacity to climate change than mainland countries yet are poorly studied. Extensive hydrometeorological records exist in Mauritius, offering a unique opportunity to model rainfall distribution and produce high resolution gridded datasets for GIS-based models. Multiple regression is used to model mean annual and monthly rainfall on the island for the period 1997 - 2011 and derive a physical basis for understanding spatial rainfall patterns. The models incorporate latitude, longitude, slope, distance to coast, elevation and their interactions accounting for 68% of the variance in mean annual rainfall and 55-72% of variance in mean monthly rainfall across the island. Spatial trends are removed from observed monthly rainfall totals and ordinary kriging is applied to the residuals. The regression and kriging results are combined to produce a high resolution, physically consistent gridded time-series dataset. Estimate and variance values from each month are then used to calculate 95% confidence interval surfaces. Cross-validation reveals close correspondence between predicted and observed values. This regression kriging approach captures what is currently understood about the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation in this mountainous sub-tropical location, giving us greater confidence in the reliability of the new rainfall estimates.",

The first concept focuses on measuring atmospheric parameters in-situ from a spaceborne platform. It consists of an instrument that utilizes both established and new methods for measuring density, winds, temperature, and composition of the atmospheric gas. A previously-developed ionization-gauge based pressure sensor is used to measure density, and composition is measured by a newly-developed mass spectrograph capable of high readout rates. Temperature and cross-track winds are measured using the established scanning-baffle technique , but a second newly-conceived method based on an imaging sensor is also included. In-track winds are measured with a time-of-flight approach that employs a high-speed mechanical modulation device. The operational principles of these sensors are discussed in detail, development status discussed, and current testing results presented.\nThe second concept utilizes spaceborne lidar to measure altitude profiles of atmospheric density, winds, and temperature in the altitude range 80-600 km. At the heart of the system is a laser transmitter/receiver pair that is sensitive to atomic oxygen. The concept is currently under study, and several paradigms for potential deployment and operation are presented. A concept for the ultraviolet laser system used for the atomic oxygen measurements is also under development, and the status of that development is also reported upon.",

            "abstract": "Pyroconvective smoke plumes from large fires can be injected directly into the geostrophic flow and dry air at high altitudes. As a result, they are usually longer-lived, can be transported thousands of kilometers, and can cross the tropopause into the lower stratosphere. Because the emissions pulses are so abrupt relative to other non-volcanic sources, their evolution and decay can be easily separated from background levels of aerosols and trace gases. This makes them interesting natural experiments against which to evaluate models, and understand the fate and effects of surface emissions pulses.\nWe have simulated the well-observed February 2009 Black Saturday smoke plume from southeast Australia using the NASA GISS Earth System Model. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first simulation of a high altitude smoke plume with a full-complexity composition-climate model. We compared simulated CO to a joint retrieval from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer and Microwave Limb Sounder instruments.\nUsing an upper tropospheric injection height, we were able to simulate the plume’s eastward transport and ascent over New Zealand, anticyclonic circulation and ascent over the Coral Sea, westward transport in the lower tropical stratosphere, and arrival over Africa at the end of February. Simulations were improved by taking into account hourly variability in emissions associated with extreme fire behavior observed by fire management agencies. We considered a range of emissions amounts, based on different assumptions about which of the Black Saturday fires were explosive enough to inject smoke to high altitudes, and accounting for emissions factor uncertainty. The best agreement between plume concentrations at the end of February was found for the highest emissions scenario. Three days after the fire, there was a linear relationship between emissions amount and plume concentration. Three weeks after the fire, the relationship was non-linear; we discuss diabatic self-lofting as a possible cause of the non-linearity.",

            "abstract": "The Sun’s motion relative to the surrounding interstellar medium leads to an interstellar neutral (ISN) wind through the heliosphere that is moderately depleted by ionization. This situation allows remote sensing of the ISN through resonant scattering of solar UV and in-situ sampling, first via pickup ions (PUI) and most recently with direct neutral atom imaging. PUI observations have revealed the gravitational focusing cone of interstellar He and Ne as well as the composition of high ionization potential elements. After the first direct ISN He observations with Ulysses GAS, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observes with high collecting power the ISN flow trajectories very close to their perihelion in Earth’s orbit for H, He, O, and Ne from December through March. Meanwhile, IBEX has recorded seven years of ISN observations, with changing solar activity and varying viewing strategies. These recurring and remarkably repeatable observations allow us to consolidate the derived physical parameters and some key compositional aspects of the interstellar medium. IBEX observations provide a very precise relation between ISN flow longitude and speed via the hyperbolic trajectory equation, but with larger uncertainties separately for longitude and speed. Recent concerted studies have led to a velocity vector that is consistent between IBEX and Ulysses, with a substantially higher temperature than found previously. The fact that the IBEX He and O ISN observations contain a substantial secondary neutral contribution adds complexity to the quantitative analysis of the physical interstellar medium parameters. However, their discovery also provides invaluable insight into the interstellar plasma interaction in the outer heliosheath, which is shaped strongly by the interstellar magnetic field. The longitude range of the IBEX observations limits the precision of the ISN velocity vector. The IBEX collection power and its sensitivity to the Earth’s magnetosphere limit composition and secondary component observations. So far, PUIs have only been observed with sensors that were not optimized for interstellar PUIs. The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) to be placed at L1 will take these observations to the next level with more powerful sensors.",

These components, not merely numbers, represent actual profile shapes that give a quantitative basis for comparing different sets of features. For example, PCA for terrestrial hotspots shows the main component as a generic dome shape. Secondary components show a more sinusoidal shape, related to the lithospheric loading response, and thus give information about the nature of the lithosphere setting of the various hotspots.\nWe examine a range of terrestrial spreading centers: fast, slow, ultra-slow, incipient, and extinct, and compare these to several chasmata on Venus (including Devana, Ganis, Juno, Parga, and Kuanja). For upwelling regions, we consider the oceanic Hawaii, Reunion, and Iceland hotspots and Yellowstone, a prototypical continental hotspot. Venus has approximately one dozen broad topographic and geoid highs called regiones. Our analysis includes Atla, Beta, and W. Eistla regiones. Atla and Beta are widely thought to be the most likely to be currently or recently active.\nAnalysis of terrestrial rifts suggests shows increasing uniformity of shape among rifts with increasing spreading rates. Venus' correlations of uniformity rank considerably lower than the terrestrial ones. Extrapolating the correlation/spreading rate suggests that Venus’ chasmata, if analogous to terrestrial spreading centers, most resemble the ultra-slow spreading level (less than 12mm/yr) of the Arctic Gakkel ridge. PCA will provide an objective measurement of this correlation.",

            "abstract": "Assessing risks to aquatic ecosystems services (ES) is challenging and time-consuming, and effective strategies for prioritizing more detailed assessment efforts are needed. We propose a screening-level risk analysis (SRA) approach that scales ES risk using socioeconomic and environmental indices to capture anthropic and climatic pressures, as well as the capacity for institutional responses to those pressures. The method considers ES within a watershed context, and uses expert input to prioritize key services and the associated pressures that threaten them. The SRA approach focuses on estimating ES risk affect factors, which are the sum of the intensity factors for all hazards or pressures affecting the ES. We estimate the pressure intensity factors in a novel manner, basing them on the nation’s (i) human development (proxied by Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, IHDI), (ii) environmental regulatory and monitoring state (Environmental Performance Index, EPI) and (iii) the current level of water stress in the watershed (baseline water stress, BWS). Anthropic intensity factors for future conditions are derived from the baseline values based on the nation’s 10-year trend in IHDI and EPI; ES risks in nations with stronger records of change are rewarded more/penalized less in estimates for good/poor future management scenarios. Future climatic intensity factors are tied to water stress estimates based on two general circulation model (GCM) outcomes. We demonstrate the method for an international array of six sites representing a wide range of socio-environmental settings. The outcomes illustrate novel consequences of the scaling scheme. Risk affect factors may be greater in a highly developed region under intense climatic pressure, or in less well-developed regions due to human factors (e.g., poor environmental records). As a screening-level tool, the SRA approach offers considerable promise for ES risk comparisons among watersheds and regions so that detailed assessment, management and mitigation efforts can be effectively prioritized.",

The transition between elastic/inelastic slip occurs at the fault extension pressure (FEP) at the onset of injection flowrate increase. In a typical test, the FEP transition associated with the characterization of the activated slip (strike and dip) on the faults may be used for calibration in a slip sensitivity study related to the ambient stress field. The potential use of the post FEP’s response to estimate the variation of the friction coefficient as a function of slip, slip rate and other static controls is discussed taking different in situ test examples.

            "abstract": "Climate change is affecting the planet and its human and natural systems at an increasing rate. As temperatures continue to rise, the international community has increasingly been considering adaptation measures to prepare for future climate change. However, most discussion around adaptation strategies has focused on preparedness for some expected amount of climate change impacts, e.g. 2 meters sea level rise.\nIn this study, we discuss adaptation to rates of change as an alternative conceptual framework for thinking about adaptation. Adaptation is not only about adapting to amounts of change, but the rate at which these changes occur is also critically important. We ground our discussion with an example of optimal coastal investment in the face of ongoing sea level rise.\nSea level rise threatens coastal assets. Finite resources could be devoted to building infrastructure further inland or to building coastal defense systems. A possible policy response could be to create a “no-build” coastal buffer zone that anticipates a future higher sea level. We present a quantitative model that illustrates the interplay among various important factors (rate of sea level rise, discount rate, capital depreciation rate, attractiveness of coastal land, etc). For some cases, strategies that combine periodic defensive investments (e.g. dikes) with planned retreat can maximize welfare when adapting to rates of climate change. In other cases, planned retreat may be optimal.\nIt is important to prepare for ongoing increasing amounts of climate change. Preparing for a fixed amount of climate change can lead to a suboptimal solution. Climate is likely to continue changing throughout this century and beyond. To reduce adverse climate impacts, ecosystems and human systems will need to continuously adapt to a moving target.",

Theory predicts that regions of enhanced cold dense plasma density embedded in relatively low background magnetic field (such as the outer equatorial plasmasphere or plasmaspheric plumes) should aid EMIC wave growth. Also, enhanced plasma density lowers the energy threshold for the resonant pitch angle scattering of outer radiation belt electrons such that EMIC waves can interact with electrons with energies below 1 MeV and hence could be a potentially important radiation belt loss mechanism. EMIC wave normal angle and polarization are also important properties that control the efficiency of their interaction with energetic particles. We will review recent statistical and single-event studies and focus on new understanding of EMIC wave characteristics and generation mechanisms in the inner equatorial magnetosphere – information extremely important for understanding energetic particle dynamics and in particular, for radiation belt and ring current modeling.",

            "abstract": "A range of measurement techniques are required to understand atmospheric composition. No single instrument can measure all you need to know about the atmosphere, due to differences in temporal and spatial scales. Satellites help interpret synoptic-scale contributions to composition, but provide little fine-scale information due to sparse measurement timing and spatial averaging. In contrast, ground-based solar-tracking FTIR instruments can capture fine-scale chemistry and dynamic influence, but being point measurements, have trouble identifying transported signals. Knowing the relative contribution of transported to local sources of atmospheric pollution is important for developing realistic air quality policies and providing accurate air quality forecasts.\nIn this study, we exploit the complementary limitations and sensitivities of two instruments to gain information about carbon monoxide (CO) sources at three stations in Australasia: Darwin and Wollongong in Australia and Lauder in New Zealand. Total column amounts of CO are compared between the satellite-borne Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and ground-based solar FTIR instruments in the TCCON and NDACC networks. Several CO timeseries anomalies are highlighted as representative of pollution delivery pathways in relation to local, regional and long-distance contributions. Large-scale pollution events are captured by both instruments, but only the satellite instrument can provide regional and global context. MOPITT identifies long-range transport of pollution from biomass burning in South America and southern Africa, while the FTIR can additionally capture local urban and biomass burning influences. Unusually low CO, sourced from southern latitudes, is also measured by both instruments. Interannual variability is significantly different at each site and is diagnosed with chemical transport modeling (CAM-chem) to quantify the role of emissions versus meteorology.",

Although the largest signal is typically due to the seasonal hydrological cycle, GPS can also measure subtle surface deformation caused by sustained wet and dry periods, and to estimate the spatial distribution of the underlying terrestrial water storage changes. The next frontier is expanding this analysis to the continental scale and paving the way for incorporating GPS models into the National Climate Assessment and into the observational infrastructure for national water resource management. This will require reconciling GPS observations with predictions from hydrological models and with remote sensing observations from a suite of satellite instruments (e.g. GRACE, SMAP, SWOT). The elastic Earth response which transforms surface loads into vertical and horizontal displacements is also responsible for the contamination of loading observations by tectonic and anthropogenic transients, and we discuss these and other challenges to this new application of GPS.",

            "abstract": "Recent airborne and satellite observations suggest large decreases in Arctic sea ice thickness in recent years, but uncertainty remains in terms of overall loss of ice mass versus redistribution of mass within the Arctic Basin. In general though, the combination of airborne and satellite observations tend to agree that some thinning of the ice cover has occurred. In addition to changes in ice thickness and mass, other related changes in properties are likely if the ice pack is undergoing fundamental changes such as a shift to a largely seasonal sea-ice cover. Therefore, it is imperative to utilize airborne and surface-based observations to evaluate satellite-based sea ice products and to improve algorithms that estimate sea ice properties.\nSea ice surface properties derived from NASA’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne measurements are currently being used to evaluate and update Suomi-NPP VIIRS sea ice products. Estimates of ice thickness derived from the OIB observations may be used to establish a relationship between sea ice thickness and the age of the ice. Drifting buoys serve to improve errors in tracking the movement of ice parcels through Arctic waters. Future airborne measurements of spectral reflectance during the melt season will improve algorithms that estimate melt pond fraction. We present examples of airborne validation of VIIRS sea ice products, relationships between sea ice thickness estimated from OIB measurements and sea ice age, and demonstrate the need for future airborne high-resolution estimates of surface reflectance, particularly in melt ponds. OIB thickness estimates over one sea ice age cell (12.5 km box) are shown in the attached figure.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic GPS data analysis has gone through several paradigm shifts since the 1980s. Initially GPS was used in relative positioning mode to leverage and densify the existing global VLBI network. In the 1990s the new paradigm was to analyze GPS as a self-contained system, in which the global network of GPS stations and satellite orbits could be estimated simultaneously. Computational resources limit this approach to a few hundred stations (n ~ 100), with O(n4) computational complexity. Since the last decade, the new paradigm is to estimate GPS orbits first, followed by precise point positioning of single stations with O(n) complexity. This allows for parallel processing of an unlimited number of stations. The Nevada Geodetic Laboratory currently updates GPS time series for over 13,500 stations every week, a number that has been doubling every ~3 years. In some parts of the world, the inter-station distance between GPS stations that we process is now approaching ~10 km. This now brings us to a new paradigm, “GPS Imaging,” for which we use thousands of GPS stations in different continents to generate smooth, yet detailed maps of vertical land motion. Our prototype images show that the striking, first-order signal in North America and Europe is large scale uplift and subsidence from mantle flow driven by Glacial Isostatic Adjustment. Thus we are imaging deep Earth processes with unprecedented scope, resolution and accuracy. At regional scales, the images reveal that anthropogenic lithospheric processes can dominate vertical land motion in extended regions. We have developed prototype techniques that form a foundation to make “GPS Imaging” operational: (1) an automatic, robust estimator of station velocity that is insensitive to prevalent step discontinuities, outliers, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity; (2) a realistic estimate of the velocity errors based on subsampling; (3) a filter of common-mode noise that is globally seamless; (4) a median spatial filter to despeckle the maps; (5) a velocity time series estimator to identify transient behavior; and (6) an integration of InSAR and GPS for fine scale maps of land motion. We predict that “GPS Imaging” is poised to assist the discovery of new natural and anthropogenic signals, and to enable more data-driven approaches to understand Earth processes.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation in dryland ecosystems is highly sensitive to changes in precipitation amount and timing. Globally, forecasted increases in climate aridity and variability in these regions are likely to alter vegetation dramatically. The Colorado Plateau (CP) is an important dryland ecoregion in the southwest United States for which drier and more variable conditions are forecast. The CP is characterized by moderate to high elevations, cold winters, and shallow soils. Vegetation across much of the CP has already undergone significant changes during the past century, that have been largely attributed to grazing intensity and multidecadal shifts in precipitation regime. Long-lived native tree and shrub species (Populus fremontii and Salix exigua) as well as non-natives (Tamarix chinensis and Eleaegnus angustifolia) have filled previously barren streambeds, shifted plant functional type dominance, and remote areas have been colonized by invasive annual plant species. These large shifts in plant functional type have changed leaf area, phenology, and net primary productivity in many habitats, consequently altering the magnitude and timing of evapotranspiration and soil drying. We combine 100 years of historic repeat photography with remote sensing and field observations from across southeastern Utah, USA, to build a model of local water balance with respect to state changes in vegetation, climate, and land use. This model will aid in understanding how vegetation changes influence water cycling, and how climatic and edaphic factors limit the scope of vegetation change.",

Two different styles of enrichment of moderately incompatible elements are present. The first characterized basalts across the ~5 km-wide ridge from >10,000 to ~4000 years ago, whereas the second characterizes more recent basalts erupted in the axial graben. We attribute the first to a higher proportion of pyroxenite to enriched peridotite in the mantle source during ridge inflation. The more recent style reflects the reduced role of pyroxenite after the axial graben formed. The enriched component for both styles is a HIMU-type because it has low 87Sr/86Sr and 176Hf/177Hf relative to 143Nd/144Nd, lower 3He/4He (~8.1 RA) than in the more depleted basalts, shallow slopes on Pb isotope diagrams, and high Nb/LREE ratios. It is regionally widespread and shared with the West Valley and Explorer segments to the north. At least 14 different samplings of mantle components occurred within <1 km of ridge length and width during a time when <1 km of upwelling occurred, indicating that the scale of mantle heterogeneity is <1 km in this setting that is far from a plume.",

            "abstract": "Despite the need for an understanding of terrestrial biospheric carbon fluxes to account for carbon cycle feedbacks and predict future CO2 concentrations, knowledge of such fluxes at the regional scale remains poor. This is particularly true in mountainous areas, where lack of observations combined with difficulties in their interpretation lead to significant uncertainties. Yet mountainous regions are also where significant forest cover and biomass are found—areas that have the potential to serve as carbon sinks.\nIn particular, understanding carbon fluxes in the American West is of critical importance for the U.S. carbon budget, as the large area and biomass indicate potential for carbon sequestration. However, disturbances such as drought, insect outbreak, and wildfires in this region can introduce significant perturbations to the carbon cycle and thereby affect the amount of carbon sequestered by vegetation in the Rockies.\nTo date, there have been few atmospheric CO2 observations in the American Rockies due to a combination of difficulties associated with logistics and interpretation of the measurements in the midst of complex terrain. Among the few sites are those associated with NCAR's Regional Atmospheric Continuous CO2 Network in the Rocky Mountains (Rocky RACCOON). As CO2 observations in mountainous areas increase in the future, it is imperative that they can be properly interpreted to yield information about biospheric carbon fluxes.\nIn this paper, we will present CO2 observations from RACCOON, along with atmospheric simulations that attempt to extract information about biospheric carbon fluxes in the Western U.S. from these observations. We show that atmospheric models can significantly misinterpret the CO2 observations, leading to large errors in the retrieved biospheric fluxes, due to erroneous atmospheric flows. Recommendations for ways to minimize such errors and properly link the CO2 concentrations to biospheric fluxes are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Brown carbon (BrC) is directly measured with high sensitivity by isolating it from black carbon in aerosol extracts and using long path wave-guide spectrophotometry. Ambient measurements by this approach show that BrC is pervasive and can be found in almost all locations, ranging from urban environments to remote continental sites and upper reaches of the free troposphere. Biomass burning appears to be the major source in many urban and rural locations, but other sources of incomplete combustion, such as vehicle emissions in urban environments also play a role. Secondary aerosols not associated with combustion sources may also contribute, but are likely of lesser importance. Studies of ambient wildfire smoke plumes show that BrC levels decrease as it ages, with a half-life of approximately 10 hours. However, a small fraction of the emitted BrC is stable and may account for much of the BrC observed throughout the atmosphere due to widely dispersed and ubiquitous smoke. A radiative transfer model indicates that this background BrC reduced US continental TOA forcing by 20 percent. Human health studies point to similar chemical components linked to BrC (i.e., HULIS), of this same ubiquitous smoke, as a significant source of adverse cardiorespiratory effects. This talk will summarize findings on BrC sources, transformations and estimates of environmental effects based on bulk measurements.",

            "abstract": "A sound understanding of the sediment sources contributing to the sediment flux and the overall sediment budget of a watershed is key to total maximum daily load (TMDL) management strategies that focus on reducing sediment and sediment-related nutrient loadings to streams. This understanding can be provided by performing complementary sediment-source fingerprinting and sediment-budgeting investigations. The sediment fingerprinting approach quantifies the relative proportion of the potential sediment sources and the delivery of sediment from these sources. Sediment budget approaches provide information on the magnitude and location of the fluxes and the links between sources, sinks, and sediment output. Sediment budget approaches can include field based, photogrammetric, GIS, and modeling approaches to identify the important sources, erosion, and storage areas of sediment within a watershed. Combining sediment budget and sediment fingerprinting approaches provides resource managers with information on where to target mitigation measures that reduce erosion, and sediment delivery. Many watersheds across the U.S. have or are soon implementing TMDL allocations to reduce sediment and nutrient loadings. Streambank erosion is typically not accounted for in statistical, empirical, and process-based models, yet it is a major source of sediment in many watersheds. We present several examples of sediment budget and sediment fingerprinting studies from the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the Driftless Area, Wisconsin where information on loading of streambank sediment has been used (successfully) to shape upland and stream corridor management practices.",

            "abstract": "The influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on nitrogen cycling can be profound but catchment scale understanding remains elusive. One of the largest sources of uncertainty is the importance of denitrification. Determining in situ rates of denitrification in elements of landscape that remove a disproportionately high amount of N from certain areas of catchment (hot spots) in response to seasonal and event driven conditions (hot moments) is critical to closing watershed nitrogen budgets. We develop an approach to scale denitrification flux from seasonal soil cores collected in different landscape positions to the entire watershed using a combination of laboratory core experiments, terrain analysis and in situ soil oxygen and soil moisture content sensors. In the Pond Branch watershed in the Piedmont region of Maryland, nitrogen deposition values are relatively high (9kg/ha/yr) with low stream export (0.5 kg/ha/yr). Our data suggest that at least 16-27% of this retention can be accounted for by denitrification in certain areas of the riparian zone. We highlight the importance of riparian microtopography and the need to better link observations and models.",

            "abstract": "To gain insight into overtopping failure of natural and constructed earthen dams, large-scale experiments were done with dams built of damp, compacted, fine-grained sand with nearly trapezoidal cross sections. Both the height and top width were varied, so that the cross-sectional shape ranged approximately from that of embankment or moraine dams to that of landslide dams. Breaching was initiated by cutting a shallow notch across the dam crest and allowing water escaping from a finite upstream reservoir to form its own channel. The channel invariably developed a stepped profile, with steps migrating upstream and coalescing into a headcut. Hydraulic control became established at the channel head, or breach crest, an arcuate erosional feature. Intersection of the migrating headcut with the breach crest triggered rapid, runaway downcutting. Step development and headcut retreat proceeded much more slowly in low dams with wide tops than in tall dams with narrow tops. Photogrammetry and underwater videography showed that the slope of the retreating headcut stayed near the friction angle of the sand and that the evolving flow cross section at the breach crest maintained a geometrically similar shape in 3D. Contrary to a common assumption in dam-breach models, the hydraulic control section was rarely perturbed by slope failures. The idea that hydraulic control reflects tradeoff between sediment delivery by slope failures and sediment removal by fluvial processes is wrong.\nHydrographs were quite reproducible when the time datum was chosen as the time that the migrating headcut reached the breach crest. Peak discharge increased systematically with the initial reservoir water level Z0, a puzzling fact given that that flow depth at the breach crest was nearly always much smaller than Z0, implying that the hydraulics at the breach crest, and thus the local shear stress, should have been nearly independent of Z0. This conundrum may be resolved if breach-crest erosion rate, and hence the flood hydrograph, are primarily controlled not by shear stress at the breach crest, but rather by headcut retreat, which is known to depend upon both and tailwater depth. Because slope failures into the breach channel cause temporary tailwater impoundment, the actual mechanism by which slope failures affect the flood hydrograph is thus identified.",

Despite the growing number of intra-event stable isotope studies, water isotope time series has only been examined for a single AR event to date. Here, we present hourly oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation for two AR events: 1) A December 10-12 event, collected in Santa Clara, CA; and 2) Four precipitation time series collected during the February 6-8 AR event in Cazadero, CA. During the December event, δ18O values decrease steadily from ~ -2 to ~ -20 ‰, with the exception of the 6 hours leading to the passage of the cold front at the surface. During this period, d-excess values decreases by 10-15 ‰, consistent with a transition between multiple moisture sources. Three of four February precipitation events exhibit V-shapes of up to 6 ‰ in δ18O values. Such patterns have been observed in a prior AR event as well as other mid-latitude cyclones, and may reflect changes in post-condensation exchange related to cold front passage. Future work will incorporate additional meteorological in-situ and satellite-derived observations in order to gain insight into the atmospheric river dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Some of the greatest potential impacts from future climate change are tied to extreme atmospheric phenomena that are inherently multiscale, including tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers. Extremes are challenging to simulate in conventional climate models due to existing models’ coarse resolutions relative to the native length-scales of these phenomena. Studying the weather systems of interest requires an atmospheric model with sufficient local resolution, and sufficient performance for long-duration climate-change simulations. To this end, we have developed a new global climate code with adaptive spatial and temporal resolution. The dynamics are formulated using a block-structured conservative finite volume approach suitable for moist non-hydrostatic atmospheric dynamics. By using both space- and time-adaptive mesh refinement, the solver focuses computational resources only where greater accuracy is needed to resolve critical phenomena.\nWe explore different methods for parameterizing sub-grid physics, such as microphysics, macrophysics, turbulence, and radiative transfer. In particular, we contrast the simplified physics representation of Reed and Jablonowski (2012) with the more complex physics representation used in the System for Atmospheric Modeling of Khairoutdinov and Randall (2003). We also explore the use of a novel macrophysics parameterization that is designed to be explicitly scale-aware.",

Samples were collected at a flow rate of 16.7 Lpm for 24 hours on 47 mm diameter cation exchange membranes (CEM) for mercury (Hg) and Teflon membranes for lead isotopes. We compared total mercury collected on CEM filters from the TAPI to that collected with the UNR active Hg membrane system and a Tekran 2537/1130/1135 system for gaseous Hg at a highway-impacted site (elev. 1370 m) from December 2013 to November 2015. The TAPI and UNR active system were also compared at a high elevation site (elev. 2515 m) adjacent to the highway-impacted site from December 2013 to October 2014. Data collection using the TAPI and UNR active system started in spring and summer of 2015 at Great Basin National Park (GBNP) in eastern Nevada. The UNR active system consists of three CEM and nylon filters (with backups in series to catch break through) sampling at a rate of 1 Lpm for 1-to-4 weeks. A Tekran total Hg system (Model 2600) was used for analyses of CEM filters from the two membrane systems after digestion. Lead isotope samples from the TAPI were analyzed on a multi-collector ICPMS (IsoProbe). Both the TAPI system and the UNR active system should collect reactive mercury (RM=GOM+PBM) on the CEM filters. TAPI measurements differed from those obtained using the Tekran system depending on season at the low elevation site and were lower than the UNR active system at the highway-impacted site and the high elevation site. We hypothesize that, due to the high flow rate and therefore short retention time, the TAPI captures mainly PBM. Lead isotopes and the chemical forms of GOM measured with the UNR active system can be used to track sources, which is important in rural areas such as GBNP.",

Many coastal residents and visitors will also be affected by the tsunami caused by the rupture. How can the scientific community effectively communicate with those who are unaware of the threat and unprepared to respond? We are studying the effects of a novel approach to science outreach we have called Flash Mob Science.\nYou have probably seen examples of flash mobs staging dynamic musical and dance routines to unsuspecting audiences. Similarly, Flash Mob Science takes the challenging (and often avoided) topic of earthquake and tsunami awareness and preparedness to unsuspecting audiences. However, Flash Mob Science seeks to move beyond having an audience of observers by engaging others as participants who enact important roles in an unfolding drama. We simulate the effects of seismic and tsunami events (e.g., prolonged surface shaking, falling debris, repeated tsunami surges) and model best practices in response (e.g., “Drop, Cover, Hold On” and moving quickly to high ground). True to the general flash mob model, when the Cascadia event inevitably does occur, it will come suddenly, and everyone affected will unavoidably be involved as actors in a real-life drama of immense scale. We seek to embed the learning of basic understandings and practices for an actual Cascadia event in a very small-scale, memorable, and sometimes even humorous, dramatization.\n We present here the lessons we have learned in the background, planning, and implementation of Flash Mob Science. We highlight the successes, limitations, and preliminary results evaluating the effectiveness of this outreach in developing learners’ understandings and preparedness in an Oregon community affected by the CSZ.",

ClNO2 can impact the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere by production of highly reactive chlorine radical (Cl) and recycling NOx after its photolysis. Subsequent reactions between Cl and volatile organic compounds may enhance photochemical formation of ozone. Despite the potentially important roles of ClNO2 in atmospheric chemistry, its abundance and effect are not well understood in some parts of the world. In late autumn 2013, ClNO2 was measured with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) at a mountain top (957 m a.s.l) in Hong Kong. During 12 nights with continuous CIMS data, elevated concentrations of ClNO2 (>400 ppbv) or its precursor N2O5 (>1000 pptv) were observed on six nights, with the highest ever reported ClNO2 (4.7 ppbv) and N2O5 (7.7 ppbv) in one case. Backward particle dispersion calculations driven by winds simulated with a mesoscale meteorological model show that the ClNO2/N2O5-laden air at the high-elevation site was due to transport of urban/industrial pollution north of the site. The highest ClNO2/N2O5 case was observed in a later period of the night and was characterized with extensively processed air and with the presence of non-oceanic chloride. A chemical box model with detailed chlorine chemistry was used to assess the possible impact of the ClNO2 in the well-processed regional plume on next-day ozone as the air mass continued to downwind locations. The results show that the ClNO2 could enhance ozone up to 23 ppbv or a 22% increase at the ozone peak in the following day. This study demonstrates the importance of the ClNO2 chemistry in polluted environments and highlights the need to consider this process in photochemical models for prediction of ground-level ozone and haze.",

Recently, observation results from different spacecraft, e.g., the STEREO A and B, and ACE, show that some ${}^3$He rich events can cover a very wide longitudinal extent, which is much larger than the area of solar flare. It means that SEPs can be observed on the field lines disconnected far away from the source. For interpreting this phenomenon, SEPs should propagate in the solar atmosphere or cross interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by the effect of perpendicular diffusion. In this work, a Fokker-Planck focus transport equation in three-dimensional Parker IMF is solved numerically. The effects of solar atmosphere propagation and perpendicular diffusion are included in our model, and we compare the simulation results with multi-spacecraft observed at different longitude.

For three-year observation period, JEM-GLIMS succeeded in detecting over 8,000 lightning events and 670 TLEs. The detected optical emissions of sprites showed clear horizontal displacement with the range of 10-20 km from the peak location of the +CG emissions and from the +CG locations detected by NLDN and WWLLN. Using VITF electric field waveform data, source locations of VHF pulses excited by the parent CG discharges are estimated. It is found that the possible VHF source locations were mostly located within the area of the parent lightning emissions. These facts may imply that the center region of the neutralized charge by CG discharges in the thundercloud located near the return stroke point and that the some seed conditions were established in advance at the sprite location before the occurrence of sprites. The global occurrence distributions and rates of lightning discharges and TLEs are also estimated. The estimated mean global occurrence rate of lightning discharges is ~1.5 events/s, which is smaller number than that derived from MicroLab-1/OTD and TRMM/LIS measurements. This may be originated in the fact that JEM-GLISM detected only intense lightning optical events due to the high threshold level for the event triggering. To the contrary, the estimated mean global occurrence rate of TLEs is ~9.8 events/min, which is two times higher than the ISUAL result. It is likely that JEM-GLIMS could detect dimmer optical emissions of TLEs than ISUAL since the distance between the JEM-GLIMS instruments and TLEs is much closer. At the presentation, we will summarize the results derived from three-year JEM-GLIMS nadir observations. We will discuss possible occurrence conditions of sprites, properties of global occurrence rates of lightning and TLEs, and their LT dependences more in detail.",

            "abstract": "Developing robust models of the temperature response and sensitivity of soil respiration is critical for determining changes carbon cycling in response to climate change and at daily to annual time scales. Currently, approaches for measuring temperature dependence of soil respiration generally use long incubation times (days to weeks and months) at a limited number of incubation temperatures. Long incubation times likely allow thermal adaptation by the microbial population so that results are poorly representative of in situ soil responses. Additionally, too few incubation temperatures allows for the fit and justification of many different predictive equations, which can lead to inaccuracies when used for carbon budgeting purposes.\nWe have developed a method to rapidly determine the response of soil respiration rate to wide range of temperatures. An aluminium block with 44 sample slots is heated at one end and cooled at the other to give a temperature gradient from 0 to 55°C at about one degree increments. Soil respiration is measured within 5 hours to minimise the possibility of thermal adaptation. We have used this method to demonstrate the similarity of temperature sensitivity of respiration for different soils from the same location across seasons. We are currently testing whether long-term (weeks to months) incubation alter temperature response and sensitivity that occurs in situ responses. This method is also well suited for determining the most appropriate models of temperature dependence and sensitivity of soil respiration (including macromolecular rate theory MMRT). With additional testing, this method is expected to be a more reliable method of measuring soil respiration rate for soil quality and modelling of soil carbon processes.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini mission has revealed Enceladus to be one of the most dynamic bodies in the solar system, with a cryovolcanic plume that emanates from a subsurface ocean of liquid water [1,2]. The chemical composition of solids and gases in the plume have been determined by the Cassini CDA [2] and INMS instruments [3], respectively. We have shown that measurements of carbonate salts in the plume particles and carbon dioxide in the plume gas can be coupled using a geochemical model of carbonate speciation in Enceladus’ ocean to estimate the pH of the ocean [4]. This leads to a self-consistent pH of 11-12, which is similar to those observed (9-12.5) in low-temperature serpentinization environments on Earth, such as the Lost City hydrothermal field. A high pH is also consistent with theoretical simulations of water-rock interactions that lead to the formation of serpentine [5]. Therefore, the high pH implies serpentinization. This is astrobiologically significant because serpentinization also produces hydrogen gas [4], which allows abiotic organic synthesis that could lead to an origin of life. Moreover, hydrogen could serve as an energy source to support possible microbial life, such as methanogens [6]. These possibilities that arise from the geochemistry of serpentinization are interesting given that Enceladus’ plume contains organic molecules, methane, and possibly hydrogen [3]. The emerging picture of Enceladus’ ocean is a habitable serpentinization environment, although questions remain concerning the timing of serpentinization, and the sources of methane and organic molecules in the plume.

Using the STEREO/STE electron measurements at ~2-20 keV and WIND/3DP measurements at ~20-200 keV, we find that solar wind superhalo electrons are present in the interplanetary medium (IPM) even in absence of any significant solar and interplanetary activity. The observed superhalo electrons generally have a nearly isotropic angular distribution and a power-law energy spectrum, J~E-β. The spectral index β ranges from ~1.5 to ~3.7, with an average of ~2.4. Both the superhalo power-law spectrum and anisotropy show no obvious correlation with sunspot number, solar flares, solar wind core population, etc. These superhalo electrons may form a quiet-time energetic electron background/reservoir in the IPM. They may originate from nonthermal processes related to the acceleration of solar wind, followed by scattering into isotropic angular distributions in the IPM. Another possibility is that superhalo electrons could be formed mainly due to acceleration by wave-particle interactions through the IPM.",

We found that this trend shift was synchronous with similar trend shifts in global oceanic evaporation and in land precipitation in all continents except the Americas. The trend shift in oceanic evaporation occurred mainly in the southern hemisphere (SH) and the subtropical oceans of the northern hemisphere (NH). Because increased oceanic evaporation strengthens the atmospheric moisture transport toward land areas, the synchrony of oceanic evaporation and land precipitation is reasonable. Surface scalar winds over the SH oceans also displayed a positive trend shift. Sea surface temperature (SST) displayed a trend shift in the mid-1980s that was negative (increasing, then decreasing) in the SH and positive in the NH. Although SST had opposite trend shifts in both hemispheres, the trend shift in evaporation was positive in both hemispheres. We infer that because strong winds promote evaporative cooling, the trend shift in SH winds strengthened the trend shifts of both SST and evaporation in the SH. Because high SST promotes evaporation, the trend shift in NH SST strengthened the NH trend shift in evaporation.",

Forest interception studies required to formulate interception processes and to quantify the recharge relevant net precipitation are, however, often only possible at point or experimental plot scale and limited to the studied tree species. Groundwater recharge, in contrast, is often linked to groundwater aquifer boundaries and thus is located at the other end of the spatial scale. To be able to utilize findings from ecohydrological site studies for regional groundwater studies we regionalize field site studies through cloud forest distribution and rainfall interpolation in a semi-arid, data scarce region heavily dependent on groundwater resources. Through different rainfall scenarios, based on regular precipitation and on cloud forest modified precipitation, for two mountainous groundwater recharge catchments we can show that even moderately forested catchments provide up to 1/3 more precipitation through cloud water.",

            "abstract": "Satellite data has proven to be a credible alternative to gauge precipitation for use in hydrologic models as gauge data are sparse and sometimes not available. In the case of large watersheds, the spatial distribution of precipitation is the key for representing hydrologic variability. Spatially distributed gauge data is usually available for experimental watersheds at small scales. Satellite precipitation data such as the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) are the most extensively available global data. TMPA data is available at 0.25° spatial and 3 hour temporal resolution for the latitude band 50°S-50°N . TMPA data has been used in hydrologic models. With the end of the TRMM mission, more-detailed IMERG data is replacing TMPA. IMERG data is available at 0.1° spatial and 0.5 hour temporal resolution for the latitude band 60°S-60°N. IMERG data is in its early stages and its application in hydrologic models has not been extensively tested. The objective of this study is to evaluate IMERG precipitation data in a hydrologic model against gauge, radar and TMPA precipitation. We created a model of the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We have used areal averaging for IMERG, TMPA and radar precipitation data, and Ordinary Krigging (OK) for gauge precipitations to interpolate precipitation data to SWAT model sub-watersheds. Finally, SWAT model simulation results are compared for each precipitation data input. Preliminary results indicated that IMERG data produced promising model performance compare to other precipitation inputs. The calibrated SWAT model results for each precipitation data will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Archean Kongling Complex in the northern Yangtze Craton is an ideal target to investigate the Precambrian accretion and evolution of continental crust in South China. This study aims to unravel the crustal evolution and tectonic setting of the Yangtze Craton during the Paleoproterozoic time, using integrated studies of petrography, zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopes and whole-rock geochemistry of Paleoproterozoic metapelitic rocks in the Kongling Complex. These rocks contain garnet, sillimanite, biotite, plagioclase, minor graphite and ilmenite. Zircons from the samples show nebulous sector-zoning and rim-core structure, suggesting both metamorphic origin and detrital origin with metamorphic overprints. The metamorphic zircons and metamorphic overprints have concordant 207Pb/206Pb age at ~2.0 Ga, while detrital grains yield three distinct concordant-age populations of >2.5 Ga, 2.4–2.2 Ga and 2.2–2.1 Ga. The age patterns indicate that the depositional age of the metasedimentary rocks was 2.1–2.0 Ga. Those 2.2–2.1 Ga detrital zircons with variable εHf(t) values (-7.28 to 2.97) suggest the addition of juvenile materials from depleted mantle to the crust during 2.2–2.1 Ga. The 2.4–2.2 Ga zircons have Hf model ages (TDM2) of ~2.6–3.5 Ga and >2.5 Ga zircons have TDM2 ages varying from 2.9 Ga to 3.3 Ga. The new data suggest that the Kongling Complex was originally a Paleoarchean (old up to 3.5 Ga) continental nucleus, which experienced multiple episodes of growth and reworking events at 3.3–3.2 Ga, 2.9 Ga, 2.7–2.6 Ga, 2.4–2.2 Ga and 2.2–2.1 Ga. In combination with available data, the new results in this study suggest a continent–arc–continent evolution model to explain the tectonic evolution of the Yangtze Craton during the Paleoproterozoic time: the western margin of Yangtze Craton was originally an individual continent, which underwent a reworking event during 2.4–2.2 Ga and a crust growth event caused by continent–arc collision during 2.2–2.1 Ga; it subsequently collided with the Yangtze nucleus at ~2.0 Ga and experienced later ~1.85 Ga extension.",

Remarkable 3-D exposures of the Rosario segment record crustal generation processes in the volcanic rocks and underlying plutonic rocks. In this study, we explore the physical and geochemical connection between the plutonic and volcanic sections of the extensional Alisitos Arc, and elucidate differentiation processes responsible for generating them. These results provide an outstanding analog for extensional active arc systems, such as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc.\nUpper crustal volcanic rocks have a coherent stratigraphy that is 3-5 km thick and ranges in composition from basalt to dacite. The most felsic compositions (70.9% SiO2) are from a welded ignimbrite unit. The most mafic compositions (51.5% SiO2, 3.2% MgO) are found in basaltic sill-like units. Phenocrysts in the volcanic units include plagioclase +/- amphibole and clinopyroxene. The transition to deeper plutonic rocks is clearly an intrusive boundary, where plutonic units intrude the volcanic units. Plutonic rocks are dominantly a quartz diorite main phase with a more mafic, gabbroic margin. A transitional zone is observed along the contact between the plutonic and volcanic rocks, where volcanics have coarsely recrystallized textures. Mineral assemblages in the plutonic units include plagioclase +/- quartz, biotite, amphibole, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene.\nMost, but not all, samples are low K. REE patterns are relatively flat with limited enrichment. Normalization diagrams show LILE enrichment and HFSE depletion, where trends are similar to average IBM values. We interpret plutonic and volcanic units to have similar geochemical relationships, where liquid lines of descent show the evolution of least to most evolved magma types. We provide a model for the formation and magmatic evolution of the Alisitos Arc.",

            "abstract": "The old water paradox describes the rapid mobilization of previously stored water via subsurface flowpaths during a storm event. Old water is usually stored in the subsurface storages. Thus, old water should dominate storm runoff where subsurface flowpaths prevail if mixing with new water is limited. The argumentum e contrario from this understanding raises the following hypothesis: storm hydrographs of catchments with prevailing near surface flowpaths are dominated by new water. We test this hypothesis using data from the scientific literature. The three runoff characteristics hydrograph response (quick or slow), flowpath (surface or subsurface) and time source (old or new water) serve as basis for a conceptual framework of catchment classification where each possible combination of the three characteristics represents a distinct stormflow generation conceptual model. Small forested research catchments for which conceptual models were developed based on field studies were reviewed and assigned to this classification system. Of the 42 reviewed catchments, 30 provide a complete set of the three characteristics resulting in one of the 8 conceptual models. Four catchments support our hypothesis, however, a larger field support exists for subsurface than for surface flowpath dominated sites. Hence, the resulting theory that hydrographs are dominated by new water where surface flowpaths prevail remains highly uncertain. Two explanations exist for the imbalance of field support between the two flowpath classes: 1) the selection of sites in past field studies was mainly to explain quick hydrograph response in subsurface flowpaths dominated catchments; 2) sites with prevailing subsurface flowpaths are more common in nature. We conclude that field studies at sites covering a broader range of characteristics are necessary to understand stormflow generation. The collection of catchments also allows us to test how the three runoff characteristics relate to climate, soils and other catchment characteristics, which may provide important information to improve future predictions.",

            "abstract": "Herein we present the geologic mapping of the Ac-H-8 Nawish Quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres, produced on the basis of the Dawn spacecraft data. The Ac-H-08 Nawish quadrangle is located between -22°S and 22°N and between 144°E and 216°E.\nAt the north-east border, a polygonal, 75km-wide crater named Nawish gives the name to the whole quadrangle. An unamed, partially degraded, 100km-diameter crater is evident in the lower central sector of the quadrangle. Bright materials have been mapped and are associated with craters. For example, bright materials occur in the central peak region of Nawish crater and in the ejecta of an unnamed crater, which is located in the nearby quadrangle Ac-H-09. The topography of the area obtained from stereo-processing of imagery shows an highland in the middle of the quadrangle. Topography is lower in the northern and southern borders, with a altitude span of about 9500 meters.\nAt the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including grayscale and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) images in January 2016.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of the thermosphere has improved considerably since 2000 thanks to the availability of high-resolution accelerometer inferred densities. Consequently, precision and shortcomings of thermosphere models are better known. Thermosphere density forecast accuracy is limited by: 1) the accuracy of the thermosphere model 2) the solar and geomagnetic activity forecast 3) the quality of the data assimilation system. The precision of semi-empirical thermosphere models is 10-25%. Solar activity forecasts can be accurate up to 5 days. They become less accurate with time, but some proxies are more forecastable than others. Geomagnetic activity forecasting is more problematic, since in most cases storm events cannot be predicted on any time scale.\nThe forecast accuracy is ultimately bounded by the thermosphere model precision and the (varying) degree to which mainly the solar proxy represents EUV heating of the atmosphere. Both errors can be corrected for by means of near real time (nrt) assimilation of satellite drag data, provided that the data is of high quality. At present, only the classified High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model of the Air Force has that capability operationally, even if other prototype nrt models have been developed. Data assimilation significantly improves density forecasts up to 72-hours out; there is no gain for longer periods due to the short memory of the thermosphere system. Only physical models, e.g. TIMEGCM and CTIPe, can in principle reproduce the dynamic changes in density for example during geomagnetic storms. However, accurate information on atmospheric heating is often missing, or not used. When it is, observed and modeled Traveling Atmospheric Disturbances are very similar. Nonmigrating tides and waves propagating from the lower atmosphere cause longitudinal density variations; sources of geophysical noise for semi-empirical models, they can be predicted qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively with physical models.\nThis presentation will give a summary of density modeling and forecasting by addressing all the above listed items.",

            "abstract": "After completing its primary science mission, ESA decided to do a risky aerobraking campaign with Venus Express (VEx) in order to gain operational experience as well as to measure high-resolution density profiles at high northern latitude. VEx was in a polar and highly eccentric orbit (e=0.84). In the aerobraking period from 24 June to 11 July 2014, the pericenter was at 75°N at an altitude of 130-134 km, and the local solar time drifted from 6.2 to 4.5 hr.\nOne density profile extending about 3° in latitude on both sides of the pericenter has been obtained for each of the 18 consecutive days at 1 Hz sampling, after ingestion of the 8 Hz accelerometer data in the GINS software. The uncertainty in the derived density is the sum of a systematic part due to the uncertainty in Cd, estimated to be 10%, and a noise and bias part due to the accelerometers. Using the accelerometer errors according to specifications, a signal-to-noise ratio of one is reached on average at 139 km altitude.\nThe validity range of the VEx densities can also be evaluated by means of comparison with a model. The VEx-to-VTS3 density ratios were computed for each profile, and these results are consistent with the specified instrument resolution. VEx densities are on average nearly a factor of 2 smaller than VTS3, which is in agreement with Precise Orbit Determination results obtained for higher altitudes (160-170 km). However, variability of up to tens of percent is visible in the form of wavelike activity as well as an altitude-dependent variation that is revealed by ratios that become smaller towards the start and end of the profile. The latter model error hints at an inaccurate the temperature profile, errors in constituent concentrations, or both. The waves can be interpreted as a superposition of two wave trains with wavelengths of around 100 km and 250 km. Average scale heights over the range of observations (130-140 km) are found to be 2.9+/-0.6 km.",

            "abstract": "Since the appearance of the first IBEX ENA fullsky maps in 2009 up to the present time it remained an open question what ENA sources are reponsible for the famous \"IBEX-ribbon\" feature. Both innerheliospheric and outerheliospheric ENA sources still today compete as reponsible candidates for that feature. Whether the ribbon-producing ENA`s are due to charge exchange processes inside or outside the heliopause is an outstanding question up to the present days. The answer, as I will show, will surely come with an extended energy range of the ENA detector and with a better time resolution in ENA maps, helping to control the reflection of temporal variations of solar wind flux patterns in ENA features as it all will be realized with IMAP.\nA second open question concerns the compressibility of the heliosheath plasma. Incompressibility prevails under very low Mach number flows or very high effective sound speeds, as could be realized by hot PUI`s or hot electrons downstream of the termination shock. Hot suprathermal electrons have been predicted, but not yet confirmed by VOYAGER measurements. At the low energy side of the spectrum this is explained by the negative charge-up of the spacecraft, at the medium energy range (0.5-1.0 MeV) shock-processed suprathermal electrons are likely to in fact explain the observations.\nFurthermore these electrons would directly influence the electrostatic wave characteristics in the heliosheath leading to unexpected propagation properties of such waves. To clarify on some of these points IMAP should have a sensitive electron detector which could monitor solar wind electron properties at passages of travelling shocks and thus prove the efficiency of shock processing.\nIf in fact hot electrons have to be expected in the heliosheath, then electron impact ionization processes have to be studied in new details, and the question may arise whether also LISM helium under these new auspices becomes partially ionized when crossing the heliosheath.",

            "abstract": "A 12 m long sediment sequence from Dendi Crater lakes, located on the central Ethiopian Plateau, was analysed with sedimentological and geochemical methods to reconstruct the regional environmental history. Bulk organic carbon samples from 23 horizons throughout the sequence were used for AMS radiocarbon dating and indicate that the sediment sequence spans the last ca. 12 cal kyr BP. Microscope analyses and sedimentological data reveal three tephra layers, of which the most prominent layer with a thickness of ~2 m was deposited at 10.2 cal kyr BP and probably originates from an eruption of the Wenchi crater 12 km to the west of the Dendi lakes. Sedimentological data of the pelagic deposits indicate shifts in erosion and rainfall throughout the record. A decrease in Ca and Sr at 11.6 cal kyr BP is related to the shift of less humid condition during the Younger Dryas (YD) to the return to full humid conditions of the African Humid Period (AHP). Single thin horizons with high carbonate content or high Ti and K imply that short spells of dry conditions and significantly increased rainfall superimpose the generally more humid conditions during the AHP. The end of the AHP is gradual. Relatively stable and less humid conditions characterised the Dendi Crater lakes until around 3.9 cal kyr BP. A highly variable increase in clastic matter over the last 1500 years indicates higher erosion due to short-term variations in precipitation within the Dendi catchment. Overall, the sediment record suggests moderate change of precipitation during the Holocene, which is probably due to their exposed location in the Ethiopian highlands. The data from the Dendi Crater lakes show, in concert with other records from the Nile catchment and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS), that the Blue Nile provided the main freshwater source for maintaining EMS stratification and sapropel S1 formation between ca. 10.0 and 8.7 cal kyr BP. Subsequent aridification is recorded from equatorial East Africa to the northeastern Mediterranean and peaked with some regional differences between ca. 4.0 and 2.6 cal kyr BP. Significant higher discharge in the Blue Nile hydraulic regime after 2.6 cal kyr BP is probably triggered by more local changes in precipitation, which are tentatively caused by a change in the influence of the Indian Ocean.",

The evolving stability of bridgmanite as well as core formation incorporating light elements are but two of the many processes involving the cycling of oxygen between different Earth reservoirs in the early Earth. Laboratory studies of the relevant minerals at the appropriate pressure and temperature conditions have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of redox processes in the Earth’s interior, where iron plays a central role as the only major element with multiple electronic configurations (oxidation and spin state). Mössbauer spectroscopy has been a key player and recent developments coupling the laser heated diamond anvil cell with a synchrotron has enabled energy domain Mössbauer data on iron-containing phases to be collected in only a few hours (or less) at pressures and temperatures up to those near the Earth’s core. The presentation will showcase recent results on both quenched phases and in situ studies and discuss their implications for the deep oxygen cycle in the early Earth.",

            "abstract": "Seismic loss estimation is essential to incorporate seismic risk of structures into an efficient decision-making framework. Evaluation of seismic damage of structures requires a multidisciplinary approach including earthquake source characterization, seismological prediction of earthquake-induced ground motions, prediction of structural responses exposed to ground shaking, and finally estimation of induced damage to structures. As the study region, Erzincan, a city on the eastern part of Turkey is selected which is located in the conjunction of three active strike-slip faults as North Anatolian Fault, North East Anatolian Fault and Ovacik fault. Erzincan city center is in a pull-apart basin underlain by soft sediments that has experienced devastating earthquakes such as the 27 December 1939 (Ms=8.0) and the 13 March 1992 (Mw=6.6) events, resulting in extensive amount of physical as well as economical losses. These losses are attributed to not only the high seismicity of the area but also as a result of the seismic vulnerability of the constructed environment. This study focuses on the seismic damage estimation of Erzincan using both regional seismicity and local building information. For this purpose, first, ground motion records are selected from a set of scenario events simulated with the stochastic finite fault methodology using regional seismicity parameters. Then, existing building stock are classified into specified groups represented with equivalent single-degree-of-freedom systems. Through these models, the inelastic dynamic structural responses are investigated with non-linear time history analysis. To assess the potential seismic damage in the study area, fragility curves for the classified structural types are derived. Finally, the estimated damage is compared with the observed damage during the 1992 Erzincan earthquake. The results are observed to have a reasonable match indicating the efficiency of the ground motion simulations and building analyses.",

            "abstract": "Fischer-Tropsch Type (FTT) reactions, e.g., the Sabatier synthesis between H2 and CO2, are considered a main source of abiotic methane on Earth and likely on other planets. Several laboratory FTT experiments demonstrated abiotic CH4 production at temperatures above 200°C, by using Fe, Ni or Cr catalysts, simulating hydrothermal conditions in peridotite-hosted systems in mid-ocean ridges. Nevertheless, at least on laboratory experiment time-scale, Fe-Ni-Cr catalysts do not support CH4 generation at T<100°C, such as those of land-based serpentinization systems. We have recently reported rapid production of considerable amounts of CH4 (>800 ppmv in 155 mL bottles after 1 day) via Sabatier reaction at 90, 50 and 25°C, using small concentrations of non-pretreated ruthenium (Ru) equivalent to those occurring in chromitites in continental ultramafic rocks (Etiope & Ionescu, 2014; Geofluids, doi:10.1111/gfl.12106). We have repeated the experiments by using 13C-enriched CO2 and we confirm fast production of CH4at percentage levels. The experiments performed so far show that:\n1. considerable amounts of CH4can be produced in dry conditions below 100°C with small quantities of Ru;\n2. under the same experimental conditions (<100°C), Fe, Ni and Cr oxides do not produce CH4;\n3. low T Sabatier reaction can produce CH4 with a large C isotope fractionation between CO2 and CH4, leading to relatively “ light” (13C-depleted) CH4, resembling microbial gas;\n4. the CO2-CH4isotope separation decreases over time and by increasing the temperature;\n5. minor amounts of C2-C6hydrocarbons are also generated.\nOur laboratory data are compatible with the isotopic patterns of CH4 naturally occurring in land-based seeps and springs. Our experiments suggest that Ru-enriched chromitites could potentially generate CH4 at low T. Since Ru is reported in Martian meteorites, low T abiotic CH4 production on Mars via Sabatier reaction cannot be excluded (Etiope et al. 2013, Icarus, 224, 276-285).",

            "abstract": "Climate warming over the 20th century has caused drastic changes in mountain glaciers globally, and of the Himalayan glaciers in particular. The stakes are high; glaciers and ice caps are the largest contributor to the increase in the mass of the world's oceans, and the Himalayas play a key role in the hydrology of the region, impacting on the economy, food safety and flood risk. Partial monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers has revealed a contrasted picture; while many of the Himalayan glaciers are retreating, in some cases locally stable or advancing glaciers in this region have also been observed. Several studies based on field measurements or remote sensing have shown a dominant slow-down of mountain glaciers globally in response to these changes. But they are restricted to a few glaciers or small regions and none has analysed the dynamic response of glaciers to climate changes at regional scales.\nHere we present a region-wide analysis of annual glacier flow velocity covering the Pamir-Karakoram-Himalaya region obtained from the analysis of the entire archive of Landsat data. Over 90% of the ice-covered regions, as defined by the Randolph Glacier Inventory, are measured, with precision on the retrieved velocity of the order of 4 m/yr. The change in velocities over the last 25 years will be analysed with reference to regional glacier mass balance and topographic caracteristics. We show that the first order temporal evolution of glacier flow mirrors the pattern of glacier mass balance. We observe a general decrease of ice velocity in regions of known ice mass loss, and a more complex patterns consisting of mixed acceleration and decrease of ice velocity in regions that are known to be affected by stable mass balance and surge-like behavior.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal reservoirs hosted in volcanic rocks, like the Rotokawa Geothermal Field in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand, typically contain fracture networks that control fluid flow. Realistic discrete fracture network (DFN) models have the potential to improve geothermal resource management. However, the spatial distribution and geometries of fracture networks are often poorly understood due to limited data and complex deformation histories including lava emplacement, subsequent burial and faulting.\nTo understand better the distribution of fractures formed during lava emplacement, we study andesitic flow exposures from Mt Ruapehu, at the southern end of the TVZ. Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) acquisition on three 50-200 m2 outcrops provided large 3D point clouds of the shape of the outcrop. Delineation of thousands of individual fractures has been semi-automated using local geometrical constraints and a shape detection algorithm detecting planar and curved surfaces. Fracture orientation, length, area, linear (P10) and areal (P20) densities from the TLS data provide input parameters for the DFN models. Fracture detection is validated using high-resolution panoramic photographs (GigaPan) and manual scanline measurements. Cooling joints are highly connected via sub-horizontal joints that are aligned with vesicular layers. UCS tests show a mechanical anisotropy between vertical and horizontal samples. Most of the cooling joints terminate within or at the brecciated margins of individual flows which contrast mechanically with the massive flow interior. Thus, highly connected and curved fractures are mostly confined to lava flows.\nThis study provides a framework for developing DFNs for geothermal reservoirs hosted in andesitic flows based on empirical observations of intrinsic fracturing and mechanical anisotropies of the host lithology. Fractures in individual lava flows may be interconnected in the reservoir by a combination of cooling joints, subsequent tectonic fault zones and hydrothermal fractures. The combination of TLS, Gigapan and manual scanlines is widely applicable to constraining DFNs other geological settings.",

            "abstract": "Deep interiors of massive icy satellites such as Titan and Ganymede probably harbor a buried ocean above high-pressure (HP) ice layers. The nature and location of the lower interface of the ocean is ultimately controlled by the amount of heat transferred through the surface ice Ih layer but it also involves equilibration of heat and melt transfer in the HP ices. While the Rayleigh number associated to such HP ice layers is most probably supercritical, classical subsolidus convection might not be a viable mechanism as the radial temperature gradient in the cold boundary layer is likely to exceed the slope of the melting curve.\nA significant part of the heat transfer could be achieved via the mass flux of warm liquid through this cold boundary layer up to the global phase boundary, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as heat-pipe mechanism. We present 3D spherical simulations of thermal convection in these HP ice layers that address for the first time this complex interplay. First, scaling relationships are proposed to describe this configuration for a large range of Rayleigh numbers and solidus curves. We then focus on a more realistic set-up where a prescribed basal heat flux is considered in a plausible range for the thermal history of Ganymede or Titan together with the expected viscosity law for HP ices.",

            "abstract": "The surface morphology of coastlines has been observed to be fractal over different length-scales. Whether this phenomena extends into the subsurface has not been previously examined. Recent assessments of shoreline change suggest that the statistical behavior of shoreline change is self-affine, where the nonstationary time-series exhibits long-range dependence (LRD) that can be approximated by a power law. The scaling exponent determines the fractal dimension where high spectral power at low frequencies dominates shoreline position over large spatial scales (~ 101 to 102 km). Here, we explore the fractality of subsurface barrier island framework geology through the lens of a portable electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor. Responses of apparent conductivity σa measured by the EMI sensor at 3 kHz (~ 4 m depth) were collected along two alongshore surveys (100 and 10 km) in Padre Island National Seashore, Texas, USA. A 10 m step-size was used for the 100 km survey, whereas a 1 m step-size was used for the 10 km survey. Thus, each spatial data series consists of n ~ 10,000 data points enabling detailed tests for LRD using traditional wavelet analysis and unconventional forecasting FARIMA techniques. In general, high powers in the wavelets correspond to previously-identified Pleistocene paleo-channels suggesting that lower-frequencies dominate the signal and are geologically controlled. Higher frequencies are proposed to reflect small-scale variations in changing hydrology. Tests for LRD by the Hurst exponent and PSD plots suggest that autocorrelations are stronger in measurements that are closer together (i.e., 1 vs 10 m step-size) over the sensor footprint. Nonetheless, the scaling exponents for both surveys suggest that σa responses are fractal signals (over different spatial scales), reflecting a very rough distribution of varying barrier island framework geology.",

            "abstract": "Long-period long-duration (LPLD) seismic events are low-amplitude tremor-like signals that have been observed in microseismic datasets acquired during hydraulic fracturing operations. These events have been interpreted to be associated with slow-slip along pre-existing fractures that are presumed to have either high clay content or to be misaligned with respect to the current day principal stress directions. However a recent study suggested that regional earthquakes could be misinterpreted as LPLD events when recorded in a vertical downhole monitoring array, and that careful analysis must be undertaken when analyzing and interpreting such events. Using data from a hydraulic fracturing microseismic data set including well-documented LPLD events, together with data from the EarthScope Transportable USArray, we investigate the hypothesis that the documented LPLD events are regional earthquakes.\nThe NEIC earthquake catalog recorded two regional earthquakes (magnitudes >2.9) concurrent with the hydraulic fracturing operation. The observed LPLD events do not correlate in time with the catalogued regional earthquakes, however they do share many important seismic waveform characteristics. Interestingly, the EarthScope Transportable USArray recorded signals associated in time with the LPLD events at distances up to 350 km from the injection well.\nThe similarities in the signal characteristics suggest that LPLD events could be regional earthquakes that are too small in magnitude to be recorded and published in the NEIC earthquake catalog. The spatial coverage of the USArray enabled many of the LPLD events to be relocated outside the stimulated volume of the reservoir, thus verifying that they are regional earthquakes of relatively small magnitude rather than locally sourced events related to the hydraulic fracture stimulation process.",

            "abstract": "Shear displacements in upper crustal faults are typically localized within cm- to m-thick high strain fault cores composed of interlayered tabular domains of cataclasite and gouge. Evidence from exhumed/exposed seismic faults shows that the great majority of co-seismic slip is taken up along narrow (<10 cm) ultracataclasite slip zones, containing thin (<100μm) principal slip zones (PSZ) bounded by sharp, polished and striated principal slip surfaces (PSS). Even in unconsolidated materials deformed near to the surface, seismogenic slip is observed to localize within discrete, narrow PSZs.\nTheoretical studies suggest that in all but the shallowest settings, the natural PSZs may be sufficiently thin to generate localised frictional heating that potentially promotes thermally-activated dynamic weakening mechanisms. We can recreate these processes in the laboratory using displacement-controlled friction experiments performed in a rotary shear apparatus on fault gouges of known composition deformed at seismic slip rates (v > 1ms-1) and normal stresses of up to 20 MPa. A sequential sampling approach is used in which slip is arrested at different stages of the observed friction evolution (e.g. post-compaction, peak friction, steady state after weakening). This allows the evolution of gouge microstructures and deformation mechanisms in the experimental samples to be: a) related to the evolving temperature regimes in the PSZ and changing mechanical behavior; and b) compared to natural PSZ/PSSs.\nUsing this approach we have investigated the behavior and deformation mechanisms of gouges made of common, rock-forming minerals (calcite, clays, olivine, quartz) both in pure form and, in some cases, as mixed compositions deformed under a range of experimental conditions. We have studied the effects of varying confining pressure, fluid content (room humidity vs water saturated) and composition (de-ionized water vs brine) and slip rate (e.g. seismic vs. sub-seismic). Our findings – and those of others – reveal a startling diversity of ‘non-brittle’ micro- to nano-scale deformation processes (e.g. viscous GBS, particulate flow). This has implications for our understanding of the frictional strength of faults, the recognition of past seismogenic events in natural examples and the forecasting of future earthquakes.",

In addition, we compared the magnetic properties of the transplants to those carried by native thalli of the lichen Xanthoria parietina and neighboring soils, barks and rocks. The data indicated a substantial homogenous magnetic mineralogy, with the exception of a sample collected from a basalt quarry. The transplants showed an excellent correlation between the saturation remanent magnetization (Mrs) and the concentration of Fe; the concentrations of the elements linked to cement production also correlated to Mrs values, apart from the basalt quarry sample.\nIn the second context, we characterized the magnetic properties of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea transplanted near a cement plant in NE Italy. The transplants were exposed for 2 months in 40 sites distributed in surrounding rural, urban and industrial areas. In this case, the agreement between the magnetic and elemental datasets pointed out a modest environmental impact of the cement plant compared to the neighboring industrial activities, which resulted in significantly higher values of the concentration-dependent magnetic parameters.\nMagnetic analyses on lichens can expand the dataset of passive dust collectors in environmental magnetism, with the advantage, for the transplants, of precisely knowing the exposure time and the initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "The UK TIMES model (UKTM) succeeds the UK MARKAL as the underlying model of the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) for long term energy system planning and policy development. It generates energy system pathways which achieve the 80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target by 2050, stipulated in the UK Climate Change Act (2008), at the least possible cost. Some of these pathways prescribe large-scale deployment of solar PV and indigenously sourced bioenergy, which are land intensive and could result in significant land use transitions; but would this create competition and stress for UK land use?\nTo answer the above question, this study uses an integrated spatio-temporal modelling approach, ForeseerTM, which characterises the interdependencies between the energy and land systems by evaluating the land required under each pathways for solar PV and bioenergy, based on scenarios of a range of PV conversion efficiencies, and energy crop yield projections. The outcome is compared with availability of suitable locations for solar PV and sustainable limits of agricultural land appropriation for bioenergy production to assess potential stresses and competition with other land use services.\nPreliminary results show UKTM pathways could pose significant impact on the UK land use system. Bioenergy deployment could potentially compete with other land services by taking up a significant part of the available UK agricultural land thus competing directly with food production, most notably livestock production. For pathways with significant solar PV deployment, direct competition would not be focussed on the high quality land used for food crop production but rather for land used for livestock production and other ecosystem services.",

Increased light transmission leads to increased deposition of solar energy in the upper ocean and thus plays a crucial role in the amount and timing of sea-ice-melt and under-ice primary production. Recent developments in underwater technology provide new opportunities to undertake challenging research at the largely inaccessible underside of sea ice. We measured spectral under-ice radiance and irradiance onboard the new Nereid Under-Ice (NUI) underwater robotic vehicle, during a cruise of the R/V Polarstern to 83°N 6°W in the Arctic Ocean in July 2014. NUI is a next generation hybrid remotely operated vehicle (H-ROV) designed for both remotely-piloted and autonomous surveys underneath land-fast and moving sea ice. Here we present results from one of the first comprehensive scientific dives of NUI employing its interdisciplinary sensor suite. We combine under-ice optical measurements with three-dimensional under-ice topography and aerial images of the surface conditions. We investigate the influence of spatially varying ice-thickness and surface properties during summer on the spatial variability of light transmittance. Results show that surface properties dominate the spatial distribution of the under-ice light field on small scales (<1000m²), while sea ice-thickness is the most important predictor for light transmission on larger scales. In addition, we suggest an algorithm to obtain histograms of light transmission from distributions of sea ice thickness and surface albedo.",

Using the work by Peyrillé and Lafore (2007) as a starting point, the framework is adapted to studying the annual cycle. A suitable forcing methodology for temperature and humidity is derived allowing the 2D model to reproduce the main features of the WAM.\nA budget analysis of the simulated temperature and humidity variables leads to a picture of the ITCZ seasonal displacement, for which the moistening on the northern side of the ITCZ is key. It is due to the near surface moisture advection by the monsoon flow to the north of the ITCZ, in addition to the turbulent fluxes and shallow convection which transport humidity to the top of the PBL. On a larger scale, the warming of the Saharan Heat Low by turbulence and radiation and the cooling/moistening within the ITCZ by convective downdrafts reinforces the monsoon flow. The mechanism seems at play during the whole seasonal cycle, which is seen as a steady translation of these structures.\nSensitivity experiments show the importance of the low level processes such as downdrafts, horizontal advection and water recycling. Although advection is the 1st order process, the water recycling appears as a key element by directly modulating the intensity of rainfall and by allowing the convective downdraft to feed back onto the WAM.",

            "abstract": "The dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt, is being closely investigated by the NASA Dawn mission since the beginning of 2015. The Visible InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard Dawn has obtained hyperspectral images of Ceres, with spatial resolution increasing with decreasing distance from the surface. Using its overall spectral range from 0.25 to 5.1 µm, VIR will ultimately enable a comprehensive mapping of Ceres' mineralogy and surface temperature. Prior to Dawn, Ceres was extensively observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which resulted in low-resolution (30 km/px) albedo and color maps in the UV-VIS spectral domain. During the approach phase VIR acquired data with a spatial resolution of ~11 km/px, and confirmed the regional color trends identified by HST earlier. In the subsequent Survey mission phase hyperspectral coverage of Ceres was obtained at ~1.3 km/px, while in the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) the nominal spatial resolution will be ~0.4 km/px. Unlike Vesta, which was investigated by Dawn in 2011-2012, the spectrum of Ceres does not display prominent absorption bands in the VIS-near IR range. Ground-based observations of Ceres highlighted a decrease in reflectance shortward of 0.4 µm and the existence of a broad absorption feature in the 3-µm region, associated with hydrated minerals. VIR data are key to unveiling the surface composition of Ceres at different spatial scales, providing answers to several unsolved questions. Compositionally homogeneous surface units, emerging in the VIS-IR spectral range sampled by VIR, are presented here for the first time. These units and their degree of similarity in terms of spectral parameters might provide insight on the surface processes that led to the composition observed nowadays.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes with magnitudes close to, and exceeding, Mw8 have long been expected along the Himalayan arc. A repeat of the 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake was expected to cause heavy damage, with as many as 40,000 fatalities in Kathmandu Valley. The 2015 Gorkha earthquake was smaller than the 1934 event, but unlike the 1934 earthquake, involved rupture of the segment of the Main Central Thrust directly beneath the valley. Despite the large magnitude and proximity to the valley, the damage was lower than expected. Throughout Kathmandu Valley as well as the near-field region, European Macroseismic Scale intensities exceeded 8 in only rare instances. The extent of landsliding and liquefaction was also lower than had been expected (Collins and Jibson, 2015). Strong motion data from one conventional (NetQuakes) instrument, several low-cost MEMS accelerometers, and high-rate GPS provide insights into the extent to which mainshock and aftershock ground motions were controlled by source, path, and site effects. Mainshock horizontal peak accelerations recorded in central Kathmandu were ≈0.16g, with shaking strongly peaked near 5 s. The long period character of the mainshock can be attributed in part to source properties (Avouac et al., 2015). The expected basin response resonance (≈1-3-s period) is, however, also absent in the mainshock coda, but present in the coda of large aftershocks. A progressive shift in predominant period is also observed over ≈10 minutes following the mainshock. We conclude that shallow soft sediments underlying Kathmandu Valley responded nonlinearly during the mainshock, such that the predominant period of amplification was shifted to longer periods than the weak-motion resonance, and high frequencies were deamplified. Mainshock ground motions, controlled by site and well as source effects, were therefore concentrated at periods that were too long to significantly impact vernacular structures in Kathmandu Valley, most of which are between 3-10 stories.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of the magma ascent rate is a key factor in predicting styles of volcanic activity and relies on the understanding of how strongly the ascent rate is controlled by different magmatic parameters. The ability to link potential changes in such parameters to monitoring data is an essential step to be able to use these data as a predictive tool. We present the results of a suite of conduit flow models that assess the influence of individual model parameters such as the magmatic water content, temperature or bulk magma composition on the magma flow in the conduit during an extrusive dome eruption. By systematically varying these parameters we assess their relative importance to changes in ascent rate. The results indicate that potential changes to conduit geometry and excess pressure in the magma chamber are amongst the dominant controlling variables that effect ascent rate, but the single most important parameter is the volatile content (assumed in this case as only water). Modelling this parameter across a range of reported values causes changes in the calculated ascent velocities of up to 800%, triggering fluctuations in ascent rates that span the potential threshold between effusive and explosive eruptions.",

Currently it is hypothesized that climate change\nwill exacerbate current trends leading a more severe and extended\ndroughts, as well as, larger than normal recovery periods. Current\nassessments, however, lack of a consistent framework to deal with\ncompatible initial conditions for the impact models and a set of\nstandardized historical and future forcings.\nThe ISI-MIP project provides an unique opportunity to understand the\npropagation of model and forcing uncertainty into century-long time\nseries of drought characteristics using an ensemble of model predictions\nacross a broad range of climate scenarios and regions. In the present\nstudy, we analyze this issue using the hydrologic simulations carried\nout with HYPE, mHM, SWIM, VIC, and WaterGAP3 in seven large continental\nriver basins: Amazon, Blue Nile, Ganges, Niger, Mississippi, Rhine,\nYellow. All models are calibrated against observed streamflow during\nthe period 1971-2001 using the same forcings based on the WATCH data\nsets. These constrained models were then forced with bias corrected\noutputs of five CMIP-5 GCMs under four RCP scenarios (i.e. 2.6, 4.5,\n6.0, and 8.5 W/m2) for the period 1971-2099.\nA non-parametric kernel density approach is used to estimate the\ntemporal evolution of a monthly runoff index based on simulated\nstreamflow. Hydrologic simulations corresponding to each GCM during the\nhistoric period of 1981-2010 serve as reference for the estimation of\nthe basin specific monthly probability distribution functions. GCM\nspecific reference pdfs are then used to recast the future hydrologic\nmodel outputs from different RCP scenarios. Based on these results,\ndrought severity and duration are investigated during periods: 1)\n2006-2035, 2) 2036-2065 and 3) 2070-2099. Two main hypothesis are\ninvestigated: 1) model predictive uncertainty of drought indices among\ndifferent hydrologic models is negligible compared to the uncertainty\noriginated from different GCMs and 2) the projected drift of drought\ncharacteristics is hydrologic model independent and it is only driven by\nthe GCM variability.

            "abstract": "Compaction bands in sandstone are laterally-extensive planar deformation features that are characterized by lower porosity and permeability than the surrounding host rock. As a result, this form of localization has important implications for both strain partitioning and fluid flow in the Earth’s upper crust. To better understand the time-dependency of compaction band growth, we performed triaxial deformation experiments on water-saturated Bleurswiller sandstone (initial porosity = 0.24) under constant stress (creep) conditions in the compactant regime. Our experiments show that inelastic strain accumulates at a constant stress in the compactant regime, manifest as compaction bands. While creep in the dilatant regime is characterized by an increase in porosity and, ultimately, an acceleration in axial strain rate to shear failure, compaction creep is characterized by a reduction in porosity and a gradual deceleration in axial strain rate. The global decrease in the rates of axial strain, acoustic emission energy, and porosity change during creep compaction is punctuated at intervals by higher rate excursions, interpreted as the formation of compaction bands. The growth rate of compaction bands formed during creep is lower as the applied differential stress, and hence background creep strain rate, is decreased. However, the inelastic strain associated with the growth of a compaction band remains constant over strain rates spanning several orders of magnitude (from 10–8 to 10–5 s–1). We find that, despite the large differences in strain rate and growth rate (from both creep and constant strain rate experiments), the characteristics (geometry, thickness) of the compaction bands remain essentially the same. Several lines of evidence, notably the similarity between the differential stress dependence of creep strain rate in the dilatant and compactant regimes, suggest that, as for dilatant creep, subcritical stress corrosion cracking is the mechanism responsible for compactant creep in our experiments. Our study highlights that stress corrosion is an important mechanism in the time-dependent porosity loss, subsidence, and permeability reduction of sandstone reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "The successful completion of NASA’s Kepler Mission has led to renewed interest in the definition and boundaries of the circumstellar habitable zone (HZ), where liquid water can be stable on a planet’s surface. Goldblatt et al. [1] showed that the runaway greenhouse effect, which defines the inner edge of the HZ, depends critically on absorption coefficients of H2O obtained from the new HITEMP database. Kopparapu et al. [2,3] followed up on this observation by recalculating HZ boundaries using HITEMP coefficients. This caused the inner edge to move out to 0.99 AU in their (fully saturated, cloud-free) 1-D climate model. Leconte et al. [4] then used a 3-D climate model to show that the inner edge moves back in to 0.95 AU when relative humidity and clouds are taken into account. In their model, however, the upper stratosphere remained cold and dry, making it difficult to explain how Venus lost its water. But Leconte et al. only looked at surface temperatures up to ~330 K. At somewhat higher surface temperatures (350 K), our own 1-D model predicts that the stratosphere should indeed become wet [5]. Towards the outer edge of the HZ, it now appears that planets should undergo limit cycles involving global glaciation, CO2 buildup from volcanism, and CO2 drawdown from weathering [6,7]. If supplemented with volcanic H2 [8], such cycles could explain how early Mars could have been cold much of the time and yet have experienced enough warm periods to carve the observed fluvial features. Results from a new model of this process will be discussed. Refs: 1. Goldblatt, C., Robinson, T. D., Zahnle, K. J., & Crisp, D. 2013, Nature Geoscience, 6, 661 2. Kopparapu, R.

            "abstract": "Geochemists have now reached consensus that the Archean atmosphere was mostly anoxic, that a Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred at around 2.5 Ga, and that the ensuing Proterozoic atmosphere was consistently oxidized [1,2]. Evidence for this broad-scale change in atmospheric composition comes from a variety of sources, most importantly from multiple sulfur isotopes [3,4]. The details of both the Archean and Proterozoic environments remain controversial, however, as does the underlying cause of the GOE. Evidence of ‘whiffs’ of oxygen during the Archean [5] now extend back as far as 3.0 Ga, based on Cr isotopes [6]. This suggests that O2 was being produced by cyanobacteria well before the GOE and that the timing of this event may have been determined by secular changes in O2 sinks. Catling et al. [7] emphasized escape of hydrogen to space, coupled with progressive oxidation of the continents and a concomitant decrease in the flux of reduced gases from metamorphism. But hydrogen produced by serpentinization of seafloor could also have been a controlling factor [8]. Higher mantle temperatures during the Archean should have resulted in thicker, more mafic seafloor and higher H2 production; decreasing mantle temperatures during the Proterozoic should have led to seafloor more like that of today and a corresponding decrease in H2 production, perhaps by enough to trigger the GOE. Once the atmosphere became generally oxidizing, it apparently remained that way during the rest of Earth’s history. But O2 levels in the mid-Proterozoic could have been as low at 10-3 times the Present Atmospheric Level (PAL) [9]. The evidence, once again, is based on Cr isotopes. Possible mechanisms for maintaining such a ‘suboxic’ Proterozoic atmosphere will be discussed. Refs: 1. H. D. Holland, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 66, 3811 (2002). 2. H. D.

            "abstract": "Cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise are widely used to retrieve the information of the medium between pairs of stations. For periods between 1 and 50 s, the diffuse wavefield is dominated by microseismic energy which travels mostly as surface waves. Therefore, such waves are mainly reconstructed in the cross-correlations, and information about the structure are obtained using dispersion analysis, i.e computing phase or group velocities. Classical group velocity determination relies on tracking the maximum energy in the dispersion diagrams in order to get a unique dispersion curve. This procedure may often present problems due to the presence of several maxima. Moreover, the estimation of associated measurement errors usually depends on ad hoc user's criteria. We handle the non-unicity of the problem by inverting the whole dispersion diagram using a non-linear inversion scheme. For each frequency, the seismic energy is mapped into a time-dependent probability density function. The resulting map is inverted for the S-wave velocity structure using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Each time a new model is randomly sampled, the misfit value is computed according to the position of the corresponding group velocity curve in the probability density functions map. This method is applied for the analysis of vertical component noise cross-correlations computed from seismic data recorded in western Europe by the temporary PYROPE and IBERARRAY networks. The inversion of the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave dispersion diagrams between 5 and 50 s period gives a set of 1D S-wave velocity models, which are regionalized to infer a 3D S-wave velocity model of western France.",

            "abstract": "The most widely used algorithms to locate earthquakes are based on iterative linearized least-squares techniques. The drawbacks of theses methods, in particular when only a small amount of observations is available, are large dependencies on location and origine time due to a priori assumptions on velocity models and on an initial set of hypocentral parameters. However, the determination of accurate earthquake hypocentral parameters with estimation statistics is essential to constrain seismic structures and to understand ongoing seismotectonic processes.\nWe develop a joint hypocenter-velocity determination method using Bayesian inferences and apply it to data recorded within a sparse network of stations. Monte Carlo sampling methods, using Markov chains, generate models within a broad range of continuous structure and hypocenter parameters, distributed according to the unknown posterior distribution. The exploration for velocity structure is defined by flat homogeneous layers with velocity and thickness parameters. Output covariances on parameters characterize the trade-off between unknowns, e.g. hypocentre depth and origin time. This method is useful to reduce uncertainties on hypocentral parameters in the absence of a priori solution for regions in which the velocity structure is poorly constrained. The algorithm has been successfully used to accurately locate events of the Armorican Massif, an extensive outcrop of Variscan basement in western France, with moderate and diffuse local seismicity.",

Devonian ductile extensional to transtensional deformation of the more internal parts of the orogen did not affect the early to mid-Silurian extrusion wedge that was preserved in the more external parts of the orogen due to foreland-directed nappe displacements in the order of >400 km.

Although the olivine largely remained to be a single crystal, it shows wavy extinctions and many parallel shear planes diagonal to the compression axis. Shear planes (i.e., fault) are macroscopically sharp and show displacement of up to 0.5 mm. The TEM observation of the fault wall revealed that the wall has a zonal structure. Well inside the wall are developed densely spaced and tangles [001] screw dislocations. Outer 2-5 micron zone is polycrystalline olivine of grain size 200-300 nm. The outermost zone is an aggregate of semi-rounded small olivine particles (ca. 200 nanometers) mounted in a matrix of glass of olivine composition. It is inferred from these microstructures that polygonization and pulverization predated the melting. Such pulverization is possible at a running fracture tip, where stress and strain rate are the highest. Moreover, very thin injection veins (ca. 50-350 nanometer thick) filled with olivine glasses locally occurred in the fault wall, suggesting fracturing and crack opening had occurred while olivine melt was present. The fracturing was probably propelled by the rapid sweep of shock waves running through the crystal. Melting probably took place by a rapid collision and frictions among the olivine nanoparticles. It is suggested that the whole process took place in a very short duration of the order of 0.5 microsecond. Apart from the role of the shock waves, the situation is considered to be analogous to natural earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical demonstrations of the Green’s function reconstruction from cross-correlations of the ambient noise rely on a strong hypothesis about the spatial homogeneity of the noise sources distribution. However, real seismic noise within the Earth is not homogeneously distributed. In particular, strongly coherent signals from earthquakes or localized noise sources might be harmful to the application of this method. Most of signal pre-processing techniques used to compensate for the wavefield inhomogeneity are based on temporal or spectral normalization of individual seismograms.\nHere we consider an approach based on simultaneous analysis of records from multiple sensors of a seismic array. We perform a time-frequency analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix. In a case of a wavefield dominated by a single noise source, the rank of the array covariance matrix is very low. Consequently, its eigenvalue spectrum contains a single dominant value. In a case of a well distribution of uncorrelated noise sources, the matrix rank increases and the eigenvalue spectrum is much broader. Therefore, we use the width of the eigenvalue spectrum as a measure of the level of the wavefield spatial coherence. The results are interpreted within the random matrix theory.\nWe apply this approach on the wavefield recorded during the year 2010 by the USArray, and evaluate the effect of the energy normalization usually applied to single data prior to cross-correlation computation. We show that many coherent events resist to this normalization, and are still harmful to ambient noise tomography. We finally propose a new way to improve the energy normalization of data. We modify the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix to mitigate the effect of strong events. We show that cross-correlation symmetry is improved with this new technique, that may allow to use noise cross-correlations in zones where the seismic activity usually prevents the use of ambient seismic noise in the analysis of the Earth’s crust.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremor is a low frequency seismic signal lacking impulsive body wave arrivals, but including low and very-low frequency earthquakes. The seismic signal is interpreted to be associated with shear failure at the tremor source, and has been detected on well-instrumented subduction and transform plate boundary interfaces. Tectonic tremor has now been detected at a wide range of depths, but appears to predominantly occur in regions of transitional frictional behavior. To create the low and very-low frequency earthquakes within the tremor signal, frictional failure with a low stress drop is required at the tremor source. A common inference is therefore that tremor involves shear failure at low effective normal stress.\nIncrementally formed slickenfibre veins are commonly observed in exhumed fault zones. Based on the angle between shear surfaces and tensile veins, slickenfibres can in some locations be shown to have formed incrementally at low effective stress, comparable to tectonic tremor. The veins show slip increments of 10 - 100 micrometers, and along-strike lengths of tens to hundreds of meters, in agreement with values predicted from low frequency earthquake signals. \nAlthough slickenfibre veins are a candidate for the geological fingerprint of tectonic tremor, the tremor source occurs over a depth and temperature range that involves several grain scale deformation mechanisms, and both pro- and retrograde metamorphic conditions. The mechanism may therefore be more fundamental, and relate to shear failure in a mixed rheology rock assemblage where ambient stress levels are low. This includes shear failure on weak, frictional discontinuities within bulk viscous rheologies, as can be expected within the frictional transition zones where tremor is observed, independently of metamorphic grade. Slickenfibre veins represent one type of preserved shear discontinuity, on which it is easy to determine past slip increments. We show a number of other examples of frictional-viscous shear zones where bulk viscous deformation is accompanied by localized shear, and suggest that tremor may be a common byproduct of finite strain accumulation across mixed-rheology shear zones.",

            "abstract": "Laser Ranging has played a major role in geodetic studies of the Earth over the past 40 years. The technique can potentially be used in between planets and spacecrafts within the solar system to advance planetary science. For example, a direct measurement of distances between planets, such as Mars and Venus would make significant improvements in understanding the dynamics of the whole solar system, including the masses of the planets and moons, asteroids and their perturbing interactions, and the gravity field of the Sun. Compared to the conventional radio frequency (RF) tracking systems, laser ranging is potentially more accurate because it is much less sensitive to the transmission media. It is also more efficient because the laser beams are much better focused onto the targets than RF beams. However, existing laser ranging systems are all Earth centric, that is, from ground stations on Earth to orbiting satellites in near Earth orbits or lunar orbit, and to the lunar retro-reflector arrays deployed by the astronauts in the early days of lunar explorations. Several long distance laser ranging experiments have been conducted with the lidar in space, including a two-way laser ranging demonstration between Earth and the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) on the MESSENGER spacecraft over 24 million km, and a one way laser transmission and detection experiment over 80 million km between Earth and the Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the MGS spacecraft in Mars orbit. A one-way laser ranging operation has been carried out continuously from 2009 to 2014 between multiple ground stations to LRO spacecraft in lunar orbit. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) on the LADEE mission has demonstrated that a two way laser ranging measurements, including both the Doppler frequency and the phase shift, can be obtained from the subcarrier or the data clocks of a high speed duplex laser communication system. Plans and concepts presently being studied suggest we may be on the cusp of demonstrating interplanetary laser ranging to bring the future of solar system geodesy and geodyamics into reality.",

            "abstract": "Although the Himalayan range is traditionally presented as cylindrical, its geological structure, topography, precipitation, and exhumation patterns all vary significantly along-strike. The potential climatic or tectonic controls on these spatially variable topographic, precipitation and exhumation patterns have been widely discussed in recent years. A growing body of data suggests that variations in the geometry of the main Himalayan detachment (in particular the presence or absence of a major mid-crustal ramp) strongly control the kinematics, exhumation and topography of the orogen. However, what controls these variations in detachment geometry and their possible temporal evolution remains unclear. Here we report new thermo-mechanical modeling results to address these issues. We model the evolution of the Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt over the last ~30 Myr, focusing on the role of rheology and pre-existing structures in controlling this evolution. Our model results lead us to propose a scenario for the formation of Greater Himalayan klippen within the Lesser Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt and suggest a transient temporal evolution of the structure and topography of the fold-and-thrust belt in response to ramp formation at the orogenic front and subsequent migration toward the orogen interior. These results suggest that asynchronous ramp underthrusting in different segments of the range could control along-strike variations in topography, structure and exhumation of the mountain belt.",

            "abstract": "Because of its utility in many industrial processes, chromium has become the second most common metal contaminant in the United States. The two most common oxidation states of chromium in nature are Cr(III), which is highly immobile, and Cr(VI), which is highly mobile and toxic. In both natural and engineered environments, the most common remediation of Cr(VI) is through reduction, which results in chromium sequestration in the low solubility mixed Cr(III)-Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxide phases. Consequently, the stability of these minerals must be examined to assess the fate of chromium in the subsurface. We examined the dissolution of mixed Cr(III)-Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides in the presence of common microbial exudates, including the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB; a common organic ligand secreted by most microbes with high affinity for ferric iron and other trivalent metal ions) and oxalate (a common organic acid produced by microbes). The solids exhibited incongruent dissolution with preferential leaching of Fe from the solid phase. Over time, this leads to a more Cr rich mineral, which is known to be more soluble than the corresponding mixed mineral phase. We are currently investigating the structure of the reacted mineral phases and soluble Cr(III) species, as well as the potential oxidation and remobilization of the soluble Cr species. Results from this study will provide insights regarding the long term transport and fate of chromium in the natural environment in the presence of microbial activities.",

Scientists need to not only know their audiences but also the needs of their audiences. Society can benefit tremendously when personal and public decisions are informed by independent and best available science. But on a variety of issues from climate to chemicals, local decision makers and public groups often struggle to know what questions to ask and to find independent information, data and analysis. Scientists also face barriers in sharing knowledge with community members. Fortunately, scientists all across the country are making such connections and forging trusted relationships with the public. The speaker will present examples of scientist-community engagement where researchers have taken the path of communicating and partnering with their local communities to address everyday issues of concern to them, from food to fracking. While such engagement efforts gain from effective communication and strategic outreach with public groups, they also has the attendant benefits of challenging scientists to consider the broader, societal implications of their work; consider how their research can serve the needs of the public; and how they can aspire to become, more than educators, learners and allies in effecting change in their communities.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the thermal effects of subduction of two oceanic plates in the Kanto region of Japan, using a 3-D numerical thermal model. The Kanto region lies in the forearc of a subduction system, where the Pacific (PAC) plate and the Philippine Sea (PHS) plate subduct beneath the North American (NA) plate. In a typical subduction setting with one subducting slab, the motion of the slab drives solid-state mantle flow in the overlying mantle wedge, and the flow brings in hot mantle from the backarc towards the forearc. In the Kanto region, however, the presence of the PHS plate between the overlying NA plate and the subducting PAC plate prevents a typical mantle flow pattern. We developed a 3-D thermal model for the Kanto region to simulate the pattern of mantle wedge flow and to quantify its effect on the thermal structure. The model incorporates realistic slab geometries that were delineated from seismological studies. Mantle wedge flow between the PHS slab and the overlying NA plate is expected to be subdued due to the small space and the relatively slow subduction of the PHS slab. We simplify the model by incorporating the results of a 2-D thermal modeling for the subduction of the PHS slab as part of boundary conditions in the 3-D model to approximate the effect of the subdued mantle wedge flow and the subduction of the PHS slab. We use geophysical observations as constraints for the 3-D thermal model and estimate the temperature distributions along the subduction plate interfaces. The model predicts a particularly cold condition in the central part of the Kanto region where the PAC and PHS slabs are in contact with one another, consistent with the observed deeper extent of seismicity along the subduction faults compared to the neighboring regions.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few years, the USGS Gas Hydrates Project has focused on advancements designed to enhance both energy resource and climate-hydrate interaction studies. On the energy side, the USGS now manages the Pressure Core Characterization Tools (PCCTs), which includes the Instrumented Pressure Testing Chamber (IPTC) that we have long maintained. These tools, originally built at Georgia Tech, are being used to analyze hydrate-bearing sediments recovered in pressure cores during gas hydrate drilling programs (e.g., Nankai 2012; India 2015). The USGS is now modifying the PCCTs for use on high-hydrate-saturation and sand-rich sediments and hopes to catalyze third-party tool development (e.g., visualization). The IPTC is also being used for experiments on sediments hosting synthetic methane hydrate, and our scanning electron microscope has recently been enhanced with a new cryo-stage for imaging hydrates. To support climate-hydrate interaction studies, the USGS has been re-assessing the amount of methane hydrate in permafrost-associated settings at high northern latitudes and examined the links between methane carbon emissions and gas hydrate dissociation. One approach relies on the noble gas signature of methane emissions. Hydrate dissociation uniquely releases noble gases partitioned by molecular weight, providing a potential fingerprint for hydrate-sourced methane emissions. In addition, we have linked a DOC analyzer with an IRMS at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, allowing rapid and precise measurement of DOC and DIC concentrations and carbon isotopic signatures. The USGS has also refined methods to measure real-time sea-air flux of methane and CO2 using cavity ring-down spectroscopy measurements coupled with other data. Acquiring ~8000 km of data on the Western Arctic, US Atlantic, and Svalbard margins, we have tested the Arctic methane catastrophe hypothesis and the link between seafloor methane emissions and sea-air methane flux.",

The US Great Plains experienced a severe drought in 2012, symptoms of which included severe rainfall deficits and record setting high temperatures. An outstanding question is the relationship between the precipitation deficits and the heat wave, and further their mutual effects on soil moisture conditions. Land surface model simulations are presented to demonstrate the combined and separate effects of rainfall deficits and air temperature on soil moisture. The effects of antecedent conditions are also assessed, and implications for drought prediction are discussed. A further question to be addressed is the role of human-induced climate change on future Great Plains drought. Results are presented of the land surface responses to plausible scenarios for precipitation and temperature change. Applying an understanding of the fundamental physics of drought, we seek to better understand the sensitivity of deep soil moisture in a significantly warmer world that can inform discussions on risks for unprecedented future drought conditions in the Great Plains.",

            "abstract": "Lunar floor-fractured craters are a class of 170 craters characterized by shallow, deformed, and heavily fractured floors, with associated volcanic features commonly including deposits of mare material, pyroclastic deposits, and vents. The fracturing is interpreted to form in response to the stalling of a dike underneath the crater; resultant sill formation deforms the overlying crater floor. Morphologic measurements of these craters can be used to estimate sill dimensions, and from this we estimate the total volume of magma contained in all floor-fractured crater sills to be approximately 3 106 km3, 30% of the total lunar mare volume. Thus floor-fractured craters represent a unique window into intrusive magmatic processes on the Moon, including magma degassing and explosive volcanism. On the Moon, explosive volcanism is frequently associated with the degassing of floor-fractured crater intrusions; the morphologies associated with this process include small vents commonly located along fractures, and dark halos, which are low albedo deposits surrounding vents and are interpreted to be pyroclastic in origin. Other explosive volcanic morphologies include regional-scale pyroclastic deposits for which no vents have yet been identified, and large vent structures, such as Sulpicius Gallus. In contrast to the numerous floor-fractured craters on the Moon, there have been no conclusively identified floor-fractured craters on Mercury. Instead, Mercury exhibits a large number of what are interpreted to be explosive volcanic deposits, on the basis of the orange/red color of the inferred pyroclastic material identified in color images. These deposits are often much more areally extensive than their lunar counter parts, and surround a wide range of large pit and vent-like morphologies, themselves up to 10s of km in diameter. Using existing databases of these features, we have divided the spectrally identified volcanic deposits into 6 initial morphologic subclasses. Using the formation mechanisms for explosive volcanic deposits on the Moon as a template, we explore possible formation mechanisms for the range of explosive morphologies on Mercury. We also explore how differences in the structure of the Moon and Mercury have led to differences in the expression of intrusive magmatism and explosive volcanism.",

            "abstract": "The electric sector depends on readily available water supplies for reliable and efficient operation. Elevated water temperatures or low water levels can trigger regulatory or plant-level decisions to curtail power generation, which can affect system cost and reliability. In the past decade, dozens of power plants in the U.S. have curtailed generation due to water temperatures and water shortages. Curtailments occur during the summer, when temperatures are highest and there is greatest demand for electricity. Climate change could alter the availability and temperature of water resources, exacerbating these issues. Constructing alternative cooling systems to address vulnerabilities can be capital intensive and can also affect power plant efficiencies. Demand response programs are being implemented by electric system planners and operators to reduce and shift electricity demands from peak usage periods to other times of the day. Demand response programs can also play a role in reducing water-related power sector vulnerabilities during summer months. Traditionally, production cost modeling and demand response analyses do not include water resources. In this effort, we integrate an electricity production cost modeling framework with water-related impacts on power plants in a test system to evaluate the impacts of demand response measures on power system costs and reliability. Specifically, we i) quantify the cost and reliability implications of incorporating water resources into production cost modeling, ii) evaluate the impacts of demand response measures on reducing system costs and vulnerabilities, and iii) consider sensitivity analyses with cooling systems to highlight a range of potential benefits of demand response measures. Impacts from climate change on power plant performance and water resources are discussed. Results provide key insights to policymakers and practitioners for reducing water-related power plant vulnerabilities via lower cost methods.",

            "abstract": "The events that led to the initiation of Snowball Earth remain poorly understood. Proposed scenarios include a methane addiction, a biological innovation that led to an increase in organic carbon burial and anaerobic remineralization, or an increase in global weatherability due to a paleogeography with a preponderance of low latitude continents, and the subareal implacement of large igneous provinces (LIPs) at the equator. The Franklin LIP was emplaced between 730 and 710 Ma and covers an area of over 2.25 Mkm2 with lavas, sills, and dikes extending over much of northern Laurentia from Alaska through northern Canada to Greenland and potentially to Siberia. The most precise geochronological constraints on the Franklin LIP overlap with the onset of the Sturtian Snowball Earth glaciation, which began between 717 and 716 Ma and marked the first glaciation in over 1 billion years. The Franklin LIP is the largest preserved Neoproterozoic LIP and one of the largest in Earth History. Additionally, it was emplaced at equatorial latitudes with associated sills that invaded epicontinental sulfur evaporite basins, potentially maximizing environmental effects. Here we explore the hypothesis that the Sturtian Snowball Earth was initiated in part by an increase in planetary albedo from the conversion of volcanic SO2/H2S emissions to tropospheric and stratospheric sulfate aerosols through a combination of geochemical and modeling studies.",

In order to be able to interpret measured volatiles heterogeneities, notably H, He and Ar, we need constraints on the fundamental behaviour of volatiles in the mantle (where are they stored, how do they partition during melting or metasomatism and how might they be transported). At present, these parameters are poorly constrained since it is technically challenging to perform experiments with volatiles at high temperature and high pressure, but also because volatiles behaviour in silicate minerals is complex and can be related to numerous possible different host sites and incorporation mechanisms. Here, we synthetize the results of high temperature – high pressure experiments, which aim to constrain hydrogen and noble gas behaviour in crystalline solids versus mono-mineralic aggregates, including grain boundaries, that mimic mantle compositions and conditions. These experiments provide basics for further thermodynamic modeling.",

            "abstract": "The concept of ‘mushmatism’- that a magma chamber resides in a crystalline state for the majority of its life, has been suggested as a plausible mechanism for observed crustal melt evolution. It is proposed that as melt is generated, its composition evolves as it rises buoyantly, reacting chemically with the surrounding crystal mush at progressively lower temperatures. It is therefore possible to explain formation of granitic melts and observed mafic-felsic layering in the crust using mush processes. It has previously been assumed that a high influx rate of molten material is required for large volumes of crustal melt to be produced. This has been modelled in the past with repetitive sill intrusion at unrealistically high rates (>3x107 m3a-1) to cause a large enough thermal perturbation of the geotherm to sustain eruptible melt in the shallow crust. However, these models are purely thermal and neglect the effects of melt segregation and mush processes on longevity of melt volumes in the crust. We have developed an axisymmetric thermo-mechanical model that includes mass transport described by coupled matrix compaction and buoyant melt segregation during repeated sill intrusion. Results are consistent with thermal models in that they demonstrate dominance of crystalline mush processes in the transient magma chamber at low-to-moderate intrusion rates. However, addition of buoyant segregation leads to formation of discrete high melt fraction layers as melt ascends through the emplacement zone. This causes a decoupling in location of maximum temperature and melt fraction not observed by purely thermal models. Our results therefore have significant implications for current methods of interpretation of geophysical data, in particular, calculating melt volumes and determining the depth of the magma chamber. In addition, transient reservoirs are produced at lower emplacement rates by the thermo-mechanical model because accumulated magma is evolved and able to remain liquid at lower temperatures. Eruptible volumes of melt are therefore produced more efficiently at lower emplacement rates than has previously been calculated. This suggests that mushmatism dominates the lifecycle of crustal magma chambers, and it is primarily through mush processes that we are able to create evolved and eruptible volumes of magma.",

In this work we establish the timing and synchronization of temperature decrease as well as rebound at orbital timescales. All sites were notably warmer than their modern annual average at ~9 Ma and exhibit sustained cooling beginning at ~8 Ma. SSTs rebound close to ~5.9 Ma at most locations suggesting that the cooling trend that began in the Late Miocene slowed down or even reversed in some locations in the Pliocene.

Other less common AOD anomalies result from loose filters, uncorrected clock shifts, connection and electronic issues, and various solar eclipse episodes.

            "abstract": "Two severe geomagnetic storms of level G4 occurred so far in 2015. These are among the strongest geomagnetic storms of the current solar cycle (Solar Cycle 24). Both reached G4-Severe level (Kp = 8) on March 17, 2015 and on June 22, 2015, respectively. The March 17 geomagnetic storm is identified as due to the Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) which erupted on March 15 from Region 2297 of solar surface. Combined effects of three CMEs produced on June 18, 19 and 21 caused G4-Severe geomagnetic storm on June 22, 2015. During these geomagnetic storms, solar wind interacts with the Earth's magnetic field and causes temporary disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere and aurora may be seen in low latitude region.\nThe Day Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP represents a major advancement in night time imaging capabilities. The DNB senses radiance spanning 7 orders of magnitude in one (0.5-0.9 μm) reflective solar band and provides imagery over illumination levels ranging from full sunlight to quarter moon. In this paper, DNB observations of aurora activities during the two geomagnetic storm events are analyzed. During these events, auroras are observed to evolve with salient features by DNB during orbital pass on the night side (~local time 1:30am) in both hemispheres. The radiometricly calibrated DNB observations allow us to quantitatively analyze the large-scale spatial distribution and temporal evolution of aurora during the geomagnetic storms. The radiance data from DNB observation are collected at the night sides of both hemispheres during the two events and geo-located onto geomagnetic local time (MLT) coordinates. Regions of aurora during each orbital pass are identified through image processing by contouring radiance values and excluding regions with stray light near day-night terminator. The evolution of aurora are characterized with time series of the poleward and low latitude boundary of aurora, their latitude-span and area, peak radiance and total light emission of the aurora region in DNB observation. These characteristic parameters are correlated with solar wind and geomagnetic index parameters. Since DNB imagery has a high spatial resolution (750m), it also allows us to analyze evolution of characteristic spatial distribution of aurora.",

            "abstract": "The along-strike segmentation of the Himalayan arc is now well established from various observations, including topography, exhumation rates and seismic activity. Over the last decades, several gravimetric campaigns have been performed in the Himalayas to decipher the deep structure of this orogen. However, most of these studies focused on individual sections across the belt are difficult to combine to obtain an overall picture of the mountain range. Thus the question of lateral variability of crustal structures in the Himalayas remains unanswered.\nIn the past five years, we carried out gravity measurements in central and western Nepal and in Bhutan. Together with previously available data, we gather a terrestrial gravity dataset that is now covering more than 1800 km of the Himalayan arc. By Combining these data with the satellite gravity gradients provided by the GOCE mission (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer), we obtain a first image of along-strike gravity changes in the Himalayas, which suggest east-west variations in the shape of the underthrusted India plate, especially between Nepal and Bhutan.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient enhanced phytoplankton production is a cause of degraded estuarine water quality. Yet, relationships between watershed nutrient loads and the spatial and temporal scales of phytoplankton blooms and subsequent water quality impairments remain unquantified for most systems. This is partially due to a lack of observations. In many systems, satellite remote sensing of water quality variables may be used to supplement limited field observations and improve understanding of linkages to nutrients. Here, we present the results from a field and satellite ocean color study that quantitatively links nutrients to variations in estuarine water quality endpoints. The study was conducted in Pensacola Bay, Florida, an estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico that is impacted by watershed nutrients. We developed new empirical band ratio algorithms to retrieve phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a (chla), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). MERIS had suitable spatial resolution (300-m) for the scale of Pensacola Bay (area = 370 km2, mean depth = 3.4 m) and a spectral band centered at wavelength 709 nm that was used to minimize the effect of organic matter on chla retrieval. The algorithms were applied to daily MERIS remote sensing reflectance (level 2) data acquired from 2003 to 2011 to calculate nine-year time-series of mean monthly chla, CDOM, and SPM concentrations. The MERIS derived time-series were then analyzed for statistical relations with time-series of mean monthly river discharge and river loads of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and SPM. Regression analyses revealed significant relationships between river loads and MERIS water quality variables. The simple regression models provide quantitative predictions about how much chla, CDOM, and SPM concentrations in Pensacola Bay will increase with increased river loading, which is necessary information for nutrient, land-use, and climate management decisions. We will discuss the lessons learned for management of Pensacola Bay and about communicating the value of satellite observations to water quality managers.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes have been widely used to reconstruct past climatic conditions and topographic histories of mountain belts. However, many studies do not account for the influences of evapotranspiration and vapor recycling on downstream meteoric water isotopic compositions. Here we present a case study of the modern Sierra Nevada and Basin and Range to illustrate the value of using process-based models across larger spatial scales to reconstruct the conditions driving local- to regional-scale water isotopic compositions.\nWe use a one-dimensional reactive vapor transport model, driven by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) high-resolution North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset, to simulate the isotopic composition of modern meteoric waters (δ18O and δD) along storm tracks across the Sierra Nevada and Basin and Range. Storm track pathways are generated using NOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory’s Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. In addition, we couple the vapor transport model with a soil moisture model to simulate depth profiles of the oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonate along our storm tracks. We show that, given reasonable estimates of the modern partitioning between evaporation and transpiration, our model output is in agreement with modern isotopic data both from compilations of published meteoric water samples and from newly collected soil carbonate samples along a transect across the northern Sierra Nevada and Basin and Range (~38-42° N). These results demonstrate that our modeling approach can be used to analyze the relative contributions of climate and topography to observed isotopic gradients. Future studies can apply this modeling framework to isotopes preserved in the geologic record to provide a quantitative means of understanding the paleoclimatic influences on spatial isotopic distributions.",

            "abstract": "Hazards associated with severe convective storms can lead to rapid changes in land surface vegetation. Depending upon the type of vegetation that has been impacted, their impacts can be relatively short lived, such as damage to seasonal crops that are eventually removed by harvest, or longer-lived, such as damage to a stand of trees or expanse of forest that require several years to recover. Since many remote sensing imagers provide their highest spatial resolution bands in the red and near-infrared to support monitoring of vegetation, these impacts can be readily identified as short-term and marked decreases in common vegetation indices such as NDVI, along with increases in land surface temperature that are observed at a reduced spatial resolution.\nThe ability to identify an area of vegetation change is improved by understanding the conditions that are normal for a given time of year and location, along with a typical range of variability in a given parameter. This analysis requires a period of record well beyond the availability of near real-time data. These activities would typically require an analyst to download large volumes of data from sensors such as NASA’s MODIS (aboard Terra and Aqua) or higher resolution imagers from the Landsat series of satellites. Google’s Earth Engine offers a “big data” solution to these challenges, by providing a streamlined API and option to process the period of record of NASA MODIS and Landsat products through relatively simple Javascript coding. This presentation will highlight efforts to date in using Earth Engine holdings to produce vegetation and land surface temperature anomalies that are associated with damage to agricultural and other vegetation caused by severe thunderstorms across the Central and Southeastern United States. Earth Engine applications will show how large data holdings can be used to map severe weather damage, ascertain longer-term impacts, and share best practices learned and challenges with applying Earth Engine holdings to the analysis of severe weather damage. Other applications are also demonstrated, such as use of Earth Engine to prepare pre-event composites that can be used to subjectively identify other severe weather impacts. Future extension to flooding and wildfires is also proposed.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) indicate that much of the recent mass loss is attributed to the speed up and retreat of outlet glaciers, especially near the western coast of Greenland. Because ice margin fluctuation (margin migration) plays a critical role in controlling variations in ice sheet volume, assimilation of margin migration into ice-sheet models is imperative to producing improved dynamic reconstructions of the GrIS, thus leading to less spread in future estimates of its contribution to future sea level change. To achieve this, the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) is used to simulate past margin migration by relying on robust paleoclimate archives using radiocarbon and cosmogenic 10 Be exposure dating of glacial features that are used as assimilation targets of past margin migration over Jakobshavn Isbrae during the Holocene. These records indicate large sensitivities in the ice margin to past climate change, providing a unique opportunity to constrain past unknowns such as basal friction and surface mass balance through data assimilation techniques. Building on existing capabilities in ISSM, we use adjoint inversions and automatic differentiation to present preliminary results of temporal inversions of basal friction and surface mass balance over Jakobshavn during the Holocene based upon ice margin reconstructions. Results from these experiments have implications for understanding the controls on past margin migration, while enhancing our understanding of basal and surface processes important for controlling modern day margin migration, which is a critical constraint for improving modern day spinups.",

            "abstract": "The exposures of the aeolian Navajo Sandstone at Buckskin Gulch, Utah, have received much attention for their spectacular displays of compaction bands. These bands are described as tabular zones of reduced porosity, and are generally categorized into shear-enhanced compaction bands (SECBs), which accommodate equal amounts of compaction and shear strain, and pure compaction bands (PCBs) that have experienced no shearing. PCBs display a wavy or crooked geometry with vertically dipping bands ~1 mm thick. Conversely, SECBs include planar bands up to 1 cm thick with moderate dips defining conjugate geometries. The Buckskin Gulch field site was surveyed, and compaction bands systematically mapped in a sub-area representative of the heaviest deformation. Geologic and structural map units include dune boundaries within the Navajo Sandstone, areas of soft-sediment deformation, and PCBs and SECBs. Mapping shows that SECBs have outcrop characteristics consistent with those reported in previous studies, and are found with varying degrees of deformation in almost all dune units. However, the mapping and compass measurements also reveal a previously unrecognized bimodal pattern of PBC orientation with bands occurring in strands of up to four individual PCBs. One set of orientations only includes single-strand PCBs, whereas the other set is composed of multi-strand PCBs. Both sets of PCBs have nearly vertical dips but their strikes clearly differ from another by up to 25°. Further, PCBs and SECBs show distinct patterns in areas of soft-sediment deformation. Although individual PCB orientations are consistent with the overall trend of PCBs in the area, SECB orientations are chaotic, their growth was clearly affected by the soft-sediment deformation. These field observations are inconsistent with the current understanding of pure compaction band mechanics and so indicate that their growth is more complex than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "There are two common ways to create a ground-motion map for a hypothetical earthquake: using ground motion prediction equations (by far the more common of the two) and using 3-D physics-based modeling. The former is very familiar to engineers, the latter much less so, and the difference can present a problem because engineers tend to trust the familiar and distrust novelty. Maps for essentially the same hypothetical earthquake using the two different methods can look very different, while appearing to present the same information. Using one or the other can lead an engineer or disaster planner to very different estimates of damage and risk. The reasons have to do with depiction of variability, spatial correlation of shaking, the skewed distribution of real-world shaking, and the upward-curving relationship between shaking and damage. The scientists who develop the two kinds of map tend to specialize in one or the other and seem to defend their turf, which can aggravate the problem of clearly communicating with engineers.The USGS Science Application for Risk Reduction’s (SAFRR) HayWired scenario has addressed the challenge of explaining to engineers the differences between the two maps, and why, in a disaster planning scenario, one might want to use the less-familiar 3-D map.",

From these measurements, the infrared power and energy radiated by nitric oxide (NO) at 5.3 µm and carbon dioxide (CO2) at 15 µm have been computed. These infrared emissions have been shown to be a mechanism for the dissipation of the atmospheric heating that results from geoeffective solar storm energy, serving as a natural thermostat to cool the atmosphere to pre-storm conditions.

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic surface deformation is important to measure for several reasons -- 1) it could be a hazard to infrastructure; 2) it could contaminate precise measurements of other types of deformation (e.g., magmatic or tectonic); and 3) the deformation can provide otherwise inaccessible information about the subsurface as we measure the Earth's response to known pumping, surface change, or mining activity. While there are studies at individual sites in North America that demonstrate these three types of studies, we lack a continental synoptic view of anthropogenic deformation and its significance. To fill this gap, we use satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to image ground deformation across the continent with a spatial resolution of 1 km/pixel or better using results from the literature as well as new analysis of more than 5000 interferograms from the ERS, Envisat, and ALOS satellites, which collectively span 1992-2011. Our compilation is not complete in terms of spatially or temporal coverage nor is it uniform in quality over the region -- certainly we have missed some areas of deformation. Most of the data analyzed is in the western US, but ALOS observations east of the Rocky Mountains are of good quality even in vegetated and snowy areas and we document mining subsidence greater than several cm per year in NY, PA, and WV. We catalog more than 200 anthropogenic deformation signals, including about 45 that are not previously reported. The majority of these deformation sources can be attributed to groundwater extraction (66%), 8% to geothermal activity, 13% to hydrocarbon extraction, 11% to mining activity, and 2% to other sources such as lake loading. In a few areas, the source of deformation is not yet determined. As expected, most deformation is time dependent and so continuous monitoring is needed. In some areas, comparisonbetween pumping records and surface deformation reveals some suprises. For example, at the East Mesa Geothermal Field in California, we find an area that changes from subsidence to uplift around 2006 even though pumping and injection appear not to have changed during that time. Future InSAR satellite missions should make routine observations over the entire continent to develop a more complete understanding of anthropogenic deformation in North America.",

            "abstract": "The process of mercury (Hg) methylation has long been recognized as a key area of research in order to understand spatial and temporal variability of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) on the landscape. Numerous factors affect MeHg production, the most important generally falling into those that affect inorganic Hg(II) bioavailability (e.g., Hg(II) concentration and ligand composition), and those that affect microbial community composition and activity. The principal goal of this project is to decipher the details of MeHg production in Alaskan peatlands exhibiting a range of trophic status, including those lacking in electron acceptors that support the traditional respiratory pathway of MeHg production (e.g., sulfate reduction). MeHg production is carried out by a diverse group of microorganisms that possess the gene cluster (hgcAB), including the well-studied sulfate and iron- reducing bacteria (SRB and FeRB). However, less well known bacteria also possess the hgcAB genes, including: syntrophs, methanogens, acetogens, and fermenters. Methylation and demethylation activities were determined by injecting trace levels of the stable isotope (198Hg and Me204Hg) into intact peat cores. In addition, the short-lived radioisotope 197Hg was used in laboratory incubations. Laboratory studies also included assays for changes in diagnostic gas concentrations (CH4, CO2, H2) and LMW organic acids (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) to infer specific microbial processes, and the use of genomics to confirm microbial assemblages and the presence/absence of hgcAB genes. Overall, we observed Hg methylation rates were greatest at minerotrophic sites with active syntrophy and methanogenesis. Methylation and demethylation rates corresponded significantly across sites. There was no evidence of SO4- reduction in these samples, and addition of SO4- did not stimulate methylation suggesting that methylation was conducted by SRB that were metabolizing syntrophically and/or by fermentation.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of regional unconformities in the circum-South Atlantic tectonic plates have linked unconformity age to the timing of changes in the azimuth of oceanic fracture zones, caused by plate interactions during opening of the South Atlantic. This observation is significant, proposing that a plate boundary geodynamic processes are transmitted into and expressed in plate interiors. However, it is not yet clear if and how other geologic events, such as intra-plate magmatism, may be linked to changes in the oceanic fracture azimuthal geometry. Here we use 2D and 3D seismic reflection, geochemical, borehole datasets and outcrop observations from the Bornu Basin, one of several intra-continental rift basins located in NE Nigeria to constrain the 3D geometry of igneous bodies and magmatic emplacement processes. This allows us to link South Atlantic plate boundary geodynamics and magmatism in the surrounding continental rift basins.\nSeismic attributes, reflection intensity, relative acoustic impedance, were used to identify and map igneous intrusions. Saucer-shaped sills are the most common type of intrusion, although en-echelon sills, up to 1.4 km in length, were also identified. The 3D geometry of the sills reveals the detailed structural components like inner sill, inclined sheets and outer sill (Fig.1). A mapped bifurcating network of the sills suggests magma emplacement process through upward and outward propagation. Seismic-stratigraphic observations indicate that igneous activity occurred in the Early Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous and Paleogene corresponding to the timing of major azimuth changes observed in the Kane Oceanic fracture zone in the South Atlantic Ocean. Overall, our study, suggests a possible influence of plate boundary geodynamics on intra-plate magmatism as reflected in the link between the time of changes in the azimuth of oceanic fracture zones and magmatic emplacement observed in the tectono-stratigraphy of the intra-continental rift basins.",

Eastward routing of Lake Agassiz runoff was originally hypothesized to have triggered the Younger Dryas. However, currently the chronology of the eastern outlets is only constrained by minimum-limiting radiocarbon ages that could suggest the eastern outlets were still ice covered at the start of the Younger Dryas at ~12.9 ka BP, requiring a different forcing of this abrupt climate event. Nevertheless, the oldest radiocarbon ages are still consistent with an ice-free eastern outlet at the start of the Younger Dryas. Here we will present preliminary 10-Be cosmogenic surface exposure ages from the North Lake, Flat Rock Lake, glacial Lake Kaministiquia, and Lake Nipigon outlets located near Thunder Bay, Ontario. These ages will date the timing of the deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet in the eastern outlet region of glacial Lake Agassiz. This will provide an important constraint for the hypothesized freshwater forcing of the cause of Younger Dryas cold event.",

            "abstract": "New field, U-Pb, and Lu-Hf data constrain the geologic history, age, and origin of the Yellow Aster Complex (YAC) in NW Washington, and suggest that this Paleozoic arc terrane originated along the paleo-Arctic margin of NE Laurentia. Field work shows the oldest YAC consists of quartzo-feldspathic paragneiss (meta-arkosic sandstone + conglomerate) and quartzose calc-silicate gneiss (meta-calcareous siltstone) in gradational contact. Paragneisses are cut by syn- and post-tectonic intrusions, and faulted against granitic orthogneiss. U-Pb results show that 1) maximum depositional ages of paragneisses are Silurian to early Devonian (399 to 434 Ma); 2) quartzose calc-silicate gneisses show a broad age peak from 1000-1900 Ma, while quartzofeldspathic gneisses contain several distinct Precambrian age peaks, including at 1.8-2.0 Ga and 2.4-2.5 Ga; 3) Both gneisses contain early Paleozoic grains with peaks at ~400-420 and ~450-460 Ma; 4) pre-tectonic orthogneiss and syn- and post-tectonic dikes range from 410 to 398 Ma; 4) All intrusive rocks contain apparently xenocrystic ~450 Ma grains. Lu-Hf data show that nearly all Paleozoic grains have negative epsilon Hf values, and zircons in the meta-arkose samples are more highly evolved than those in the calc-silicate. Several meta-arkose samples yield epsilon Hf values of -40 to -50, which is rare in the North American Cordillera, and requires the involvement of Early Archean crustal components. The most likely source region is Greenland, which implies derivation from the paleo-Arctic margin of northeastern Laurentia or Baltica. The chemistry and petrology of the igneous rocks suggest the terrane was in a continental arc setting during or very shortly after deposition of the sedimentary rocks. The data suggest that sedimentation, deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism all occurred within a brief (~15 m.y.) period in the early Devonian. These relationships suggest a Caledonian origin for YAC prior to translation to the Cordillera. Although our prior work suggested connections to Turtleback complex (San Juan Islands) and Alexander terrane (Karheen formation) based on U-Pb data, Hf data appear to rule out such connections. However some elements of Alexander terrane (St Elias and Banks Island) are similar to YAC, and further work is needed to resolve the tectonic links.",

            "abstract": "Natural gases form in tight source rocks at temperatures between 120ºC up to 200ºC over a time of 40 to 50my depending on the heating rate of the gas kitchen. Inferring from pyrolysis experiments, gases after primary migration, a pressure driven process, are rich in C2+ hydrocarbons (C2 to C5). This is consistent with gas compositions of oil-associated gases such as in the Bakken Shale which occur in immediate vicinity of the source with little migration distances. However, migration of gases along porous rocks over long distances (up to 200km in the case of the Troll field offshore Norway) changes the gas composition drastically as C2+ hydrocarbons tend to be retained/sequestered during migration of gas as case histories from Virginia and the North Sea will demonstrate. Similar “molecular fractionation” is observed between reservoirs and surface seeps. In contrast to gas composition, stable isotopes in gases are, in general, not affected by the migration process suggesting that gas migration is a steady state process. Changes in isotopic composition, from source to reservoir to surface seeps, is often the result of mixing of gases of different origins. Examples from various gas provinces will support this notion. Natural gas basins provide little opportunity of tracking and identifying gas phase separation. Future research on experimental phase separation and monitoring of gas composition and gas ratio changes e.g. various C2+ compound ratios over C1 or isomer ratios such as iso/n ratios in butane and pentane may be an avenue to develop tracers for phase separation that could possibly be applied to natural systems of retrograde natural condensate fields.

While early OSSEs focused on large-scale numerical weather prediction, more recent OSSEs have included evaluation of the impact of proposed observing systems on smaller-scale phenomena. These have included global OSSEs to evaluate impact on hurricane track forecasting and regional OSSEs aimed at evaluating both track and intensity prediction. Two global OSSEs conducted using the fvGCM nature runs showed a substantial impact of space-based lidar wind profiles on hurricane track predictions. Current OSSEs are using multiple nature runs in which the WRF model, at very high resolution, is embedded within a global T511 nature run that had been generated by ECMWF. These OSSEs are evaluating the potential impact of new (proposed) observing systems on hurricane track and intensity prediction and trade-offs in the design and configuration of these observing systems They are also being used to optimize sampling strategies for current and future airborne and spaceborne observing systems and to evaluate and improve data assimilation and vortex initialization methodology for hurricane prediction. Results from recent OSSEs show the relative impact of alternative lidar technologies and the relative impact of global and regional assimilation on hurricane track and intensity prediction.

The USAM seep province stretches nearly 1300 km from Nygren Canyon near Georges Bank in the north to the well-studied Blake Ridge Diapir seeps offshore South Carolina. Here we use methane derived authigenic carbonate (MDAC) samples retrieved by DSV Alvin on the July 2015 SeepC expedition led by C. Van Dover, supplemented by carbonates obtained on earlier expeditions, to date methane efflux at selected USAM seep sites using U-Th geochronology. MDAC U-Th analysis, carried out in conjunction with petrographic and tracer isotope analyses (e.g., δ13C), and a robust assessment of detrital Th corrections, will provide absolute dates for MDAC formation and inferentially methane efflux. Multiple dates, with associated information on petrographic context, can be obtained from each sample, and multiple samples were collected from seeps situated both on the upper continental slope, and in deepwater settings. The resulting dataset will constrain the tempo of methane efflux at each site, and the distribution of ages obtained at each seep may be used to distinguish between short-lived, or prolonged and/or episodic records of methane emission. Prior U-Th geochronologic analyses on two archive samples from Baltimore Canyon and Norfolk Canyon yielded ages corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum and the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The hypothesis that high rainfall rates have the power to drive erosion and shape landscapes is tantalizing. However, definitive support for this hypothesis has been somewhat elusive, in part because high rainfall rates often occur in areas of high rock uplift rates. Here we present a number of best practices, developed from theory and landscape evolution modeling, that can be used to decipher whether climate, tectonics, or both importantly affect landscape morphology and evolution. For illustration we assume that there is a single, dominant gradient in both rainfall and rock uplift rates across the landscape. We quantify the morphology of rivers using the normalized channel steepness index, ksn, or channel slope normalized by drainage area. If rainfall influences landscape evolution solely through the production of runoff and fluvial discharge, then ksn is inversely proportional to the upstream averaged rainfall rate. In contrast, ksn is directly proportional to the local rock uplift rate. Exploring patterns in channels that primarily flow perpendicular to the gradient in forcing and channels that flow parallel to the gradient in forcing, illustrates the influence of different drivers. In channels that flow in the direction of the gradient, the rock uplift forcing should have a greater impact on channel form. However, when comparing among channels that flow perpendicular to the gradient, ksn should vary with the local rainfall rate. We apply these ideas in the Eastern Cordillera of the Northern Bolivian Andes, where modern rainfall rates and hypothesized rock uplift rates vary in the same dominant direction. We explore the morphology of channels that are both parallel and perpendicular to the gradient in forcings and find that the pattern of rock uplift dominates the morphology of the landscape, but that climate likely has a secondary effect. Using published erosion rate data from detrital 10Be, we find no correlation between rainfall and erosion rates.",

            "abstract": "Plagioclase, one of the most common and abundant mineral phases in volcanic products, will vary in composition in response to changes in temperature, pressure, composition of the ambient silicate melt, and melt H2O concentration. Changes in these parameters may cause dissolution or growth of plagioclase crystals, forming characteristic textural and compositional variations (zoning patterns), the complete core-to-rim sequence of which describes events experienced by an individual crystal from its nucleation to the last moments of its growth. Plagioclase crystals in a typical volcanic rock may look drastically dissimilar despite their spatial proximity and the fact that they have erupted together. Although they shared last moments of their growth during magma ascent and eruption, their prior experiences could be very different, as plagioclase crystals often come from different domains of the same magma system. Distinguishing similar zoning patterns, correlating them across the entire population of plagioclase crystals, and linking these patterns to specific perturbations in the magmatic system may provide additional perspective on the variety, extent, and timing of magma processes at active volcanic systems. Examples of magma processes, which may be distinguished based on plagioclase zoning patterns, include (1) cooling due to heat loss, (2) heating and/or pressure build up due to an input of new magmatic material, (3) pressure drop in response to magma system depressurization, and (4) crystal transfer between different magma domains/bodies. This review will include contrasting examples of zoning patters from recent eruptions of Karymsky, Bezymianny, and Tolbachik Volcanoes in Kamchatka, Augustine and Cleveland Volcanoes in Alaska, as well as from the drilling into an active magma body at Krafla, Iceland.",

Surprisingly, after decades of fire behavior research an experimentally based, fundamental understanding of wildland fire spread processes has not been established. Modelers have commonly assumed radiation to be the dominant heating mechanism; that is, radiation heat transfer primarily determines wildland fire spread. We tested this assumption by focusing on how fuel ignition occurs with a renewed emphasis on experimental research. Our experiments show that fuel particle size can non-linearly influence a fuel particle’s convective heat transfer. Fine fuels (less than 1 mm) can convectively cool in ambient air such that radiation heating is insufficient for ignition and thus fire spread. Given fire spread with insufficient radiant heating, fuel particle ignition must occur convectively from flame contact. Further experimentation reveals that convective heating and particle ignition occur when buoyancy-induced instabilities and vorticity force flames down and forward to produce intermittent contact with the adjacent fuel bed. Experimental results suggest these intermittent forward flame extensions are buoyancy driven with predictable average frequencies for flame zones ranging from laboratory (10-2 m) to field scales (101m). Measured fuel particle temperatures and boundary conditions during spreading laboratory fires reveal that convection heat transfer from intermittent flame contact is the principal mechanism responsible for heating fine fuel particles to ignition. Our experimental results describe how fine fuel particles convectively heat to ignition from flame contact related to the buoyant dynamics of spreading flame fronts. This research has caused a rethinking of some of the most basic concepts in wildland fuel particle ignition and flame spread.",

The seismic data are analyzed using advanced attributes to detect and delineate the base of the gas hydrate stability (BGHS) and fluid-migration pathways associated with recently discovered seafloor methane seeps.  The sparker was operated at 2.6 kJ, and the amplitude frequency spectrum of the resulting data ranges from ~50-700 Hz, with the dominant frequency centered at 150 Hz. Using a frequency attribute workflow, we calculate and visualize changes in dominant frequency content within the seismic profiles. Laterally-distributed and abrupt high-to-low frequency changes are observed at depth. High frequencies are attenuated below this transition, which commonly mimics the seafloor and gradually shoals towards the seafloor with decreasing water depth.  The BGHS depths calculated using gas hydrate stability constraints and geothermal gradients closely coincide with these transitions, which are likely caused by free gas that scatters and attenuates higher frequencies. This approach allows for improved delineation of the BGHS on high-frequency MCS data that lack a reverse-polarity bottom-simulating reflector and on upper slopes where the BGHS is hard to discern. We also apply a neural-network seismic attribute workflow to analyze potential fluid-pathways below methane plumes imaged in the water column. The workflow uses structural steering calculations and multiple weighted attributes in a neural-network algorithm targeted for gas chimney detection.  The results highlight probable fluid flow pathways in areas with and without seafloor methane seeps and delineate deep-seated features (e.g., fractures) that supply gas to some of the deepwater (> 1000 m) seep sites.",

            "abstract": "Drought and heat-induced tree mortality is accelerating in many forest biomes as a consequence of a warming climate, resulting in a threat to global forests unlike any in recorded history. Forests store the majority of terrestrial carbon, thus their loss may have significant and sustained impacts on the global carbon cycle. We used a hydraulic corollary to Darcy’s law, a core principle of vascular plant physiology, to predict characteristics of plants that will survive and die during drought under warmer future climates. Plants that are tall with isohydric stomatal regulation, low hydraulic conductance, and high leaf area are most likely to die from future drought stress. Thus, tall trees of old-growth forests are at the greatest risk of loss, which has ominous implications for terrestrial carbon storage. This application of Darcy’s law indicates today’s forests generally should be replaced by shorter and more xeric plants, owing to future warmer droughts and associated wildfires and pest attacks. The Darcy’s corollary also provides a simple, robust framework for informing forest management interventions needed to promote the survival of current forests. There are assumptions and omissions in this theoretical prediction, as well as new evidence supporting its predictions, both of which I will review. Given the robustness of Darcy’s law for predictions of vascular plant function, we conclude with high certainty that today’s forests are going to be subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "At the end of the planetary formation stage, the Earth experienced multiple giant impacts. The last giant impact, which is believed to have formed the Moon, could have been so energetic that it would have mixed the Earth’s whole mantle. This view, however, appears to be inconsistent with geochemical studies that suggest that the Earth’s mantle was not mixed by the impact. To reconcile this discrepancy, we determine the state of the Earth’s mantle after the impact by performing giant impact simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Three models are investigated: (a) standard model: a Mars-sized impactor hits the proto-Earth, (b) fast-spinning Earth: a small impactor hits a rapidly rotating proto-Earth, and (c) sub-Earths: two half Earth-sized planets collide. We find that the mantle remains unmixed in (a), but it may be mixed in (b) and (c). Therefore, (a) is most consistent with the preservation of the mantle heterogeneity. We also determine that the Earth’s mantle becomes mostly molten by the impact in all of the models. Additionally, our results indicate that the Rankine-Hugoniot equations do not predict entropy gains of the mantle materials by a giant impact very well. This is because the entropy increase of the mantle is caused not only by the primary impact-induced shock, which provides the peak shock pressure, but also by subsequent processes. We further discuss the time evolution of the Earth’s mantle.",

This also raises expectations for future VIIRS models. For JPSS J1 VIIRS DNB, performance shortfalls have been identified based on prelaunch tests in the laboratory. This includes the nonlinear response at high scan angles, and the straylight contamination that persists on Suomi NPP VIIRS will likely to appear for J1 as well. This paper introduces the mitigation strategies to address these performance shortfalls. The new aggregation mode options and artifacts in imagery are discussed. Modifications to the geolocation software code has been developed to accommodate the changes. The new aggregation mode also introduces J1 specific characteristics in the DNB imagery.\nExpanded validation capabilities have been developed using Suomi NPP data as proxy to monitor the response versus scan both radiometrically and in geolocation accuracy. This includes the radiometric stability monitoring using night light point sources such as from bridges, oil platforms, power plants, as well as flares. Time series of VIIRS observations of the point sources at different scan angles are constructed to monitor the radiometric bias and geolocation across aggregation zones. Finally, lessons learned in the straylight correction for Suomi NPP can be applied to J1 VIIRS DNB to ensure that the performance meet specifications and user expectations.",

            "abstract": "Planetary oceanography is enjoying renewed attention thanks to not only the detection of several exoplanetary ocean worlds but also due to the expanding family of ocean worlds within our own star system. Our solar system is now believed to host about nine ocean worlds including Earth, some dwarf planets and few moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Amongst them, Europa, like Earth is thought to have an ice Ih-liquid water system. However, the thickness of the Europan ice-ocean system is much larger than that of the Earth. The evolution of this system would determine the individual thicknesses of the ice shell and the ocean. In turn, these thicknesses can alter the course of evolution of the system. In a pure H2O system, the thickness of the ice shell would govern if heat loss occurs entirely by conduction or if the shell begins to convect as it attains a threshold thickness. This switch between conduction-convection regimes could determine the longevity of the subsurface ocean and hence define the astrobiological potential of the planetary body at any given time.\nIn reality, however, the system is not pure water ice. The detected induced magnetic field infers a saline ocean layer. Salts are expected to act as an anti-freeze allowing a subsurface ocean to persist over long periods but the amount of salts would determine the extent of that effect. In our current study, we use geodynamic models to examine the effect of salinity on the evolution of ice-ocean system. An initial ocean with different salinities is allowed to evolve. The effect of salinity on thickness of the two layers at any time is examined. We also track how salinity controls the switch between conductive-convective modes. The study shows that for a given time period, larger salinities can maintain a thick vigorously convecting ocean while the smaller salinities behave similar to a pure H2O system leading to a thick convecting ice-shell. A range of salinities identified can potentially predict the current state and possibly the intermediate states of the ice-ocean system as it evolved over time. This could help constrain the endogenic contribution of salts to the surface chemistry.",

The sputtering of Mars’ atmosphere has been even suggested to lead to a significant cumulated loss along Mars’ history. Up to now, only a limited number of observations have been possible. ASPERA-3/Mars Express observed such precipitation only during extreme solar conditions events suggesting that sputtering might be not as intense as theoretically predicted.\nBased on MAVEN first six months of observations, we here show that precipitation of heavy ions also occur during quiet solar conditions and that the average precipitating flux during this period is significant and globally in good agreement with predictions.

            "abstract": "Recent first-principles calculations (e.g. Stixrude, 2009; de Koker, 2013), shock-wave experiments (Mosenfelder, 2009), and diamond-anvil cell investigations (Sanloup, 2013) indicate that silicate melts undergo complex structural evolution at high pressure. The observed increase in cation-coordination (e.g. Karki, 2006; 2007) induces higher compressibilities and lower adiabatic thermal gradients in melts as compared with their solid counterparts. These properties are crucial for understanding the evolution of impact-generated magma oceans, which are dominated by the poorly understood behavior of silicates at mantle pressures and temperatures (e.g. Stixrude et al. 2009). Probing these conditions is difficult for both theory and experiment, especially given the large compositional space (MgO-SiO2-FeO-Al2O3-etc).\nWe develop a new model to understand and predict the behavior of oxide and silicate melts at extreme P-T conditions (Wolf et al., 2015). The Coordinated Hard Sphere Mixture (CHaSM) extends the Hard Sphere mixture model, accounting for the range of coordination states for each cation in the liquid. Using approximate analytic expressions for the hard sphere model, this fast statistical method compliments classical and first-principles methods, providing accurate thermodynamic and structural property predictions for melts. This framework is applied to the MgO system, where model parameters are trained on a collection of crystal polymorphs, producing realistic predictions of coordination evolution and the equation of state of MgO melt over a wide P-T range. Typical Mg-coordination numbers are predicted to evolve continuously from 5.25 (0 GPa) to 8.5 (250 GPa), comparing favorably with first-principles Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. We begin extending the model to a simplified mantle chemistry using empirical potentials (generally accurate over moderate pressure ranges, <~30 GPa), yielding predictions rooted in statistical representations of melt structure that compare well with more time-consuming classical MD calculations. This approach also sheds light on the universality of the increasing Grüneisen parameter trend for liquids (opposite that of solids), which directly reflects their progressive evolution toward more compact solid-like structures upon compression.",

We explore the correlation of elastic and electrical anisotropy of shales to mineralogy and organic richness. Both, elastic and electrical anisotropies in rocks are known to be functions of clay and kerogen contents. The elastic anisotropy in clay- and organic-rich shales is related to their laminated and lenticular texture that is enhanced with compaction and diagenesis leading. The correlation of complex resistivity and anisotropy in shales with clay content has theoretically modeled using cation exchange capacity of the clay minerals. Although, it is appear likely that elastic and electrical anisotropy might be controlled by similar petrophyiscal properties, very little research exists that explores the relationship between these two anisotropies and how petrophysical properties might influence them.\nWe present an experimental data of elastic and electrical anisotropy in shales acquired with a new system that allows simultaneous measurements of acoustic velocities and complex resistivities under hydrostatic pressure in three directions: parallel, 45° and perpendicular to any orientation, such as bedding planes. Our results of five shale samples show:\nElastic and electrical anisotropy are inversely related to pressure\nElectrical anisotropy is generally higher than elastic anisotropy\nElectrical anisotropy is more sensitive to pressure change\nComplex resistivity anisotropy for in-phase resistivity and phase is highly frequency dependent\nIn future, we plan to measure shale samples with varying clay and organic contents and correlate anisotropy to petrophysical properties.",

            "abstract": "Global-scale melting expected to follow the largest accretionary impacts suggests that the mantle of terrestrial\nbodies may have been processed through one or multiple magma oceans before reaching a solid state. Several studies\nhave discussed how the fractional crystallization of a magma ocean can establish a primordial compositional\nstratification that may represent a suitable initial condition to model the thermal evolution of the interior as\nwell as the formation, mixing, and sampling through partial melting of geochemical reservoirs. Fractional\ncrystallization is expected to produce a compositional stratification characterized by a progressive enrichment in\nheavy incompatible elements from the core-mantle boundary to the surface. Such configuration is gravitationally\nunstable, it may cause the overturn of the mantle and the formation of a stable chemical layering. This scenario is\nsuccessful in explaining the generation of the Moon's mare basalts as a consequence of the convective instability\nof overturned ilmenite-bearing cumulates and the preservation of Mars' geochemical reservoirs as required by the\nisotopic characteristics of the SNC meteorites. However, it also has a few consequences that can be difficult to\nreconcile with the subsequent evolution of the interior such as the rapid formation of a stagnant lid preventing\nthe uppermost dense cumulates from sinking into the mantle or the difficulty for thermal convection to start\nbecause of the strength of the stable compositional gradient established after the overturn. Using numerical\nsimulations of thermo-chemical convection, we illustrate the above issues and their consequences for the thermal\nevolution of a Mars-like planet. We also present recent results showing that, under a variety of conditions,\nsolid-state convection can start mixing the mantle well before the overlying magma ocean has completely solidified,\nthereby partly or completely erasing the effects of its fractional crystallization.",

            "abstract": "Spectral induced polarization (SIP) porosimetry is a new technique for characterizing the pore size distribution of a porous medium. The induced polarization of porous media under low frequencies is mainly attributed to the relaxation of the mineral/fluid interface, i.e., the electrical double layer (EDL, including both Stern and diffuse layers). Currently, the salinity effect is not considered while applying the SIP porosimetry although a number of experiments have shown the water salinity could affect the relaxation of EDL. In this study, we conducted SIP measurement of a Portland sandstone sample with a broad range of salinities. The relaxation time distributions of the sample at different salinities are obtained by inverting the measured SIP responses using the least-square method with optimized damping parameter. The modal relaxation time shows a non-negligible dependence on the salinity/fluid conductivity. The salinity dependence can be explained by considering the ions exchange between Stern and diffuse layers during polarization, i.e., diffuse layer polarization (DLP). It is also shown that the SIP porosimetry could underestimate the pore size if only Stern layer polarization is considered. It is therefore suggested to include DLP while interpreting the SIP porosimetry data in order to give consistent pore size information with other techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and mercury injection capillary porosimetry.",

These hypotheses are tested by computing three-dimensional back trajectories using winds from a high-resolution simulation of the event with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The WRF model simulation reproduces the storm structure and evolution with good fidelity. The back trajectories reveal two distinct layers of outflow air from different mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Most air in the upper layer is transported northward from an MCS in southern Texas, while the lower layer is from both the northern squall line and the southern MCS. In both layers inconsistencies between observed concentrations of CO, NO, and O3, and predictions from a simple mixing model suggest that there is significant production of NO by lightning in the convective systems. This is consistent with lightning observations from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additionally, the model simulation appears to slightly underestimate the depth of vertical transport by the MCS.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory team is using the Curiosity rover to investigate fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian strata that form the base of Aeolis Mons (Mt. Sharp). Basal outcrops that form the lowest stratigraphic unit of Aeolis Mons, the Murray formation, are dominated by lacustrine mudstones with interbedded fluvial sandstones and conglomerates. They are unconformably overlain by younger, likely eolian sandstones, which onlap the slopes of Aeolis Mons. Interpretation of the stratal relationships requires combined regional-scale orbital mapping and in situ observations of bedding geometry and sedimentary structures due to the laterally discontinuous nature of fluvial interbeds in the Murray formation and the similarity in appearance of the fluvial and eolian sandstones in orbital data. Team efforts demonstrate at least 10’s of meters of relief on the unconformity separating the Murray formation from younger sandstones.\nThe mudstone facies of the Murray formation show substantial variations in elemental composition. SiO2 ranges from <50 to >80 wt %, and Fe (calculated as FeO) varies from <3 to >15 wt %. Magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, and jarosite are present in significantly varying ratios. Cristobalite is also present in some, but not all of the mudstone. Textures in the mudstones include sub millimeter-scale lamination as well as diagenetic textures such as small crystal laths, 3d dendritic concretions, subspherical concretions, and at least two generations of mineral precipitation in fractures.\nOverall, the stratigraphic relationships, textural characteristics, elemental composition and mineralogy indicate deposition in a lake followed by multiple diagenetic events related to lithification, burial, subsurface fluid flow, and weathering. Cross cutting relationships constrain the relative timing of some of these events, but the complexity of the geological history of the basal strata of Aeolis Mons suggests a rich geological history for the basal strata of Aeolis Mons.",

            "abstract": "Similar to Io’s mass loading in the jovian magnetosphere, Saturn’s moon, Enceladus, provides 100s of kilograms of water group neutrals and plasma to the planet’s magnetosphere every second. The newly added plasma, being accelerated and convecting outward due to the centrifugal force, is then lost through magnetic reconnection in the tail. To conserve the total magnetic flux established by the internal dynamo, the ‘empty’ reconnected magnetic flux must return from the tail back to the inner magnetosphere. At both Jupiter and Saturn, flux tubes with enhanced field strength relative to their surroundings have been detected and are believed to be taking the role of returning the magnetic flux. However, at Saturn, flux tubes with depressed field strength are also reported. To reveal the relationship between the two kinds of flux tubes, we have systematically surveyed all the available 1-sec magnetic field data measured by Cassini and studied their statistical properties. The spatial distributions show that enhanced-field flux tubes are concentrated near the equator and closer to the planet while depressed-field flux tubes are distributed in a larger latitudinal region and can be detected at larger distances. In addition, we find that for both types of flux tubes, their occurrence rates vary with the local time in the same pattern and their magnetic flux is in the same magnitude. Therefore, the two types of flux tubes are just different manifestations of the same phenomenon: near the equator with high ambient plasma density, the flux tubes convecting in from the tail are compressed, resulting in increased field strength; off the equator, these flux tubes expand slightly, resulting in decreased field strength. Here we also present the lifecycle of the enhanced-field flux tubes: they gradually break into smaller ones when convecting inward and become indistinguishable from the background inside an L-value of about 4.",

During this monsoon period, besides the happening of flood along east coast, landslides also causes millions of Malaysian Ringgit economical losses. Hence, it is essential to study the prediction of slope failure to prevent the casualty of landslides happening.\nIn our study, we introduce prediction method of the accumulated rainfall affecting the stability of the slope. If the curve, in the graph, which is presented by rainfall intensity versus accumulated rainfall, crosses over the critical line, the condition of the slope is considered in high risk where the data are calculated and sent from rain gauge in the site via internet.\nIf the possibility of slope failure is going high, the alert message will be sent out to the authorities for decision making on road block or setting the warning light at the road side. Besides road block and warning light, we propose to disseminate short message, to pre-registered mobile phone user, to notify the public for easing the traffic jam and avoiding unnecessary public panic.\nPrediction is not enough to prevent the casualty. Early warning awareness of the public is very important to reduce the casualty of landslides happening. IT technology does not only play a main role in disseminating information, early warning awareness education, by using IT technology, should be conducted, in schools, to give early warning awareness on natural hazard since childhood.\nKnowing the pass history on landslides occurrence will gain experience on the landslides happening. Landslides historical events with coordinate information are stored in database. The public can browse these historical events via internet. By referring to such historical landslides events, the public may know where did landslides happen before and the possibility of slope failure occurrence again is considered high.\nSimulation of rainfall induced slope failure mechanism and educational video on symptom before the occurrence of landslide may alert the public awareness, especially in the hilly area.

            "abstract": "Deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratios in Earth’s hydrologic cycle have long served as important tracers of biosphere-atmosphere exchange, yet the global HDO budget remains poorly constrained because of uncertainties in the isotopic compositions of continental evapotranspiration and runoff. Through synthesis of ship-based observation of marine water vapor collected from the world oceans, we bias-correct satellite retrievals of HDO and H2O concentrations from the Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer to resolve the global HDO budget. This budget provides a global baseline for geochemically enabled Earth system models, demonstrates patterns in entrainment of moisture into the marine surface layer, and constrains the isotopic composition of continental output fluxes critical for global ecohydrologic investigations. Based on the composition global continental runoff and evapotranspiration, we quantify the magnitude of hydrologic flux sub-components of transpiration, soil evaporation, surface water evaporation, and interception that are consistent with the global flux isotope ratios. We also investigate the hydrologic connectivity of bound, plant available soil waters with more mobile surface waters. Our results indicate that globally, transpiration is 64 ± 13% (mean ± 1 standard deviation) of evapotranspiration, and 65 ± 26% of evaporation originates from soils and not surface waters. We estimate that 38 ± 28% of surface water is derived from the plant-accessed soil water pool. This limited connectivity between soil and surface waters fundamentally structures the physical and biogeochemical interactions of water transiting through catchments.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed that the geochemical evidence left behind following tsunami inundation is often preserved (Chagué-Goff, 2010). Geochemical signatures can allow us to identify tsunami deposits, but also to accurately estimate the inundation area. However, there is still little known about the characteristics; what kind of chemical component is transported, and how long such a component is preserved.\nHigh concentrations of water-leachable ions attributed to seawater have been reported from paleo-tsunami deposits (e.g., Minoura and Nakaya, 1991). They were also reported in the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami deposit (e.g., Chagué-Goff et al., 2012). Water-leachable ions derived from the tsunami were concentrated in the muddy tsunami deposit or the soil below the sandy tsunami deposit. However, the concentrations decreased with time (a few months to years) (e.g., Chagué-Goff et al., 2014; Shinozaki et al., submitted), probably as a result of leaching by meteoric water. While the evidence of marine inundation is sometimes preserved for a long time (e.g., Minoura et al., 1994), we still need to carry further research of modern and paleo-tsunamis.\nBiomarker analysis is a new study area in tsunami research. Biomarkers are molecular fossils originating from living organisms, which play a role as tracers of particular sources. If we could find marine-origin biomarker from terrestrial sediment, it would be a strong evidence of seawater incursion. Shinozaki et al. (2015, submitted) revealed the characteristics of biomarker in the 2011 tsunami deposit. Marine-origin biomarkers were found in the soil below the sandy tsunami deposit or in the tsunamigenic mud, while they were absent in the sandy tsunami deposit and sandy mud. Biomarkers can adsorb to fine particles and organic matter but not to sand-sized particles. They are expected to be preserved for a long time because marine-origin biomarkers were detected from samples collected more than two years after the tsunami.",

            "abstract": "The full-phase light curves of individual close-in extrasolar giant planets, or \"hot Jupiters,\" show a trend of increasing fractional amplitude with increasing planetary equilibrium temperature. The attached figure shows this trend for 7 transiting low-eccentricity hot Jupiters. For these planets, this trend can be realized as a trend of increasing dayside-to-nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium temperature, as these planets are expected to be tidally locked. Here we examine this trend, in order to shed insight on the physical processes that regulate heat redistribution in tidally-locked planet atmospheres. We utilize a combination of analytic theory to predict how heat is redistributed from day to night over a range of equilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag strengths, and confirm the theory using numerical circulation modeling. Our theory identifies that the transition from low to high day-night temperature differences is mediated by wave adjustment, the same process that regulates heat redistribution in the tropics of Earth. Due to their low rotation rate and hence large Rossby deformation radius, tidally locked planets allow for wave propagation to occur over a much larger latitude range than on Earth. Hence, wave adjustment processes play a key role in the the global, not just equatorial, heat redistribution in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Wave propagation can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by either radiative cooling to space or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag, if present, would likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere threaded by a planetary-scale magnetic field. The radiative cooling timescale is inversely related to the cube of temperature, and any Lorentz drag would increase with temperature due to the increasing ionization fraction of the atmosphere. Hence, both of these processes damp waves more effectively as equilibrium temperature increases. We find in both our analytic theory and numerical simulations that radiative cooling plays the largest role in mediating day-night temperature differences. As a result, day-night temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres decrease with increasing pressure and increase with increasing stellar irradiation.",

            "abstract": "Assessments of hydrological uncertainty often show multiple, interacting uncertainty sources and worryingly large error bounds. Hydrological data such as rainfall and flow measurements, hydrological model structure and model parameters are all potential sources of uncertainty. However, the effects of hydrological uncertainty on our ability to make predictions or decisions can vary widely depending on the question asked, and the choice of question may in part mitigate the effects of high uncertainties.\nThis presentation will use real-world examples of uncertainty assessment in practice, taking an overview of several projects in the UK and New Zealand that involved estimation of uncertainty in predictions of flow regime, water quality trends, subsurface catchment boundaries and flood risk. I will discuss the different strategies used to quantify uncertainty in each project, how uncertainty was communicated, and the effect of uncertainty on the project conclusions and recommendations.\nOf particular interest is whether hydrological methods can be designed to be robust to known sources of uncertainty. Potential strategies include changing the specification of hydrological indices to avoid highly uncertain subsets or analyses of data, or ensuring that only sources of uncertainty directly relevant to the specific management question are considered. I will discuss how these strategies were applied, or could have been improved, in each of the example applications.",

            "abstract": "The caldera of Campi Flegrei is one of the active volcano-hydrothermal systems of the Mediterranean region experiencing notable unrest episodes in a densely populated area. One peculiar trait characterizes the unrest of this system: the ability of withstanding large uplifts before setting off a swarm of microeartquakes. Therefore, one core question is how the subsurface rocks of Campi Flegrei withstand such a large strain and have high strength.\nThe rock physics analysis of well cores up to 3 km provides evidence for the existence of two horizons, above and below the seismogenic area, underlying a natural, coupled process. The basement is a calc-silicate rock housing hydrothermal decarbonation reactions, which provide lime-rich fluids. The impermeable caprock above the seismogenic area has a pozzolanic composition and a fibril-rich matrix made of intertwining filaments of ettringite and tobemorite, resulting from lime-pozzolanic reactions. These findings provide evidence for a natural process reflecting that of the engineering of the Roman concrete. The formation of fibrous minerals by intertwining filaments confers shear and tensile strength to the caprock, contributing to its ductility and increased resistance to fracture.\nThe importance of these findings lies not only on the fibrous and compositionally nature of the caprock but also on its possible physicochemical deterioration. Given the P-T‐XCO2 conditions regulating the decarbonation reactions, possible influx of new brine into the Campi Flegrei system dilutes the existing CO2, thus triggering further decarbonation reaction. This leads to the formation of additional CO2, methane, and steam. As these gases rise toward the surface, they are halted by the natural concrete-like layer, which would lead to pore pressure increase and subsequent ground deformations.",

            "abstract": "The island of Bohol, in central Visayas, Philippines, endured a devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.2 in the morning of October 15, 2013. This inland earthquake occurred as a result of movement along a previously unknown thrust fault now called the North Bohol Fault. Surface rupture, coastal uplift and analysis of SAR data all indicate surface deformation spread over a rupture area extending along the 60 km length of the island of Bohol. In contrast, the NEIC finite fault solution, shows slip concentrated in a tight asperity offshore and to the SW of the island. About 230 people were killed by the earthquake and over 70,000 buildings damaged. Because of the extensive damage and the wide spread of intensities inferred to have shaken the island, the Bohol earthquake presents an important opportunity to improve knowledge of building fragility for the Philippines and similar countries. However, this requires: (1) a detailed source model for accurate estimation of earthquake ground motion, and (2) a reliable statistical description of building damage. To this end we developed an improved source model through joint inversion of seismic and SAR data, as well as empirical Green's functions. We also undertook a statistical building survey of damaged as well as undamaged buildings, collecting data for over 18,000 structures in rural and urban districts spread throughout the island. These data have been correlated with the intensities derived from different finite source models. We show how this allows us to place observational constraints on building fragility functions, thereby improving earthquake risk and impact forecasts for future earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The problem of chromospheric and coronal heating is also a problem of mass supply to the corona. On average we see redshifts at transition region temperatures of the order of 10 km/s. If interpreted as downflows, this would quickly empty the corona, and fresh material has to be transported into the corona. Several models have been proposed to understand this mass cycle between the different atmospheric layers. However, as of yet all these proposals have serious shortcomings. On the observational side open questions remain, too. With the new IRIS mission we can observe the transition region at unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution, but the observational results are still puzzling. In particular the finding that the spatial distribution of line widths and Doppler shifts do not change with increasing resolution is against physical intuition. This shows that even with IRIS we still have significant velocity gradients along the line-of-sight, indicating that shocks might play a significant role. Likewise the temporal evolution might be a key for our understanding of the mass cycle. It might well be that the filling and draining of hot plasma occurs on significantly different time scales, which might be part of the difficulty to arrive at a conclusive observational picture. Considering the progress made for the quiet Sun, it seems clear that the processes responsible for the mass exchange are not resolved (yet). Therefore one might wonder to what extent one could use larger and resolved individual events in more active parts of the Sun to understand the details of the mass transport. In particular a common understanding of reconnection events such as Ellerman bombs in the photosphere, explosive events in the transition region and the recently discovered IRIS bombs in-between might provide the key to better understand the mass cycle throughout the atmospheric layers from the photosphere to the corona.",

            "abstract": "Many phenomena and data related to volcanoes and volcano eruptions have been observed and collected over the past four hundred years. They have been interpreted with the conventional and widely accepted hypothesis or theory of hot magma fluid from mantle.  However, the prediction of volcano eruption sometimes is incorrect. For example, the devastating eruption of the Mount Ontake on Sept. 27, 2014 was not predicted and/or warned at all, which caused 55 fatalities, 9 missing and more than 60 injured. Therefore, there is a need to reconsider the cause and mechanism of active volcano and its hydrothermal system. On the basis of more than 30 year study and research in geology, volcano, earthquake, geomechanics, geophysics, geochemistry and geohazards, the author has developed a new and alternative modeling framework (or hypothesis) to better interpret the observed volcano-hydrothermal system data and to more accurately predict the occurrence of volcano explosion. An active volcano forms a cone-shape mountain and has a crater with vertical pipe conduit to allow hot lava, volcanic ash and gases to escape or erupt from its chamber (Figure). The chamber locates several kilometers below the ground rocks. The active volcanos are caused by highly compressed and dense gases escaped from the Mantle of the Earth. The gases are mainly CH4 and further trapped in the upper crustal rock mass. They make chemical reactions with the surrounding rocks in the chamber. The chemical reactions are the types of reduction and decomposition. The reactions change the gas chemical compounds into steam water gas H2O, CO2, H2S, SO2 and others. The oxygen in the chemical reaction comes from the surrounding rocks. So, the product lava has a less amount of oxygen than that of the surrounding rocks. The gas-rock chemical reactions produce heat. The gas expansion and penetration power and the heat further break and crack the surrounding rock mass and make them into lavas, fragments, ashes or bombs. The pyroclastic deposits are carried out of the chamber by the gas expansion and uplift power and form the cone-shape mountain. The crust loses its rocks and the chamber becomes larger and larger. Eventually, the last eruption occurs and breaks the upper rocks and the cone mountain. The pyroclatic rocks collapse into the chamber space and leave a basin or lake.  ",

Herein we discuss ion energy distributions extracted from these spectra, each accumulated over an ~4 minute interval along the spacecraft trajectory. This is accomplished by fitting calibration peak models to TOF spectra in order to determine the TOF range associated with each aforementioned ion group, and then summing counts over each TOF range to obtain well-resolved energy peaks for each group. Energy distributions are determined by fitting the logistic power peak function to each of the resulting energy spectra. We then plot the resulting distribution parameters (peak energy, peak amplitude, and peak width or temperature) for each species and each encounter against Titan latitude, longitude, and altitude to generate a map of ion parameters. In addition, the encounters are grouped according to ambient plasma and magnetic field measurements in order to characterize the ion distribution parameters in different regions of Saturn's magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Predictability of the formation, rapid intensification and eyewall replacement of sheared tropical cyclones (TCs) are explored through a series of convection-permitting ensemble simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with different environmental vertical wind shear, sea-surface temperature (SST), and ambient moisture conditions. It is found that the intrinsic predictability of the RI onset time is more limited with increasing shear magnitude until the shear magnitude is large enough to prevent the TC formation. Based on ensemble sensitivity and correlation analysis, the RI onset timing within one set is largely related to the vortex tilt magnitude, the diabatic heating distribution and the strength of the primary vortex circulation. Systematic differences amongst the ensemble members begin to arise right after the initial burst of moist convection associated with the incipient vortex. This difference from the randomness inherent in moist convection in terms of both location and intensity first changes the TC vortex structure subtly and then leads to the deviations in system scales and eventually in the development (and precession) of the TC. On average, a higher SST has a positive effect on the TC formation and reduces the uncertainty of development under all shear conditions, while a drier environment has a negative impact on the TCs development and either broadens the ensemble spread of RI onset time or prevents the storm from forming when the shear-induced tilt is large. Nevertheless, the uncertainty in environmental shear magnitudes may dominate over the effect of randomness in moist convection in terms of TC formation and predictability. A byproduct of tropical cyclones under vertical wind shear is the secondary eyewall formation (SEF). It is found that the eyewall formation is more often observed in TCs with moderate to high shear, which was inherently more unpredictable. The inward contraction/axisymmeterization of shear-induced asymmetric outer rainbands is the key to SEF of sheared tropical cyclones.",

            "abstract": "It has been acknowledged for some time that a coupling exists between vegetation, climate and hydrological processes (e.g. Eagleson, 1982a, Rodriguez-Iturbe,2001 ). Recently, Gao et al.(2014) demonstrated that one of the core parameters of hydrological functioning, the catchment-scale root zone water storage capacity, can be estimated based on climate data alone. It was shown that ecosystems develop root zone storage capacities that allow vegetation to bridge droughts with return periods of about 20 years. As a consequence, assuming that the evaporative demand determines the root zone storage capacity, land use changes, such as deforestation, should have an effect on the development of this capacity .\nIn this study it was tested to which extent deforestation affects root zone storage capacities. To do so, four different hydrological models were calibrated in a moving window approach after deforestation occurred. In this way, model based estimates of the storage capacity in time were obtained. This was compared with short term estimates of root zone storage capacities based on a climate based method similar to Gao et al.(2014). In addition, the equilibrium root zone storage capacity was determined with the total time series of an unaffected control catchment.\nPreliminary results indicate that models tend to adjust their storage capacity to the values found by the climate based method. This is strong evidence that the root zone storage is determined by the evaporative demand of vegetation. Besides, root zones storage capacities develop towards an equilibrium value where the ecosystem is in balance, further highlighting the evolving, time dynamic character of hydrological systems.",

            "abstract": "Version 3 of GEOMAGIA50 is the product of an international collaboration to develop a comprehensive online database that allows easy access to published paleomagnetic and chronological data from the past 50 ka. The overarching scientific goal is to improve our understanding of changes in the geomagnetic field, with applications ranging from the deep Earth, to past environments and climate, to the interaction of the geomagnetic field with the space environment. We present the large range of modifications made to the database since its initial release in 2006. The most significant is the addition of paleomagnetic, rock magnetic and chronological data obtained from lake and marine sediments. An emphasis has been placed on geochronological data from sediments and the database includes comprehensive radiocarbon age data, oxygen isotope data, varve ages and tephra ages. In the archeomagnetic and volcanic database, the amount of declination, inclination and paleointensity data has been increased greatly and now exceeds 15,000. In addition, a number of new metadata fields have been added, e.g., more specific information about the archaeological or volcanic sites the data were obtained from. Finally, the web interface has been updated. This includes a new query form for the sediment database and improved functionality of the archeomagnetic and volcanic query form.

            "abstract": "We take an advantage of five different DC electric field measurements in the plasma sheet available from the EFW double probe experiment, EDI electron drift instrument, CODIF and HIA ion spectrometers, and PEACE electron spectrometer on the four Cluster spacecraft. The calibrated observations of the three spectrometers are used to determine the proton and electron velocity moments. The velocity moments can be used to estimate the proton and electron drift velocity and furthermore the DC electric field, assuming that the electron and proton velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field is dominated by the ExB drift motion. Naturally when ions and electrons do not perform a proper drift motion, which can happen in the plasma sheet, the estimated DC electric field from ion and electron motion is not correct. However, surprisingly often the DC electric fields estimated from electron and ion motions are identical suggesting that this field is a real DC electric field around the measurement point. As the measurement techniques are so different, it is quite plausible that when two different measurements yield the same DC electric field, it is the correct field. All five measurements of the DC electric field are usually not simultaneously available, especially on Cluster 2 where CODIF and HIA are not operational, or on Cluster 4 where EDI is off. In this presentation we investigate DC electric field in various transient plasma sheet events such as dipolarization events and BBF’s and how the five measurements agree or disagree. There are plenty of important issues that are considered, e.g., (1) what kind of DC electric fields exist in such events and what are their spatial scales, (2) do electrons and ions perform ExB drift motions in these events, and (3) how well the instruments have been calibrated.",

            "abstract": "In the last three decades the capabilities of measuring the atmospheric composition from space did grow tremendously with ESA’s ENVISAT and NASA’s Eos-Aura satellite programmes. The potential to operationally monitor the atmospheric composition, like the meteorological community is doing for the physical parameters, is now within reach. At the same time, the importance for society of operational environmental monitoring, related to the ozone layer, air quality and climate change, became apparent.\nThe Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), launched on board of NASA’s EOS-Aura spacecraft in on July 15, 2004, provides unique contributions to air quality monitoring from Space. The combination of urban scale resolution (13 x 24 km2 in nadir) and daily global coverage proved to be key features for the air quality community. The OMI data is currently used for improving the air quality forecasts, for inverting high-resolution emission maps, for UV forecast and for volcanic plume warning systems for aviation. Due to its 11 year continuous operation OMI now provides the longest NO2 record from space, which is essential to understand the changes in emissions globally.\nIn 2016 Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), will be launched on board ESA’s Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite. TROPOMI will have a spatial resolution of 7x7 km2 in nadir; a more than 6 times improvement over OMI. The high spatial resolution serves two goals: (1) emissions sources can be detected with even better accuracy and (2) the number of cloud-free ground pixels will increase substantially. TROPOMI also adds additional spectral bands that allow for better cloud corrections, as well as the retrieval of carbon monoxide and methane. TROPOMI will be an important satellite mission for the Copernicus atmosphere service.\nTROPOMI will play a key role in the Air Quality Constellation, being the polar instruments that can link the 3 GEO UVN instruments, Sentinel 4, TEMPO and GEMS. Thus, TROPOMI can serve as a travelling standard that allows intercomparison of the calibration of the geostationary instruments.\nAn overview of air quality applications, emission inversions and trend analyses will be presented, based on the 11 years of OMI data. An outlook will be presented on the potentials of TROPOMI, including its role in the Air Quality Constellation.",

            "abstract": "Since 1947, Iceland has featured 26 volcanic eruptions (2.5 eruptions/year). These include events at the central volcanoes Hekla, Eyjafjallajökull, Grímsvötn and Askja and the fissure eruptions of Surtsey 1963-67 and Nornahraun 2014-15. Of these, 11 are effusive, 8 are mixed (explosive to effusive) and 6 are within-glacier events. Surtsey is the only emergent submarine event (1309 days; 1 km3). Duration of effusive eruptions spans 0.3 to 181 days, with volume, average and peak magma discharge ranging from 10-5–1.6 km3, 0.5–123 m3/s and 1–370 m3/s. Similarly, the mixed events have durations spanning 2.8 to 393 days with volume, average and peak magma discharge ranging from 0.03–0.87 km3, 14–617 m3/s and 50–35600 m3/s. Duration of within-glacier events spans 4.4 to 14 days with volume, average and peak magma discharge ranging from 0.05–0.27 km3, 9–440 m3/s and 400–14000 m3/s. The discharge profiles for these eruptions are highly variable. Mixed eruptions often feature intense discharge (1500 to 40000 m3/s) at the onset of eruption (lasting hours), but some start in a much more subdued manner (500-1000 m3/s). This initial phase is followed by low (3-20 m3/s) magma discharge lasting for weeks to months that normally terminates abruptly. The onset of effusive eruptions is typified by modest discharge (10’s to 100’s m3/s). They can be very abrupt (<1 day), or drawn out for weeks to months with discharge dropping steadily throughout. The within-glacier events are short-lived explosive events, although with highly varied intensity (see above), and appear to terminate rather abruptly. Plots of eruption duration against size or discharge exhibits no systematic correlation suggesting that none of the eruption source parameters exert principal control on eruption duration or termination. However, these parameters may play a role in conjunction with other factors such as the nature of the lithostratigraphic succession and the local stress field at the eruption site.",

            "abstract": "The 31.08.2014 to 27.02.2015 Nornahraun eruption in North Iceland is the largest eruption in Iceland in 232 years, producing an 85km2 lava flow field with a volume of 1.5-2km3. The eruption began on a 2 km long fissure that cut through the 1797AD Holuhraun vent system, spreading lava onto the flat (slope <0.4°) Dyngjujokull outwash plane. At mean magma discharge of 250 m3  the lava was transported from the vents via a 3.5km long lava channel, feeding a 1–2km wide rubbly pāhoehoe to ‘a‘a flow front advancing to the NE at rate of 1–2 km/day. This lava flow came to halt on 12 September at a distance of 18km from the vents and for the next 5 days it was subjected to endogenous growth reaching a mean thickness 12m and a volume 0.35km3. Mean magma discharge dropped to 150 m3/s on 18th and the vent activity was reduced to a 500 m long central segment of the fissure. A new lava flow formed, advancing along the southern margins of the first, coming to rest on 22 September at 11.5 km from the vents (vol. 0.09km3). On 23rd the third flow formed, advanced along south and north margins of the flow field, reaching a maximum length of 6.7 km as it came to rest on the 26th (vol. 0.06km3). Increase in magma discharge to about 220 m3/s is observed between 27 September and 8 October forming the 4th lava flow along the south margins of the flow field. This flow surged out to a distance of 15km in 12 days (vol. 0.22km3). Flow 5 formed between 9 to 30 October at mean discharge of 140 m3/s, advancing along the south side of flow 4 and reaching length of 11 km (vol. 0.30km3). Similarly, the sixth flow formed along flow 5 between 1-14 November at mean discharge of 110 m3/s and reaching length of 7.5km (vol. 0.11km3). This signaled the end of this gradual clockwise widening of the flow field, which coincided with partial crusting over of the lava channel and initiation of insulated flows that were emplaced on top of the earlier formed flows for the reminder of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of hot planets depends strongly on how heat is transported to their surfaces through large scale convection flows. This is ultimately controlled by the rheology of high-pressure phases under extreme conditions. Whenever solid rocks are concerned, plastic flow results from the propagation of crystal defects (point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries). In this presentation we focus on the role of pressure on dislocation glide which is usually the most efficient strain-producing mechanism.\nDislocation glide is assessed through multiscale numerical modeling. First, dislocations are modeled at the atomic scale based on first-principles calculations to incorporate the influence of pressure. Then the mobility law of dislocation at finite temperature is modeled by describing thermally-activated mechanisms for dislocation glide based on the kink-pair model. Then the flow stress at the grain scale is deduced either from application of the Orowan equation or by dislocation dynamics modeling. This approach is applied to wadsleyite, ringwoodite, bridgmanite and post-perovskite. Mechanical properties are either calculated at laboratory strain-rates to be compared with experiments when available or at mantle strain-rate to assess their efficiency under natural conditions.",

Remote sensing offers a good option for creating glacier outlines over large areas, but manual correction is frequently necessary, especially in areas containing supraglacial debris. We show three different workflows for mapping clean ice and debris-covered ice within Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). By working at the object level as opposed to the pixel level, OBIA facilitates using contextual, spatial and hierarchical information when assigning classes, and additionally permits the handling of multiple data sources.\nOur first example shows mapping debris-covered ice in the Manaslu Himalaya, Nepal. SAR Coherence data is used in combination with optical and topographic data to classify debris-covered ice, obtaining an accuracy of 91%.\nOur second example shows using a high-resolution LiDAR derived DEM over the Hohe Tauern National Park in Austria. Breaks in surface morphology are used in creating image objects; debris-covered ice is then classified using a combination of spectral, thermal and topographic properties.\nLastly, we show a completely automated workflow for mapping glacier ice in Norway. The NDSI and NIR/SWIR band ratio are used to map clean ice over the entire country but the thresholds are calculated automatically based on a histogram of each image subset. This means that in theory any Landsat scene can be inputted and the clean ice can be automatically extracted. Debris-covered ice can be included semi-automatically using contextual and morphological information.",

            "abstract": "At the outlet of mountain ranges, rivers flow onto flatter lowlands. The associated change of slope causes sediment deposition. As the river is free to move laterally, it builds conical sedimentary structures called alluvial fans. Their location at the interface between erosional and depositional areas makes them valuable sedimentary archives. To decipher these sedimentary records, we need to understand the dynamics of their growth.\nMost natural fans are built by braided streams. However, to avoid the complexity of braided rivers, we develop a small-scale experiment in which an alluvial fan is formed by a single channel. We use a mixture of water and glycerol to produce a laminar river. The fluid is mixed with corindon sand (~ 300 μm) in a tilted channel and left free to form a fan around its outlet. The sediment and water discharges are constant during an experimental run. We record the fan progradation and the channel morphology with top-view pictures. We also generate an elevation map with an optical method based on the deformation of a moiré pattern.\nWe observe that, to leading order, the fan remains self-affine as it grows, with a constant slope. We compare two recent studies about the formation of one-dimensionnal fan [Guerit et al. 2014] and threshold rivers [Seizilles et al. 2013] to our experimental findings. In particular, we propose a theory witch relates the fan morphology to the control parameters ( fluid and sediment discharges, grain size). Our observation accord with the predictions, suggesting that the fan is built near the threshold of sediment motion.\nFinally, we intend to expand our interpretation to alluvial fans build by single-thread channels ( Okavango, Bostwana; Taquari and Paraguay, Brasil; Pastaza, Peru).",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and the strongest stratospheric ozone-destroying substance released in the 21st century. Main N2O emissions are linked to different microbial pathways, therefore sources are disperse and highly variable, complicating their interpretation. Isotopic measurements have great potential to distinguish between individual source and sink processes. Developments in laser spectroscopy allow both the intramolecular distribution of 15N substitutions (15N14N16O versus 14N15N16O) and the oxygen isotopic composition of N2O to be measured in real-time, at high precision and in excellent compatibility to IRMS [1].\nIn a number of laboratory and pilot plant studies we investigated the isotopic signature of distinct microbial and abiotic N2O production and consumption pathways in soil and aqueous solution [e.g. 2-4]. Specific pathways were favoured by selection of the nitrogen substrates and process conditions and their isotopic signatures identified by real-time laser spectroscopic analysis. Results from our laboratory studies are in accordance with pure culture experiments and can therefore be applied to other ecosystems.\nHigh precision isotopic analysis at ambient N2O concentration is feasible by combining laser spectroscopy with automated preconcentration. Field deployment was demonstrated by real-time monitoring of the isotopic composition of N2O emissions above an intensively managed grassland in central Switzerland. The responses of the N2O isotopic signatures were analysed with respect to management events and climatic conditions [5]. In a follow-up project we combine real-time N2O isotopic analysis at a tall tower in central Switzerland with atmospheric transport simulations and a biogeochemical model of surface fluxes of N2O isotopomers. The working hypothesis is that this approach will allow us to quantify regional N2O sources, identify emission hot spots, and constrain source processes, which will significantly advance our understanding of this important greenhouse gas.\n[1] J.

Using GPS data from 1998 to 2013 as well as a block modeling approach, we decompose the crustal motion into multiple rotating blocks and elastic deformation associated with fault slip at block boundaries. Our preferred model composed of 8 blocks, produces a mean residual velocity of 3.4 mm/yr at 93 GPS stations. Estimated long-term slip rates along the Manila subduction zone show a gradual southward decrease from 66 mm/yr at the northwest tip of Luzon to 60 mm/yr at the southern portion of the Manila Trench. We infer a low coupling fraction of 11% offshore northwest Luzon and a coupling fraction of 27% near the subduction of Scarborough Seamount. The accumulated strain along the Manila subduction zone at latitudes 15.5°~18.5°N could be balanced by earthquakes with composite magnitudes of Mw 8.7 and Mw 8.9 based on a recurrence interval of 500 years and 1000 years, respectively. Estimates of sinistral slip rates on the major splay faults of the Philippine fault system in central Luzon increase from east to west: sinistral slip rates are 2 mm/yr on the Dalton fault, 8 mm/yr on the Abra River fault, and 12 mm/yr on the Tubao fault. On the southern segment of the Philippine fault (Digdig fault), we infer left-lateral slip of ~20 mm/yr. The Vigan-Aggao fault in northwest Luzon exhibits significant reverse slip of up to 31 mm/yr, although deformation may be distributed across multiple offshore thrust faults. On the Northern Cordillera fault, we calculate left-lateral slip of ~7 mm/yr. Results of block modeling suggest that the majority of active faults in Luzon are fully locked to a depth of 15–20 km. Inferred moment magnitudes of inland large earthquakes in Luzon fall in the range of Mw 7.0–7.5 based on a recurrence interval of 100 years. Using the long-term plate convergence rate between the Sunda plate and Philippine Sea plate as well as seismic moment release rate, we calculate the moment budget for the entire Luzon plate boundary zone that could be balanced by earthquakes with a composite magnitude of ~Mw 9 based on recurrence intervals of 500–1000 years.",

            "abstract": "There is growing scientific and political interest in the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions on the Arctic. Over recent decades temperatures in the Arctic have increased twice the global rate, largely due to ice albedo and temperature feedbacks. While deep cuts in global CO2 emissions are required to slow this warming, there is also growing interest in the potential for reducing short lived climate forcers (SLCFs). Politically, action on SLCFs may be particularly promising because the benefits of mitigation appear promptly and there are large co-benefits in terms of improved air quality.\nThis study is the first to systematically quantify the Arctic climate impact of regional SLCF emissions, taking into account BC, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile hydrocarbons (VOC), organic carbon (OC) and tropospheric ozone, their transport processes and transformations in the atmosphere. Using several chemical transport models we perform detailed radiative forcing calculations from emissions of these species. Geographically we separate emissions into seven source regions that correspond with the national groupings of the Arctic Council, the leading body organizing international policy in the region (the United States, Canada, the Nordic countries, the rest of Europe, Russia, East and South Asia, and the rest of the world). We look at six main sectors known to account for [nearly all] of these emissions: households (domestic), energy/industry/waste, transport, agricultural fires, grass/forest fires, and gas flaring.\nWe find that the largest Arctic warming source is from emissions within the Asian nations. However, the Arctic is most sensitive, per unit mass emitted, to SLCFs emissions from a small number of activities within the Arctic nations themselves. A stringent, but technically feasible SLCFs mitigation scenario, phased in from 2015 through 2030, can cut warming by 0.2 K in 2050.",

            "abstract": "Spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamic is a major factor influencing flash flood modelling. Interactions between localized, intense rainfall patterns and initial soil moisture spatial distributions make soil saturation excess to be reached quickly (ref: Anquetin et al., 2010 and Zocatelli et al., 2010) The few observations on hillslope flows suggest significant lateral flow transfer from the soil layers to the river. Moreover, Vannier et al. (2013) and Garambois et al. (2015) point out the importance of the catchment geological properties on flash flood dynamics, and in particular on the water storage during those events.\nAccording to these observations, this study proposes a new modelling of the soil water dynamic in the distributed and physical-based model MARINE. The objective is to improve the representation of the physical processes in an operational flash flood model.\nThe soil column is divided in two compartments in order to represent in the upper layer the interflow in the vadose-zone with transmissivity and suction forces depending on Van Genuchten’s formula and in the lower layer the groundwater flow and the storage in the weathered bedrock with a free water table model based on Darcy’s law. Furthermore boundary conditions of lateral flow at channel interface are adapted using the conductance concept in order to better represent the dynamic interaction between both hydrological elements.\nThe model is applied to several catchments of the French Mediterranean area ranging from 100 km2 to 500 km2. As expected, the new process representation impacts the simulation of the flow dynamic. The rising time of the subsurface flow is consistent with the catchment characteristic response time of a storm event. The recession curves are also improved. The sensitivity analysis suggests a strong influence of stream-aquifer flows and their representation.",

            "abstract": "Late Cretaceous magmatism is widely distributed along the south west coast of India, mainly in the form of dyke intrusions. Most prominent dykes were emplaced around 65 Ma and are distributed in central Kerala, north Kerala and Goa. The strike trend of these dykes is NW-SE in central Kerala, whereas two orthogonal directions with NW-SE and NE-SW trends are found in north Kerala. In Goa region, they are mostly perpendicular to the coast. 25 sites (232 samples) have been collected in Kerala and Goa areas. A subordinate magmatism, around 90 Ma in age, is also traced in Agali area and St Mary Archipelago off the Malpe coast. Nine dykes (79 samples) with NW-SE trend were collected, and 9 flows (63 samples) from 8 different islands of the St Mary Archipelago. Finally, following some field evidences, the Ezhimala igneous complex, south of St Mary Islands, that occurs as a linear ridge with a NNW-SSE trend and consists mainly of granite, granophyre and gabbro, cut by dolerites, was also sampled (9 sites, 58 samples) despite its inferred Precambrian age (Rb-Sr determinations at 678 Ma). Finally, in order to constrain the duration of the Deccan volcanism, some of the younger and of the older flows (55 sites, 309 samples) were also collected.\nMost of the doleritic dykes are fine to medium grained with typical mineral assemblages of plagioclase, augite, olivine, and Fe-Ti oxides. All the mafic dykes of Kerala plot within the sub-alkalic field but three groups can be distinguished chemically. Fe-Ti oxides are found either as early inclusions within pyroxene or as interstitial and may constitute the late crystallization phases. Selected specimens from each site were subjected to low and high temperature susceptibility measurements to define the magnetic carriers and the thermal stability of the samples. They have indicated titanomagnetite as the main carrier of magnetization. Palaeomagnetic measurements were carried out by detailed step-wise alternating field and thermal demagnetizations. After removal of sometime significant secondary components of magnetization, characteristic remanent magnetizations could be defined for most samples. The directions include both normal and reverse polarities. Some Ar/Ar age determinations have also been carried out. These Late Cretaceous results will be discussed in a geodynamic context.",

            "abstract": "The genesis of economical rare metals (Zr, Nb, REE) ore deposits in largegranitic complexes (e.g., Strange Lake and Thor Lake Nechalacho deposit, Canada; Galineiro complex, Spain) is related to the intrusion of alkaline halogen-rich magmatic bodies. Although the role of exolved magmatic fluids in the mobilization and transport of HFSE is widely recognized, the physico-chemical conditions and atomic-scale mechanisms that control the formation of the ore deposits remain poorly understood.\nWe present new experimental constraints on behavior of HFSE during the exsolution of aqueous fluids from peralkaline granitic magmas at crustal conditions. In situ partitioning and speciation studies of Zr in the haplogranite-(F)-H2O systems using synchrotron X-ray spectroscopies provide evidence for large controls of fluid chemistry and temperature on the mobilization and transport of HFSE in crustal settings. At shallow crustal pressure conditions (> 800 °C and 0.3 GPa), Zr preferentially partitions into the exolved aqueous fluid in the presence of fluorine (Df/mZr = 1.40 ± 0.10) as previously reported for Nb in F- (and Cl-) bearing metaluminous granitic systems at similar conditions. The reverse partitioning of HFSE (Zr and Nb) into the aqueous phase at temperature above 800 °C contrast with the behavior observed at lower temperatures, where the Df/mZr remain lower than 1 at all pressures. The enrichment of the aqueous phase in HFSE (Zr, Nb) in the earlier stages of the magmatic evolution is likely related to the enhanced peralkalinity of low pressure (< 0.4 GPa), F-bearing aqueous fluid coexisting with granitic melts as temperature increases. This particular fluid chemistry provides the favorable conditions for the mobilization of HFSE via the formation of HFSE-O-Si/Na clusters in the fluid as shown by the in situ Zr speciation data. Our results show that the exsolution of highly alkaline early magmatic fluid at pressures below 0.4 GPa has the potential to extract HFSE from F-rich granitic melts and thus play a chief role in the formation of rare metal deposits. Moreover, the potential mobilization and redistribution of HFSE by high T-low P (T > 700 – 800 °C; 0.05 < P < 0.3 GPa) fluids in volcanic arcs may have critical implications for the interpretation of geochemical signature of arc magmas as will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Multiyear ice (MYI) characteristics can be retrieved from passive or active microwave remote sensing observations. One of the algorithms that combine both of observations to identify partial concentrations of ice types (including MYI) is the Environment Canada’s Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE). However, cycles of warm/cold air temperature trigger wet-refreeze cycles of the snow cover on MYI ice surface. Under wet snow conditions, anomalous brightness temperature and backscatter, similar to those of first year ice (FYI) are observed. This leads to misidentification of MYI as being FYI, hence decreasing the estimated MYI concentration suddenly. The purpose of this study is to introduce a correction scheme to restore the MYI concentration under this condition. The correction is based on air temperature records. It utilizes the fact that the warm spell in autumn lasts for a short period of time (a few days). The correction is applied to MYI concentration results from ECICE using an input of combined QuikSCAT and AMSR-E data; acquired over the Arctic region in a series of autumn seasons from 2003 to 2008. The correction works well by replacing anomalous MYI concentrations with interpolated ones. For September of the six years, it introduces over 0.1×106 km2 MYI area except for 2005. Due to the regional effect of the warm air spells, the correction could be important in the operational applications where small and meso scale ice concentrations are crucial.",

            "abstract": "Knowing the age distribution of water abstracted from public water supply wells is of prime importance to ensure customer trust and to underpin predictions of water quality evolution in time. Especially, age distributions enable the assessment of the vulnerability of well fields, both in relation to surface sources of contamination as in relation to subsurface sources, such as possibly related to shale gas extraction. We sampled the raw water of 41 large public supply well fields which represents a mixture of groundwaters and used the a discrete travel time distribution model (DTTDM, Visser et al. 2013, WRR) in order to quantify the age distribution of the mixture. Measurements included major ion chemistry, 3H, 3He, 4He, 18O, 2H, 14C, 13CDIC and 13CCH4 and the full range of noble gases. The heavier noble gases enable the calculation of the Noble Gas Temperature (NGT) which characterizes the temperature of past recharge conditions. The 14C apparent age of each mixture was derived correcting for dead carbon sources. The DTTDM used the 3H and 4He concentrations, the 14C apparent age and the NGT as the four distinctive tracers to estimate the age distributions. Especially 4He and NGT provide extra information on the older part of the age distributions and showed that the 14C apparent ages are often the result of mixing of waters ranging between 2.000 and 35.000 years old, instead of being discrete ages with a limited .variance as sometimes assumed.\nThe results show a large range of age distributions, comprising vulnerable well fields with >60% young water (< 100 yrs) and well-protected well fields with >85% very old groundwater (> 25 kyrs) and all forms of TTD’s in between. The age distributions are well in correspondence with the hydrogeological setting of the well fields; all well fields with an age distribution skewed towards older ages are in the Roer Valley Graben structure, where fluvial and marine aquitards provide protection from recent recharge. Especially waters from this graben structure exhibit clear paleoclimate signals, with a clear relations between NGT (ranging from 2,8 -9 °<span\">C), 4He (up to 3.3E-6 cc STP/g) and 18O (range from -8.5—5.5‰).

            "abstract": "Understanding climate-glacier dynamics in the Himalaya is notoriously difficult, as numerous forcing factors govern glacier mass balance and glacier sensitivity to climate change. There are large uncertainties associated with characterizing and predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of debris-covered glacier surfaces due to topographic forcing, supraglacial debris sediment fluxes and depth, ablation rates and meltwater production, supraglacial lake development, and ice stress and velocity dynamics. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize glacier sensitivity to climate change and the degree to which glacier topography changes over time. Therefore, we examined the utility of geomorphometric parameters and objects to characterize temporal changes in glacier-surface topography that may be indicative of glacier sensitivity to climate change. Specifically, we utilized STRM and ASTER digital elevation models over the Karakoram Himalaya to evaluate some of the largest glaciers including the Baltoro, Batura, Biafo and Hispar Glaciers. We developed new geomorphometric parameters to characterize the first- and second-order topographic structures for these glaciers, and compared the spatial patterns over multiple years. Our results indicate that glacier-surface topographic patterns are spatially complex compared to the surrounding topography, and that spatial patterns vary significantly over time due to complex climate-glacier dynamics. Various patterns are associated with meltwater and ice flow, downwasting, supraglacial lakes, and the build-up of supraglacial debris. Quantitative characterization of these patterns can be used to map various process-form relationships over time. The presence of unique glacier morphologies and their rates of change may enable a first-order approximation of glacier sensitivity to climate change, as glacier-surface topography integrates feedback mechanisms that account for microclimate, ablation and meltwater production, and sediment transport and debris depth. We report on the utility of these metrics and patterns for characterizing and mapping glacier-surface morphodynamic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The standard approach to traveltimes inversion in layered models allows us to recognize velocities using refracted waves observations and describe the shapes of boundaries using reflected waves. This idea works well in crustal studies where we observe high vertical velocity gradients and sharp velocity contrasts on interfaces. In case of sedimentary layers this situation is different. Velocities in each layer are almost constant and boundary contrasts are weak. In this scenario dominant wide angle signals in form of post-critical reflections are often observed.\nThis presentation shows an alternative inversion strategy, where a wide angle reflections are used to find the velocities in corresponding layers. A detailed synthetic analysis for a sedimentary layers shows that refraction is giving information about the upper part of a layer, and cannot give reliable estimation of velocities, especially in the deeper part. Using a joint inversion of both refractions and reflections including post-critical observations significantly improves the uncertainties of velocities. Besides synthetic tests, a field data interpretation is presented. During the standard reflection seismic experiment Żelazny-Most 2D with vibratory sources an additional full spread refractions has been recorded. Those data are combined with near-vertical reflections interpreted from reflection seismic for the best possible results. Presented analysis shows that this approach gives the possibility to significantly enhance the velocity information with cheap and easy to perform observations, that help us estimate the uncertainty of the depth of seismic horizons in the final depth image.",

            "abstract": "The detailed snowpack model SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus is used for a wide range of applications such as avalanche hazard risk forecast, mountain hydrology and climatology. Recently, a spectral two-stream radiative scheme (TARTES, Libois et al., 2013) has been implemented in Crocus in replacement of the original semi-empirical parameterizations of albedo and solar radiation absorption. The effect of the spectral repartition of the diffuse/direct incident solar radiation, of the sun zenith angle and of the physical and chemical properties of every snow layers are thus physically taken into account in the computation of the solar radiation penetration and absorption in the snowpack. Crocus simulations with various options ranging from the original version to the full radiative transfer for both the snowpack and the atmosphere are compared during one winter season at Col de Porte Site, Chartreuse, France. The detailed benefits of using a full radiative transfer scheme are evaluated with respect to snow physical properties, spectral albedo measurements. The impacts of the physically-based radiative scheme on the snow temperature profiles and metamorphism are investigated.",

            "abstract": "The ice albedo feedbacks in the Arctic are a key factor of the positive feedback mechanisms, which amplify climate change in the high northern latitudes. This study assesses the potential and side effects of an idealised Arctic ocean albedo modification (AOAM) experiment under varying emissions scenarios. A first finding is the fact that the decreasing trend in the Arctic summer sea ice extent could only be offset rather than reversed by the implementation of AOAM under increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions. What becomes evident in this study is that the Earth system regulates its internal heat budgets. Therefore a local cooling at the high northern latitudes causes compensatory heat fluxes in the atmosphere and the ocean. Meaning that firstly, the effectiveness of local scale climate intervention will, in the long term, be lowered by these compensatory fluxes and secondly that there are consequences, such as the subsurface warming signal found in this study, which are unexpected and unintended.",

            "abstract": "Coastal erosion and relative sea-level rise inundate terrestrial permafrost with seawater and create submarine permafrost. Once flooded, permafrost begins to warm under marine conditions, which can destabilize the sea floor. The timing of inundation can be inferred from the rate of coastline retreat and the distance from the shoreline. Coastline retreat rates are inversely related to the inclination of the upper surface of submarine ice-bonded permafrost. Submarine permafrost thaw is considered to be a cause for recent observations of methane emissions from the seabed to the water column and atmosphere of the East Siberian shelf.\nA 52 m long core drilled from the sea ice in Buor Khaya Bay, central Laptev Sea revealed unfrozen sediment overlying ice-bonded permafrost. Dissolved methane and sulfate concentrations are inversely related along the core with higher methane and lower sulfate contents in the ice-bonded submarine permafrost relative to the overlying unfrozen sediment.\nThe observed profiles of sediment pore water sulfate concentrations, as well as methane concentrations and methane stable carbon isotope ratios, indicate that methane from ice-bonded permafrost is oxidized at or immediately following thaw. Anaerobic oxidation of methane in the unfrozen sediment column between ice-bonded permafrost and the seabed makes it unlikely that methane from thawing submarine permafrost could reach the seabed.",

An important retention mechanism for colloids in unsaturated porous media is attachment to air-water interfaces. However, air-water interfaces can also lead to colloid mobilization and enhanced transport if air-water interfaces are moving, such as during infiltration, imbibition, and drainage. Colloid attachment to air-water interfaces is caused by surface tension forces, and these forces usually exceed other interactions forces; therefore, surface tension forces play a dominant role for colloid transport in unsaturated porous media. In this presentation, experimental and theoretical evidence of surface tension forces acting on colloids will be presented, and the role of moving air-water interfaces will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "This study addresses several issues of using calcite speleothems as a high temporal resolution archive of the directional fluctuations of the Earth’s magnetic field. This was achieved by collecting 3 stalagmites in the Theoreticians’ cave (St Benoît, French Alps). This cave, although hardly accessible, presents two advantages. First, there are recent speleothems as evidenced by their still active growth. Thus the remanent magnetization can be directly compared with a secular variation model such as ARCH.3k. Second, the cave is carved in lutetian limestones that are directly overlain by iron-sulfide-rich priabonian marlstones. So potentially, drip water can contain iron that is a major asset for a magnetic study. We estimated by means of various rock magnetic experiments that the remanent magnetization is carried by single-domain magnetite. The recent age of the stalagmites is confirmed with U/Th dating suggesting that our sampling covers the last 3 millennia. These ages yield a mean growing rate of about 0.1 mm/yr. Remanent magnetization measurements are carried out with a 2G cryogenic magnetometer. The challenging issue is to measure samples of small size (cylinder of 1 inch in diameter and about 2 mm in height, i.e. a sample of about 1 gram). We worked on improving measurement protocols as well as on the development of a new type of sample holder. Before each series of measurements, the magnetometer must be perfectly tuned in order to have the lowest possible baseline and a minimum drift. In the best conditions, encountered during the nights or during the weekends, the background noise is around 1x10-12 Am2. Such conditions are necessary to measure the NRM that is characterized in most cases by intensity less than 1x10-8 Am2/kg (i.e one order of magnitude above the sensitivity limit of our magnetometer). With such NRM intensities, the major challenge is to determine the direction of the ChRM by stepwise AF treatment. The results obtained are very encouraging in particular with respect to the evolution of the inclination of the field. It fits perfectly on the ARCH.3k model. Even if the measurement and sampling protocols still require developments, our results open new perspectives on the study of high-resolution record of the Earth's magnetic field fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "In its early evolution, the Earth mantle likely experienced several episodes of complete melting enhanced by giant impact heating, short-lived radionuclides heating and viscous dissipation during the metal/silicate separation. We have developed numerical models to monitor the thermo-chemical evolution of a cooling and crystallizing magma ocean from an initially fully molten mantle. For this purpose, we use a 1D approach accounting for turbulent convective heat transfer. Our numerical model benchmarked with analytical solutions solves the heat equation in spherical geometry. This model also integrates recent and strong experimental constraints from mineral physics such as adiabatic temperature profiles and liquidus/solidus up 140 GPa for different mantle compositions. Our preliminary results show that a deep magma ocean starts to crystallize rapidly after its formation. The cooling efficiency of the magma ocean is strongly dependent on the coupling with the core cooling. Hence, depending on the thermal boundary layer thickness at the CMB, the thermal coupling between the core and magma ocean can either insulate the core during the MO solidification and favor a hot core, generate the formation of a thin basal molten layer or empty the heat from the core. Then, once the melt fraction reaches a critical value, the cooling efficiency becomes limited.",

            "abstract": "A number of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of Greenland exist, each of which are applicable for different purposes. This study presents two such DEMs: One developed by merging contemporary radar and laser altimeter data, and one derived from high-resolution stereoscopic imagery. All products are made freely available.\nThe former DEM covers the entire Greenland. It is specific to the year 2010, providing it with an advantage over previous models suffering from either a reduced spatial/ temporal data coverage or errors from surface elevation changes (SEC) occurring during data acquisition. Radar data are acquired with Envisat and CryoSat-2, and laser data with the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, the Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor, and the Airborne Topographic Mapper. Correcting radar data for errors from slope effects and surface penetration of the echoes, and merging these with laser data, yields a DEM capable of resolving both surface depressions as well as topographic features at higher altitudes. The spatial resolution is 2 x 2 km, making the DEM ideal for application in surface mass balance studies, SEC detection from radar altimetry, or for correcting such data for slope-induced errors.\nThe other DEM is developed in a pilot study building the expertise to map all ice-free parts of Greenland. The work combines WorldView-2 and -3 as well as GeoEye1 imagery from 2014 and 2015 over the Disko, Narsaq, Tassilaq, and Zackenberg regions. The novelty of the work is the determination of the product specifications after elaborate discussions with interested parties from government institutions, the tourist industry, etc. Thus, a 10 m DEM, 1.5 m orthophotos, and vector maps are produced. This opens to the possibility of using orthophotos with up-to-date contour lines or for deriving updated coastlines to aid, e.g., emergency management. This allows for a product development directly in line with the needs of parties with specific interests in Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Coastal communities with high population density and infrastructure close to the shoreline are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise (SLR). In the northeast, annual precipitation has increased by more than 10-percent in the last 100 years and is projected to increase further in the future. In addition, sea level in coastal New Hampshire is projected to rise 1.2 to 2.0 meters by the year 2100 (New Hampshire Coastal Risks and Hazards Commission). Climate change vulnerability and adaptation studies have primarily focused on surface water flooding from SLR; however, little attention has been given to rising waters from beneath the ground surface. Groundwater in many coastal communities will rise with rising sea level which will likely have important consequences for water quality, the structural integrity of foundations and infrastructure, and the health of natural ecosystems in the coastal zone.\nIn this study, we have constructed a regional groundwater flow model of coastal New Hampshire to investigate the effect of various climate change and SLR scenarios on groundwater levels, focusing on impacts to road infrastructure. Using LiDAR datasets and downscaled global climate predictions, we determined that the interaction of several hydrogeological factors resulted in distinct spatial patterns of groundwater rise that were not evident from simple models linking SLR and terrain. Furthermore, by loosely coupling the groundwater model to a hydraulic model for pavement systems, we were able to identify sections of roadways that will have compromised pavement performance due to rising groundwater intersecting the sublayers of these roadways. Our findings broadly suggest that adaptation strategies designed to counter the effects of climate change and SLR in coastal communities must consider potential damage from rising groundwater in addition to surface water impacts not only immediately along the coast but also at significant distances inland.",

            "abstract": "Decades of ocean drilling have demonstrated wide spread microbial life in deep sub-seafloor sediment, and surprisingly high microbial cell numbers. Despite the ubiquity of life in the deep biosphere, the large community sizes and the low energy fluxes in the vast buried ecosystem are still poorly understood. It is not know whether organisms of the deep biosphere are specifically adapted to extremely low energy fluxes or whether most of the observed cells are in a maintenance state.\nRecently we developed and applied a new culture independent approach – the D:L-amino acid model – to quantify the turnover times of living microbial biomass, microbial necromass and mean metabolic rates. This approach is based on the built-in molecular clock in amino acids that very slowly undergo chemical racemization until they reach an even mixture of L- and D- forms, unless microorganisms spend energy to keep them in the L-form that dominates in living organisms. The approach combines sensitive analyses of amino acids, the unique bacterial endospore marker (dipicolinic acid) with racemization dynamics of stereo-isomeric amino acids.\nBased on a heating experiment, we recently reported kinetic parameters for racemization of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine and alanine in bulk sediment from Aarhus Bay, Denmark. The obtained racemization rate constants were faster than the racemization rate constants of free amino acids, which we have previously applied in Holocene sediment from Aarhus Bay and in up to 10 mio yr old sediment from ODP Leg 201. Another important input parameter for the D:L-amino acid model is the cellular carbon content. It has recently been suggested that the cellular carbon content most likely is lower than previously thought. In recognition of these new findings, previously published data based on the D:L-amino acid model were recalculated and will be presented together with new data from an Arctic Holocene setting with constant sub-zero temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS), surrounded by the Eurasia, Pacific and India-Australia plates, was formed by the interaction of the three plates and the Cenozoic seafloor spreading. Magnetic data is the crucial data for understanding tectonic evolution and seafloor spreading model in the SCS. Magnetization intensity is related closely to rock type and tectonics. Through magnetization mapping, the distribution of apparent magnetization in the subsurface will be obtained, benefiting in lithologic classification and geological mapping. Due to strong remanence presented in the oceanic crust, magma and seamounts in the SCS, the magnetization directions are complex and heterogeneous, quite different from the modern geomagnetic field directions. However, the routine techniques for magnetization mapping are based on negligence of remanence. The normalized source strength (NSS), one quantity transformed from the magnetic anomalies, is insensitive to remanence and responds well to the true locations of magnetic sources. The magnetization mapping based on the NSS will effectively reduce effects of remanence, benefitting in better geological interpretation. Here, we assembled high-resolution total magnetic intensity (TMI) data around the ocean basin of the SCS, and then transformed them into the NSS. Then we did magnetization mapping based on the NSS to obtain the crustal magnetization distribution in the studied area. The results show that the magnetization distribution inside of each subbasin is relatively homogeneous, but that of eastern subbasin is mostly strong with amplitude of 0.2A/m~4.2A/m, while that of southwestern subbasin is weak with amplitude of 0.2A/m~1.1A/m. It implies that magnetic structure and tectonic features in the crust are discriminative between both subbasins, and the tectonic boundary between both subbasins is roughly ranges from the northeastern edge of the Zhongsha Islands running in the southeast direction to the northeastern edge of the Reed Bank.",

            "abstract": "Rifts are segmented linear depressions, filled with sedimentary and igneous rocks, that form by extension and often evolve into plate boundaries. Flood basalts, a class of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), are broad regions of extensive volcanism due to sublithospheric processes. Typical rifts are not filled with flood basalts, and typical flood basalts are not associated with significant crustal extension and faulting. North America’s Midcontinent Rift (MCR) is an unusual combination. Its 3000-km length formed as part of the 1.1 Ga rifting of Amazonia (Precambrian NE South America) from Laurentia (Precambrian North America) and became inactive once seafloor spreading was established, but contains an enormous volume of igneous rocks. MCR volcanics are significantly thicker than other flood basalts, due to deposition in a narrow rift rather than a broad region, giving a rift geometry but a LIP's magma volume. Structural modeling of seismic reflection data shows an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a postrift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding basin without associated faulting. The crust thinned during rifting and rethickened during the postrift phase and later compression, yielding the present thicker crust. The coincidence of a rift and LIP yielded the world's largest deposit of native copper. This combination arose when a new rift associated with continental breakup interacted with a mantle plume or anomalously hot or fertile upper mantle. Integration of diverse data types and models will give insight into questions including how the magma source was related to the rifting, how their interaction operated over a long period of rapid plate motion, why the lithospheric mantle below the MCR differs only slightly from its surroundings, how and why extension, volcanism, and compression varied along the rift arms, and how successful seafloor spreading ended the rift phase.\nPapers, talks, and educational material are available at http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/research/mcr.html",

The temporal variations of surface waves polarization (Ψ) show slow and weak variations due to seasonal changes superposed to rapid and strong variations at the time of the earthquake and slightly before, at the end of april. Strong change in Ψ (of the order of 10°) might be related to change in the orientation of cracks distribution, hence change in the induced extrinsic anisotropy between two receivers.",

            "abstract": "Subduction dynamics has been widely studied in free subduction models, which document the important control of the downgoing plate. However, various models have shown how the overriding plate can influence subduction dynamics through its thermal structure, thickness and coupling.\nUsing the code Fluidity we investigate overriding plate deformation in a 2-D thermo-mechanical model of the two-plate subduction system. We use Fluidity's adaptive mesh and free-surface formulation. The model includes a composite temperature- and stress-dependent rheology, and plates are decoupled by a weak layer, which allows for free trench motion.\nWe focus on the evolution of the topography and state of stress in the overriding plate during the different phases of the subduction process: early stages of subduction, free-fall sinking in the upper mantle and interaction of the slab with the high-viscosity lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "During the period 31st August September 2014- 28th February 2015, a significant fissure eruption occurred in the Holuhraun area of Iceland. Unlike the well documented eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, this eruption has received relatively little public attention as the emissions are at low altitude, there is little accompanying ash, and thus there has not been any impact on trans-Atlantic air-traffic. However, the emission rates of sulphur dioxide from the eruption during the first two months was at least four times those from the entire 28 European member states and the continuous nature of the eruption means that by the end of the eruption, the emissions of sulphur dioxide exceeded the total annual emission targets of all of Europe. We provide a comprehensive global modelling estimate of the impact on cloud microphysics and show that the empirical relationship between degassed sulphur and TiO2/FeO ratios derived from prior Icelandic basaltic flood lava has undoubted utility. The impact of the sulphur dioxide cloud droplet size is clearly identified in satellite retrievals over the entire North Atlantic. Pristine clouds of lesser reflectivity were replaced by polluted clouds of higher reflectivity. This eruption provides an ideal test bed for validating models and inter-comparing observations of aerosol-cloud-interactions. Simulations with HadGEM3 including a detailed aerosol-microphysical scheme show excellent agreement with observations of cloud effective radius and cloud droplet number concentration and we use the model to assess the detectability of other variables such as aerosol optical depth, cloud liquid water path, cloud optical depth and radiation forcing. We conclude that, just as the explosive eruption of Pinatubo into the stratosphere provided the basis for many model and satellite analysis and inter-comparisons, the Holuhraun eruption provides a similar counterpart for focussing analyses of tropospheric cloud-aerosol interactions.",

            "abstract": "Metal ions are not only valuable intermediates in metal extraction, but also important raw materials for technical applications. They possess some unique but, identical physical and chemical properties, which make them useful probes of low temperature geochemical reactions. Heavy metals are natural constituents of the earth's crust, but indiscriminate human activities have drastically altered their geochemical cycles and biochemical balance. Metal concentration in soil typically ranges from less than one to as high as 100,000 mg/kg. Heavy metal contaminations of land resources continue to be the focus of numerous environmental studies and attract a great deal of attention worldwide. This is attributed to no--biodegradability and persistence of heavy metals in soils. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc can cause deleterious health effects in humans. Complexation, separation, and removal of metal ions have become increasingly attractive areas of research and have led to new technical developments like phytoremediation that has numerous biotechnological implications of understanding of plant metal accumulation. Croton bonplandianum is newly identified as a potential heavy metal hypreaccumulator. In this study Croton bonplandianum was subjected for in vitro heavy metal accumulation, to explore the accumulation pattern of four heavy metals viz Cadmium, Lead, Nickel and Zinc in various parts of Croton bonplandianum plant parts. It was found that the efficiency of Croton bonplandianum to accumulate heavy metals is Cd>Pb>Zn>Ni. The absorption of these heavy metals in plant parts revealed that the highest translocation of metals from ground to root was ground to be in the order of Pb (1.12) > Zn (0.26) > Ni (0.18) > Cd (0.15). The distribution of Cd in Croton bonplandianum followed the trend Root>Stem>Leaf; with Ni it was Root>Leaf>Stem, while Pb showed leaf>stem>root. Translocation of metals in Croton bonplandianum plant parts from soil makes this plant an eligible candidate to remove heavy metals from soil.",

Particularly debated is the extent of the absorption enhancement by internally compared to externally mixed BC, which critically depends on the interior morphology of the BC-containing particles. Here we suggest that a currently unaccounted morphology, optically very different from the customary core shell and volume-mixing assumptions, likely occurs in aerosol particles undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Using Raman spectroscopy on micrometer-sized droplets, we show that LLPS of an organic/inorganic model system drives redistribution of BC into the outer (organic) phase of the host particle. This results in an inverted core-shell structure, in which a transparent aqueous core is surrounded by a BC-containing absorbing shell.\nWe also study the redistribution of a model proxy for brown carbon, carminic acid, in single, levitated aqueous aerosol particles undergoing LLPS and compare the measured absorption efficiency with corresponding Mie calculations.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust created by wind erosion of soil particles is the dominant aerosol by mass in the atmosphere. It exerts significant effects on radiative fluxes, clouds, ocean biogeochemistry, and human health. Models that predict the lifecycle of mineral dust aerosols generally assume a globally uniform mineral composition. However, this simplification limits our understanding of the role of dust in the Earth system, since the effects of dust strongly depend on the particles’ physical and chemical properties, which vary with their mineral composition. Hence, not only a detailed understanding of the processes determining the dust emission flux is needed, but also information about its size dependent mineral composition.\nDetermining the mineral composition of dust aerosols is complicated. The largest uncertainty derives from the current atlases of soil mineral composition. These atlases provide global estimates of soil mineral fractions, but they are based upon massive extrapolation of a limited number of soil samples assuming that mineral composition is related to soil type. This disregards the potentially large variability of soil properties within each defined soil type. In addition, the analysis of these soil samples is based on wet sieving, a technique that breaks the aggregates found in the undisturbed parent soil. During wind erosion, these aggregates are subject to partial fragmentation, which generates differences on the size distribution and composition between the undisturbed parent soil and the emitted dust aerosols.\nWe review recent progress on the representation of the mineral and chemical composition of dust in climate models. We discuss extensions of brittle fragmentation theory to prescribe the emitted size-resolved dust composition, and we identify key processes and uncertainties based upon model simulations and an unprecedented compilation of observations.",

            "abstract": "Solfatara of Pozzuoli is one of the largest studied volcanic-hydrothermal system of the world releasing a large amount of deeply derived fluids. Since 1998, extensive soil CO2 flux surveys where performed using the accumulation chamber method over a large area (1.45 km2). The statistical analysis of CO2 flux, coupled with the investigation of the CO2 efflux isotopic composition, allowed to characterize the different CO2 sources and to investigate their temporal variability. The geostatistical elaboration of CO2 fluxes allowed to define the spatial structure of the degassing area, as well as the total amount of released CO2, pointing out the presence of a well defined diffuse degassing structure interested by the release of deeply derived CO2 (Solfatara DDS). The extension of the DDS experienced relevant variations with two major enlargements, the first consisted in its doubling in 2003-2004 and the second in further enlargement of about 30% in 2011-2012. These variations mainly occurred external to the crater area in correspondence of a NE-SW fault system (Pisciarelli area). The first event was previously correlated with the occurrence in 2000 of a relatively deep seismic swarm, which was interpreted as the indicator of the opening of an easy-ascent pathway for the transfer of magmatic fluids towards the shallower portion of the hydrothermal system; the second enlargement well correlates with the recent unrest phase of the system, characterized by an acceleration of the ground uplift. The amount of released CO2 has been estimated ranging between about 700 t/d and about 1500 t/d (with errors between 9 and 15 %) until the January 2015 when there was an increase up to 2800 t/d. The CO2 variations in the last two years seems to follow the trend depicted by ground deformations, with increases of fluxes during the uplift accelerations and decreases of fluxes during the phases of relative “no-uplift”. The comparison of the CO2 flux data with the chemical composition of the main fumaroles suggests that the variation of in the DDS extension is correlated to processes of condensation of the vapor plume feeding the Solfatara manifestation accompanied by an overall increase of the temperatures, caused by the arrival of increasing amounts of deep fluids, possibly magmatic.",

            "abstract": "Long-term satellite measurements of vegetation productivity in high-latitude environments have revealed profound and widespread responses to climate warming. Although warmer and longer summers are causing the Arctic to “green”, many regions of boreal forest are showing the opposite response, particularly since the mid 1990s. This “browning” phenomenon was generally unexpected at the time of discovery, is not captured by global models, and may have profound consequences for the boreal biome. A number of studies have linked satellite-based browning trends to tree productivity through tree rings. However, our understanding of the environmental controls and ecosystem consequences of browning remains remarkably limited.\nHere we examine to what extent browning patterns are related to a fundamental demographic process: tree mortality. We focus on a long-term inventory database in Alaska to characterize mortality events and trends from 1994 to 2014. These patterns were related to vegetation productivity indices from MODIS and the AVHRR-based GIMMS3g data set. We explore three central hypotheses: (1) mortality events are likely to be preceded by 5-10 year browning trends (“press stress”), (2) mortality events are likely to be preceded by distinct pulses of low productivity (“pulse stress”), and (3) long-term trends in mortality are related to long-term browning. Within our study region, which encompasses eastern Alaskan from the Pacific coastal mountains up through the interior, we find strong evidence for the first two hypotheses. The third is weakly supported, which may be a consequence of the episodic nature of mortality in the region. However, preliminary analyses in the southern Canadian boreal reveal a markedly stronger relationship between long-term mortality and browning. Taken together, our study suggests a robust correlation between satellite-based metrics of productivity and forest demography; one that has consequences for forest composition, carbon stocks, and early signs of a biome shift in boreal forests.",

            "abstract": "Cities in the western U.S. are heavily irrigated and have increasingly been the focus of water conservation measures. Even cities that previously relied only on voluntary reductions in outdoor water use have been employing stricter mandates to limit irrigation. These cities are in a period of transition and the outcomes are far from certain. There are many tradeoffs in the environmental and social consequences of different urban water management strategies. Here we review recent work studying these tradeoffs in cities of southern California and Utah. We have measured the water use of different types of landscapes ranging from turfgrass to urban trees to xeriscapes. Unshaded turfgrass shows evapotranspiration (ET) rates close to potential ET; however, shaded turfgrass uses substantially less water. On the other hand, plants used in xeriscapes may have surprisingly high transpiration rates if they are heavily watered. In addition, unshaded xeriscapes may substantially alter surface energy balance and have unintended consequences for urban climate. Through whole tree sap flux measurements and scaling of ET estimates, we have found that urban trees generally use less water than turfgrass, and provide additional cooling benefits through interception of radiation. Current measures to reduce outdoor water use through irrigation restrictions and turfgrass removal programs do not include safeguards to ensure that urban trees receive adequate irrigation, and the future of urban tree canopies in western cities is highly uncertain. Although trees and other deep-rooted vegetation may require less irrigation than turfgrass and better withstand periods of drought, this vegetation must still be appropriate managed with water inputs informed by an understanding of plant water relations and urban subsurface hydrology. On the current trajectory, cities may see a substantial loss of vegetative cover and leaf area unless an understanding of ecohydrology is better integrated into strategies for long-term stewardship of urban landscapes in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic imaging techniques enable researchers to “see” details of fault rupture that cannot be captured by complementary tools such as seismology and field studies, thus providing increasingly detailed information about surface strain, slip kinematics, and how an earthquake may be transcribed into the geological record. For example, the recent Haiti, Sierra El Mayor, and Nepal earthquakes illustrate the fundamental role of geodetic observations in recording blind ruptures where purely geological and seismological studies provided incomplete views of rupture kinematics. Traditional earthquake hazard analyses typically rely on sparse paleoseismic observations and incomplete mapping, simple assumptions of slip kinematics from Andersonian faulting, and earthquake analogs to characterize the probabilities of forthcoming ruptures and the severity of ground accelerations. Spatially dense geodetic observations in turn help to identify where these prevailing assumptions regarding fault behavior break down and highlight new and unexpected kinematic slip behavior. Here, we focus on three key contributions of space geodetic observations to the analysis of co-seismic deformation: identifying near-surface co-seismic slip where no easily recognized fault rupture exists; discerning non-Andersonian faulting styles; and quantifying distributed, off-fault deformation. The 2013 Balochistan strike slip earthquake in Pakistan illuminates how space geodesy precisely images non-Andersonian behavior and off-fault deformation. Through analysis of high-resolution optical imagery and DEMs, evidence emerges that a single fault map slip as both a strike slip and dip slip fault across multiple seismic cycles. These observations likewise enable us to quantify on-fault deformation, which account for ~72% of the displacements in this earthquake. Nonetheless, the spatial distribution of on- and off-fault deformation in this event is highly spatially variable- a complicating factor for comparisons of geologic and geodetic slip rates. As such, detailed studies such as this will play a continuing vital role in the accurate assessment of short- and long-term fault slip kinematics.",

            "abstract": "Both sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and soil moisture (SM) are important drivers of climate variability over land. In this study we present a comprehensive comparison of SM versus SST impacts on land climate in the warm season. We perform ensemble experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) where we set SM or SSTs to median conditions, respectively, to remove their inter-annual variability, whereby the other component - SST or SM - is still interactively computed. In contrast to earlier experiments performed with prescribed SSTs, our experiments suggest that SM is overall as important as SSTs for land climate, not only in the midlatitudes but also in the tropics and subtropics. Mean temperature and precipitation are reduced by 0.1-0.5 K and 0-0.2 mm, respectively, whereas their variability at different time scales decreases by 10-40% (temperature) and 0-10% (precipitation) when either SM or SSTs are prescribed. Also drought occurrence is affected, with mean changes in the maximum number of cumulative dry days of 0-0.75 days. Both SM and SST-induced changes are strongest for hot temperatures (up to 0.7 K, and 50%), extreme precipitation (up to 0.4 mm, and 20%), and strong droughts (up to 2 days). Local climate changes in response to removed SM variability are controlled - to first order - by the land-atmosphere coupling and the natural SM variability. SST-related changes are partly controlled by the relation of local temperature or precipitation with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Moreover removed SM or SST variabilities both induce remote effects by impacting the atmospheric circulation. Our results are similar for the present day and the end of the century. We investigate the inter-dependency between SM and SST and find a sufficient degree of independence for the purpose of this study. The robustness of our findings is shown by comparing the response of CESM to removed SM variability with four other global climate models. In summary, SM and SSTs are similarly important for land climate; these results contradict the common view that soil moisture effects mostly act as feedbacks to SST effects. Given the good predictability of both quantities our results indicate comparable potential value of both initial SM and SST conditions in weather and climate forecasting over land.",

            "abstract": "Between 1948 and 1996, wind-driven components of ice drift and surface ocean currents experienced a well-pronounced decadal variability alternating between anticyclonic and cyclonic circulation regimes. During cyclonic regimes, low sea level atmospheric pressure dominated over the Arctic Ocean driving sea ice and the upper ocean clockwise; the Arctic atmosphere was relatively warm and humid and freshwater flux from the Arctic Ocean toward the sub-Arctic seas was intensified. During anticylonic circulation regimes, high sea level pressure dominated over the Arctic driving sea ice and ocean counter-clockwise; the atmosphere was cold and dry and the freshwater flux from the Arctic to the sub-Arctic seas was reduced. Since 1997, however, the Arctic system has been dominated by an anticyclonic circulation regime with a set of environmental parameters that are atypical for these regimes. Of essential importance is to discern the causes and consequences of the apparent break-down in the natural decadal variability of the Arctic climate system, and specifically: Why has the well-pronounced decadal variability observed in the 20th century been replaced by relatively weak interannual changes under anticyclonic circulation regime conditions in the 21st century? We discuss a hypothesis explaining the causes and mechanisms regulating the intensity and duration of Arctic circulation regimes, and speculate how changes in freshwater fluxes from Greenland impact environmental conditions and interrupt their decadal variability. In order to test this hypothesis, numerical experiments with several FAMOS (Forum for Arctic Modeling & Observational Synthesis) ice-ocean coupled models have been conducted. In these experiments, Greenland melt freshwater is tracked by passive tracers being constantly released along the Greenland coast. Propagation pathways and time scales of Greenland meltwater within the sub-Arctic seas are discussed.",

Repeated sampling at this field since its discovery in the mid 90’s shows persistent inter-site differences the end-member hot fluid compositions, revealing 4 groups of sites that possibly reflect various processes, such as phase separation, conductive cooling, tidal pumping, or magmatic activity. Three groups are at the main field, and a fourth one (Capelinhos) is 1,5 km to the E. We also identify a period of high CO2 content of hydrothermal fluids (up to 120 mmol/l), clearly showing replenishment of the magmatic chamber in 2008 and 2010.\nThe Si-Cl geothermobarometer of the most vapor-dominated fluid (270 mmol/l, Capelinhos) gives a pressure of 370 bars and a temperature of ˜435ºC in the reaction zone. If hydrothermal cells operate in a cold hydrostatic pressure gradient, the transition between the reaction and upflow zones is located at about 2400 mbsf, with a magma lens at ˜3400 mbsf. Si-based geothermobarometry and empirical Fe/Mn geothermometry argue for P and T conditions close to seawater critical point at 300 bars (i.e. ˜1300mbsf) for Capelinhos. In contrast, the 3 other groups exhibit temperatures much lower than 380ºC, as well as reduced end-member Fe and Mn concentrations compared to those of Capelinhos. These physico-chemical features reflect the effects of conductive cooling along the upflow zone. Conductive cooling can vary spatially owing to variable substratum permeability across the hydrothermal field, a requisite to induce along-axis oriented hydrothermal cell.\nThe end-member chemical features of the 4 groups suggest that local variations in tectonism and volcanism exert a strong control on heat, mass and chemical fluxes.",

The progress has been made because of more and improved measurements, and advances in modeling the ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics (I-T-E) system. With regard to modeling, the recent focus has been on ensemble modeling with both physics-based and data assimilation models. Our team has created a Multimodel Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) that is composed of seven physics-based data assimilation models for the I-T-E system that cover the globe. Five different data assimilation models cover the mid-low latitude region, so that we can conduct ensemble modeling with physics-based data assimilation models in that domain. The data assimilation models can assimilate Total Electron Content (TEC) from a constellation of satellites, bottom-side electron density profiles from digisondes, and in situ plasma densities, occultations and ultraviolet emissions from satellites. We have performed MEPS model runs for selected storm and quiet periods, and for each period we have obtained ensemble model reconstructions with different data types and amounts in order to determine how the individual data assimilation models behave.

The impact of weather, climate and climate change on ambulance services around the world has received increasing attention in recent years but most studies have been area specific and there is a need to establish basic relationships between ambulance data (both response and illness data) and meteorological parameters.\nIn this presentation, the effects of temperature and relative humidity on ambulance call out rates for different medical categories will be investigated. We use call out data obtained from the London Ambulance Service (LAS) and meteorological data from a central London meteorological station. A time-series analysis was utilized to understand the relation between temperature, relative humidity, air pollutants and different call out categories.\nThere are statistically significant relationships between mean temperature and ambulance callout rate for most of the categories investigated. Most categories show a negative dependence on temperature, i.e. call outs increase with decreasing temperature but some categories showed a positive dependence such as alcohol related call outs. Relative humidity is significant for some categories but in general is much less important than temperature. Significant time lag effects were observed for most of the categories related to infectious illnesses, which are transferrable through human contact.\nThese findings support the opinion that ambulance attendance callouts records are an effective and well-timed source of data and can be used for health early warning systems. Furthermore the presented results can much improve our understanding of the relationships between meteorological conditions and human health thereby allowing for better prediction of ambulance use through the application of long and short-term weather forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The sensitivity of the diurnal cycle to convective intensity is investigated for the wet season (DJF) and dry season (JJA) in the Amazon region. Model output reveals large water and energy budget errors in tropical rainforests, arising from a misrepresentation of the diurnal cycle of the complex processes inherent to diurnally forced moist convection. Daily, 3-hourly satellite observations of CERES Ed3a SYN1DEG TOA fluxes and 3-hourly TRMM 3B42 precipitation rate from 2002-2012 are split into regimes of convective intensity using percentile definitions for both daily minimum OLR and daily maximum precipitation rate to define regimes. These satellite-defined regimes are then co-located with convective parameters calculated from radiosonde observations. Diurnal statistics from satellite include: phase, amplitude, precipitation onset, precipitation duration and diurnal mean. The diurnal phase of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and longwave cloud forcing (LWCF) occurs several hours earlier on convective days compared to stable days, however, climatological precipitation phase is less sensitive to convective intensity, occurring between 1-4PM local time for all regimes and 1-2 hours later on very convective days, which is related to longer duration precipitation events from increased humidity. Diurnal convection in the Amazon is strongly related to 8AM values of both dynamic and thermodynamic variables, most of which are related to: the background moisture content of the troposphere, the stability of the lower troposphere, convective inhibition (CIN) and wind speed and direction in the column. Morning values of CIN, lifted condensation level (LCL), level of free convection (LFC) and equilibrium level (EL) are lower in DJF than JJA, and lower on very convective days than stable days for all stations. Higher background humidity is related to longer duration precipitation events (r-values between 0.4-0.6, depending on station and season), earlier phases and onset times of clouds and precipitation (r-values ranging from 0.2-0.5) and larger diurnal amplitudes and diurnal mean values of precipitation and OLR with r-values as high as 0.7 in JJA between 8AM upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) and convective intensity.",

            "abstract": "The decline in Arctic sea ice cover has been widely documented and it is clear that this change is having profound impacts locally. An emerging and highly uncertain area of scientific research, however, is whether such Arctic change has a tangible effect on weather and climate at lower latitudes. Of particular societal relevance is the open question: will continued Arctic sea ice loss make mid-latitude weather more extreme? Here we analyse idealised atmospheric general circulation model simulations, using two independent models, both forced by projected Arctic sea ice loss in the late twenty-first century. The likelihood and duration of cold extremes are projected to decrease over high latitudes, and over central and eastern North America, but to increase over central Asia. Hot extremes are projected to increase in frequency and duration over high latitudes. We show that temperature extremes over central and eastern North America are more sensitive to Arctic sea ice loss than those over other mid-latitude regions. To better understand the drivers of these changes we utilise self-organising maps (SOMs) to identify the predominant regional weather patterns associated with surface temperature extremes. Then, the projected changes in temperature extremes are partitioned into dynamically and thermodynamically induced components. The former is estimated by examining the change in the frequency of occurrence of each pattern, whilst the latter is estimated from the change in the average number of temperature extremes associated with each pattern. We show that the contrasting responses over North America (fewer cold days) and central Asia (more cold days) can be largely explained by the differing relative importance of dynamics and thermodynamics in these two regions. Similar analyses for precipitation extremes will also be briefly discussed.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that ongoing reductions of Arctic sea ice may affect various aspects of Northern Hemisphere weather and climate. Many of these linkages have been hypothesized based on statistical associations found in observations; however, it is difficult to unambiguously assign causality and to separate the influences of multiple interconnected processes in the climate system using observations alone. Modeling studies offer a way forward for understanding and isolating the physical processes underlying observed relationships. The atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is often estimated through atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations with prescribed sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) conditions. Typically, global SSTs are held to climatological-mean values. It is well known however, that (multi-) decadal ocean variability has a strong influence on the mean atmospheric state and thus, the atmospheric response to sea ice loss may be sensitive to the phase of (multi-) decadal ocean variability (i.e., be state dependent). Here we explore the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss under different phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), using 8 ensembles of AGCM simulations; with extensive and reduced Arctic sea ice applied alongside PDO-, PDO+, AMO- and AMO+ SST anomalies. Preliminary analyses suggest, amongst other things: 1) an enhanced Arctic winter warming response during PDO- compared to PDO+; and 2) during AMO- sea ice loss forces a wintertime ridge-trough pattern over North America, with warmer conditions over the west and colder conditions over the east, compared to the response to identical sea ice loss during AMO+. The largest observed losses of Arctic sea ice have occurred since ~2000 during predominantly PDO- and AMO+. The possible implications of the recent switch to PDO+ in 2014, and an eventual return to AMO+ in coming decades, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Scarcity of in situ measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes hamper calibration and validation of continental assessments of carbon budgets in Africa. It limits essential studies of ecosystem functioning and ecosystem processes. Wide reported ranges of estimated African net primary production (NPP) and gross primary production (GPP) is a function of the uncertainty originating from this scarcity of data. GPP estimates, based on vegetation models and remote sensing based models, range from ~17 to ~40 Pg C yr−1 and NPP estimates roughly range from ~7 to ~20 Pg C yr−1 for continental Africa. Differences in modeled carbon use efficiency (i.e. the NPP/GPP ratio) further enhance the uncertainty caused by low spatial resolution driver data sets when deriving NPP from GPP. Current substantial uncertainty in vegetation productivity estimates for Africa (both magnitudes and carbon use efficiency) may be reduced by increased abundance and availability of in situ collected field data including meteorology, radiation, spectral properties, GHG fluxes as well as long term ecological field experiments.\nCurrent measurements of GHGs fluxes in Africa are sparse and not well coordinated. The European Fluxes Database Cluster includes ~24 sites with flux data, most of them with a small amount of data in short time series. Large biomes such as the evergreen broad leafed forest are no well represented whereas savannas are slightly better represented. USA for example, with 171 flux site listed in FLUXNET has a flux site density of 17 sites per million km2, whereas Africa has density of 0.8 sites per million km2.\nIncreased collection of data on fluxes of GHGs, ecosystem properties and processes, both through advanced micro meteorological and through cost effective straightforward field experiments can contribute to reduce the uncertainty in quantification of the African carbon budget. Adaptation of crucial resource production systems such as agriculture, pastoralism and forestry, to climatic change, would benefit from additional knowledge potentially gained for in situ studies.",

Daily and monthly averaged values of TSI and SSI, with associated time and wavelength dependent uncertainties, are estimated from 1882 to the present with yearly averaged values since 1610, updated quarterly for the foreseeable future. The new Solar Irradiance Climate Data Record, jointly developed by the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), is constructed from solar irradiance models that determine the changes from quiet Sun conditions when bright faculae and dark sunspots are present on the solar disk. The magnitudes of the irradiance changes that these features produce are determined from linear regression of the proxy Mg II index and sunspot area indices against the approximately decade-long solar irradiance measurements made by instruments on the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft. We describe the model formulation, uncertainty estimates, operational implementation and validation approach. Future efforts to improve the uncertainty estimates of the Solar Irradiance CDR arising from model assumptions, and augmentation of the solar irradiance reconstructions with direct measurements from the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS: launch date, July 2017) are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "There has been a long-standing uncertainty about the relative importance of deep/very deep convection vs. shallow/moderate precipitation for rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs). Many previous observational case studies have shown horizontally small-scale, asymmetric deep convection (such as convective bursts and hot towers) within the inner core of TCs, which are deemed as being important for RI. This talk examines shear-relative distributions of precipitation/ convection in tropical cyclones using 14 years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) data, which suggests a different conclusion. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that RI is more likely triggered by the increase of shallow-to-moderate precipitation, especially in the upshear quadrants, and the appearance of more moderately-to-very deep convection in the middle of RI is more likely a response or positive feedback to changes in the vortex.",

            "abstract": "In shallow table conditions, a disproportionate increase or decrease in water table in response to minor water input or drainage is observed. This increase happens because the capillary fringe of the shallow water table reaches up to or near the surface (Wieringermeer effect). Conventional methods of calculating recharge such as multiplying the actual specific yield with the water table fluctuations cannot be used for Wieringermeer effect situations. A method using water balance data and soil moisture at different depths in the lysimeters was developed to estimate recharge and upflux. The recharge results were used to develop the apparent specific yield (Sya), which could be used to calculate consequent recharge events from water table fluctuations data. The correlations between water table level changes and rainfall, seepage irrigation, drip irrigation, and drainage were analyzed. Correlations with rainfall, seepage irrigation, and drainage were satisfactory (R-square ranged from 0.46 to 0.97). Combining the water tables fluctuations relationships developed with Sya value will allow the prediction of recharge from rainfall and irrigation events without the need for soil moisture equipment.",

The complex is presented by dykes of rocks of various composition and granite stocks within Proterozoic metamorphic rocks and Late Proterozoic granites of Angaro-Vitim batholite. Several grabens are located within the area. The grabens are filled by effusive analogues of Gudzhir complex covered by Late Jurassic–Aptian continental sedimentary rocks of Gusinoozersk series. The age of Gudzhir complex and its effusive analogues is uncertain. According to the location within sedimentary section it cannot be younger than Late Jurassic. At the same time according to the geochronological analysis (Ar-Ar method) the age of the complex is 120-100 mil.years – the end of Early Cretaceous.\nIn the river Vitim valley (between entries of rivers Karenga and Kalar) 32 dykes of Gudzhir complex have been studied. Laboratory palaeomagnetic studies of the samples was carried out. According to the Zyidelveld diagrams within the middle- high temperature spectrum two types of magnetization components are present: high temperature components (were not used) and “transitional” magnetization component of normal polarity. The latest was considered as secondary (metachronic). Similar direction was obtained previously for the Permian-Triassic volcanites within Southern Buriatia. Obtained pole location is the same as for Middle Cretaceous samples (within SW and NE margins of Siberian platform). According to these results the rocks of Gudzhir complex were remagnetized in Cretaceous time after crustal folding. Cretaceous age of the metachronic component was obtained from the total demonstration of magnetization of primary polarity which corresponds to the Dzhalal superchrone (124-84 mil. years).\nAccording to the obtained results: 1. Post Cretaceous tectonic processes did not lead to significant movements of blocks; 2. The location of the obtained pole and its similarity to the even-aged poles of Siberia and East European platform for the time period 110-100 mil.years indicate the total consolidation of Eurasia to this period; 3. In the time of metachronic magnetization formation (Middle Cretaceous) the studied area was located between 55 and 60°NH.\nThe work was carried out with support of Ministry of Education and Science, project №14.z50.31.0017.",

Our team exploited over 100 Million hours of computing access on the 700,000+ core Blue Waters machine to radically advance our ability to discover and visualize key system tradeoffs and sensitivities. This project represents to our knowledge the first attempt to develop a 10,000 member Monte Carlo global hydrologic simulation at one degree resolution that characterizes the uncertain effects of changing the available frequencies of satellite precipitation on drought and flood forecasts. The simulation—optimization components of the work have set a theoretical baseline for the best possible frequencies and coverages for global precipitation given unlimited investment, broad international coordination in reconfiguring existing assets, and new satellite constellation design objectives informed directly by key global hydrologic forecasting requirements.

            "abstract": "There is a growing recognition and interest in using emerging computational tools for discovering the tradeoffs that emerge across complex combinations infrastructure options, adaptive operations, and sign posts. As a field concerned with “deep uncertainties”, it is logically consistent to include a more direct acknowledgement that our choices for dealing with computationally demanding simulations, advanced search algorithms, and sensitivity analysis tools are themselves subject to failures that could adversely bias our understanding of how systems’ vulnerabilities change with proposed actions. Balancing simplicity versus complexity in our computational frameworks is nontrivial given that we are often exploring high impact irreversible decisions. It is not always clear that accepted models even encompass important failure modes. Moreover as they become more complex and computationally demanding the benefits and consequences of simplifications are often untested. This presentation discusses our efforts to address these challenges through our “many-objective robust decision making” (MORDM) framework for the design and management water resources systems. The MORDM framework has four core components: (1) elicited problem conception and formulation, (2) parallel many-objective search, (3) interactive visual analytics, and (4) negotiated selection of robust alternatives. Problem conception and formulation is the process of abstracting a practical design problem into a mathematical representation. We build on the emerging work in visual analytics to exploit interactive visualization of both the design space and the objective space in multiple heterogeneous linked views that permit exploration and discovery. Many-objective search produces tradeoff solutions from potentially competing problem formulations that can each consider up to ten conflicting objectives based on current computational search capabilities. Negotiated design selection uses interactive visualization, reformulation, and optimization to discover desirable designs for implementation. Multi-city urban water supply portfolio planning will be used to illustrate the MORDM framework.",

We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that this transport is due to “atmospheric rivers” driven largely by synoptic Rossby wave breaking. The results indicate that extreme moisture transport into the Arctic occurs throughout the year, but with a distinct seasonality: the frequency and intensity of the moisture fluxes peak in late-summer, early autumn. On interannual timescales, moisture transport into the Arctic is strongly influenced by climate variability captured by ENSO and the NAO. Possible dynamical drivers of these events and their seasonal and interannual variability are discussed.",

These data show a statistically significant solar cycle variation and a possible increase in intensity between successive solar maximum periods. We will discuss these data in the context of recent modeling studies with a single-column version of the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. We investigate mechanisms associated with the solar cycle and greenhouse gas forcing of hydrogen by separately doubling carbon dioxide and methane, as well as doubling both together. These simulations indicate that carbon dioxide cooling, as well as methane changes to the source species for hydrogen, both lead to predicted increases in the upper thermospheric hydrogen density and that the response of hydrogen to greenhouse gases depends on the phase of the solar cycle. However, the effect of greenhouse gas doubling is not as large as the modeled solar cycle variability of thermospheric hydrogen.

            "abstract": "Numerical models are widely used to investigate the impact of glaciations on groundwater flow systems because they can simulate complex glacial processes. However, it isn’t clear which of these processes are relevant to adequately capture groundwater flow dynamics. Given the complexity of representing these processes in a numerical model and the paucity of field data available for their validation, it is of prime interest to assess how they impact groundwater flow and if any of these processes could be neglected.\nIn order to assess the specific impact of glacial processes on groundwater flow dynamics, those processes were included in the numerical model FEFLOW and simulations were conducted in a simple conceptual model representing a 21 ky glacial cycle in a sedimentary basin. The following processes have been simulated: subglacial recharge, linear and non-linear compaction of the porous medium under the weight of the ice, isostasy, proglacial lakes, as well as permafrost. Solute transport was simulated along with groundwater flow to track groundwater originating from the ice-sheet. To interpret the results, a base case scenario considering only subglacial recharge was selected and compared with the other scenarios, where individual glacial processes were simulated.\nWhen comparing the results at the end of the simulations, it appears that most of the aforementioned glacial processes don’t lead to a significant difference in meltwater distribution with respect to the base case. Only hydromechanical coupling brings some noticeable change. Conversely, the type and the value of the boundary condition applied at the base of the ice-sheet play a major role in groundwater flow dynamics.

            "abstract": "Topography can strongly influence root and associated mycorrhizal fungal function in the Critical Zone. In the Shale Hills-Susquehanna Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO), soil depths range from more than 80 cm deep in the valley floor to about 25 cm on the ridge top. Tree height varies from about 28 m tall at the valley floor to about 17 m tall at the ridge top. Yet total absorptive root length to depth of refusal is quite similar across the hillslope. We find root length density to vary as much at locations only 1-2 m apart as at scales of hundreds of meters across the catchment. Tree community composition also varies along the hillslope, including tree species that vary widely in thickness of their absorptive roots and type of mycorrhiza (arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal). Studies of trees in a common garden of 16 tree species and in forests near SSCZO indicate that both root morphology and mycorrhizal type can strongly influence root foraging. Species that form thick absorptive roots appear more dependent on mycorrhizal fungi and thin-root species forage more by root proliferation. Ectomycorrhizal trees show more variation in foraging precision (proliferation in a nutrient-rich patch relative to that in an unenriched patch) of their mycorrhizal hyphae whereas AM trees show more variation in foraging precision by root proliferation, indicating alternative strategies among trees of different mycorrhizal types. Collectively, the results provide insight into how topography can influence foraging belowground.",

Weather and climate applications for society and the private industry are in demand and have increased significantly over the last few years, creating new employment opportunities for atmospheric scientists. It is therefore more important than ever that our graduates are well prepared for the newly emerging careers. The Bureau’s Occupational Outlook predicts that opportunities for atmospheric scientists will increase more rapidly in the private industry than in other sectors (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Employers in the private sector indicate that, while job applicants often bring the required scientific training, there is a gap between the technical and professional skills needed in those positions and those possessed by graduates. Job candidates were found to be most lacking in written and oral communication skills, adaptability, and project management (Chronicle for Higher Education, 2012). The geoscience community needs to come together to better prepare our graduate students. While some of this work can be done within academic institutions, partnerships with mentoring programs and the private industry are essential. In this paper we will present one approach taken by the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program to improve its students’ skills in project management, collaborating, communication, problem solving, and essential leadership skills.",

            "abstract": "Dune interactions, which consist of collisions and detachments, are a known driver of changing dune morphology and provide the dynamics for field-scale patterning. Although interactions are ubiquitous in modern dune fields, the stratigraphic record of interactions has not been explored. This raises the possibility that an entire class of signature architectures of bounding surfaces and cross-strata has gone misidentified or unrecognized. A unique data set for the crescentic dunes of the White Sands Dune Field, New Mexico, allows for the coupling of dune interactions with their resultant stratigraphic architecture. Dune interactions are documented by a decadal time-series of aerial photos and LiDAR-derived digital elevation models. Plan-view cross-strata in interdune areas provide a record tying past dune positions and morphologies to the current dunes. Three-dimensional stratigraphic architecture is revealed by imaging of dune interiors with ground-penetrating radar. The architecture of a dune defect merging with a target dune downwind consists of lateral truncation of the target dune set by an interaction bounding surface. Defect cross-strata tangentially approach and downlap onto the surface. Downwind, the interaction surface curves, and defect and adjacent target dune sets merge into a continuous set. Predictable angular relationships reflect field-scale patterns of dune migration direction and approach angle of migrating defects. The discovery of interaction architectures emphasizes that although dunes appear as continuous forms on the surface, they consist of discrete segments, each with a distinct morphodynamic history. Bedform interactions result in the morphologic recombination of dune bodies, which is manifested stratigraphically within the sets of cross-strata.",

We report new detrital zircon U/Pb geochronology and sedimentology from the Cenozoic Austral (Magallanes) foreland basin in Argentina and Chile (near 51°S) that record changes in orogenic paleogeography during uplift of the Patagonian Andes. Near Cerro Castillo, Chile, zircons from deltaic and estuarine sandstones of the Cerro Dorotea Fm. indicate sedimentation ~60-61 Ma, revising the long-held Danian age assignment based on the foraminiferal content. Lower Eocene (47-46 Ma) zircons constrain the age of the overlying unit, the deltaic lower Río Turbio Fm., which shares sedimentological, paleontological, and provenance affinity with the northern Man Aike Fm. Deposition of the upper Río Turbio Fm. in Argentina occurred during the Eocene-Oligocene transition ~33-34 Ma and continued until ~26 Ma. Deposition of the Río Guillermo Fm. resumed ~23.5 Ma with the first occurrence of fluvial sedimentation that continued until the marine Patagonian transgression ~21-19 Ma at this location. Detrital zircon ages reveal upsection reduction in Late Jurassic and Paleozoic igneous sources, variable contributions of Late Cretaceous zircons, and younging of arc-derived zircons. Combined with published bedrock thermochronology and structural data, we suggest that early Miocene faulting and exhumation of the thrust-belt resulted in drainage reorganization and eastward shift in the drainage divide to the central domain, isolating the retroarc basin from the Jurassic Tobífera thrust sheets. Revised timing of sedimentation and changes in upland source areas during Paleocene-Miocene time reveals a complex relationship between basin evolution, Cenozoic climate, and phases of Andean tectonic activity.",

Over 2,000 peer-reviewed SWAT-related journal articles have been published and hundreds of other studies have been published in conference proceedings and other formats. The use of SWAT was initially concentrated in North America and Europe but has also expanded dramatically in other countries and regions during the past decade including Brazil, China, India, Iran, South Korea, Southeast Asia and eastern Africa. The SWAT model has proven to be a very flexible tool for investigating a broad range of hydrologic and water quality problems at different watershed scales and environmental conditions, and has proven very adaptable for applications requiring improved hydrologic and other enhanced simulation needs.\nWe investigate here the various technological, networking, and other factors that have supported the expanded use of SWAT, and also highlight current worldwide simulation trends and possible impediments to future increased usage of the model. Examples of technological advances include easy access to web-based documentation, user-support groups, and SWAT literature, a variety of Geographic Information System (GIS) interface tools, pre- and post-processing calibration software and other software, and an open source code which has served as a model development catalyst for multiple user groups. Extensive networking regarding the use of SWAT has further occurred via internet-based user support groups, model training workshops, regional working groups, regional and international conferences, and targeted development workshops. We further highlight several important model development trends that have emerged during the past decade including improved hydrologic, cropping system, best management practice (BMP) and pollutant transport simulation methods. In addition, several current SWAT weaknesses will be addressed and key development needs will be described including the ability to represent landscapes and practices with more spatial definition, the incorporation of a module specifically designed to simulate rice paddy systems and algorithms that can capture plant competition dynamics such as occur in complex tree/crop systems and interactions between crops and weeds.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the influence of antecedent geology on the distribution of submarine landslides along the central U.S. Atlantic margin, we examined a suite of multichannel seismic data, including vintage airgun data from Norfolk Canyon to Cape Hatteras and new high-resolution sparker data across the Currituck Slide, as well as regional multibeam bathymetry. Areas north and south of the Currituck Slide are characterized by oblique margin morphology, defined by angular, convex deltaic clinoforms deposited during the Mid-Miocene, which generated an abrupt shelf-break with relatively steep downslope gradients (>8°). As a result, upper slope sediment bypass, closely spaced submarine canyons, and small landslides confined to canyon headwalls and sidewalls characterize these areas. In contrast, the Currituck region is defined by a sigmoidal geometry, with a smooth shelf-edge rollover and more gentle slope gradient (<6°) that allowed >800m of Plio-Pleistocene sediment accumulation across the continental slope prior to failure. Regionally continuous seismic reflectors show little or no evidence of canyonization beneath the Currituck Slide. A significant volume of intact strata on the lower slope suggests the Currituck region was a primary depocenter for fluvial inputs during multiple sea level lowstands. Failure along bedding planes is evident in outcropping strata along the upper and lower headwalls. Buried scarps beneath these headwalls imply repeated cycles of failure. Folds and faults suggest differential compaction across these scarps may have contributed to the most recent failure. These results suggest high sedimentation and subsequent compaction along a sigmoidal margin were critical components in preconditioning the Currituck Slide for failure. Examination of the regional geological framework illustrates the importance of sediment supply and antecedent slope morphology in the development of large, potentially unstable depocenters along passive margins.",

            "abstract": "The winter and spring of 2014-15 brought abnormal warmth to much of Western Canada and a transition from snowfall to rainfall for many winter and spring precipitation events in the Canadian Rocky Mountains where snowfall normally dominates precipitation volumes in these seasons. Spring and summer remained abnormally warm and exceptionally dry. The impact of a warm winter and dry spring and summer resulted in substantial reduction in snowfall and a shift to earlier rainfall in the Canadian Rockies. As a result peak snow accumulation was from 1/3 to 1/2 of long term averages at upper middle elevations and low elevation valley snowpacks ablated shortly after forming in early December. Snowmelt occurred 2 to 6 weeks earlier than average, resulting in earlier than normal spring freshets and exposure of glacier firn and ice. June 1st snow accumulation was completely ablated or at record low values for most observation stations. The shift from winter and spring snowfall to rainfall and subsequent low summer rainfall resulted in the emergence of exceptionally wide-spread forest fires, rapid glacier melt, low streamflow and severe agricultural drought in Western Canada. By mid-July the seasonal snowpack had largely ablated, discharge rates in the Bow River at Calgary were 40% of average, many mountain streams had dried up and the Athabasca Glacier had experienced 3 m of ice melt. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model was used to simulate the impacts of the snowfall to rainfall transition on the snow redistribution, sublimation and melt processes, runoff and evapotranspiration that control the water balance of selected mountain environments in this period, employing Harder and Pomeroy’s Psychrometric Energy Balance Method to estimate precipitation phase. The results help to diagnose how a “warm drought” impacts the hydrology and glaciology of cold regions environments and suggest the possible impacts of future warmer climates and increased rainfall fraction on this region.",

            "abstract": "A well-instrumented headwater basin in the Canadian Rockies, Marmot Creek Research Basin, has experienced substantial warming at a range of elevations with evidence of hydrological functional change, but there has been no change observed in the streamflow regime over the last 50 years. Despite observations of increased air temperature of up to 4 oC in winter, concentration of precipitation into multiple day events in the spring, decreased peak snow accumulation at lower elevations by 50%, and decreased (increased) low (high) elevation groundwater storage; there are no trends in streamflow timing, peak or seasonal volumes since records began in 1962. This suggests a remarkable resilience in runoff generation to changing temperature and precipitation regime in a cold regions basin. To diagnose possible reasons for this resilience the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) simulated the basin hydrological processes and response over two periods that had excellent driving meteorology; 1969-1987 and 2006-2013. CRHM calculates all of the relevant hydrological processes including blowing snow redistribution, intercepted snow and rain loss, sublimation, snowmelt, evapotranspiration, infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils, overland flow, interflow in organic soils, sub-surface runoff in mineral soils, soil water redistribution and groundwater flow. Model results show that compared to the first period, increases in annual, basin-averaged fluxes occurred in the latter period for rainfall (37%), snowfall (20%), snowmelt (30%), evapotranspiration (23%), and sublimation (42%), but no significant trend in runoff developed between the two periods. Snowmelt, sublimation and runoff increases were primarily at high elevations and sometimes reversed at lower elevations, whilst evapotranspiration and rainfall increases were at all elevations. This suggests that there are compensatory, altitude dependent increases in evaporative losses from sublimation and evapotranspiration that promote resiliency in streamflow generation despite profound temperature increases and precipitation regime changes in this basin. Diagnostic hydrological process modelling was essential to understand changes in hydrological functions that were driving the hydrological resiliency to climate change for this basin.",

            "abstract": "In semi-arid basins across the world, the gap between water supply and demand is growing due to climate change, population growth, and shifts in agriculture and unconventional energy development. Water conservation efforts among residential and industrial water users, recycling and reuse techniques and innovative regulatory frameworks for water management strive to mitigate this gap, however, the extent of these strategies are often difficult to quantify and not included in modeling water allocations. Decision support systems (DSS) are purposeful for supporting water managers in making informed decisions when competing demands create the need to optimize water allocation between sectors. One region of particular interest is the semi-arid region of the South Platte River basin in northeastern Colorado, where anthropogenic and climatic effects are expected to increase the gap between water supply and demand in the near future. Specifically, water use in the South Platte is impacted by several high-intensity activities, including unconventional energy development, i.e. hydraulic fracturing, and large withdrawals for agriculture; these demands are in addition to a projected population increase of 100% by 2050. The current work describes the development of a DSS for the South Platte River basin, using the Water Evaluation and Planning system software (WEAP) to explore scenarios of how variation in future water use in the energy, agriculture, and municipal sectors will impact water allocation decisions. Detailed data collected on oil and gas water use in the Niobrara shale play will be utilized to predict future sector use. We also employ downscaled climate projections for the region to quantify the potential range of water availability in the basin under each scenario, and observe whether or not, and to what extent, climate may impact management decisions at the basin level.",

The model injects protons onto a sequence observer field lines at intensities dependent on the connected shock source strength which are then integrated at the observer to approximate the proton flux. EMMREM couples with MHD models such as ENLIL and computes energetic particle distributions based on the focused transport equation along a Lagrangian grid of nodes that propagate out with the solar wind. In this presentation we compare SEP modeling results with data, and consider SEP variability in longitude and latitude. Additionally we study the relative importance of observer-connectivity to the solar source and shock locations, as derived from ENLIL. We evaluate the shock geometry and compare model-derived shock parameters with those observed. Finally, we test the effect of the seed population on the resulting profiles.",

            "abstract": "Canadian environments are under considerable pressure from both climate and land-use change. While warming temperatures are widespread and amplified in the north, surface mining has resulted in large-scale landscape disturbance. How these changes affect catchment response is profound, fundamentally altering the cycling and delivery of water and geochemicals to the drainage network. In permafrost-underlain environments, coupled mass and energy processes control runoff response, and as ground thaw increases, new subsurface pathways become accessible while changing overall catchment storage. With surface mining, watersheds are altered such that they bare little resemblance to what existed prior to mining. In this presentation, data will be presented from long-term experiments exploring the impact of climate and mining on runoff processes in cold catchments using stable isotopes of water and associated hydrometric measurements. In southern Yukon, results from the Wolf Creek Research Basin highlights the influence of surface energy balances on controlling the timing and magnitude of flow response, with inter-annual variability largely driven by how atmospheric forcing interacts with permafrost-underlain areas of the catchment. In mountainous areas of southern British Columbia, surface mining reconfigures landscapes as valleys are filled with waste-rock. Mine-influenced catchments exhibit attenuated flows with delays in spring freshet and a more muted to precipitation. Stable isotopes in stream water suggests that both waste-rock and reference catchments are well mixed, however reference catchments are more responsive to enrichment and depletion events and that mine-influenced catchments had a heavier isotope signature than reference watersheds, suggesting enhanced influence of rainfall on recharge. In both cases, snow storage and release exerts considerable control on streamflow responses, and future changes in streamflow regimes will reflect both a changes in the snow regime and inherent catchment storage properties that are dynamic with time.",

            "abstract": "Whistler mode (WM) radio sounding from IMAGE has led to the first measurements of plasmaspheric field-aligned electron density and ion composition as a function of geomagnetic storm activity during Aug-Sep 2005, a period that included several successive geomagnetic storms of varying strength. The plasmapause was located at L~2.4 during the onset and main phases of the storms. On the dayside, as a function of storm activity we found in general the following results: (1) The electron density, relative ion concentrations, and O+/H+ transition height had different temporal behavior. (2) Electron density in the first 1-2 days of the storm increased followed by a decrease in the recovery phase. (3) αH+ decreased during the onset, main and early recovery phase, and then it increased; αO+ increased in the early recovery phase, and then it decreased; αHe+ in general increased in the onset or main phase and decreased in the recovery phase. (4) O+/H+ transition height increased by ~200-300 km during the onset, main and early recovery phase. (5) When successive storms occurred in less than a day's span, the latter storms had little or no effect on the electron density and ion composition. On the nightside, WM sounding data was sparse. In the case of one moderate storm, we found that 3 days after the storm, electron density at F2 peak and relative ion concentrations (at all altitudes) were comparable to those before the storm, whereas electron density above O+/H+ transition height decreased. WM sounding results for the dayside and nightside were in agreement with measurements from CHAMP (350 km) and DMSP (850 km). WM sounding measurements coupled with physics-based models (e.g. SAMI2) will allow: (a) investigation of the role of thermospheric winds, dynamo and storm time electric fields in causing the variations in electron and ion densities, and (b) testing of current theories and validating physics-based models of the thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes transmit pulses of water, sediment and solutes through the terrestrial environment and network of stream channels. The timing, frequency and magnitude of these pulses depend on inputs of water, energy and rock/soil as well as a multitude of critical zone processes that may modulate the signal. Therefore, the potential for a landscape to generate and transmit these pulses changes over long timescales, primarily as a function of climate and local base level rise or fall. Humans have profoundly altered many critical zone processes that govern these environmental signals, often targeting rate-limiting processes for the purpose of enhancing economic productivity and/or reducing financial risk. These alterations are especially evident in the intensively managed landscapes of the Midwestern US, where vegetation change, soil tillage, and pervasive modifications of the surface and subsurface drainage system have substantially changed water, sediment and nutrient fluxes. Effects, in terms of amplification or damping of environmental signals, are strongly dependent on landscape setting, and often non-linear. Hysteresis and sensitivity may hinder the return to the initial state when perturbations have reached a certain threshold. We draw from multiple examples in the upper Midwestern US to illustrate, at a basic level, the mechanisms by which landscape evolution establishes the template for generation and transmission of environmental signals and furthermore how humans have altered critical zone processes to optimize specific landscape outputs, often at the expense of modifying the rate and/or magnitude of many other landscape outputs. We present a conceptual model and discuss implications for mathematical modeling of water, sediment and nutrient fluxes to guide watershed management and restoration.",

Decision-makers want scientists who collect and analyze data to be able to predict the likelihood and severity of a hazard occurrence. When there is an event, they look to scientists to find ways to ameliorate the consequences. Science cannot predict with the accuracy sought by scientists and scientists themselves are rarely aware of the cascading consequences that they are being asked to minimize. Importantly too, scientists differ in their interpretation of data and uncertainties. While these differences are the spark of science they are often the bane of disaster decisions.

            "abstract": "The science of runoff generation describes the processes by which catchments lose water by drainage during high flow periods. For many ecohydrological problems, however, we are more interested in how water is retained during low flow periods. For example, fish habitat in the relatively dry catchments of the semiarid mountain west depends on how low streamflow is metered through the summer. Additionally, upland plants survive by the soils ability to retain water in opposition to runoff generation. Here, I discuss the impacts of soil water retention and vegetation on low flow in seasonally dry, semiarid catchments. I present evidence showing 1) low flows are getting lower, 2) plants and streams receive water from different co-existing sources, and 3) transpiration perturbs streamflow at daily, storm and seasonal scales. The simultaneous occurrence of points 2 and 3 point to conflict emerging in recent hydrologic literature: How can plants use water that is seemingly disconnected from streams while simultaneously impacting streamflow?",

            "abstract": "Lateral downslope flow in snow during snowmelt and rain-on-snow (ROS) events is a well-known phenomenon, yet its relevance as a runoff generation mechanism and the impacts on soil moisture distribution have received little attention. We used dye tracers, geophysical methods, isotopic studies, and hydrometric measurements to describe the snow properties that promote lateral flow, assess the relative velocities of lateral flow in snow and soil, and estimate volumes of downslope flow in snow. Results demonstrate that rain and melt water can travel tens of meters downslope along layers within the snowpack or at the snowpack base within tens of hours. Lateral flow within the snowpack becomes less likely as the snowpack becomes saturated and stratigraphic boundaries are destroyed. Flow along the base can be prevalent in all snowpack conditions. The net result of lateral flow in snow can be deposition of water on the soil surface in advanced downslope positions relative to its point of origin, or direct discharge to a stream. While both melt and ROS events can redistribute water to downslope positions, ROS events produced the most significant volumes of downslope flow. This can help explain rapid delivery of water to streams during ROS events, as well as anomalously high contributions of event water during snowmelt hydrographs.",

            "abstract": "The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft orbited the planet Mercury from March 2011 until the end of April 2015, when it impacted the planetary surface after propellant reserves used to maintain the orbit were depleted. This highly successful mission was led by the principal investigator, Sean C. Solomon, of Columbia University. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) designed and assembled the spacecraft and served as the home for spacecraft operations. Spacecraft navigation for the entirety of the mission was provided by the Space Navigation and Flight Dynamics Practice (SNAFD) of KinetX Aerospace. Orbit determination (OD) solutions were generated through processing of radiometric tracking data provided by NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) using the MIRAGE suite of orbital analysis tools.\nThe MESSENGER orbit was highly eccentric, with periapsis at a high northern latitude and periapsis altitude in the range 200–500 km for most of the orbital mission phase. In a low-altitude “hover campaign” during the final two months of the mission, periapsis altitudes were maintained within a narrow range between about 35 km and 5 km. Navigating a spacecraft so near a planetary surface presented special challenges.\nTasks required to meet those challenges included the modeling and estimation of Mercury’s gravity field and of solar and planetary radiation pressure, and the design of frequent orbit-correction maneuvers. Superior solar conjunction also presented observational modeling issues. One key to the overall success of the low-altitude hover campaign was a strategy to utilize data from an onboard laser altimeter as a cross-check on the navigation team’s reconstructed and predicted estimates of periapsis altitude. Data obtained from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) on a daily basis provided near-real-time feedback that proved invaluable in evaluating alternative orbit estimation strategies, and eventually allowed the navigation team to settle on an approach that gave consistently accurate predictions. Thus, final mission success was truly the result of a collaborative effort between members of the science, mission operations, mission design, and navigation teams.",

            "abstract": "Israel is located adjacent to the Dead Sea Transform (DST) capable of producing earthquakes with maximal magnitudes of M7.5-M7.8 and a recurrence time for a M6 and M7 earthquake on the order of 100 and 1000 years, respectively. The most recent destructive earthquake along the DST was the 1927 ML 6.2 earthquake near Jericho, leading to 285 deaths and ~1000 injured across the area. The Israeli government is now building an Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS). The prime objective of this research is to implement and validate the ElarmS EEWS for the Israeli Seismological Network (ISN).\nBased on seismic rates along the DST, earthquakes with M>4.5 and M>5.0 are expected to occur every 5yr and 15yr, respectively. Thus, it is essential to use historical data to evaluate ElarmS in addition to analyzing the real-time performance of the system in Israel with smaller magnitude earthquakes. We analyze the system in real-time between April 2015 and July 2015, and analyze the results of replaying historical data from 39 events (Md>3.0) between January 2012 and May 2015.\nHistorical playback results show near complete detection of all events. However, ElarmS has a mean underestimation of magnitudes by 1 magnitude order using the magnitude scaling relation developed for California. We find that using a previously determined independent magnitude estimation equation developed for Israel (Sadeh et al., 2014) remove this magnitude offset. Using the adjusted magnitude estimation equation, the real time performance of the system shows a good agreement with catalog magnitudes.\nThe real-time implementation of ElarmS in Israel is performing well. It issued a warning for the June 27, 2015 M5.5 Nueba earthquake. However, the alert was on 0.6 sec before the arrival of the S-wave at the nearest city of Eilat ~100 km from the epicenter. This was due to the significant latencies (2-4 sec) and long data packets (up to 10 sec) that exist for the ISN which has still to be optimized for EEWS.",

            "abstract": "Tropical glaciers constitute an important water resource for downstream populations. However, our understanding of their physical processes is limited due to their high elevation and remote location. In order to gain information on the processes driving the ablation of tropical glaciers, we acquired time-lapse (5-10 minute interval) high-resolution (0.64 m2 pixel size) infrared imagery of the Cuchillacocha Glacier in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, in June 2014. This temperature dataset allows for the investigation of small-scale processes observed on the surface of the glacier and surroundings, such as the longwave transfer from the rock adjacent to the glacier. This process is particularly important for tropical glaciers, where the intense incoming solar radiation results in relatively high temperatures of the rocks adjacent the glacier and enhances longwave radiation emission. This radiative flux, varying between 81 and 120 W m-2 daily, is affected by local shading but shows no significant dependency on elevation. The longwave flux derived from the infrared images is integrated into an energy-balance model of the glacier to compare melt at the glacier margin to that occurring on the surface of the glacier. We can then estimate the melt volume generated by this enhanced longwave radiation at the glacier margins during the dry season. Including the quantification of the longwave flux at the glacier margin results in an improved assessment of glacier energy budget and melt water generation of tropical glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Collisionless shocks are an important feature in astrophysical, heliospheric and magnetospheric settings. At these structures plasma is heated, the properties of flows are changed, and particles are accelerated to high energies. Particles are accelerated throughout the heliosphere. There are no times or conditions where suprathermal ions forming tails are not present on the solar wind ion distribution, and given the low speeds of these particles they must be accelerated locally in the heliosphere. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) accelerate particles up to 10s of MeV/nucleon. The termination shock of the solar and the heliosheath produce energetic particles including the Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs), with energies in excess of 100 MeV. In the last few years’ very interesting observations at low energies showing power laws that cannot be explained with commonly accepted acceleration mechanisms and thus increased the need for alternative acceleration processes.\nFully consistent kinetic particle simulations such as hybrid simulations appear to be a powerful tool to investigated ion acceleration. Nowadays these simulations can be performed in 3D and relative large simulation domains covering up to hundreds of ion inertial length in size and thus representing the MHD scale.\nThese 3D hybrid simulations show filamentary magnetic and density structures, which could be interpreted as small-scale flux ropes. The growth of these small-scale structures is also associated with ion acceleration. In this talk we will discuss properties of these filamentary structures, their spatial and temporal evolution and the particle dynamics during the acceleration process. The results of this study may be of particular importance for future high resolution magnetospheric and heliospheric mission such as THOR.",

The immense biological and chemical diversity of BVOC is a challenge for the numerical modeling of BVOC emissions, especially for tropical forests. The fast response airborne PTR-MS measurements of BVOC mixing ratios during the GoAmazon2014/5 campaign provide an opportunity to estimate BVOC emissions from tropical forest landscapes using eddy covariance and mixed layer variance techniques. The average isoprene emissions based on airborne measurements are 6.16±4.62 mg m-2 h-1 during wet season and 12.89±8.93 mg m-2 h-1 during dry season. These observations are compared with the spatial and temporal distributions of BVOC emissions estimated using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) within the framework of the Community Land Model (CLM). By comparing the emissions estimated from airborne observations with that from MEGAN simulations, the predictive capability for diverse tropical land cover types are evaluated and an approach for improving model estimates is outlined. Satellite observations are also applied to investigate the environmental driving variables for BVOC emissions. OH concentrations are calculated from the observed BVOC mixing ratios by using the mixed layer mass balance technique and by the gradient in measured eddy covariance fluxes.

            "abstract": "In 2016 Q2 the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) mission will be launched with the TROPOMI instrument as its single instrument payload. It comprises global measurements of the atmospheric composition for air quality and climate application as part of the Copernicus atmospheric services. To this purpose it will perform nadir observations in the UV-VIS (270 – 500 nm), NIR (675-725 nm), and SWIR (2305-2385 nm) measuring key species such as O3, NO2, CO, CH4, CH2O, SO2. TROPOMI is a push broom grating spectrometer combining a large swath (~2600 km) with high spatial resolution (7x7km2 in nadir) measurements, and has heritage from OMI and SCIAMACHY. The S5P will extend the data records from these missions, as well as being a preparatory (precursor) mission for the Sentinel-5 missions planned for 2020 onward.\nIn this presentation we will address the Carbon cycle relevant SWIR products from TROPOMI (CH4, CO) as well as a fluorescence product from the NIR. In particular, this presentation will focus on the potential for CH4 measurements also in respect to other existing missions.",

            "abstract": "The effects of aerosols on the radiation balance and climate are of special concern in Arctic areas, which have experienced warming at twice the rate of the global average. As future scenarios include increased emissions of air pollution, including sulfate aerosols, from ship traffic and oil exploration in the Arctic, there is an urgent need to obtain the fundamental scientific knowledge to accurately assess the consequences of pollutants to environment and climate. In this work, we studied the chemistry of aerosols at the new Villum Research Station (81°36' N, 16°40' W) in north-east Greenland during the “inauguration campaign” in spring 2015. The chemical composition of sub-micrometer Arctic aerosols was investigated using a Soot Particle Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-ToF-AMS). Aerosol samples were also collected on filters using both a high-volume sampler and a low-volume sampler equipped with a denuder for organic gases. Chemical analyses of filter samples include determination of inorganic anions and cations using ion-chromatography, and analysis of carboxylic acids and organosulfates of anthropogenic and biogenic origin using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). Previous studies found that organosulfates constitute a surprisingly high fraction of organic aerosols during the Arctic Haze period in winter and spring. Investigation of organic molecular tracers provides useful information on aerosol sources and atmospheric processes. The physico-chemical properties of Arctic aerosols are also under investigation. These measurements include particle number size distribution, water activity and surface tension of aerosol samples in order to deduct information on their hygroscopicity and cloud-forming potential. The results of this study are relevant to understanding aerosol sources and processes as well as climate effects in the Arctic, especially during the Arctic haze period.",

We present remotely sensed (UAV, WorldView) and in situ (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, Lagrangian drifters) measurements of supraglacial river drainage pattern, hydraulic properties, and discharge in the Kangerlussuaq region. This area of the ice sheet is characterized by large, well-organized supraglacial stream/river networks that efficiently drain the ice surface with minimal retention of surface water, with river moulins being the the dominant physical mechanism by which surface meltwater enters the ice sheet. An intensive 2015 field campaign acquired novel datasets of watershed extent, drainage pattern, ablation rate, albedo and discharge for a ~70 km2 mid-elevation ice catchment (\"Rio Behar\"), including a continuous 72-hour record of discharge and water temperature in a supraglacial river upstream of its terminal moulin. We conclude that this area of the ice sheet is efficiently drained by supraglacial stream/river networks, that ice-surface DEMs alone cannot fully describe supraglacial drainage and its connection to subglacial systems; and that in situ measurements of supraglacial river discharge offer a unique opportunity to test runoff predictions of regional climate models.",

While there are several methods to measure, monitor, and model different properties and functions of these important ecosystems, many of those methods are spatially and temporally limited. Utilizing remotely sensed satellite observations in conjunction with in situ observations can offer a greater understanding of the spatial variation of certain biotic and abiotic properties.\nThe purpose of this research was to utilize NASA Earth Observations and in situ observations to better understand the temporal and spatial variation of several ecosystems properties (i.e. sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), and oceanic surface currents), to predict physiological responses (i.e. body temperature and body growth) of the ecosystem engineer, the California mussel (Mytilus californianus). Using decision trees and other modeling methods, we determined important predictor variables for mussel growth. Furthermore, while remotely sensed satellite observations were not able to capture the fine scale resolution of many of the variables, they were able to explain the spatial variation much better than the in situ observations. Satellite observations coupled with in situ observations further enhanced our understanding of the temporal and spatial variation in biological and physical processes along the pacific north coast.",

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring climate refugia, specifically in the form of cold-air pools (CAPs) in mountain basins, are increasingly discussed as potential safe havens against some impacts of global warming on western ecosystems and cold-adapted species. A key concern in these discussions should be: How will CAPs react to regional warming? Several broad possibilities exist: CAPs may “resist” regional warming, remaining as cool as ever despite warming of their surroundings. CAPs may “reflect” regional warming, experiencing temperature increases that are roughly equal to the warming of their surroundings but that leave the CAP as cool relative to their surroundings as ever. Or CAPs might “disintegrate” in the face of regional warming, losing their special cool status relative to surroundings and in the process warming much more than their surroundings. An evaluation of historical observations of wintertime cold-air pooling in the Lake Tahoe basin and adjacent Truckee drainage offers examples of CAPs that have resisted regional warming (Tahoe) and that have reflected regional warming (Truckee). These two CAP responses to warming suggest that no single fate awaits all CAPs in the Sierra Nevada. Rather, different CAPs will likely evolve in different ways, depending on their topographic configurations (e.g., closed vs draining basins), topographic depths, CAP areas, and even (in the case of the Tahoe basin) thermal conditions at the base of the CAP. These CAP examples also suggest a need for research on the possibility of equivalent future responses by other, non-CAP climate refugia in a warming world.",

            "abstract": "Protein- and non-protein-amino acids likely occupied the oceans at the time of the origin and evolution of life. Primordial soup-, hydrothermal vent-, and meteoritic-processes likely contributed to this early chemical inventory. Prebiotic synthesis and carbonaceous meteorite studies suggest that non-protein amino acids were likely more abundant than their protein-counterparts. Amino acid preservation before abiotic and biotic destruction is key to biomarker availability in paleoenvironments and remains an important uncertainty.\nTo constrain primitive amino acid lifetimes, a 1992 archived seawater/beach sand mixture was spiked with D,L-alanine, D,L-valine (Val), α-aminoisobutyric acid (α-AIB), D,L-isovaline (Iva), and glycine (Gly). Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) showed that only D-Val and non-protein amino acids were abundant after 2250 days.\nThe mixture was re-analyzed in 2012 using HPLC-FD and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQ-MS). The analytical results 20 years after the inception of the experiment were strikingly similar to those after 2250 days.\nTo confirm that viable microorganisms were still present, the mixture was re-spiked with Gly in 2012. Aliquots were collected immediately after spiking, and at 5- and 9-month intervals thereafter. Final HPLC-FD/QqQ-MS analyses were performed in 2014.\nThe 2014 analyses revealed that only α-AIB, D,L-Iva, and D-Val remained abundant. The disappearance of Gly indicated that microorganisms still lived in the mixture and were capable of consuming protein amino acids. These findings demonstrate that non-protein amino acids are minimally impacted by biological degradation and thus have very long lifetimes under these conditions.\nPrimitive non-protein amino acids from terrestrial synthesis, or meteorite in-fall, likely experienced greater preservation than protein amino acids in paleo-oceanic environments. Such robust molecules may have reached a steady state concentration dependent on ocean circulation through hydrothermal systems and synthetic input processes. We are presently trying to estimate this concentration.",

            "abstract": "Earth-observing satellites have produced a global record of aerosol optical depth approaching two decades in length. However a global record of aerosol properties at the level-of-detail required for constraining aerosol radiative forcing, aerosol-cloud interaction assessments, and many air quality applications is as yet lacking. Some aerosol-type information is derived from surface-based photometers, and qualitative classification is possible under favorable conditions from MISR, POLDER, and CALIPSO. More detailed particle microphysical properties are obtained from in situ measurements, but sampling is poor, and the suite of coincident measurements required for many applications is rarely acquired. Aerosol transport models can connect remote-sensing and in situ observations to specific aerosol sources, and extrapolate limited observational sampling in space and time. The biggest challenges to producing a global aerosol-type data record are filling gaps in detailed observations, maintaining global observing capabilities, and putting the pieces together.\nObtaining detailed particle properties is probably the leading observational gap. One simplifying factor is that, for a given aerosol source and season, aerosol amounts can vary, but the particle properties tend to be repeatable. So an aircraft payload designed and deployed frequently enough to acquire the PDFs of the key variables could fill this gap; the SAM-CAAM (Systematic Aircraft Measurements to Characterize Aerosol Air Masses) concept aims at meeting this objective. Such data would add value to the entire satellite data record, improving the aerosol property assumptions in retrievals, and providing quantitative mass extinction efficiencies to translate between remote-sensing optical constraints and the aerosol mass book-kept in climate models. This will also help putting the pieces together in other ways, by improving the connection between remote-sensing particle types and those defined in models. The enhanced connections will encourage including model aerosol-type into the overall data record where observing conditions preclude satellite retrievals. The third major challenge, maintaining global observing capabilities, requires continued hard work by the community, and good budgetary fortune.",

            "abstract": "Imaging spectrometers like the next generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) are well suited for identifying methane point sources by covering large regions with the high spatial resolution necessary to resolve emissions. A controlled release experiment at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) showed detectable methane plumes at multiple flux rates and flight altitudes. Images of plumes agreed with wind direction measured at ground stations and were consistently present for fluxes as low as 0.09 kt/year (14.16 cubic meters per hour; 500 standard cubic feet per hour, scfh).\nIn some cases plumes were detected as low as 0.02 kt/year (3.40 cubic meters per hour; 120 scfh), indicating that AVIRIS-NG has the capability of detecting a number of fugitive methane source categories for natural gas fields. Following the RMOTC campaign, real time detection and geolocation of methane plumes has been implemented using an operator interface that overlays plumes on a true color image acquired by AVIRIS-NG. This has facilitated surveys over existing oil and gas fields to identify and attribute methane emissions to individual point source locations, including well pads known to use hydraulic fracturing and natural gas pipelines.\nAn imaging spectrometer built exclusively for detection, quantification, and attribution of methane plumes would have improved sensitivity compared to AVIRIS-NG. The Airborne Methane Plume Spectrometer (AMPS) instrument concept is mature, ready for development, and would provide a spectral resolution of 1 nm and a detection threshold of approximately 0.28 cubic meters per hour (10 scfh). By offering the potential to identify point source locations, airborne imaging spectrometers could have particular utility for resolving the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic emissions, including industrial point source emissions and fugitive methane from the oil and gas industry.\nFig.1: True color image subset with superimposed methane plume. Google Earth imagery with finer spatial resolution is also included from June 2014 (red box), indicating likely methane source are tanks (likely either produced water storage tanks or condensate tanks).

Estimates of moisture transport were derived using decomposition of the moisture advection into the mean flow and transient eddy transport components. Extensive evaluation demonstrates general qualitative consistency of different products in replication the structure of the transports, however quantitative differences between different reanalyses may be quite pronounced and relate in particular to the fractional contribution of transient eddies to the total transport. Transient eddy transport over the Northern Eurasia and the North European basin was further associated with the cyclone activity diagnosed by different products and it has been found that cyclones may seriously contribute to the northward moisture advection. Importantly, this contribution is associated not only with the area of the main subpolar storm track in the North European basin but also with the area of continental storm tracks over the Northern Eurasia. Analysis of long-term interannual variability in different components of the highlatitude moisture budget demonstrated that the moisture advection tended to decrease over the last several decades while the Arctic hydrological cycle has intensifies with upward changes in both evaporation and precipitation. This is confirmed by all reanalyses analyzed and hints on the importance of local diabatic mechanisms in changing Arctic hydrological cycle in the period of rising Arctic temperatures and declining sea ice extent.",

            "abstract": "Previous work by various authors has pointed to the role of humidity in the lower free troposphere in affecting the onset of deep convection in the tropics. Empirical relations between column water vapor and the onset of precipitation have been inferred to be related to this. Evidence includes deep-convective conditional instability calculations for entraining plumes, in which the lower free-tropospheric environment affects the onset of deep convection due to the impact on buoyancy of turbulent entrainment of dry versus moist air. Tropical Western Pacific in situ observations, and tropical ocean basin satellite retrievals in comparison to climate model diagnostics each indicate that substantial entrainment is required to explain the observed relationship. In situ observations from the GoAmazon field campaign confirm that the basic relationship holds over tropical land much as it does over tropical ocean (although with greater additional sensitivity to boundary layer variations and to freezing processes). The relationship between deep convection and water vapor is, however, a two-way street, with convection moistening the free troposphere. One might thus argue that there has not yet been a smoking gun in terms of establishing the causality of the precipitation-water vapor relationship. Parameter perturbation experiments in the coupled Community Earth System Model show that when the deep convective scheme has low values of entrainment, the set of statistics associated with the transition to deep convection are radically altered, and the observed pickup of precipitation with column water vapor is no longer seen. In addition to cementing the dominant direction of causality in the fast timescale precipitation-column water vapor relationship, the results point to impacts of this mechanism on the climatology. Because at low entrainment the convection can fire before the lower troposphere is moistened, the climatology of water vapor remains lower than observed. These differences can be consequential to both climatological biases and simulations of climate change, underscoring the importance of this causal pathway.",

            "abstract": "This presentation reviews some of the single-point observations of the magnetotail at lunar distances made by ALSEP, Explorer 33, 35, ISEE-3, and Geotail that form the framework for interpreting more recent dual-spacecraft ARTEMIS observations. Earth's distant magnetotail flaps, twists, and flattens in response to variations in the solar wind flow direction and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation. It may even disappear leaving nothing more than a wake during strongly northward IMF orientations. Standing slow mode expansion fans provide for a gradual transition between magnetotail lobe and magnetosheath plasma and magnetic field parameters. The distant neutral line may at times reside at lunar distances, creating jets of sunward-streaming plasma within the cislunar plasma sheet and layers of streaming energetic particles on its boundaries. Reconnection at near-Earth neutral lines releases antisunward-moving plasmoids that transit lunar distances, briefly expanding the diameter of the plasma sheet and magnetotail. Taken as a whole, the distant magnetotail is a fascinating plasma laboratory and a region of great important to the magnetosphere.",

To determine flows in the near-surface layers of the solar convection zone from the surface to a depth of about 16 Mm, we have analyzed Dopplergrams obtained with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) using a dense-pack ring-diagram analysis. We will compare the zonal and meridional flows during Cycle 24 with those during Cycle 23. The zonal and meridional flows at high latitudes are now accessible thanks to HMI data. The zonal- and meridional-flow patterns track the mean latitude of activity and are precursors of magnetic activity appearing about three years before activity is visible in synoptic maps of the solar surface. The poleward branch of the zonal-flow pattern is noticeable during Cycle 24 but is considerably weaker than during the previous cycle. We will also present the latest results from global helioseismology for comparison.",

We present observations of the nitric oxide δ and γ band emissions between 190 and 270 nm by the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph on the MAVEN spacecraft. The emission reveals recombination of N and O atoms dissociated on the dayside of Mars, and is known to trace upper atmosphere hemispheric circulation patterns. We extend previous studies to higher latitudes, finding brighter emissions lower in the atmosphere as predicted from global circulation models. Statistically signicant variability suggests variation of the fluxes of N and O carried from the dayside thermosphere, as well as possible variations of the wind pattern in the nightside thermosphere and mesosphere. We report unexpected variability between the individual components of the nitric oxide band system. We provide statistical characteristics and evaluate possible explanations for this phenomenon.",

This is true specifically in large watersheds and remote areas in developing countries, with little infrastructure and limited resources, as well as in semiarid areas, where the lack of water may represent an obstacle to the regional economic and sustainable development. On the other hand, over the past two decades, various satellite data sets that can be used to generate land surface hydrological variables have been made available, as well as model data sets resulting from the assimilation of remotely sensed and in-situ data in land surface models. This work focuses on using these satellite datasets and model outputs for the hydrological modeling of an ungauged basin, wherein stream flow data are absent or insufficient and little or no observations of spatially variable hydrological quantities are carried out. This work will focus on a 18200km² semi­arid catchment Upper Contas watershed in Northeastern Brazil. We will examine the performance of a rainfall runoff model by calibrating the parameters using (a) observed stream flows (b) soil moisture from the GLDAS model output for the periods 1982-present. We also examine the relationship between vegetation growth using NDVI from MODIS and the model generated soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "There are many scientific and engineering methods in petroleum industry for collecting data about small fractures in subsurface. The acquired data is predominantly indirect, and constrained by the bounds of technology and the subtle nature of small fractures. Among the various data types, cores and wellbore images reliably provide the data to observe small fractures, and help characterize important fracture properties such as density, geometry and aperture. There is, however, a major uncertainty about how thorough is the illustration of the small fractures in the wellbore electrical images which are widely used instead of cutting core for practical and economical grounds. We present novel results to help with understanding the potential and limits of wellbore electrical imagers to detect small fractures. We compare and discuss observations from high-quality microresistivity images and their equivalent core samples that are obtained from sub-horizontal wells drilled into carbonate hydrocarbon reservoirs in eastern Arabia. We observed that the wellbore images give limited and inconsistent fracture sampling. The reduction in fracture sampling is related to the fracture nature that defies the imager-resolution capacity. We propose that the imaging capacity is constrained by: 1) degree of fracture roughness, 2) contrast between resistivity and conductivity of the geologic features, 3) effective stress action that is increasing and decreasing fracture aperture, and 4) fracture intake of drilling fluids under a variable fluid pressure balancing between wellbore and reservoir. The wellbore imaging outcomes influence fracture studies, particularly the areas of measuring static and dynamic properties of reservoir fractures and estimating trends and magnitudes of in situ stress.",

Water from those glaciers-fed basins are mostly utilized for hydropower, irrigation and drinking water supply to around 1.4 billion population downstream. The basin system, particularly in Nepal, is divided into three categories: (i) snow and glaciers fed: Koshi, Gandaki, Karnali and Mahakali basins (ii) from Mahabharat range: Babai, West Rapti, Bagmati, Kamala, Karnali, Mechi and (iii) Streams and rivulets from Chure hills: Surahinala, Badganga, Mohana etc. This study shows majority of flow (~78% of average flow) is from first category, 9% from second and 13% from third category. In the recent decades, especially during the dry season, rivers from third category have low runoff (or even zero)which leads to lack of water for irrigation and drinking water supply by lowering its water table.Interestingly, during monsoon season the whole region is facing high risks of flash floods and landslides due to unpredictable rainfall pattern. Increasing temperature trend (0.08˚Ca-1) and weakening precipitation rate (7.9±1.2 mm a-1) for last four decades shows indirect sign of climate change, though long time series in-situ observations are largely lacking in Nepal Himalaya. Our study supports high impact of climate change on potential generation of hydropower in Nepal which are more pronounced in coming decades.",

For example the drought events in the African Sahel which once came every decade could now come every couple of years bringing a new challenge and leading to severe disturbances and rapid environmental changes. The report identified and analyzed the problems associated with extreme climatic events, and examined how human responses to these events and the consequent disasters could contribute to adaptation objectives, and how adaptation to climate change could become better integrated with Disasters Risk Management (DRM) practices. Moreover, a number of studies explored the linkages and interactions between disasters and development and clearly demonstrates how the exposure to extremes and vulnerability to climate change can hinder development efforts, emphasizing the need for much smarter development and economic policies that consider managing disaster risk and implement adaptation measures as main components of sustainable development.\n The proposed presentation will provide an overview of   findings from IPCC reports and other studies and will draw on existing experiences and lessons learned to explore the linkages between disaster risk management, adaptation and economic development in Africa. It will also shed light on some of the regional and global interventions which aim at mitigating the impacts of extremes and disasters in African countries characterized by high exposure & vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. It concludes by highlighting the need for broader cooperation and partnership between development partners and agencies working on disaster risk management & climate change adaptation including the private sector, bilateral and multilateral agencies in order to ensure sustainable development.",

            "abstract": "Our piece of cosmic real-estate, the heliosphere, is the domain of all human existence -- an astrophysical case-history of the successful evolution of life in a habitable system. By exploring our global heliosphere and its myriad interactions, we develop key physical knowledge of the interstellar interactions that influence exoplanetary habitability as well the history and destiny of our solar system. IBEX was the first mission to explore the global heliosphere and in concert with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 is discovering a fundamentally new and uncharted physical domain of the outer heliosphere. In parallel, Cassini/INCA maps the global heliosphere at energies (~5-55 KeV) above those measured by IBEX. The enigmatic IBEX ribbon and the INCA belt were unanticipated discoveries demonstrating that much of what we know or think we understand about the outer heliosphere needs to be revised. Remarkably, the combination of observations of the ribbon, the belt and the globally distributed flux have provided a picture not only of the global heliosphere, but also the interstellar magnetic field, which has a strength and direction that can be directly compared to Voyager 1 observations. Currently, unraveling the interstellar magnetic field and its influences on the flows and structure of the heliosheath is an area of remarkably rapid discovery. The next quantum leap enabled by IMAP will open new windows on the frontier of Heliophysics at a time when the space environment is rapidly evolving. IMAP, like ACE before it, will be a keystone of the Heliophysics System Observatory. IMAP with 100 times the combined resolution and sensitivity of IBEX and INCA will discover the substructure of the IBEX ribbon and will reveal in unprecedented resolution global maps of our heliosphere. The remarkable synergy between IMAP, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will remain for at least the next decade as Voyager1 pushes further into the interstellar domain and Voyager 2 moves through the heliosheath.",

            "abstract": "Teaching the science and policy of climate change is necessary but insufficient for helping students to develop a robust climate literacy. Climate change educators must also teach students how to evaluate historical trends, to unpack the assumptions in shared cultural narratives, to grapple with ethical dilemmas, and more generally to traverse the turbulence of feeling that is a hallmark of living in a time of global climate chaos. In short, climate literacy must include the skills and strategies of the humanities, and specifically literary and cultural studies. After providing an overview of how literary and cultural studies scholars from around the world are developing innovative pedagogical methods for addressing climate change (drawing on the presenter’s experience editing the forthcoming volume Teaching Climate Change in the Humanities), the presentation will then report on a specific Literary Genres course taught at the University of Oregon. The course, offered to undergraduate non-majors who entered the class with little or no knowledge of climate change, constituted a case study of action research into the transdisciplinary teaching of climate change. The presentation will thus draw on quantitative course assessments, student coursework, and the instructor’s own experiences in arguing that three key narratives underpin the work we do as multidisciplinary climate change educators: narratives of observation, narratives of speculation, and narratives of conversion. That is, we guide students through the processes of witnessing climate change, imagining more just and sustainable futures, and by so doing, transforming themselves and their communities. In the particular Literary Genres course under consideration, students used the tools of literary and cultural studies first to analyze existing versions of these narratives and then to compose their own versions of these narratives based on their local communities and ecologies. In the context of multidisciplinary climate change education, one of the most important roles of the humanities is to empower students by giving them the critical and creative tools to tell their own climate stories.",

            "abstract": "Auroral substorm expansion is often characterized by initial brightening of aurora, followed by a westward traveling surge (WTS). In spite of their attractive features, the underlying mechanisms of initial brightening and WTS are poorly understood. We propose a scenario for the formation of the initial brightening and WTS by analyzing the result obtained by a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation: (1) Near-Earth neutral line releases magnetic tension in the near-Earth plasma sheet to compress plasma and accelerate it earthward. (2) Earthward, perpendicular flow is converted to parallel flow when flow braking takes place. (3) Plasma moves earthward parallel to a field line. The plasma pressure is additionally enhanced at off-equator. Near-Earth dynamo is formed at the expanding front of the high-pressure region. (4) Flow vorticities are generated near the off-equatorial high-pressure region. When the resultant field-aligned current (FAC) is connected with the ionosphere, the upward FAC is rapidly increased in the ionosphere, which may manifest initial brightening. (5) Due to continued earthward flow, the high-plasma pressure region continues to expand. (6) The ionospheric conductivity continues to increase in the upward FAC region. (7) The gradient of the Hall conductivity gives rise to positive space charge (divergent electric field). (8) Due to the divergent electric field, the magnetospheric plasma moves counterclockwise at low altitude. (9) Localized upward FAC is generated at low altitudes, which may manifest WTS. The current line extending from the WTS is diverted from a magnetic field line by the strong perpendicular (diamagnetic current), and is connected with the mantle dynamo region by way of the near-Earth dynamo region. The near-Earth dynamo and the gradient of the Hall conductivity may be important in the formation of the upward FACs in substorm expansion phase.",

            "abstract": "It has long been assumed that once the postseismic phase of the earthquake cycle is complete, years to decades after a large earthquake, deformation and strain accumulation during the interseismic phase of the seismic cycle are uniform. Although postseismic transients have been widely documented and result from a variety of processes, they are commonly observed to decay to a “background” deformation rate. The belief was that, subsequently, this “background” interseismic strain rate (or pattern of interseismic deformation) remained steady over most of the seismic cycle [Savage and Thatcher, 1992, JGR]. More recently, researchers discovered processes and phenomena previously unappreciated along subduction zones, including slow slip events at a range of timescales, abrupt changes in the width of the locked region, and changes over time in plate coupling. Yet our understanding of the range of behavior during the interseismic period along a subduction zone is generally limited by the brevity of modern geodetic networks, which may be at most two or three decades old.\nTaking advantage of high-resolution paleogeodetic data from coral microatolls in Sumatra, I show that it is the rule, not the exception, that interseismic rates vary over the course of a seismic cycle, and from one seismic cycle to the next. Although interseismic vertical deformation rates (uplift or subsidence) may be linear for decades to a century, the rate at any site may shift abruptly to a new rate and remain fixed at the new rate for decades more. The coupling pattern before one great earthquake may be dramatically different from the pattern leading up to a similar, co-located earthquake. Some sections of a megathrust may be nearly uncoupled for a century or more, yet appear fully coupled at other times and sustain large displacements during an ensuing earthquake. In general, the coral records suggest that our observations and understanding of fault behavior between earthquakes are still far from complete. They call into question the very meaning of an interseismic rate or an interseismic coupling pattern determined from a modern geodetic network over a subduction zone, when that rate or coupling pattern may reflect motion and deformation during only the most recent few decades.",

This is especially evident in the use of the Digital Object Identifier in association with formal bibliographic citation of literature and increasingly of data sets. Indeed, the principles and methods of data citation have been a hot topic in the informatics community over the last decade or so. To date the focus has typically been on closely linking data sets to associated literature and generally emulating bibliographic-style citation. To design a sustainable, trusted data infrastructure, however, requires us to unambiguously reference many things in many ways, be they data, software, instruments, methods, or people. Design of this infrastructure also requires us to consider the entire data lifecycle and when important elements come into play and need to be identified.\nThis paper will advocate an “ecological” model of data sharing that takes a more holistic perspective than many traditional data publication approaches. It will explore a variety of use cases around what elements of an information ecosystem need to be unambiguously identified and located, at what point in the data production process, and to what explicit purpose.",

It has been believed that water is carried into the deep Earth’s interior by hydrous minerals such as the dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMSs) which are also known as alphabet phases (phase A, superhydrous phase B, and phase D etc.) in the descending cold plate. It has been thought that the relay of these hydrous phases was terminated at ~1200 km depth by the dehydration of phase D which was the highest pressure phase of DHMSs. Recently, we have theoretically predicted the high pressure phase of phase D and experimentally confirmed the existence of this new DHMS in lower mantle pressure conditions above ~45 GPa. This phase has MgSiO4H2chemical composition and named as phase H.\n At the lower mantle pressure conditions, Al and H-bearing SiO2, δ-AlOOH, ε-FeOOH and phase H may be the relevant hydrous phases in the subducting slabs. Interestingly, the crystal structure of these hydrous phases are almost same and have CaCl2type structure. This suggests that these hydrous phases may potentially be able to make the wide range of solid solution. Some experimental studies already reported that Al preferentially partitioned into phase H and the stability of phase H drastically increased by incorporation of Al (Nishi et al. 2014, Ohira et al. 2014). The density of subducted MORB is reported to be denser than that of pyrolite in the lower mantle (e.g. Kawai et al. 2009). Therefore, there is a possibility that phase H containing Al and Fe in subducted MORB survive down to the bottom of lower mantle and the melting of phase H at the core mantle boundary may contribute to the cause of ultra-low velocity zones.\nIn this study, we further extends our exploration of these hydrous phases, such as the spin transition of Fe in phase H and the possibility of further phase transition of this new hydrous mineral using first principles calculation techniques and discuss the possible effects of this hydrous phase at the bottom of lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Production and oxidation of methane (CH4) in the Community Land Model (CLM) largely depends on the gridcell inundated fraction within the model. The functioning version of the CH4 model parameterizes gridcell inundated fraction using water table depth and surface runoff. Unfortunately, this method contains problems in representing dynamic seasonality of the gridcell inundated fraction and is not compatible with some of the recent model developments to represent permafrost thaw related processes. The future model development plan is to parameterize inundated fraction based on precipitation and river channeling to capture seasonal dynamics of hydrological cycles. Here, we investigate how different model parameterization of inundated fraction affect Arctic hydrological cycles. In addition, we quantify the rate of CH4 production and oxidation under changes in inundated fraction using different parameterization methods. We used CLM4.5BGC to understand the behavior of hydrology as well as CH4 production and oxidation. The results show that using water table depth and surface runoff to parameterize inundated fraction result in unrealistic seasonality especially in the high latitude region. For instance, winter freezing, spring thaw, and summer increase in inundated fraction were not manifested using water table depth and surface runoff to parameterize inundated fraction. The two other methods simulated these processes more realistically throughout the season except that precipitation based parameterization underestimated and river channeling based parameterization overestimated the overall high latitude inundated fraction compared to satellite based estimation. Despite the large difference in inundated fraction estimation, total CH4 production and oxidation simulated in the high latitude region were similar across the three different parameterization of inundated fraction.",

            "abstract": "Transitions from effusive to explosive regime at andesitic volcanoes are almost unpredictable at the moment. The reliability of empirical methods based on geophysical precursory patterns is still debated. A better understanding of the physical processes happening in the volcanic system before explosions and associated geophysical signals is needed. At andesitic volcanoes, dome building is often observed during the effusive phase. The weight of a forming dome is expected to have several effects: 1) It obviously induces a ground subsidence in the near field; 2) pressure increase at the top of the conduit causes magma properties and flow conditions evolution; 3) it increases pressure in the surrounding rock such decreasing rock permeability and thus gas loss through the conduit walls, possibly leading to gas pressurisation. Here we use numerical models that couple realistic magma flow conditions in the upper conduit with solid deformation, in 2D axisymmetry, to investigate all these effects. Subsiding effect due to the dome emplacement is simulated by a pressure loading of the rock surrounding the conduit. From realistic initial magma flow conditions in effusive regime (Collombet, 2009), we apply increasing pressure at the conduit top. Volatile solubility increases with pressure, then dome growth causes a decrease of magma porosity and permeability at the top of the conduit. This also causes a decrease of magma viscosity. From magma flow model, we extract pressure and shear stress conditions at the conduit wall, and apply them to the surrounding rock for ground deformation calculation . Darcy flow model is used to study the impacts of permeability decrease inside the conduit and in the surrounding rock on gas loss cinematics. Permeability decrease in the conduit and pressure increase in the surrounding rock cause gas pressurisation.",

            "abstract": "In regions such as the Himalayan syntaxes, feedbacks between high erosion rates, rapid exhumation, and the rise of hot weak crust have been proposed, where high erosion rates lead to thermal weakening of the crust, leading to focused deformation and uplift, high topography, focusing of precipitation, and further rapid erosion. To help elucidate these interactions and their inception, we turn to a system with pronounced spatial variations in climate, topography, and exhumation. Gongga Shan, a 7500 m peak on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, caps an area of localized anomalous topography and sits at the southern end of the Gonnga Shan granite, a Cenozoic intrusive body about 120 km long that parallels the NNW-SSE strike-slip Xianshuihe Fault. U-Pb zircon ages indicate that granite emplacement spanned most of the Cenozoic, with melting at depth possibly continuing to the present. While the southern end of the granite contains extremely high relief, the rest of the granite has subdued topography, with gentle slopes and low relief. Cosmogenic 10Be basin wide erosion rates are extremely high (> 5 mm/yr) in the Gongga region with rates decreasing in all directions to as low as 0.1 mm/yr over a distance of ~30 km. Thus, Gongga Shan is a region of extremely high topography in hot crust experiencing localized rapid exhumation, while the granite to the north is also a region of hot crust, but without high topography or rapid erosion. This contrast coincides with differences in precipitation and preexisting relief, as the granite stretches from the plateau margin with orographically enhanced precipitation in the south to the dry plateau interior in the north. Gongga Shan is also adjacent to the deeply incised Dadu River; which created substantial local relief even prior to the development of anomalous topography. We propose that the combination of focused precipitation, preexisting relief, and hot crust in the southern part of the granite set into motion a series of feedbacks between erosion, uplift, and orographic precipitation that has resulted in the extremely high topography and rapid erosion rates seen today. Only where all three of the driving factors are present do we observe the topographic and erosional extremes, and each of these driving factors was likely present prior to the initiation of extremely rapid uplift of Gongga Shan.",

            "abstract": "The causes of the California drought during November to April winters of 2011/12 to 2014/15 are analyzed using observations and ensemble simulations with seven atmosphere models forced by observed SSTs. Dry winters in California most typically arise from internal atmosphere variability but La Nina conditions can tip the odds in favor of dry conditions. The first of the four dry winters was indeed a La Nina. Winters 2012/13 and 2013/14 were however different and ENSO-neutral. However, the SST-forced models suggest that SST anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans drove a wave train that placed a ridge over the northeast Pacific and North American west coast that generated dry conditions. After an El Nino failed to develop in 2014, the tropical SSTs reverted to a state similar to that in winter 2013/14 and California's wet season came to an abrupt end creating a fourth winter of drought. However, SST forcing cannot easily explain the severity of the ridge and drought conditions and constructive internal atmosphere variability might be needed to provide a full explanation. Recent idealized modeling work suggests that it is warm SSTs in the southern Indian Ocean and tropical west Pacific and cool anomalies in the central tropcial Pacific that combine to generate the responsible circulation anomalies. While the drought was driven by reduced precipitation, from the surface moisture perspective, warm conditions intensified the drought with the warmth attributable to a combination of natural variability and a long term warming trend that likely includes a human-driven component. While warming will continue to exert water stress, model projections from the CMIP5 suggest that California will experience a shorter, sharper, wet season but dynamical analysis suggests the projected mid-winter wetting is likely an overestimate. At the time of writing coupled forecast systems are predicting a strong El Nino to last through the winter. Historical records suggest that should increase the likelihood of a wetter than normal late winter (February through April) especially in southern California that, if it happens, will provide important but incomplete drought relief.",

            "abstract": "The \"dry-get-drier, wet-get-wetter\", otherwise known as \"rich-get-richer, poor-get-poorer\" concept of the hydrological cycle response to rising greenhouse gases was a major advance in terms of perception of climate change in the research community and the winder public. It provides a good description of hydroclimate change in many regions but especially over the oceans. Here there is a clear divide between wet regions, with positive precipitation minus evaporation (P-E), and dry regions with negative P-E. However over land, long term P-E is either zero or positive and balanced by streamflow and it is not so simple to divide between wet and dry regions. What is more, the simple wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier paradigm is based only on thermodynamics with rising humidity causing increased amplitude of moisture convergence and moisture divergence and, hence, larger variations in P-E. It is now being realized more and more that changes in atmospheric circulation can also drive changes in moisture convergence/divergence and that a full explanation of hydrological cycle change requires attention to circulation change. This will be illustrated with reference to North America and the Mediterranean region. In both case changes in the mean circulation are important drivers of regional hydroclimate change. Model-projected North American hydroclimate change in winter is strongly influenced by a lengthening of the zonal scale of intermediate-scale stationary waves forced by extratropical heating. Wetting at the west coast, drying in the interior southwest and wetting at the US east coast are stronger in models that have a climatological wave field that exaggerates these waves than in models that have more realistic amplitude wave fields. Intense Mediterranean region drying in both summer and winter is also explained in part by shifts towards regional high pressure that, as of now, have not been fully explained. In neither southwest North America nor the Mediterranean, despite the importance of storm systems in delivering moisture to the regions, is projected drying caused by reduced transient eddy moisture convergence. Instead thermodynamic drying and mean flow changes share the responsibility for shifting the regions to drier, more water-stressed, climates.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow and transport through geologic fractures plays a key role in several areas such as groundwater hydrology, geothermal energy, oil and gas production, CO2 sequestration and nuclear waste disposal. High-permeability zones associated with fracture corridors often serve as fast fluid conduits for both single and multiphase flow in otherwise low-permeability media. When multiphase flow occurs, the presence of one phase interferes with the flow of the other phase, resulting in complex displacement patterns through the fracture, and macroscopic descriptors (such as fracture-scale capillary pressure and relative permeability) that depend on the phase concentration of both phases.\nHere, we investigate the impact of normal stress on single and multiphase flow through rough-walled fractures: (1) we generate synthetic aperture fields that honor the fractal roughness structure observed in real fractures; (2) we model the effect of normal stress on the fracture aperture geometry by solving the contact problem between fracture walls; and (3) we use invasion percolation with trapping to model immiscible fluid displacement and then compute relative permeability numerically for each stress scenario. Our results indicate that normal stress increases the amount of contact area in the fracture wall, which results in an increase of the tortuosity of the available path for fluid displacement. Increasing normal stress results in low relative permeability for the wetting phase due to a decrease of the available path for fluid flow, and therefore a small amount of non-wetting fluid has a large impact on the flow of the wetting fluid. We find that the relative permeability of the non-wetting fluid shows less variation with stress than the wetting fluid, and that both fluids exhibit strong phase interference at intermediate saturations.\nFinally, we show early results from our experimental work currently underway to validate the modeling results.",

But are these organisms active or preserved? At SMTZs, a change in the assembly statistics is noted, as well as an increase in cell counts, suggesting that cells are truly active. As depth increases, genome sizes are consistently large, suggesting that much like soil microbes, sedimentary microbes may maintain a larger reportorie of genomic potential. Functional changes are seen with depth, but at many sites are not correlated to specific geochemistries. Individual genomes show changes with depth, which raises interesting questions on how the subsurface is settled and maintained.

            "abstract": "A recent report demonstrating magnetotactic behavior in the nematode worm, C. elegans, presents two intriguing biophysical puzzles. Vidal-Gadea et al. (2015, DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07493) show that wild-type, well-fed populations from both Hemispheres migrate upwards when their soil environment is moist and wet, and downward when starved. Their data show that inverting the vertical component of the magnetic field reverses the migration direction, indicating that it is a magnetically polar (not axial) response. Also, the angle of magnetic migration varies with the inclination angle of the local geomagnetic field at the native site, minimizing travel time. This ancestral magnetic migration direction persists even when strains are taken to different areas. We note that only a single-domain ferromagnetic magnetoreceptor (e.g, magnetite) is capable of producing a polar magnetotactic response, and in support there is one report of magnetosomes in C. elegans (Cranfield et al., 2004;DOI 10.1098/rsbl.2004.0209).\nHowever, the polarity of a magnetosome is determined at the time it grows across the SPM/SD threshold, and the magnetic orientation will lock-in randomly unless biased by the strong field of adjacent magnetosomes. Hence, the persistence of a North or South seeking direction preference within these populations demands that stable magnetosome chains of fixed polarity must be transmitted from parents, to the eggs, to the larvae, and then to the new adults. This is similar to the non-genetic inheritance process by which populations of magnetotactic bacteria can maintain North- or South-seeking swimming preference. Furthermore, for a magnetotactic organism to maintain a consistent angle from the magnetic axis is not enough to make it go vertical; it would go in a cone. For them to go vertical as reported (or to deviate at their natal magnetic inclination) demands that they must have a separate gravity sensor with which to measure the inclination angle relative to the magnetic field. If correct, the results of Vidal-Gadea et al. make clear predictions for the inheritance of single-domain magnetite crystals through ontogeny, and demand the presence of a gravity receptor. But if they have a gravity receptor, why would they need magnetotaxis? These are puzzles.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Southwest and surrounding areas rely on the Colorado River Basin for water supply across a range of applications. The majority of water originates as snowfall in the headwaters region, which has experienced both episodic disturbance from deposition of dust from regional dryland sources on mountain snowpacks, as well as widespread forest mortality due to bark beetle infestation across a range of forest types, elevation, and latitude. In this work, the relative impacts of competing streamflow drivers are explored through assessing system sensitivities to individual and combined disturbances. This analysis begins at the catchment-scale by parameterizing the Distributed Hydrology and Vegetation Model (DHSVM) over a historical period for a set of 4 catchments that offer a gradient in dust-deposition, bark beetle impacts, elevation, and forest coverage. Observational estimates of disturbance are used to parameterized the model, including satellite inferences of dust-on-snow radiative loading, aerial survey forest disturbance data, ecological indices derived from MODIS forest phenology products, as well as plot-scale disturbance and in situ dust radiative loading information. Sensitivities from the catchment analysis presented, then compared with hydrologic simulations over the entire headwaters region using a meso-scale hydrologic model. Experiments are aimed at quantifying the system sensitivity and hydrologic impacts of changing LAI (from forest disturbance) and reduced snowpack albedo (from dust deposition and forest litter) on streamflow and hydrologic states. Results suggest beetle kill-induced canopy loss leads to an overall increase in water yield (i.e. streamflow) on the order of 8 - 13%, depending on disturbance severity and extent. Dust-on-snow exerts a primary control on the timing and rate of melt, with earlier and more rapid melt rates associated with more extreme dust deposition and with relatively limited interaction among components. Differences in model sensitivity across scale present a compelling case for additional research.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) are major participants in bio-geomagnetism and serve as models for understanding magneto-reception by animals. These single-cell organisms construct magnetosome organelles consisting of chains of membrane-bound single-domain nano-crystals of magnetite or greigite that are uniform in size and shape. How are these organelles and crystals constructed? Our current model is based on studying the alpha-proteobacterial MTB, which produce magnetosomes containing cubo-octahedral magnetite crystals. However, different species of MTB synthesize crystals of different shapes and sizes that are arranged within the cell in different ways. For example, the delta-proteobacterial MTB Desulfovibrio magneticus RS-1 produces elongated, bullet-shaped magnetite crystals. By comparing the genes required for a magnetic response in RS-1 to our alpha-proteobacterial model, I identify new genes that are required for synthesizing these different magnetosomes. Surprisingly, the phenotypes of mutants that have a limited magnetic response indicate that the fundamental way that magnetosomes are produced and organized within the cell are different between the delta- and alpha-protobacterial MTBs. Upon closer examination of the properties of RS-1 magnetosomes, I suggest that we need to expand our understanding of what a magnetosome is.",

            "abstract": "The quality of municipal groundwater supplies on Tutuila, the main island in American Samoa, is currently in question. A high vulnerability for contamination from surface activities has been recognized, and there exists a strong need to clearly identify anthropogenic sources of pollution and quantify their influence on the aquifer. This study examines spatial relationships and time series measurements of nutrients and other tracers to identify predominant pollution sources and determine the water quality impacts of the island’s diverse land uses. Elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations are correlated with areas of human development, however, the mixture of residential and agricultural land use in this unique village based agrarian setting makes specific source identification difficult using traditional geospatial analysis. Spatial variation in anthropogenic impact was assessed by linking NO3- concentrations and δ15N(NO3) from an extensive groundwater survey to land-use types within well capture zones and groundwater flow-paths developed with MODFLOW, a numerical groundwater model. Land use types were obtained from high-resolution GIS data and compared to water quality results with multiple-regression analysis to quantify the impact that different land uses have on water quality. In addition, historical water quality data and new analyses of δD and δ18O in precipitation, groundwater, and mountain-front recharge waters were used to constrain the sources and mechanisms of contamination. Our analyses indicate that groundwater nutrient levels on Tutuila are controlled primarily by residential, not agricultural activity. Also a lack of temporal variation suggests that episodic pollution events are limited to individual water sources as opposed to the entire aquifer. These results are not only valuable for water quality management on Tutuila, but also provide insight into the sustainability of groundwater supplies on other islands with similar hydrogeology and land use history.",

            "abstract": "We developed user-friendly empirical models to predict instantaneous fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from coastal wetlands based on a small set of dominant hydro-climatic and environmental drivers (e.g., photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature, water depth, and soil salinity). The dominant predictor variables were systematically identified by applying a robust data-analytics framework on a wide range of possible environmental variables driving wetland greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. The method comprised of a multi-layered data-analytics framework, including Pearson correlation analysis, explanatory principal component and factor analyses, and partial least squares regression modeling. The identified dominant predictors were finally utilized to develop power-law based non-linear regression models to predict CO2 and CH4 fluxes under different climatic, land use (nitrogen gradient), tidal hydrology and salinity conditions. Four different tidal wetlands of Waquoit Bay, MA were considered as the case study sites to identify the dominant drivers and evaluate model performance. The study sites were dominated by native Spartina Alterniflora and characterized by frequent flooding and high saline conditions. The model estimated the potential net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) both in gC/m2 and metric tonC/hectare by up-scaling the instantaneous predicted fluxes to the growing season and accounting for the lateral C flux exchanges between the wetlands and estuary. The entire model was presented in a single Excel spreadsheet as a user-friendly ecological engineering tool. The model can aid the development of appropriate GHG offset protocols for setting monitoring plans for tidal wetland restoration and maintenance projects. The model can also be used to estimate wetland GHG fluxes and potential carbon storage under various IPCC climate change and sea level rise scenarios; facilitating an appropriate management of carbon stocks in tidal wetlands and their incorporation into a potential carbon market.",

            "abstract": "Real-time GPS position streams are desirable for a variety of seismic monitoring and hazard mitigation applications. We report on progress in our development of a comprehensive real-time GPS-based seismic monitoring system for the Cascadia subduction zone. This system is based on 1 Hz point position estimates computed in the ITRF08 reference frame. Convergence from phase and range observables to point position estimates is accelerated using a Kalman filter based, on-line stream editor that produces independent estimations of carrier phase integer biases and other parameters. Positions are then estimated using a short-arc approach and algorithms from JPL’s GIPSY-OASIS software with satellite clock and orbit products from the International GNSS Service (IGS). The resulting positions show typical RMS scatter of 2.5 cm in the horizontal and 5 cm in the vertical with latencies below 2 seconds. To facilitate the use of these point position streams for applications such as seismic monitoring, we broadcast real-time positions and covariances using custom-built aggregation-distribution software based on RabbitMQ messaging platform. This software is capable of buffering 24-hour streams for hundreds of stations and providing them through a REST-ful web interface. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we have developed a Java-based front-end that provides a real-time visual display of time-series, displacement vector fields, and map-view, contoured, peak ground displacement. This Java-based front-end is available for download through the PANGA website.\nWe are currently analyzing 80 PBO and PANGA stations along the Cascadia margin and gearing up to process all 400+ real-time stations that are operating in the Pacific Northwest, many of which are currently telemetered in real-time to CWU. These will serve as milestones towards our over-arching goal of extending our processing to include all of the available real-time streams from the Pacific rim. In addition, we have developed a Kalman filter to combine CWU real-time PPP solutions with those from Scripps Institute of Oceanography’s PPP-AR real-time solutions as well as real-time solutions from the USGS. These combined products should improve the robustness and reliability of real-time point-position streams in the near future.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has a strong impact on permafrost coasts in the Arctic. With increasing air and water temperatures, the ice-rich unlithified permafrost coasts will thaw and erode at a greater pace. Organic carbon that has been stored for thousands of years is mobilized and degrades on its way to the ocean. The objective of this study is to investigate to what extent permafrost carbon degrades after thawing before it enters the ocean in a retrogressive thaw slump. A slump located on Herschel Island (Yukon Territory, Canada) was sampled systematically along transects from the permafrost headwall to the coastline. Concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC) as well as its stable carbon isotopes (δ13C-POC and δ13C-DOC) were measured and compared in frozen deposits and in thawed sediments. Ammonium, nitrite and nitrate were also analyzed in order to identify and understand the carbon metabolization mechanisms taking place during slump activity. Our results show that major portions of permafrost carbon are metabolized right after thawing. Ammonium concentrations are highest in areas where thawed permafrost material directly accumulates. We suggest that before entering the nearshore zone permafrost organic carbon and nitrogen is subject to major degradation and metabolization. This makes permafrost coasts and retrogressive thaw slumps degradation hotspots at the land-ocean-interface.",

            "abstract": "Lab-on-a-chip instrumentation is providing an ever more powerful in situ approach for detecting organic molecules relevant for chemical/biochemical evolution in our solar system obviating the cost, risk and long mission duration associated with sample return. Microfabricated analysis systems are particularly feasible when directly sampling from comet comae, or ejecta from icy moons, such as targeting organic molecules in plumes from Enceladus. Furthermore, the superb ppm to ppb sensitivity of chip analyzers, like the Enceladus Organic Analyzer (EOA), coupled with the ability to examine organics with a wide variety of functional groups enhance the probability of detecting organic molecules and determining whether they have a biological origin.\nThe EOA is based on 20 years of research and development of microfabricated capillary electrophoresis (CE) analyzers at Berkeley that provide ppb sensitivity for a wide variety of organic molecules including amino acids, carboxylic acids, amines, aldehydes, ketones and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [1]. Organic molecules are labeled with a fluorescent reagent according to their functional group in a programmable microfluidic processor [2,3] and then separated in a CE system followed by laser-induced fluorescence detection to determine molecular size and concentration.\nThe EOA will be flown through Enceladus plumes and uses a specially designed impact plate/door to capture ice-particles. After closing the door, the material in the capture chamber is dissolved, labeled and analyzed by the microfabricated CE system. Only a few thousand 2 µm diameter particles containing ppm organic concentrations will provide an EOA detectable signal. If amino acids are detected, their chirality is determined because chirality is the best indicator of a biologically produced molecule.

We present here new results illustrating a clear link between OM mass-fraction enrichment in sea spray (OMss) and both phytoplankton-biomass and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). We suggest that the OM enrichment of sea spray through the demise of the bloom, driven by nanoscale biological processes (such as viral infections), which determine the release of celldebris, exudates and other colloidal material.

            "abstract": "In much of the marine atmosphere, organic components in aerosol particles have many sources other than sea spray that contribute organic constituents. For this reason, physical sea spray models provide an important technique for studying the organic composition of particles from marine biogenic sources. The organic composition of particles produced by two different physical sea spray models were measured in three open ocean seawater types: (i) Coastal California in the northeastern Pacific, which is influenced by wind-driven, large-scale upwelling leading to productive or eutrophic (nutrient-rich) seawater and high chl-a concentrations, (ii) George’s Bank in the northwestern Atlantic, which is also influenced by nutrient upwelling and eutrophic seawater with phytoplankton productivity and high chl-a concentrations, and (iii) the Sargasso Sea in the subtropical western Atlantic, which is oligotrophic and nutrient-limited, reflected in low phytoplankton productivity and low chl-a concentrations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provides information about the functional group composition that represents the marine organic fraction more completely than is possible with techniques that measure non-refractory mass (vaporizable at 650°C). After separating biogenic marine particles from those from other sources, the measured compositions of atmospheric marine aerosol particles from three ocean regions is 65±12% hydroxyl, 21±9% alkane, 6±6% amine, and 7±8% carboxylic acid functional groups. The organic composition of atmospheric primary marine (ocean-derived) aerosol particles is nearly identical to model generated primary marine aerosol particles from bubbled seawater. Variability in productive and non-productive seawater may be caused by the presence of surfactants that can stabilize the bubble film and lead to preferential drainage of the more soluble (lower alkane group fraction) organic components without substantial changes in overall group composition. There is sparse evidence for the size dependence of organic aerosol particle composition from marine biogenic sources, which could provide an important mechanistic link to sea spray production.",

            "abstract": "The Diviner instrument aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is providing the most comprehensive view of how regoliths on airless body store and exchange thermal energy with the space environment. Approximately a quarter trillion calibrated radiance measurements of the Moon, acquired over 5.5 years by Diviner, have been compiled into a 0.5° resolution global dataset with a 0.25 hour local time resolution. Maps generated with this dataset provide a global perspective of the surface energy balance of the Moon and reveal the complex and extreme nature of the lunar surface thermal environment.\nDaytime maximum temperatures are sensitive to the radiative properties of the surface and are ~387–397 K at the equator, dropping to ~95 K before sunrise. Asymmetry between the morning and afternoon temperatures is observed due to the thermal inertia of the regolith with the dusk terminator ~30 K warmer than the dawn terminator at the equator. An increase in albedo with incidence angle is required to explain the observed temperatures with latitude. At incidence angles >40° topography and surface roughness result in increasing anisothermality between spectral passbands and scatter in temperatures. Minimum temperatures reflect variations in thermophysical properties (Figure).\nImpact craters are found to modify regolith properties over large distances. The thermal signature of Tycho is asymmetric consistent with an oblique impact coming from the west. Some prominent crater rays are visible in the thermal data and require material with a higher thermal inertial than nominal regolith. The influence of the formation of the Orientale basin on the regolith properties is observable over a substantial portion of the western hemisphere despite its age (~3.8 Gyr), and may have contributed to mixing of highland and mare material on the southwest margin of Oceanus Procellarum where the gradient in radiative properties at the mare-highland contact are observed to be broad (~200 km).",

The aquifer system consists of highly heterogeneous, alluvial, unconsolidated coarse- to fine-grained sediments and is among the largest aquifers in the U.S.. Overlying landuse includes 3 million ha of irrigated agriculture and 1.7 million mature dairy cows in nearly 1,500 CAFOs. A multi-scale survey of water-borne indicator pathogens (Enterococcus spp. and generic E. coli) and of three water-borne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7) was conducted at five different spatial scales, increasing with distance from animal sources of these enteric microbial organisms: moist surfaces within individual CAFO sub-systems (calf-hutches, heifer corrals, mature cow stalls, hospital barn etc.), first encountered (shallow) groundwater immediately below these sub-systems, production aquifer below CAFOs, production aquifer near CAFOs, and production aquifer away from CAFOs. Where found, indicator pathogens were tested for antibiotic resistance. Hundreds of samples were collected at each scale: continuously during irrigation events and seasonally over a multi-year period at the three smaller site-scales; and in a one-time survey at the two larger, regional scales. All three pathogens were frequently detected in moist surface samples across CAFO sub-systems, albeit at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than enteric indicators. Two of the three pathogens (but not Campylobacter) were also detected in first encountered groundwater, at 3-9 m below ground surface, in 1% of samples. No pathogens were found at the production aquifer scales. Generic E. coli was detected in ¼ of first encountered groundwater samples, and in 4% of production aquifer samples, while Enterococcus spp. was ubiquitously present across the three site scales on CAFOs and in ¼ of production aquifer samples near and away from CAFOs. Two thirds of E. coli and five in six Enterococcus exhibited resistance to multiple (> 2) antibiotics. Field monitoring results are consistent with fate and transport modeling that accounts for heterogeneity in aquifer systems.",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of land surface phenology (LSP) in the “Never-green” Sahara desert and the “Ever-green” equatorial Congo Basin were rarely discussed due to the extremely low seasonal greenness variations across the Sahara desert and the prolonged cloud cover over the Congo Basin. Based on 30-minute observations acquired by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager onboard the METEOSAT geostationary satellites, we generated a three-day angularly corrected Two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series for each year between 2006 and 2013. We further reconstructed EVI2 temporal trajectories and retrieved LSP transitions using the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model. We associated the LSP transitions with the rainy season transitions derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Product 3B42. Results show that LSP within both the Sahara Desert and the Congo Basin was strongly controlled by the rainfall seasonality. Specially, although there is no vegetation growth in most part of the Sahara Desert, recurring LSP was spatially detected in irrigation agriculture and the geomorphological regions of wadis, dayas, chotts/sebkhas and rocky hills. These geomorphological features are able to store moisture in soil to keep plants growing during the long dry seasons after vegetation greenup is triggered by rainfall events. The spatial shift of phenological timing is controlled by the Mediterranean rainfall regime in the north and the rainfalls brought by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the south. Across the equatorial Congo Basin, EVI2 time series reveals that canopy greenness cycles (CGC) of the seasonal leaf variation occur in tropical rainforests, which differs from the commonly termed “growing season” with complete leafless canopies. The seasonal EVI2 amplitude is very small and represents the gradual “leaf-exchange” processes. Two annual CGC are found and their spatial shifts closely follow the seasonal migration of ITCZ precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric electrons were reported to have increased ~40 minutes before the 2011 Tohoku-oki (Mw9.0) earthquake, Japan, by observing total electron content (TEC) with GNSS receivers [e.g. Heki and Enomoto, 2013]. They further demonstrated that similar TEC enhancements preceded all the recent earthquakes with Mw of 8.5 or more. Their reality has been repeatedly questioned due mainly to the ambiguity in the derivation of the reference TEC curves from which anomalies are defined [e.g. Masci et al., 2015]. Here we propose a numerical approach, based on Akaike’s Information Criterion, to detect positive breaks (sudden increase of TEC rate) in the vertical TEC time series without using reference curves. We demonstrate that such breaks are detected 20-80 minutes before the ten recent large earthquakes with Mw7.8-9.2. The amounts of breaks were found to depend on the background absolute VTEC and Mw, i.e. Break (TECU/h)=4.74Mw+0.13VTEC–39.86, with the standard deviation of ~1.2 TECU/h. We can convert this equation to Mw = (Break-0.13VTEC+39.86)/4.74, which can tell us the Mw of impending earthquakes with uncertainty of ~0.25. The precursor times were longer for larger earthquakes, ranging from ~80 minutes for the largest (2004 Sumatra-Andaman) to ~21 minutes for the smallest (2015 Nepal). The precursors of intraplate earthquakes (e.g. 2012 Indian Ocean) started significantly earlier than interplate ones. We performed the same analyses during periods without earthquakes, and found that positive breaks comparable to that before the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake occur once in 20 hours. They originate from small amplitude Large-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (LSTID), which are excited in the auroral oval and move southward with the velocity of internal gravity waves. This probability is small enough to rule out the fortuity of these breaks, but large enough to make it a challenge to apply preseismic TEC enhancements for short-term earthquake prediction.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx) contribute to photochemical smog, tropospheric ozone and aerosol, and human health problems. Remote sensing observations provide a valuable means of constraining emissions of NOx, and thus improving our ability to use air quality models for further understanding these issues. Traditional top-down estimates have provided important constraints for NOx emission inventories in China, but are either time-consuming (e.g., 4D-Var) or only crudely represent the influence of atmospheric transport and chemistry (e.g., mass balance). Here, we combine mass balance and 4D-Var approaches, and investigate the improvements in simulated NOx column density over China. Scaling factors derived from the mass balance approach with OMI observations are first applied to NOx emissions. In this process, a smoothing kernel is used to account for emissions from adjacent grid cells, and optimized NOx emissions are derived using maximum likelihood estimation, which weigh top-down and bottom up estimates by their relative errors. This is followed by subsequent inversion using an adjoint-based 4D-Var approach with GEOS-Chem at the 0.5x0.667 degree resolution. We consider the correlations between errors in neighboring grid cells by using off-diagonal terms in scaling factors’ error covariance matrix. An optimal value of the regularization parameter is selected using an L-curve and minimization of total error. We compare the solutions obtained using this hybrid approach with that obtained from standard 4D-Var, as well as to the direct solution from the mass balance approach itself. Differences between these methods in specific grid cells are investigated. We demonstrate the effect of transport and chemistry on the performance of mass balance and 4D-Var, identifying cases where the smoothing kernel and weighting errors in mass balance can cause the scaling factor to be in a direction that occasionally increases residual error. This study shows potential to facilitate decadal-scale NOx emission inversions.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the observed and projected changes in temperature and precipitation in the mountains of Central Asia and attempts to quantify the impacts on runoff supporting irrigated farming in the foothills and adjacent plains. Since the mid-20th Century, mountains of Central Asia experienced significant climatic warming. Although there arefew continuous long-term records from high-altitude meteorological stations, those available indicate that climate has been warming at a rate of 0.02-0.03oC a-1 in summer when impacts of climatic warming are strongest as they affect melt of seasonal snow pack and glacier ice, availability of liquid precipitation and, therefore, runoff. Throughout the year, runoff generated by snow and glacier melt in the mountains, accounts for about 10-15% of the total in the foothills. However, in the summer growing season, it accounts for about 50% of the total and is crucial for irrigation. Assessments of glacier changes have shown that glaciers have lost between 5% and 40% of their area between the mid-20th Century and early 21st Century and in the areas generating runoff supporting agriculture, the recession was stronger at 15-40%. However, quantification of the impacts of glacier recession is complicated by changes in snow accumulation, dates of snow melt and availability of liquid precipitation because it is melting of seasonal snow pack and liquid precipitation in summer that dominates runoff from the mountains accounting for about 70% of its total. In this paper, we use both observational data and regional climate model PRECIS to evaluate the recent past and future climatic changes and their impacts.",

Mountain cryosphere is very sensitive to climate change, however, monitoring and modeling of cryospheric process and its interaction with hydrology and ecology needs to be further strengthened. We establish a multi-scale high mountain river basin observing system in the upstream area of the Heihe River Basin, Qilian Mountains of China. This system consists of flux towers on alpine tundra, alpine meadow and alpine steppes, a network of automatic meteorological stations, a wireless sensor network of soil moisture, soil temperature, snow depth, and precipitation, and two super observatories for monitoring snow and frozen soil, respectively. Super-high resolution (1 meter) DEMs of four experiment sub-watersheds (each about 20-40 km2) within this river basin were obtained via airborne LiDAR remote sensing.\nWe introduce the data obtained since 2012 and present some preliminary modeling and data assimilation results. The results show that runoff, precipitation, snowmelt, and glacier melt keep increasing in the upstream area of the Heihe River Basin due to a warming climate. The ratio of snowmelt in total runoff has increased and the onset of snowmelt has gone ahead. The contribution of glacier melt to total runoff has almost doubled in the past decade. Frozen soil melt advances in time as well, and it may also contributes to the increase of the portion of baseflow in total runoff.\nThis observatory has joined the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (NARCH) and will work as a unique site to monitor cryospheric and hydroclimatological changes in very high mountains.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying magma volumes in magma plumbing systems is mostly done through geophysical means or based on volcanic eruptions. Detailed studies of plutons, however, are useful in revealing depths and evolving volumes of stored magmas over variable lifetimes of magma systems. Knowledge of the location, volume, and longevity of stored magma is critical for understanding where in the crust magmas attain their chemical signature, how these systems physically behave and how source, storage levels, and volcanoes are connected. Detailed field mapping, combined with single mineral geochemistry and geochronology of plutons, allow estimates of size and longevity of melt-interconnected magma batches that existed during the construction of magma storage sites.\nThe Tuolumne intrusive complex (TIC) recorded a 10 myr magmatic history. Detailed maps of the major units in different parts of the TIC indicate overall smaller scale (cm- to <1 km) compositional variation in the oldest, outer Kuna Crest unit and mainly larger scale (>10 km) changes in the younger Half Dome and Cathedral Peak units. Mineral-scale trace element data from hornblende of granodiorites to gabbros from the Kuna Crest lobe show distinct hornblende compositions and zoning patterns. Mixed hornblende populations occur only at the transition to the main TIC. This compositional heterogeneity in the first 1-2 myr points to low volume magmatism resulting in smaller, discrete and not chemically interacting magma bodies. Trace element and Sr- and Pb-isotope data from growth zones of K-feldspar phenocrysts from the two younger granodiorites indicate complex mineral zoning, but general isotopic overlap, suggesting in-situ, inter-unit mixing and fractionation. This is supported by hybrid zones between units, mixing of zircon, hornblende, and K-feldspar populations and late leucogranites. Thus, magma body sizes increased later resulting in overall more homogeneous, but complexly mixing magma mushes that fractionated locally.",

            "abstract": "We simulate rupture dynamics of branch fault system in 3D homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium by boundary integral equation method (BIEM). Numbers of simulations with varying tectonic stress σxx/σyy are modeled to investigate its effect on dynamic rupture of branch fault. It is found that when the main fault tectonic stress σxx/σyy is larger than a specified value (about 1.75), the branch fault rupture is more inclined to the compression fault, and rupture propagates on both the main and branch fault, while the final slip of branch fault is smaller than that of main fault. We also find when the main fault tectonic stress σxx/σyy  is smaller than a specified value (about 1.5), the branch fault rupture is more inclined to the extensional fault, and the rupture only propagates on the branch fault. Another interesting discovery is found that there is a second nucleation rupture on the main fault in 3D homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium, which is due to the stop phase of rupture on the branch. Our results show that the final slip of branch fault is proportional to the length of branch fault when the main fault tectonic stress σxx/σyy  is smaller than the specified value (about 1.5) on the extensional fault, which is larger than that of the main fault. So the occurrence of small earthquakes in the main fault may trigger a large earthquake on the branch fault. The effect of free surface on dynamic rupture of branch fault is also studied in this research.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, remote sensing based mapping and monitoring of the rice crop have been demonstrated in many pilot studies and research sites - mainly in Asia - using both optical and SAR sensors and ground based observations. These efforts have been partly driven by the high demand for more timely, more detailed and more accurate information on the rice crop for applications in both public and private sector, such as food security policy, crop and land management, infrastructure investment and crop insurance. The basic premise being that better access to better information leads to eventual benefits for both producers and consumers through better investment and management at all levels. To realise these benefits means scaling up this work to national and regional levels.\nThis presentation summarises the progress of two related projects in Asia: RIICE (Remote Sensing-based Information and Insurance in emerging Economies) and PRISM (Philippine Rice Information SysteM) that are making the transition from research to operation with the support of national governments and international donors. The presentation focuses on the technology, the partnerships, the achievements and the challenges in embedding both the capacity and the technology for remote sensing based monitoring of rice in countries in South and South East Asia. We highlight several aspects which are essential for a successful transition to a sustainable operational status and lessons learned in each country where the two projects have been operating.",

These studies have collectively suggested various mechanisms in which sea-ice loss is an active modulator of NH mid-latitude large-scale circulation, weather, and extreme events. This is an area of vigorous scientific debate, and a consensus has not emerged; competing hypotheses clearly need to be examined. To contribute to this debate, we propose a new mechanism to explain the observed concurrence of the NH circulation trends and sea-ice loss in the past 30 years. Our mechanism is based on lines of evidence suggesting that the recent summer NH circulation trend in and around the Arctic is both natural and anthropogenic in origin, but natural variability originating primarily from the tropics plays a dominant role in generating the observed circulation pattern—especially the increasing height over Greenland and northeastern Canada—which may play a key role in modulating Arctic sea-ice change and the mid-latitude weather and extreme events over North America at the same time.",

The original climate change is complex, in addition, global warming make the climate change more complex. The winter wheat growth period is from October to June, just during the rainless season, the WW growth always depends on part of irrigation water. Under such complex climate change, the rainfall varies during the growing seasons, and water table elevations also vary. Thus, water tables supply variable moisture change between soil water and groundwater, which impact the irrigation and discharge scheme for plant growth and yield. In Huaibei plain, the environmental pollution is very serious because of agricultural use of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide and etc. In order to protect river water and groundwater from pollution, the irrigation and discharge scheme should be estimated accurately. Therefore, determining the irrigation and discharge scheme for winter wheat under climate change is important for the plant growth management decision-making. Based on field observations and local weather data of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, the numerical model HYDRUS-1D was validated and calibrated by comparing simulated and measured root-zone soil water contents. The validated model was used to estimate the irrigation and discharge scheme in 2010-2090 under the scenarios described by HadCM3 (1970 to 2000 climate states are taken as baselines) with winter wheat growth in an optimum state indicated by growth height and LAI.",

Past fair weather measurements conducted over the oceans (The Carnegie curve) show a diurnal variation that correlates positively with the diurnal variation of global thunderstorm activity. However, during local dust storms with high concentrations of aerosols, the atmospheric conductivity is reduced significantly, and a marked increase in the Ez is expected.\nGround-based measurements of Ez have been performed from June 2013 at the Wise Observatory in the Negev desert, a quiet and remote station in southern Israel (30035’N, 34045’E). The measurements aim to study the diurnal and seasonal behavior of Ez , separating local and global impacts. The global impact is associated with global thunderstorm activity while the local impact is found to depend on the synoptic regime that governs the amount of aerosol loading. In several extreme dust events in Israel, we observed increases in the electric field that coincided with the presence of PM10 particles, in concentrations of 300-1000 µg/m3.

We set up 10 sites with 4 TDR sensors at each site (20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 80cm depth) to monitor the soil moisture content. The weather forecasting data are downloaded from the website of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The reference evapotranspiration is estimated based on FAO-Blaney-Criddle equation with only the air temperature from ECMWF. Then the crop water requirement is forecasted by the crop coefficient multiplying the reference evapotranspiration. Finally, the soil moisture content is forecasted based on soil water balance with the initial condition is set as the monitoring soil moisture content. When the soil moisture content reaches to a threshold, the irrigation warning will be announced. The irrigation mount can be estimated through three ways: (1) making the soil moisture content be equal to the field capacity; (2) making the soil moisture saturated; or (3) according to the irrigation quota. The forecasting period is 10 days.\nThe system is developed according to B2C model with Java language. All the databases and the data analysis are carried out in the server. The customers can log in the website with their own username and password then get the information about the irrigation forecasting and other information about the irrigation. This system can be expanded in other irrigation districts. In future, it is even possible to upgrade the system for the mobile user.",

            "abstract": "We examine transport of nanoparticles (NPs) in a refraction index-matched, three-dimensional, water-saturated porous medium, consisting of polyacrylamide beads which carry a negative surface charge. Flow cell experiments involved use of synthesized, negatively-charged gold and silver nanoparticles (AuNPs, AgNPs) and positively-charged AgNPs, to determine the effect of surface charge on NP transport behavior. From sequential imaging of the flow cell and detailed image analysis, we obtained measurements of the temporally evolving spatial NP concentration distribution. The current experiments focused on point source, pulse injection of AuNPs and AgNPs into a uniform flow field. Parallel experiments employing a conservative (Congo red) tracer demonstrated the transport to be mildly non-Fickian. A continuous time random walk (CTRW) particle tracking (PT) model was then used to quantify the spatial and temporal migration of both the conservative and reactive tracer plumes; model parameters related to the non-Fickian transport were determined from conservative (column and flow cell) tracer experiments. The results show that the negatively-charged NPs behaved similarly to the conservative tracer. These results are in accord with previous measurements of transport of negatively-charged AgNPs in sand columns. The positively-charged AgNPs, in contrast, displayed a decreasing tendency over distance to attach to the negatively-charged porous medium. Further analysis showed that the decreasing tendency of these NPs to attach to the porous medium may be correlated to the particle residence time. This transport behavior is understood by DLS and ζ potential measurements, which showed that aggregation processes and inversion in particle surface charge occurred during the transport of the positively-charged NPs. Modeling results indicated the transport to be more non-Fickian for the positively-charged AgNPs, highlighting a coupling between attachment and transport processes. We conclude that interactions between migrating particles and the porous medium may alter NP chemical properties and lead to a significant change in their mobility. We further emphasize the ability of the CTRW-PT modeling approach to quantify various geochemical processes that occur during non-Fickian transport in porous media.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the relationships between stratospheric polar vortex anomalies and cooling events in eastern China using isentropic reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Daily mean data from 2000 to 2011 are used to explore the effective stratospheric signals. First, diagnoses of the 2009/2010 winter show that after the stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) of the Atlantic-East Asian (AEA) pattern, the stratospheric high isentropic potential vorticity(IPV) center derived from the split polar vortex will move to the northeast of the Eurasian continent. The air mass, accompanied by some southward and eastward movements and characterized by high IPV values, will be stretched vertically, leading to apparent reinforcements of the positive vorticity and the development of a cold vortex system in the troposphere. The northerly wind on the western side of the cold vortex can transport cold air southward and downward, resulting in this distinct cooling process in eastern China. Secondly, the Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses of IPV anomalies on the 430 K isentropic surface during 2000–2011 winters indicate that the IPV distribution and time series of the first mode are able to represent the polar vortex variation features, which significantly influence cold-air activity in eastern China, especially in the AEA-type SSW winter. When the time series increases significantly, the polar vortex will be split and the high-IPV center will move to the northeast of the Eurasian continent with downward and southward developments, inducing obvious cooling in eastern China. Moreover, all the four times SSW events of AEA pattern from 2000 to 2011 are reflected in the first time series, and after the strong polar vortex disturbances, cooling processes of different intensities are observed in eastern China. The cooling can sustain at least one week. For this reason the first time series can be used as an available index of polar vortex oscillation and has the power to predict cold-air activity in winter.",

            "abstract": "The Aegean Sea region in the eastern Mediterranean is one of the classic and best-studied extensional provinces. Inspired by recent 3D geodynamic models of laterally heterogeneous accretion during rollback we discuss the nature of the transition from the Aegean Sea basin (Hellenides) into the Anatolian plateau of west Turkey (Anatolides). The Hellenides and Anatolides experienced similar rates of convergence, but display remarkable differences in lithospheric structure. Whereas the Aegean is characterized by sustained high-pressure metamorphism followed by slab retreat since c. 60 Ma, a south verging greenschist-facies thrust-and-fold belt formed in the Anatolides since c. 45 Ma. Fission-track contour maps show that since c. 24 Ma extension in both regions evolved differently. Gravity data, earthquake locations and seismic velocity anomalies highlight a N–S oriented subvertical boundary in the upper mantle between a fast slab below the Aegean and a slow asthenospheric region below west Turkey, the West Anatolia Transfer Zone (WATZ). Our data support the hypothesis that the WATZ developed as a result of laterally inhomogeneous convergence along the boundary of the Adriatic and Anatolian lithospheres.\n3D numerical simulations of laterally inhomogeneous convergence predict a similar evolution, where two distinct domains develop along strike: a region of distributed shortening where the systems gets congested by a microcontinent (Anatolides), and a region of extension associated with rollback of the active subduction zone (Hellenides). Strike-slip deformation concentrates perpendicular to the boundary of the two domains (WATZ). The numerical simulations also predict other salient features of regional geology and geodynamics, including the origin of a lithospheric window below west Turkey, local ocean floor topography, and the formation of the North Anatolian Fault zone. We argue that the seemingly complex tectonic evolution of the Aegean-Anatolian portion of the Tethyan orogen can be explained by a relatively simple model of continuous convergence of laterally heterogeneous lithosphere.",

It flows from the Great Dismal Swamp at the VA/NC border into the Albemarle Sound. The watershed provides a transition between spawning grounds and waters of the Albemarle Sound. Forested swamp wetlands border much of the waterways. Increased agricultural and urban development has greatly affected water quality during recent years. Test were completed along the tributaries and the river itself, adding to the previously data from 2011, 2013, and 2014. Streams tested were the Newbegun Creek, Knobbs Creek, Areneuse Creek, Mill Dam Creek, and Sawyers Creek. These streams cover a large area of the watershed and provide a wide variety of shore development from swampland and farmland to industrial development. Samples were tested for pH, salinity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity. Air/water temperature, dissolved oxygen, wind speed/direction, and turbidity/clarity measurements were taken in the field. The results were placed into an online database and correlated to the location of the sample using Google Maps®. Analysis tools were developed to compare the data from all years. Excel spreadsheets were developed to look more closely at individual points and tests for each point. This database was connected to a data visualization page utilizing Google Maps®. The results show variations for the individual water quality scores, but the overall water quality score for all the tested water sources remained at a comparable level from previous years. Mill Dam Creek rose above the previous three scores of 48 (2011), 47 (2013), and 49 (2014) and achieved a medium water quality score of 57. Areneuse Creek improved in water quality with a medium water quality score of 60. Sawyers Creek became the lowest scoring waterway tested at 35. Knobbs Creek decreased from previous years with a water quality score of 42. For a fourth consecutive testing year, Newbegun Creek fell within the medium water quality range with a score of 65. Pasquotank River rose from the previous testing year’s score of 35 but still remained within the bad water quality range with a score of 45.

            "abstract": "Mantle peridotites and their serpentinized counterparts from ocean-continent transition zones (OCT's) and (ultra-) slow spreading ridges question a series of ‘common beliefs’ that have been applied to understand Alpine-type collisional orogens in the framework of the ophiolite concept. I will show that inherited mantle signatures play a key role for the interpretation of ophiolites, and similar processes are relevant for present-day passive margins.\nField data and petrology demonstrates that ancient, thermally undisturbed, pyroxenite-veined subcontinental mantle formed parts of the ocean floor next to thinned continental crust. These heterogeneities might comprise an ancient subduction component. Mantle upwelling and decompression melting during rifting forms partial melts that enter a thick conductive lithospheric mantle and inevitably leads to freezing of the melt and refertilization of the lithospheric mantle. Mafic bodies (gabbros, basalts) are small and discontinous. The abundance of plagioclase peridotites in the Alpine ophiolites and elswhere along rifted margins are interpreted as recorders of refertilization processes related to thinning and exhumation of mantle lithosphere. Similar features are found (ultra-) slow spreading ridges. Another important result is the discovery of extremely refractory Nd-isotopic compositions with highly radiogenic 147Sm/144Nd, which indicates that partial melting processes and Jurassic magmatism in the Western Tethys are locally decoupled. Although the isotopic variability along ridges is generally explained by mantle heterogeneities such as pyroxenites, an alternative is that these depleted domains represent snapshots of melting processes that are related to Permian and/or even older crust forming processes, and during the most recent decompression they were unffected by (further) melting. Similarly, refractory rocks from rifted margins and (ultra-) slow spreading ridges have been interpreted to represent ancient melting, mainly based on Os-isotopic studies. If the dimensions of mantle exhumation and the formation of proto-oceanic crust (refertilized domains) can be compared to passive margins such as Iberia-Newfoundland or the Australian - Antartic margins, true oceanic crust might form later than is generally assumed.",

            "abstract": "Many driving mechanisms have been proposed to explain rise of a salt structure and formation of a minibasin. However, these studies mainly focus on qualitative discussion and analog modeling on these mechanisms. Quantitative studies such as numerical modeling are much needed. In this study, we apply a commercial finite-element software package, ELFEN, to develop two-dimensional plane-strain large-deformation coupled poromechanical finite-element models. We simulate initiation and rise of a salt wall from a flat salt body driven by differential topographic loading during sedimentation processes. We run drained and transient analyses, and investigate deformation, stress and pore fluid overpressure in the evolving supra-salt basin. Our model results show that 1) horizontal stress increases even higher than vertical stress at the flank of the salt wall and in the minibasin due to horizontal pushing out of the rising salt wall; 2) orientations of principal stresses in the minibasin rotate relative to far-field stress field; 3) overpressure varies much through different vertical profiles across the minibasin: relative to far-field overpressure, the overpressure near the salt wall and within the minibasin is largely perturbed by the rising salt wall. Through comparing our finite-element model overpressure with that predicted by traditional pore pressure prediction methods such as normal compaction trend approach and mean stress model, we find that the perturbations of pore pressure near the salt wall and within the minibasin, can not be resolved by these traditional prediction methods. Hence we propose to develop and apply a general Modified Cam Clay soil model to predict pore pressure. These results in this study help geoscientists understand near-salt deformation, stress, and pore fluid overpressure, provide insights into near-salt overpressure prediction, and provide implications for near-salt wellbore drilling programs.",

            "abstract": "The largest ice shelf in Antarctic, Ross Ice Shelf, was investigated over the years of (1970-2015). Near the basal stress boundary between the ice shelf and the West Antarctic ice sheet, ice velocity ranges from a few meters per year to several hundred meters per year in ice streams. Most of the drainage from West Antarctica into the Ross Ice Shelf flows down two major ice streams, each of which discharges more than 20 km3 of ice each year.\nAlong with velocity changes, the warmest water below parts of the Ross Ice Shelf resides in the lowest portion of the water column because of its high salinity. Vertical mixing caused by tidal stirring can thus induce ablation by lifting the warm water into contact with the ice shelf. This process can cause melting over a period of time and eventually cause breakup of ice shelf.\nWith changes occurring over many years a validation is needed for the Antarctic Snow Accumulation and Ice Discharge (ASAID) basal stress boundary created in 2003. After the 2002 Larsen B Ice Shelf disintegration, nearby glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula accelerated up to eight times their original speed over the next 18 months. Similar losses of ice tongues in Greenland have caused speed-ups of two to three times the flow rates in just one year. Rapid changes occurring in regions surrounding Antarctica are causing concern in the polar science community to research changes occurring in coastal zones over time. During the research, the team completed study on the Ross Ice Shelf located on the south western coast of the Antarctic. The study included a validation of the ABSB vs. the natural basal stress boundary (NBSB) along the Ross Ice Shelf. The ASAID BSB was created in 2003 by a team of researchers headed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA GSFC), with an aim of studying coastal deviations as it pertains to the mass balance of the entire continent. The point data file was aimed at creating a replica of the natural BSB. Select cloud free Landsat satellite imagery from satellites 1 through 7 was used to detect changes occurring over the span of 19 years. The last major interest in the study included documenting the deviations or incorrect placements of the ABSB vs. NBSB.

            "abstract": "Development of thermokarst landforms through the thawing of ice-rich permafrost soils is expected to accelerate in the northern hemisphere due to ongoing climate change. This can damage infrastructure but also drastically impact landscape soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we present a first circumpolar assessment of the spatial extent and distribution of thermokarst terrain, defined as landscapes where thermokarst landforms either have developed or potentially can develop. We differentiate between wetland, lake and hillslope thermokarst terrain types, and assess regional coverage of each type using geographical information of landscape characteristics, including ground ice content, soil type, topography, biome, and permafrost zone. Each thermokarst terrain type is estimated to occupy 5 to 8% of the northern boreal and tundra permafrost region, but otherwise differ markedly in their spatial distribution and projected exposure to climate change. With high soil organic carbon content, thermokarst terrain is estimated to store a disproportionate 30% of the total permafrost region soil organic carbon stock in the upper 3 meters of soil, and potentially more than half when accounting for deeper carbon stores. This first-order estimate of the distribution of northern thermokarst terrain is an essential step for assessing soil carbon vulnerability to thaw and the magnitude of the permafrost carbon feedback.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands in the Mackenzie River valley initiated ~9000 years ago and have built up vast soil carbon stores since. Peatland development history in this region is characterized by several distinct stages, varying in nutrient status and permafrost conditions. Widespread permafrost thaw has recently occurred in response to warming, thus making large soil C stores available for microbial processes and mineralization. A crucial question to answer is whether these peatland become net sinks or sources of C following thaw. The net response to thaw will either be dominated by new peat C accumulation at the surface or by mineralization of old peat C released from permafrost. In order to address this question we cored peat plateaus and nearby thermokarst bogs near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, representing 4 chronosequences. The cores were analyzed for C content, radiocarbon dates, macrofossils, testate amoebas, peat humification degree, elemental analysis, and microbial lability through an incubation experiment. Together, these approaches reveal peatland development histories, both before and following permafrost thaw. It is clear from our findings that C cycling following permafrost thaw will be intrinsically dependent on the developmental history of the peatland.",

            "abstract": "Much of the Earth was built by high-energy impacts of planetesimals and embryos, many of these impactors already differentiated, with metallic cores of their own. Geochemical data provide critical information on the timing of accretion and the prevailing physical conditions, but their interpretation depends critically on the degree of metal-silicate chemical equilibration and metal dispersion during core-mantle differentiation, which is poorly constrained. Efficient equilibration requires that the large volumes of iron derived from impactor cores mix with molten silicates down to scales small enough to allow fast metal-silicate mass transfer. Here we use fluid dynamics experiments to investigate the fate of the metal phase of a planetesimal or planetary embryo colliding with the proto-Earth. The degree of metal-dispersion and metal-silicate mixing are found to depend primarily on the Froude number of the impactor, with \"small\" impacts (having large Froude numbers) having a comparatively higher amount of dispersion and mixing than \"large\" impacts (moderate Froude numbers).",

            "abstract": "Hydroclimatic extremes , such as major floods and droughts, or periods with a high frequency of clustered tornadoes, fires or cyclones, have often been thought of as random, rare events, and much of the literature on these topics has been obsessed with the estimation of the tail probabilities (e.g., the 100 year event) of these processes. It has taken the \"acceptance\" of the notion of climate change to question whether the machinery developed for such estimation or even the associated questions are reasonable. However, much of the literature that has evolved since has focused on how to detect and model changes in these probabilities using a variety of methods. In this talk, I will argue that while such efforts may be useful in a certain, outdated context, they are not necessarily leading to an improvement in eihter the science of the application of the science to disaster risk mitigation. I develop an argument that hydroclimatic extremes result from an organization of the associated global and local dynamical systems that leads to the systems trajectories locking into a particular region of state space. Such excursions could be considered as rare events, in their ultimate expression, or in their frequency of visitation and persistence in those states. An open question is whether the dynamics of the system under such conditions are marked by high or low predictabilty in the Lyapunov sense. A characterization of the dimension and predictability of hydroclimatic extremes would allow us to better understand the potential implications of climate change, and also of whether or not a regional drought or similar persistent regime is likely to dissipate or grow.",

            "abstract": "Northern latitude wetlands (&gt;~50°N) are characterized by cold and wet conditions that result in low decomposition rates for plant litter. This process promotes the sequestration of carbon (C) in the form of organic matter (i.e. peat) and the formation of widespread peatands. Peatlands, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, have accumulated C by removing atmospheric CO2 for approximately the past 10,000 years. Historically, peatlands represent a net C sink; however, increases in the global average temperature could alter peatlands ability to store carbon. With a warming climate and permafrost thaw, the pool of once stable soil organic C available for decomposition is increasing. Like all terrestrial ecosystems, a number of environmental factors (e.g. peat temperature and vegetation) play important roles in governing the fate of C in peatlands. Projected climate change is expected to affect these regulating factors. Subarctic peatlands in zones of discontinuous permafrost are experiencing widespread environmental changes due to climate warming. In this study, we present net ecosystem (CO2) exchange and δ13C-CO2 data from Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden (68°22’N, 19°03’E). Measurements were made using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer connected to automatic chambers placed in the three predominant ecosystems (a dry, elevated Palsa; an intermediate thaw regime dominated by Sphagnum spp. and; a completely thawed, inundated site dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium).

            "abstract": "Snow’s insulating and reflective properties substantially influence Arctic sea ice growth and decay. A particularly important, but under-appreciated, aspect of snow on sea ice is its fine-scale spatial distribution. Snow redistribution into dunes and drifts controls the effective thermal conductivity of a snowpack and dictates the locations of melt pond formation, exerting considerable control over ice mass balance. The effective thermal conductivity of snow distributions created on sea ice, for example, is often considerably greater than a uniform snowpack of equivalent mean thickness. During the N-ICE 2015 campaign north of Svalbard, we studied snow distributions across multiple ice types and the impacts these have on thermal fluxes and ice mass balance. We used terrestrial LiDAR to observe the snow surface topography over km2 areas, conducted many thousands of manual snow depth measurements, and collected hundreds of observations of the snow physical properties in snow pits. We find that the wind driven redistribution of snow can alter the net effect of a constant snow cover volume on ice mass balance as strongly as inter-annual variability in the amount and timing of snowfall. Further comparison with snow depth distributions from field campaigns in other parts of the Arctic highlights regional and inter-annual differences in snow distribution. We quantify the impact of this variability on ice mass balance and demonstrate the need for considering snow distributions and redistribution processes in sea ice models.",

            "abstract": "The Santa Maria da Vitória River supplies over 30% of the water for the greater Vitória, Espírito Santo, BR metropolitan area, which has a population of roughly 1.6 million people. The availability of clean freshwater is severely limited during periods of heavy rainfall because water sanitation facilities are “clogged” by high sediment discharge. The headwaters of the Santa Maria da Vitória River are characterized by relatively pristine forested environments, transitioning into primarily agricultural and rural land uses, and finally reaching the large urban center of Vitória near its marine receiving waters. The discharge of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter (DOM) was examined at a 3 hour frequency during heavy storm flows from October 2013 to May 2015 in the Santa Maria da Vitória River main channel and a small tributary, the Mangaraí River. Bulk isotopic analyses were used to determine potential sediment sources and whether specific landscape/land use features were functionalized during periods of high runoff. Likewise, time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-ToF-MS) was used to identify a broad suite of DOM compounds that responded positively with river discharge in an effort to determine the influence of land use on the delivery of dissolved components to the river. For example, the abundance of compounds related to specific agricultural settings increased during storm flow along with anthropogenic DOM sources such as plasticizer and pesticide-derived compounds. Suspended sediment concentrations increased by as much as 70 times during peak river discharge relative to base flow several days earlier with similar increases in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen observed. Results from this study and previous field measurements were integrated into a coupled hydrology-sediment transport model, DHSVM, as part of a dynamic information framework with the goal of predicting water/sediment discharge to inform management and policy sectors of the state of Espírito Santo.",

            "abstract": "Radial and azimuthal anisotropy in seismic wave speeds have long been observed using surface waves, which are believed to be controlled by deformation within the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle. Although radial and azimuthal anisotropy reflect important aspects of anisotropic media, few studies have tried to interpret them jointly. We describe a method of inversion that interprets simultaneous observations of radial and azimuthal anisotropy under the assumption of a hexagonally symmetric elastic tensor with a tilted symmetry axis defined by dip and strike angles. Our inferences occur within the framework of a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion, which yields a posterior distribution that reflects both variances of and covariances between all model variables. We show how uncertainties in the surface wave travel time measurements and prior hypotheses affect the posterior distribution of models, and compare results from the western US and Tibet. In the western US, the data can be explained well by a models whose anisotropic symmetry axis is oriented at a constant angle with depth in the crust. In contrast, across eastern Tibet, the data require that the symmetry axes are oriented differently between the upper and middle-to-lower crust. In Tibet, the data prefer models with steeply dipping upper crustal and shallowly dipping middle/lower crustal symmetry axes, which may reflect a fractured brittle upper crust above a ductile middle/lower crust dominated by subhorizontal flow.",

The 2012 basal deposits 10 km S of Copahue are mm-sized ashes with hydrothermally altered debris, followed by up to 10cm pancake pumices, while denser cinders fell near the crater in the waning stages. The strombolian plume was ~ 6 km high and satellite images show its trajectory up to 200 km S. The pumices have finely porous rims (0.3mm vesicles) that were probably quenched by hydrothermal fluids and coarse interiors (several mm vesicles) that inflated during eruption. All the products have identical chemical composition and mineralogy, and only vary in degree of vesiculation. The 2012 products are the most mafic of the whole volcanic history of Copahue, with MgO ~ 4.5 %. The quench rim pumice glass contains 1160 ppm Cl while glass inclusions have up to 1800 ppm Cl. Water concentrations are 0.5-2.0 % (by difference with EMPA) and plagioclase hygrometry. Pre-eruptive conditions were 1080 oC and 1-2.5 kb pressure. The magmato-hydrothermal system is leaking fluids into the overlying crater lake and into a river. The hot springs have pH <1 and these fluids are up to 60% magmatic in origin. Annual river flux measurements and non-steady state modeling between 1997 and 2013 constrain the mean hydrothermal Cl flux at 1170 tonnes/month. The 2012 erupted magma mass is about 1012 gr, and from the measured total Cl loss between 2000 and 2012 and mean degassed Cl in the magma the volume of degassing magma is estimated at 1014-1015 grams. Much more magma was degassing than was erupted. Analyses of 226Ra-210Pb constrained the maximum degassing time at 8-10 years prior to the 2012 eruption. Almost all rock samples have 210Pb deficits, and so most gas escaped from the magma into the hydrothermal system. Nonetheless, the top of the magma reservoir accumulated bubbles, which caused overpressurization that led to the eruption. Calculations of bubble rise velocities help constrain the geometry of the underlying magma reservoir. The decadal eruption rhythm of Copahue is probably more determined by the time needed for bubble accumulation and associated pressure increase (about ten years) and less by new magma intrusions.",

Studies of the activities of enzymes in environmental systems often report Vmax (the maximum possible rate of reaction; often proportional to the concentration of enzymes in the system) and sometimes Km (a measure of the affinity between enzymes and their substrates). However, enzyme studies – particularly those related to enzymes involved in organic carbon oxidation – are often limited to only those parameters, and a relatively limited and mixed set of enzymes. Here I will discuss some novel methods to assay and characterize the specific sets of enzymes that may be important to the carbon cycle in aquatic environments. First, kinetic experiments revealed the collective properties of the complex mixtures of extracellular peptidases that occur where microbial communities are diverse. Crystal structures combined with biochemical characterization of specific enzymes can yield more detailed information about key steps in organic carbon transformations. These new techniques have the potential to provide mechanistic grounding to geomicrobiological models.",

The first data were obtained during the June-July commissioning phase, which included the first moderate resolution (10 km) color images of the entire sunlit earth, color images of the Moon, and scientific data from 10 narrow band filters (317.5, 325, 340, 388, 443, 551, 680, 687.75, 764, and 779.5 nm). Three of these filters were used to construct the color images (443, 551, 680 nm) based on the average eye response histogram of the sunlit earth. This talk will discuss some of the issues involved in deriving science quality data for global ozone, the aerosol index (dust, smoke, and volcanic ash), cloud amounts and reflectivity, and cloud height (measured from the O2 A- and B-bands).

The two main agencies involved in the operational production of WSFs have used only two approaches to creating WSFs during this history: regression of flow volumes on in situ measurements (SWS), and model-based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP). In limited cases, climate information or forecasts have been incorporated into the WSFs, but leveraging climate system predictability remains uncommon. In this talk, I offer perspective on the institutional constraints affecting the development and adoption of new WSF techniques, and present insights from a new end-to-end project working with water agency managers toward developing, evaluating and operationalizing (in an experimental mode) a range of new approaches toward enhancing WSFs through improved uses of climate information and forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Building a hydrological ensemble prediction system (H-EPS) from an operational deterministic one may look like an easy task. Indeed, one has only to issue many forecasts at each time step instead of a single one. The problem gets much more complicated when that same person seeks the predictive distribution to be interpretable (reliable).\nThis presentation examine the role played by meteorological ensemble forecasts (meteorological uncertainty), Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) streamflow assimilation (initial conditions uncertainty), and multiple hydrological models (structural uncertainty), combined in a nearly reliable H-EPS. The EnKF is shown to contribute largely to the ensemble accuracy and dispersion, indicating that the initial condition uncertainty is dominant. However, it fails to maintain the required dispersion throughout the entire forecast horizon and needs to be supported by a multimodel approach to take into account structural uncertainty. Moreover, the multimodel approach contributes to improve the general forecasting performance and prevents from falling into the model selection pitfall since models differ strongly in their ability. Finally, the use of probabilistic meteorological forcing was found to contribute mostly to long lead time reliability.\nThe H-EPS was implemented on 38 catchments (Québec, Canada) characterized by a dominant spring freshet and tested for 9-day ahead forecasts over a 2-year period. Twenty lumped hydrological models, chosen for their structural and conceptual diversity, were available to the project as well as ECMWF probabilistic meteorological weather forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The modern tropical Fiji climate is characterised by seasonal rainfall controlled by the position of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Interannual rainfall is strongly modulated on decadal timescales by ENSO with higher rainfall associated with La Nina events. Voli Voli cave near Sigatoga (Viti Levu) is a stream passage that has been monitored since 2009. A U-Th dated laminated speleothem spans a 1500 year interval across the transition from the Medieval Warm Period into the Little Ice Age marked by a fabric change from finely laminated calcite with thin clay layers, to white well-laminated calcite. The older record is characterised by rising δ13C values followed by a rapid decrease in δ13C around 1200 AD. Evidence from cave monitoring shows that cave air CO2 levels are strongly seasonal as a result of greater ventilation by winter trade winds and high resolution δ13C record shows regularly spaced peaks correlated with paired laminae and cycles in P and S which provide annual markers driven by rainfall and seasonal ventilation. δ18O values remain relatively unchanged throughout the record but micromilling at sub-annual resolution reveals systematic cycles in δ18O that span groups of paired laminae with an inferred periodicity of 3-7 years i.e. a similar frequency to modern ENSO. The presence of these sub-decadal cycles in δ18O may be a result of a combination of factors. The amplitude of 2-3‰ would be equivalent to an amount-effect related change in annual precipitation of around 50% but an additional smoothing process, perhaps a result of aquifer storage, is required to attenuate interannual variance in precipitation. The Voli Voli record provides evidence of an underlying climatic change to more frequent La Niña conditions from 1200 AD and may be associated with increased conflict, shifts in settlements and changes in subsistence strategies on the island. Coeval speleothem isotope records from tropical Pacific Islands provide a provide a powerful means of locating the mean position and intensity of the SPCZ and changes in regional coupling of ocean-atmospheric circulation patterns.",

            "abstract": "Factor-of-safety analyses of submarine slope failure depend critically on the shear strength of the slope material, which has two components: friction and cohesion. While evaluating friction is from laboratory testing is common, cohesion is commonly ignored despite its potential importance in resisting failure. Here, we report on laboratory experiments conducted at effective normal stresses of < 2 MPa where we measure shear strength, but and also directly measure sediment cohesion by measuring its shear strength in a direct-shear apparatus by removing the applied effective normal stress (σn’ = 0). We document systematic behavior demonstrating that cohesion depends positively on clay mineral content and consolidation stress. The dependence on clay content suggests that the mechanism of cohesion is hydrogen bonding between charged clay surfaces and water molecules. The stress dependence indicates that estimating cohesion from extrapolating a Coulomb-Mohr failure envelope could lead to inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the proportion of shear strength attributable to cohesion is higher at lower stresses corresponding to shallow depths where landslide failures are expected.\nMeasuring shear strength and cohesion over a wide range of overconsolidation ratios (OCR) for sediments containing clays show that significantly higher peak strengths are expected to occur for OCR > 4, and the primary source of this strength increase is not friction, but rather increased cohesion which depends log-linearly on the OCR. Our data suggest that in areas which have experienced unroofing due previous mass movements, overconsolidated clays can be stronger than cohesionless sediments such as quartz silt/sand. Overconsolidated clays would exhibit increased peak strength toward the surface, therefore failure would be expected to occur deeper where the OCR is lower. In seismically active areas, this could explain why slope failure recurrence appears to be lower than expected when considering potential triggering from local earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Iso2k is a new, community-based effort within the Past Global Changes 2k (PAGES2k) project to investigate decadal to centennial-scale variability in hydroclimate over the past 2,000 years. This PAGES2K Trans-Regional Project will create a global database, available for public use, of archives that record the stable isotopic composition of water (δ18O and δD). Stable water isotopes detect regional-scale circulation patterns, making them excellent tracers of the water cycle’s response to changes in climate. Researchers will use the database to identify regional- and global-scale features in hydroclimate and atmospheric circulation during the past 2kyr and their relationship with temperature reconstructions. Other key science questions to be addressed include: How do water isotope proxy records capture changes in the tropical water cycle? Where and how well do the modern day temperature-hydrology relationships hold over the last 2k? How do changes in atmospheric conditions relate to changes in oceanic conditions? The Iso2k database will be also be a valuable tool for the wider community, including those researching such topics as isotope-enabled climate model simulations and proxy system modeling.\nTo facilitate broad use of the database, experts in various proxy archive types developed metadata fields to encode the information needed to accurately and systematically interpret isotope ratios. Proxy records in the database are derived from many archives, including corals, ice cores, fossil groundwater, speleothems, tree ring cellulose, and marine and lacustrine sediments. Annually-banded records have a minimum duration of 30 years, and low-resolution records have a minimum duration of 200 years and at least 5 data points during the past 2kyr. Chronological accuracy standards follow those of the PAGES2k temperature database. Datasets are publicly archived, although unpublished data is accepted in some circumstances. Ultimately, isotope records will be integrated into the larger PAGES 2k database, where they can be searched along with other climate proxies.\nIn this presentation, we will show initial results of the Iso2k effort. Our goals are to solicit community input into the project and to encourage use of the database to answer questions about the climate of the past two millennia.",

            "abstract": "The most important source of energy that drives atmospheric circulation in the climate system is solar radiation. The key of its simulation is the radiative transfer process which is prescribed by a differential-integral equation. A two-stream method is widely used in solving radiative transfer equation in Global Climate Models, but it may produce relative errors up to 20% under cloudy-sky condition. In order to improve the accuracy of the radiative simulation in CAM5 (Version 5.0 of Community Atmosphere Model), a four-stream Spherical Harmonic Expansion approximation for solar radiation is implemented. The more accurate method needs the higher moment of phase function. In this case, a parameterization of full four-stream cloud optical properties is developed. Exact Mie calculation is performed to get the extinction, scattering cross sections and phase function at numerous wavelengths across the solar spectrum. The band results of expansion coefficients parameterized by polynomials are obtained by averaging the wavelengths within each band. That involves the weighting factor of solar flux incident at 500hPa for solar zenith angle of 48.19° (Cronin 2014). By using column radiative model for different solar zenith angles, atmospheric profiles and aerosol conditions, it shows that the four-stream method can reduce the flux biases when aerosol is considered under clear sky. Implementation of the method in single column model indicates more accuracy than the original two-stream one when comparing with ARM data. Improvements are also inferred in validation of global climate model using ERBE and CERES data.",

            "abstract": "One of the major problems in atmospheric model applications is the representation of deep convection within the models; explicit simulation of deep convection on fine meshes performs much better than sub-grid parameterized deep convection on coarse meshes. Unfortunately, the high cost of explicit convective simulation has meant it has only been used to down-scale global simulations in weather prediction and regional climate applications, typically using traditional one-way interactive nesting technology. We have been performing real-time weather forecast tests using a global non-hydrostatic atmospheric model (the Model for Prediction Across Scales, MPAS) that employs a variable-resolution unstructured Voronoi horizontal mesh (nominally hexagons) to span hydrostatic to nonhydrostatic scales. The smoothly varying Voronoi mesh eliminates many downscaling problems encountered using traditional one- or two-way grid nesting. Our test weather forecasts cover two periods - the 2015 Spring Forecast Experiment conducted at the NOAA Storm Prediction Center during the month of May in which we used a 50-3 km mesh, and the PECAN field program examining nocturnal convection over the US during the months of June and July in which we used a 15-3 km mesh. An important aspect of this modeling system is that the model physics be scale-aware, particularly the deep convection parameterization. These MPAS simulations employ the Grell-Freitas scale-aware convection scheme. Our test forecasts show that the scheme produces a gradual transition in the deep convection, from the deep unstable convection being handled entirely by the convection scheme on the coarse mesh regions (dx > 15 km), to the deep convection being almost entirely explicit on the 3 km NA region of the meshes. We will present results illustrating the performance of critical aspects of the MPAS model in these tests.",

            "abstract": "Cave monitoring provides a crucial link between hydrological and climate processes and how they may in turn effect speleothem δ18O calcite composition. This is particularly important in arid environments where potential evapotranspiration (PET) exceeds precipitation (P) and may dominate the δ18O signature. In this study we investigate climate-karst-cave interactions driving the δ18O variability in modern drip water samples from Cathedral Cave in semi-arid SE Australia and use this information to interpret a modern sub-annually resolved speleothem record. Over a two-year monitoring campaign we established that mean composition of δ18O in modern drip waters was enriched by up to 2.9‰, relative to the weighted mean annual rainfall. Furthermore, fluctuations in δ18O over time were controlled by two processes (1) evaporation in the unsaturated zone, resulting in heavier values, and (2) recharge during infiltration events, resulting in isotopically lighter values. Large soil moisture deficits in the soil zone must therefore be surpassed to initiate infiltration, resulting in relatively infrequent (0-3 per year) infiltration events. A series of infiltration experiments were conducted to elucidate water flow delivery mechanisms and water residence times. We found that the hydrological pathways and resulting mixing processes that occurred in the unsaturated zone determined the isotopic variability in the drip water δ18O between individual drip sites, and that potential storage in the unsaturated zone is generally greater than 6 months. We establish that the δ18O record in speleothems from this cave do not exclusively record rainfall composition or amount but are overlaid with an evaporative signal that is strongly affected by the time since the last infiltration event, local hydrogeology, cave climate and disequilibrium during calcite deposition. This hypothesis was tested by reconstructing the δ18O proxy record in a speleothem growing for ~50 years in the instrumental era. Our results have implications for the interpretation of speleothem records from semi-arid regions where PET>P.",

            "abstract": "Best practices in geothermal resource capacity assessment use probabilistic approaches based on conceptual model interpretations that interpolate and extrapolate temperature and permeability from wells using geology, geochemistry, and geophysics data. However, the most significant constraint on resource capacity prior to drilling is often limited to data from surface resistivity surveys. In geothermal exploration of volcanic areas, magnetotelluric (MT) resistivity imaging is commonly used to detect the low resistivity and low permeability smectite clay alteration that caps almost every volcano-hosted geothermal reservoir. Case histories of MT resistivity surveys and drilling results at geothermal fields in New Zealand illustrate the tendency to misestimate capacity if a direct correlation between low resistivity and producible reservoir area is assumed. Although improvements in MT noise mitigation and both 1D and 3D MT inversion have increased the resolution and reliable depth of investigation of resistivity imaging, the main source of uncertainty in applying resistivity imaging to resource capacity assessment is the conceptual ambiguity of the resistivity pattern with respect to reservoir properties. New Zealand case histories indicate that this uncertainty can be mitigated by a conceptually consistent integration of MT resistivity imaging with surface geoscience data, particularly structural indications of abrupt resource margins and geochemical and thermohydrodynamic constraints on upflow and outflow. Further case histories from geothermal fields in Chile illustrate the positive application of this conceptual model approach to geothermal resource capacity assessment.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental reorganization of magma dynamics at Okataina volcano, New Zealand, occurred at 26 ka involving a change from smaller volume, high-temperature rhyodacite magmas to a lower eruptive tempo of larger volume, low-temperature, rhyolite magmas. Zircon studies demonstrate the presence of a periodically active, long-lived (100,000 yr) magmatic reservoir. However, there is little correlation between periods of zircon crystallization and eruption events. In contrast, the changing magmatic dynamics is revealed in plagioclase growth histories. Crystals from the ~0.7 ka Kaharoa eruption are characterized by resorbed cores displaying a cellular-texture of high-An (>40) zones partially replaced by low-An (<30) zones, surrounded by a resorption surface and a prominent normal-zoned rim (An50-20). Elevated An, Fe, Mg, Sr and Ti follow the resorption surface and display rimward depletion trends, accompanied by Ba and REE enrichment. The zonation is consistent with fractional crystallization and cooling. The cores display wide trace element diversity, pointing to crystallization in a variety of melts, before transport and mixing into a common magma where the rims grew. Plagioclase from the ~36 ka Hauparu eruption display several regrowth zones separated by resorption surfaces, which surround small resorbed cores with a spongy cellular texture of variable An content (An 40-50). The crystals display step-wise re-growth of successively higher An, Fe, Mg and Ti content, consistent with progressive mafic recharge. Two crystal groups are distinguished by trace element chemistry indicating growth in separate melts and co-occurrence via magma-mingling. The contrasting zoning patterns in plagioclase correspond to the evolutionary history of magmatism at Okataina. Emptying of the magma reservoir following caldera eruption at 46 ka reduced barriers to mafic magma ascent. This is recorded by the frequent resorption and recharge episodes in Hauparu crystals.

In 2006, Taiwan has launched six low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as a RO constellation mission, named FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F-3/C). F-3/C mission can release 1500-2500 data sets per day for both neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. With the advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in ten years and FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F-7/C-2) mission, 12 LEO satellites are planned to be launched and deployed in two clusters of 6-satellites into the designated low and high inclination orbits in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The amount of RO data set will increase to about 8000 set per day with the using of GNSS TriG (GPS, Glonass, Galileo) receiver. For retrieving better water vapor profiles, the 4x3 antennas arrays will be on board to receive weak signals which pass through low troposphere around earth surface.

            "abstract": "Using the planet as a study domain and collecting observations over unprecedented ranges of spatial and temporal scales, NASA’s EOS (Earth Observing System) program was an agent of transformational change in Earth Sciences over the last thirty years. The remarkable space-time organization and variability of atmospheric and terrestrial moist processes that emerged from the analysis of comprehensive satellite observations provided much impetus to expand the scope of land-atmosphere interaction studies in Hydrology and Hydrometeorology. Consequently, input and output terms in the mass and energy balance equations evolved from being treated as fluxes that can be used as boundary conditions, or forcing, to being viewed as dynamic processes of a coupled system interacting at multiple scales. Measurements of states or fluxes are most useful if together they map, reveal and/or constrain the underlying physical processes and their interactions. This can only be accomplished through an integrated observing system designed to capture the coupled physics, including nonlinear feedbacks and tipping points. Here, we first review and synthesize lessons learned from hydrometeorology studies in the Southern Appalachians and in the Southern Great Plains using both ground-based and satellite observations, physical models and data-assimilation systems. We will specifically focus on mapping and understanding nonlinearity and multiscale memory of rainfall-runoff processes in mountainous regions. It will be shown that beyond technical rigor, variety, quantity and duration of measurements, the utility of observing systems is determined by their interpretive value in the context of physical models to describe the linkages among different observations. Second, we propose a framework for designing science-grade and science-minded process-oriented integrated observing and modeling platforms for hydrometeorological studies.",

            "abstract": "We have recently shown how large landslides can be detected, located, and their dynamics measured in near-real-time through inversion of long-period surface waves. Here I will talk about our discovery, over several years, of multi-km-scale landslides in remote regions across the world, several of which remain unreported, and how we have developed insights into landslide physics using a large inventory of such observations.\nSlope failures accelerating masses exceeding 10 megatons at 1-3m/s^2 generate forces large enough to trigger teleseismic waves detectable at broadband stations located 100s of kms distant. Inversion of such signals using a single-force model locates the epicenter to around +/-20km, and generates an approximate time series of the forces exerted by the evolving mass motion at that fixed point. This 3D vector sequence indicates the direction and magnitude of accelerations and thus momentum vector changes of the bulk landslide mass. Assuming constancy of this unknown mass during the main phase of motion allows us to infer a mass-scaled trajectory of motion of the mass center in 3D. Calibration against an observed runout distance leads to an estimate of then bulk mass. Conversely, use of an otherwise-estimated landslide mass (e.g., from differential topo mapping) leads to a calibration of the runout path without the need to observe it directly. In either case, comparison can be made against field and remote-sensing observations to check the validity of the method.\nHere we present multiple such tests against landslides discovered by our group in Alaska, Tibet, the Andes, and more. I will summarize analysis of the dynamical properties of these slope failures and discuss their implications. Simple scaling is seen among a host of dynamical properties, including peak force, mass, momentum, peak kinetic energy, etc.\nRoughly 5-15 events of this magnitude are seen globally each year. The majority strike in the periglacial environments of Alaska and Himalaya-Tibet-Karakoram. Most interesting are those that collapse onto glaciers and runout of many kms. Since momentum changes are weak during sliding over such low-angle, low-friction surfaces, we cannot invert for this phase of motion using long-period signals. The question remains whether the short-period seismicity has useful information to impart.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) across space and time is of great significance for quantifying global water cycle and improving land and water resources management. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and ground-based climatic variables were integrated with eddy covariance tower-based ET (ETEC) at six AmeriFlux tallgrass prairie sites in the Central United States to develop a simple and robust statistical model for predicting tallgrass prairie ET. The EVI tracked the seasonal variation of ETEC well at both individual (R2 > 0.70) and across six (R2 = 0.76) sites, suggesting that the EVI could be used to estimate ET. The inclusion of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured at tower sites further improved the ET-EVI relationship (R2 = 0.86). Based on this result, we aggregated ETEC, EVI, and PAR (MJ m-2 d-1) data from four sites (15 site-years) to develop a statistical model (ET = 0.11 Rg + 5.49 EVI – 1.43, adj. R2 = 0.86, P < 0.0001) for predicting ET (mm d-1) at 8-day intervals. This predictive model was evaluated against additional two years of ETEC data from one of the four model development sites and two independent sites. The predicted ET (ETEVI+PAR) captured the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of ETEC, and correlated well with ETEC, with R2 of 0.87-0.96 and RMSE of 0.35-0.49 mm d-1, and it was significantly improved compared to the standard MODIS ET product and ET estimates from two remote sensing ET models (Coupling Photosynthesis and Transpiration Model and Vegetation Transpiration Model). Overall, the results from this study demonstrated that tallgrass prairie ET can be accurately predicted using a multiple regression model that uses EVI and PAR which can be readily derived from remote sensing data.",

            "abstract": "In previous studies, the emission of anthropogenic atmospheric Hg in China as well as single sector have been examined a lot. However, there might have been more Hg released as solid wastes rather than air. Hg stored in solid wastes may be released to air again when the solid wastes experience high temperature process or cause local pollution if the solid wastes are stacked casually for a long time. To trace the fate of Hg in China, this study developed the substance flow of Hg in 2010 covering all the sectors summarized in table 1.\nBelow showed in Figure 1, the total Hg input is 2825t. The unintentional input of Hg, mined Hg, and recycled Hg account for 57%, 32% and 11% respectively. Figure 2 provides the detail information of substance flow of Hg. Byproducts from one sector may be used as raw materials of another, causing cross Hg flow between sectors. The Hg input of cement production is 303 t, of which 34% comes from coal and limestone, 33% comes from non-ferrous smelting, 23% comes from coal combustion, 7% comes from iron and steel production and 3% comes from mercury mining. Hg flowing to recycledHg production is 639 t, mainly from Hg contained in waste active carbon and mercuric chloride catalyst from VCM production and acid sludge from non-ferrous smelting. There are 20 t mercury flowing from spent mercury adding products to incineration. Figure1 and Figure 2 also show that 46% of the output Hg belongs to “Lagged release”, which means this part of mercury might be released later. The “Lagged release” Hg includes 809 t Hg contained in stacked byproducts form coal combustion, non-ferrous smelting, iron and steel production, Al production, cement production and mercury mining, 161t Hg stored in the pipeline of VCM producing, 10 t Hg in fluorescent lamps that are in use and 314 t mercury stored in materials waiting to be handled with in recycled mercury plants. There is 112 t Hg stored in landfill and 129 t Hg exported abroad with the export of mercury adding products. Besides, 729t Hg is released to the environment, among which, 534 t is emitted to air, 129 t flows into water and 66 t is discharged to soil.\nTo decrease the released mercury, the used mercury should be reduced firstly. On the one hand, large users like VCM production (the largest intentionally mercury user) should lower used mercury, on the other hand, mercury recycling should be enhanced.",

            "abstract": "We performed fission-track (FT) analyses for constraining timing of fault slip events associated with plastic deformations of biotite grains formed at high temperature (around 150–250°C or higher). We investigated crushed zones in the Tsuruga Peninsula, southwest Japan, consisting of the late Cretaceous Kojaku granite emplaced at ~68 Ma. We collected seven granite samples around the crushed zones associated with plastic deformations of biotite grains, according to the distance from a basaltic dyke intruded at ~19 Ma. Apatite FT ages were estimated at 48.4–14.3 Ma, getting younger near the basaltic dyke. By comparing the distribution of apatite FT ages with forward thermal and FT annealing calculation results, we interpreted the younger ages are basically explained by the basaltic intrusion. On the other hand, reheating event(s) occurred at 19–14 Ma is also potential since the youngest FT age is younger than 19 Ma at 2σ level. By following the thermal history above, we concluded the plastic deformations of biotite grains could occur associated with the following events: 1) primal cooling of the granitic body from 68 to around 50 Ma, 2) basaltic intrusion at ~19 Ma, and 2’) potential reheating event(s) by unknown heat source at 19–14 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Glacier sliding plays a central role in ice dynamics. A number of remote sensing and deep drilling initiatives have therefore focused on the ice-bed interface. Although these techniques have provided valuable insights into bed properties, they do not supply theorists with data of sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to rigorously test mathematical sliding laws. As an alternative, passive seismic techniques have gained popularity in glacier monitoring. Analysis of glacier-related seismic sources ('icequakes') has become a useful technique to study inaccessible regions of the cryosphere, including the ice-bed interface. Seismic monitoring networks on the polar ice sheets have shown that ice sliding is not only a smooth process involving viscous deformation and regelation of basal ice layers. Instead, ice streams exhibit sudden slip episodes over their beds and intermittent phases of partial or complete stagnation.\nHere we discuss new and recently published discoveries of basal seismic sources beneath various glacial bodies. We revisit basal seismicity of hard-bedded Alpine glaciers, which is not the result of pure stick-slip motion. Sudden changes in seismicity suggest that the local configuration of the subglacial drainage system undergoes changes on sub daily time scales. Accordingly, such observations place constraints on basal resistance and sliding of hard-bedded glaciers. In contrast, certain clusters of stick-slip dislocations associated with micro seismicity beneath the Greenland ice sheet undergo diurnal variations in magnitudes and inter event times. This is best explained with a soft till bed, which hosts the shear dislocations and whose strength varies in response to changes in subglacial water pressure. These results suggest that analysis of basal icequakes is well suited for characterizing glacier and ice sheet beds. Future studies should address the relative importance between \"smooth\" and seismogenic sliding in different glacial environments.",

            "abstract": "Day-to-night plasma transport and electron precipitation from the solar wind (SW) are two most likely sources for the Martian nightside ionosphere. Although Mars does not have a large-scale intrinsic magnetic field, the existence of the crustal magnetic field and the induced field associated with the SW/Mars interaction can affect the morphology and ion-dynamics of the Martian ionosphere considerably. As revealed from the magnetometer/electron reflectometer (MAG/ER), the most intense crustal magnetic fields at Mars are located in the Terra Sirenum region. Mini-magnetospheres can be formed by the crustal magnetic anomalies, which can shield the Martian ionosphere from the upstream solar wind flow. Strong horizontal magnetic field may favor the day-to-night plasma transport and hinder the electron precipitation and the vertical plasma diffusion. In the cusp-like regions where the magnetic field line is nearly vertical, the connection with interplanetary magnetic field can permit the precipitation of the SW and the energetic particles.\nHere, we use the MARSIS subsurface total electron content (TEC) data to study the role of day-to-night plasma transport in the Martian nightside ionosphere. As an extended work of Cui et al. (2015), we will study the effect of different crustal magnetic components on the transport process in the Time in Darkness (TD) domain. The Bx component points to the local north, By points to the local east, and Bz points to the nadir. It is supposed that eastward By term will enhance the day-to-night plasma transport, and vice verse for the westward By term. Constraining the observations in the strong crustal magnetic region of the southern hemisphere, we find that TEC generally maintains a higher value for By > 100 nT compared with By < -100 nT as the ionosphere is turning into the night. The opposite is found for the Bz component, and it may indicate that large vertical B-field can make the plasma diffuse up or down according to the direction of Bz, which further slow down the day-to-night transport and lead to lower TEC in the night. We also find that the maximum TD value is much larger for the southern hemisphere than that for the northern hemisphere. This indicates that the crustal magnetic field mainly located in the southern hemisphere helps to maintain the nighttime ionosphere. ",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis originating in South America are known to have affected Lyttelton Harbour, New Zealand, in the recent past. However, while there was clear evidence of inundation, in particular in 1960 and 2010, there was no report of any sand left behind. Our study aimed to search for evidence of these small historical tsunamis, in the absence of any visible sand layer. Shallow trenches revealed discontinuous layers of small grey mud clasts at various depths across the study area, most likely transported from the nearby harbour. The origin of these mud clast layers was investigated using sedimentological, geochemical and diatom analyses complemented by dating from 137Cs activity profiles and historical data. Subtle variations consistent with inclusions of marine mud such as a decrease in organic content and magnetic susceptibility and increases in geochemical markers (e.g. Ca, K, K/Rb, Si/Rb and Sr/Rb) were found in the sediment profile. Variations in diatom assemblages suggesting a marine influence were also recorded at similar depths, aligning with layers of mud clasts. Based on 137Cs activity profiles and historical data, these deposits were attributed to the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska tsunamis, and we also found evidence for an older deposit, possibly associated with the 1868 Arica tsunami. Sedimentary evidence for the 2010 Chile tsunami was not found at the study site, but our study revealed spatial variations in Ca, Cl and Sr concentrations that were inversely related to Ti concentrations. This was used to identify the landward extent of inundation by the 2010 event. We show that a broad multi-proxy analysis can distinguish even the subtle signatures of an inconspicuous deposit laid down by a small tsunami.",

The climatological monthly frequency of the NW Atlantic is on a normal distribution with a maximum in January, while it deviates from a normal distribution in the NW Pacific, in particular, the deviation is large in March.\nLow-level meridional temperature gradient decreases linearly from February to April in the Gulf stream region. However, the gradient is maintained through February to March to the east of Japan, and it sharply weakens in April. This feature is in good agreement with the climatological monthly frequency of the explosive cyclones in the two regions.\nThe difference in the seasonal change of the low-level meridional temperature gradient in the two regions is caused by the positional relation of the gradient and continents. In particular, the difference of warmed area in the eastern part of the Eurasian and the North American continents causes the difference of the low-level meridional temperature gradient, and it causes the difference in the climatological monthly frequency of the explosive cyclones between the two regions from February to April.",

            "abstract": "The low-energy and dense plasma originated from the ionosphere has often been observed in the dayside magnetosphere and may play an important role in the dynamics of the dayside magnetopause. We present a statistical study of the plasmaspheric plumes and the ionospheric outflows observed by the Cluster spacecraft near the dayside magnetopause from 2007 to 2009. The plasmaspheric plumes were identified by the low-energy ions (< 1 keV) which have 90° pitch angle distributions from the CIS/HIA instrument onboard Cluster in the magnetosphere. The ionospheric outflows were characterized by uni- or bi-directional field-aligned pitch angle distributions with low-energy ions observed in the dayside magnetosphere. 43 (10%) plasmaspheric plume events and 32 (7%) ionospheric outflow events were detected during 442 dayside magnetopause crossings. The occurrence rate of the plume at the duskside is significantly higher than that at the dawnside, indicating that the plasmaspheric plumes may lead to a dawn-dusk asymmetry of the dayside reconnection. The occurrence rate of the outflow shows a weak dawn-dusk asymmetry. We investigated how the plasmaspheric plume and ionospheric outflow’s occurrence rates depend on geomagnetic activity and solar wind/IMF conditions. It is found that the plume events prefer to occur during moderate geomagnetic activity (Kp = 3, -30 ≤ Dst < -10 nT), while the ionospheric outflow events do not occur when Kp = 0 and their occurrence rate does not have a clear Dst dependence. It is also found that the plume events tend to occur during southward IMF (duskward solar wind electric field). In contrast, the ionospheric outflows prefer to occur during northward IMF (dawnward solar wind electric field). Finally, the occurrence rates of both plumes and outflows increase with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure.",

            "abstract": "We have carried out laboratory experiments to study the generation of granular flows on the slopes of pyroclastic cones that are experiencing volcanic tremor or tectonic earthquakes. These experiments are inspired by the occurrence of granular flows on the flanks of Mount Vesuvius during its 1944 eruption. Our laboratory model consists of sand cones built around a vibrating tube which represents a volcanic conduit with erupting magma inside. A video camera allows the study of the granular flow inception, movement and deposition. Although the collapse of the entire cone is obtained at a specific resonance frequency, individual granular flows can be generated by all the vibration frequencies and all the vibration amplitudes that our experimental apparatus has allowed us to adopt. We believe that this is due to the fact that the energy threshold to generate the flows is small in value. Therefore, if this is true in nature as well, shaken pyroclastic cones are always potentially dangerous because they can easily generate flows that can strike the surrounding areas.",

            "abstract": "Typically, low- to moderate-temperature geothermal resources are more effectively used for direct heat energy applications. However, due to high thermal losses during transport, direct use requires that the heat resource is located near the user. Alternatively, we show here that if such a low-temperature geothermal resource is combined with an additional or secondary energy resource, the power production is increased compared to the sum from two separate (geothermal and secondary fuel) power plants (DiPippo et al. 1978) and the thermal losses are minimized because the thermal energy is utilized where it is produced. Since Adams et al. (2015) found that using CO2 as a subsurface working fluid produces more net power than brine at low- to moderate-temperature geothermal resource conditions, we compare over a range of parameters the net power and efficiencies of hybrid geothermal power plants that use brine or CO2 as the subsurface working fluid, that are then heated further with a secondary energy source that is unspecified here. Parameters varied include the subsurface working fluid (brine vs. CO2), geothermal reservoir depth (2.5-4.5 km), and turbine inlet temperature (200-600°C) after auxiliary heating. The hybrid power plant is numerically modeled using an iterative coupling approach of TOUGH2-ECO2N/ECO2H (Pruess, 2004) for simulation of the subsurface reservoir and Engineering Equation Solver for well bore fluid flow and surface power plant performance. We find that hybrid power plants that are CO2-based (subsurface) systems have higher thermal efficiencies than the brine based systems at low turbine inlet temperatures. Specifically, our results indicate that geothermal hybrid plants that are CO2-based are more efficient than brine-based systems when the contribution of the geothermal resource energy is higher than 48%.",

            "abstract": "Land use/cover change (LULCC) can significantly alter energy and water balance partitioning, which can affect surface and atmospheric temperatures and ultimately local and regional climate. The LULCC models used for large-area applications have limitations that may obscure the importance of land-energy-water coupling and feedbacks. Here, we present an empirical method to overcome some of these obstacles: biophysical and socioeconomic data are used to map LULCC through time on a continuous (annual) basis in Kenya. The model will be calibrated and validated using area frame samples and several geospatial datasets that are open access and available throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This ensures the approach can be used to develop LULCC maps in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The area frame samples have dimensions of 5 x 5 km and were developed from extensive field surveys and aerial photos taken in major agricultural regions of Kenya in 1983, 1985, 2013. A total of 2,178 frames were generated and include the percentage of 21 crop-specific land cover types and 24 additional land uses per frame, yielding a total of 45 land use/cover variables. Forty-three static and dynamic (annually-changing) predictor variables (“drivers of change”) were collected and averaged so that each area frame corresponded to a single predictor variable. Dynamic data consisted of 1) Bioclim temperature variables derived from the Princeton University Terrestrial Hydrology Group’s high resolution climate reanalysis dataset for East Africa; 2) Bioclim precipitation variables derived from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS); 3) phenology derived from the non-linear harmonic regression of the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System Normalized Difference Vegetation Index product (NDVI3g); and 4) population density derived from the United Nations Environmental Program African Population Distribution Database. Given the large number of land use/cover types and predictor variables, partial least squares regression will be used for data reduction, while decision trees will be used to generate maps of LULCC in Kenya from 1983-2013.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircon studies have become the tool of choice to address a wide range of geological questions including basin evolution, geodynamic setting, paleogeographic reconstructions, and determining source-sink relationships. However, grain destruction during transportation may be critical in understanding the detrital zircon record, yet it has not been explored in detail. In the magmatic crystallization environment zircon crystal shape is effectively a function of the magma chemistry and temperature.\nWe address to what extent the zircon population represents an artefact of preservation, or a meaningful record of the magmatic events within the source terrain. We use image analysis of previously SIMS U-Pb dated zircon crystals to quantify how zircon grain shapes relate to the chemical composition of magmatic and detrital zircon crystals. We achieve this by testing the correlation between shape factors and the uranium, thorium content, apparent alpha dose, and isotopic signature of individual zircons with statistical methods.\nWe focus our investigation on two different areas of Western Australia: (1) the Archean of the Yilgarn Craton and (2) the Proterozoic of the Musgrave Province, and their associated Proterozoic basin sediments:\n(1) The Yilgarn craton represents a Neoarchean amalgamation of c. 3.8 Ga and 2.6 Ga granite-greenstone belts including a variety of gneisses, metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock formations, and granites. Along the northern edge of the craton a series of four Proterozoic basins, with variable tectonic and metamorphic overprinting overlay this basement.\n(2) The West Musgrave Province consists of an east-west trending Meso- to Neoproterozoic belt dominated by granites and volcanics deformed by several major orogenic events between c. 1.35 Ga and 350 Ma. Based on age and Hf isotopic relationships the bedrock of the Musgrave Province is the source for the Neoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous Amadeus Basin to its north.\nUsing rigorous statistical techniques in a coherent approach across all samples, we show quantitatively whether the zircon shape distribution in sediments is similar to the magmatic population of the inferred basement. We propose that by taking into account grain shape distributions we have a better control on the representativeness of the detrital zircon record.",

The effect of wildfire on karst processes remains poorly understood. We provide a unique analysis of the effects of an intense wildfire on δ18O composition and solute concentrations of dripwater in a shallow cave, at a forested site in southwest Australia. By determining the local controls on dripwater chemistry, i.e. vegetation cover, evapotranspiration and carbonate mineral reactions, we determine a cave dripwater signature for wildfires in semi-arid regions. The dripwater response to the wildfire is clearest in the combined δ18O and Cl signature due to increased evaporation, and decreased transpiration in the case of Cl. Other solutes such as Mg, Sr and Ca strengthen this argument when coupled with δ18O over this time period. In fact our fire response from 18O shows an approx. 2‰ increase equivalent to some of the greatest changes seen in the Quaternary record. This highlights the significance of multi–year signatures that could be mistakenly interpreted as climate variability especially when combined with other proxies that would also be affected by fire, such as speleothem growth rate. Furthermore, the potential preservation of δ18O and Ca (as a growth rate determinant) in speleothems, combined with trace elements (Mg, Sr, Cl to a lesser extent), opens a new avenue for paleo-fire records.",

            "abstract": "The study of arc magmas most often stumbles on deciphering both the nature and the composition of the subduction components involved in magma genesis. In Ecuador, the subduction of the Carnegie ridge, appears as a key parameter accounting for the temporal chemical changes highlighted in the quaternary lavas, whose composition shifted from calc-alkaline to adakitic [1-3]. Moreover, the adakitic signature is only observed in an area located above the Carnegie ridge subduction [4, 5]. Re-Os and Pb isotopic compositions of lavas from the Pichincha volcano were investigated, in order to document the nature and origin of this transition. The Pichincha Volcanic Complex consists of (1) an ancient, eroded edifice (the Rucu, 1.1-0.15 Ma), and (2) a younger edifice (Guagua, 60-11 ka). This structural evolution is correlated with significant variations of trace element abundances, mainly reflecting major processes of magmatic mixtures [1, 2].\nIn addition to Pichincha lavas, we also analysed the subducted oceanic basalts and sediments (Amadeus campaign), as well as samples of the Pichincha basement. In a 187Os/188Os vs. 1/Os diagram, Pichincha basalts define a positive trend ranging between an unradiogenic Os component (i.e., peridotitic mantle) and a radiogenic basaltic Os component with low Os content, which is consistent with Carnegie ridge basalt composition. On another hand, the sediments and basement samples plot away from this trend, indicating that crustal contamination contribution remained insignificant. This conclusion is also supported by the low 207Pb/204Pb ratios in the Guagua compared to Rucu lavas. Finally, in the Guagua lavas, the high 187Os/188Os ratios positively correlate with the adakitic character (high Sr/Y and La/Yb).\n[1] Samaniego S. et al.

            "abstract": "The concept of the Anthropocene has created a profound paradigm shift within the scientific community that we argue will create equally important changes in philosophy, history and politics. There is general scientific agreement that human activity has been a geologically recent, yet profound, influence on the Earth System. The magnitude, variety and longevity of human-induced changes, to the lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and atmosphere suggests that we should refer to the present, not as within the Holocene Epoch (as it is currently formally referred to), but instead as within the Anthropocene Epoch. Discussion is now centred on defining the start of the epoch using the fundamental principles of stratigraphy. These must include (i) a near permanent change to the Earth system that sets it on to a new trajectory and (ii) global changes to the Earth system recorded in a number of stratigraphic deposits worldwide to provide a correlative boundary event or marker called a Global Stratotype Section & Point (GSSP) or ‘golden spike’. Using this framework we conclude that just two time-periods are likely adhere to the criteria. These are 1) the irreversible cross-ocean exchange of species alongside the globally synchronous coolest part of the Little Ice Age in the 17th century, marked by the 1610 minima of CO2 (Orbis Spike), and 2) the accelerating atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial changes in the second half of the 20th century, referred to as the Great Acceleration and conveniently marked by the 1964 peak radionuclide fallout (Bomb Spike). We seek to clear up misconceptions and misunderstandings about geological criteria and relevant evidence that have crept into the literature. We also argue that there are multiple definitions of the Anthropocene and even if a formal definition of the Anthropocene Epoch is agreed by geoscientists, this would in no way invalidate other definitions or uses. It is the utility and wide appeal that makes the Anthropocene such an important concept.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data are routinely used to provide qualitative insights about the main lithologies and the distribution of soil moisture in the critical zone. Quantitative hydrogeophysical inferences of critical zone properties and processes are much more challenging because of the multitude of interacting physical, biological and chemical gradients that may affect the geophysical measurement response. In this context, it is essential to incorporate the geophysical data within a wider modeling framework that centers on a conceptual model that describes the properties and processes under study together with appropriate boundary conditions. Based on recent groundwater applications, I describe how it is now possible to build geologically meaningful realizations of subsurface structure using multiple-point statistics (MPS) and to make uncertainty estimates. I will demonstrate conditioning of MPS simulations to geophysical tomograms, inclusion of summary statistics derived from MPS simulations within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion, and full MPS MCMC inversion based on fast (speed-up of 40 times) model proposal algorithms that we have adapted from computer vision. For future applications in the critical zone, I suggest that MPS simulations should be used to derive and perturb primary lithological properties and that biological, chemical, and hydrological state variables (given appropriate boundary conditions) are subsequently simulated using domain-specific algorithms. The geophysical data (an individual snap shot or time-series) are then used to guide the model update of the primary properties (and nuisance parameters such as petrophysical parameters) that in turn influence the predicted state variables and their associated fluxes. Instead of classical parameter estimation, I argue that it is often more appropriate to focus on model selection, in which alternative conceptual models of the subsurface are compared and ranked given the available data.",

Direct estimates via eddy covariance have been attempted by only a handful of studies, most of which measured only the total number flux, or achieved rather coarse size segregation. Applying eddy covariance to the measurement of sea-spray fluxes is challenging: most instrumentation must be located in a laboratory space requiring long sample lines to an inlet collocated with a sonic anemometer; however, larger particles are easily lost to the walls of the sample line. Marine particle concentrations are generally low, requiring a high sample volume to achieve adequate statistics. The highly hygroscopic nature of sea salt means particles change size rapidly with fluctuations in relative humidity; this introduces an apparent bias in flux measurements if particles are sized at ambient humidity.\nThe Compact Lightweight Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (CLASP) was developed specifically to make high rate measurements of aerosol size distributions for use in eddy covariance measurements, and the instrument and data processing and analysis techniques have been refined over the course of several projects. Here we will review some of the issues and limitations related to making eddy covariance measurements of the sea spray source flux over the open ocean, summarise some key results from the last decade, and present new results from a 3-year long ship-based measurement campaign as part of the WAGES project. Finally we will consider requirements for future progress.",

The sensitivity of precipitation and the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation to uncertain historical aerosol emission fluxes and aerosol-cloud parametrisations are quantified and their climatic importance considered. The predictability of monsoon onset and intensity, position of the inter-tropical convergence zone, tropical storm frequency and intensity, heat transport to the Arctic and changes in the mode of the El Niño Southern Oscillation are all limited by the parametric uncertainties examined here. Precipitation and aerosol-cloud radiative forcing sensitivities are found to be both spatially and temporally heterogeneous.

            "abstract": "The representation of exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere still reveals significant model limitations in explaining temporal and spatial variability. Despite agreement between models for contemporaneous periods, prognostic simulations reveal a strong between-model divergence regarding the role of the land surface in the global carbon cycle. The integration of multiple data-streams in inverse modelling approaches for parameterization and model evaluation, ultimately leads to model improvement. Here we explore multiple-constraint approaches ranging from in situ to regional and global spatial scales. Constraints include stocks and fluxes of water and carbon. We show that integrating multiple datasets contributes to a better representation of ecosystem dynamics in different models, from forest and dynamic vegetation models to land surface schemes. At site scale, model-data comparisons reveal substantial differences in the modelled temporal dynamics of carbon stocks and turnover times and their relationships with climate, especially at annual scales. Inter-annual variability remains a problem for all models, even after parameter optimization. At regional and global scales, the integration of multiple data-streams to constrain albedo, phenology and primary productivity patterns yields a significant improvement in regional simulations of vegetation dynamics, from seasons to longer-term trends. The role of environmental controls and vegetation dynamics in explaining recent trends in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 is evaluated using an improved dynamic vegetation model. We conclude by identifying major challenges in model-data-integration: to explore the information content in longer time series; avoid confounding effects of missing processes on parameter estimation; set up cost functions for multivariate-data integration; quantification of uncertainties arising from data bias, model structure, and initial conditions; and test modelling concepts (e.g. PFTs) to guide development of new principles. These challenges emphasize the importance and value of integrating multivariate/multi-temporal information in Earth System models for an enhanced understanding and description of the terrestrial carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are increasingly at risk from climate change with negative impacts predicted for human health, the economy and ecosystems. These risks require responses from cities, to improve the resilience of their infrastructure, economy and environment to climate change. Policymakers need to understand what is already being spent on adaptation so that they can make more effective and comprehensive adaptation plans. Through the measurement of spend in the newly defined ‘Adaptation Economy’ we analysis the current efforts of 10 global megacities in adapting to climate change. These cities were chosen based on their size, geographical location and their developmental status. The cities are London, Paris, New York, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Beijing, Mumbai, Jakarta, Lagos and Addis Ababa. It is important to study a range of cities in different regions of the world, with different climates and at different states of socio-economic development. While in economic terms, disaster losses from weather, climate and geophysical events are greater in developed countries, fatalities and economic losses as a proportion of GDP are higher in developing countries. In all cities examined the Adaptation Economy is still a small part of the overall economy accounting for a maximum of 0.3% of the Cities total GDP (GDPc). The differences in total spend are significant between cities in developed and rapidly emerging countries, compared to those in developing countries with a spend ranging from £16 million to £1,500 million. Comparing key sub sectors, we demonstrate that there are distinctive adaptation profiles with developing cities having a higher relative spend on health, while developed cities have a higher spend on disaster preparedness, ICT and professional services. Comparing spend per capita and as a percentage of GDPc demonstrates even more clearly disparities between the cities in the study; developing country cities spend half as much as a proportion of GPCc in some cases, and significantly less per capita. This is a clear warning sign as to whether enough is being done to adapt in major population centres in developing and emerging economies.",

            "abstract": "For the last 10 years, the Cassini RADAR has been exploring Saturn’s moon Titan, the only planetary body besides Earth whose surface presently exhibits significant accumulations of liquids in the forms of lakes and seas. In particular, the passive Radiometer that is incorporated in this instrument has been recording the 2.2 cm-wavelength thermal emission from Titan’s three seas. Radiometry observations provide new information beyond the active radar reflection data. In this paper, we analyze the radiometry observations collected from Feb. 2007 to July 2013 over one of these seas, Ligeia Mare, with the goal of providing constrains on its liquid composition, seafloor nature, bathymetry, and dynamics. In light of the two-layer model we have developed for this analysis, we find that the dielectric constant of the sea liquid is most likely smaller than 1.8, suggesting that the composition of Ligeia Mare is dominated by liquid methane rather than liquid ethane (although a ternary methane-ethane-nitrogen mixture cannot be ruled out). This result is further supported by the value we infer for the liquid loss tangent of 3-5×10-5. This value is in agreement with the one first published by Mastrogiuseppe et al. (2014) based on active radar observation. A high methane concentration suggests that Ligeia Mare is either a sea from which ethane has been removed by crustal interaction, or a sea primarely fed by methane-rich precipitation, or both. For the seafloor, a dielectric constant of 2.6-2.9±0.9 is determined. Though this result is not very constraining, we favor a scenario where the floor of Ligeia Mare is covered by a sludge of compacted and possibly nitrile-rich organic material formed by the deposition of photochemical haze or by rain-washing of the nearby shores. These results are then used to convert the radiometry mosaic of Ligeia Mare into a qualitative low-resolution bathymetry map. Lastly, we establish limits on the physical temperature variation of the sea between Feb. 2007 to July 2013, namely less than 2 K, providing a constraint on the relative amounts of solar heating and evaporative cooling currently being explored in ocean circulation models.",

            "abstract": "Consistent and efficient analysis of both real-time volcano seismology data and of data catalogues from key eruptions is important to characterise seismicity surrounding eruptions and to determine patterns of volcanic behaviour. Seismicity patterns can be characterised by a variety of metrics, such as spectral analysis, identification of repeating waveform families and event classification, and temporal changes in these seismicity patterns can indicate changes in volcanic behaviour. Data catalogues from key eruptions can be large, and during seismic crises real-time monitoring of volcano seismicity can be overwhelming. This highlights the need for simple, rapid and effective analysis of such datasets, however, large-scale or rapid analysis of this type has been hindered by computational limitations associated with cross-correlation of large datasets and the labour intensive nature of waveform classification. Consistent waveform classification remains a challenge during both real-time analysis and retrospective analysis. In real-time many events are classified by an analyst, but during seismic crises there may be hundreds to thousands of events to analyse per day and this can rapidly become unfeasible. Automated classification allows consistent classification of waveforms but often requires an extensive training period. We have developed a fast-approximation method, peakmatch, to cross-correlate large seismic data catalogues for rapid analysis of repeating waveforms, and we use machine-learning techniques to automatically classify seismic waveforms with minimal training data.",

These can be purely esthetic but are often linked to some kind of biotic recovery or the provision of important ecosystem services such as flood control or self-purification. The social setting of restoration projects, with a range of potential conflicts, significantly reduces scale of most interventions to a size with little room, or wish, for natural processes. We show that projects sizes are still very small and that the restoration target is not to recover natural geomorphic processes but rather to fulfil human perception of what a nice stream looks like. One case from Danish lowland streams, using a space-for-time substitution approach, shows excess use of pebble and gravel when restoring channelized sandy bottom streams, de-coupling the link between energy and substrate characteristics that are found in natural lowland systems. This has implication for both the biological structure and functioning of these systems as a direct link between substrate heterogeneity and macroinvertebrate diversity was not found in restored streams, while the density of grazer increased indicating an increased use of periphyton as a basal resource. Another case of adding woody debris to UK lowland streams, using a BACI study design, showed very little effect on the macroinvertebrate community even after a 100-year flood, which indicate that added tree trunks did not provide additional flow refugia. We suggest that restoration schemes should aim at restoring the natural physical structural complexity in the streams and at the same time enhance the possibility of re-generating the natural geomorphological processes sustaining the habitats in streams and rivers.",

            "abstract": "Land surface processes play an important role in East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), and its parameterization schemes may cause uncertainty of dynamic downscaling in regional climate model (RCM) for EASM. In this study we investigated the sensitivity of RCM to land surface parameterization (LSP) schemes for long-term simulations of EASM. Simulations for 22-year EASM using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model coupled with four different LSP schemes (Noah-MP, CLM4, Pleim-Xiu and SSiB; Four simulations are named Sim-Noah, Sim-CLM, Sim-PX and Sim-SSiB respectively) were conducted. The 22-year averaged spatial distribution and intensity of downscaling large-scale circulation, precipitation and 2-m temperature were compared with ERA-Interim/ observations. Results show that the downscaling ability of RCM for EASM is sensitive to LSP scheme. Furthermore, RCM does add more information than reanalysis/GCM-products. And Sim-PX and Sim-SSiB show closer to observation than Sim-Noah and Sim-CLM for monsoon precipitation and 2-m temperature. To clarify the physical and dynamic mechanisms of the sensitivity, the differences of energy budgets and their atmospheric effects between Ens-Noah-CLM (ensemble mean averaging Sim-Noah and Sim-CLM) and Ens-PX-SSiB (ensemble mean averaging Sim-PX and Sim-SSiB) were compared. We found that the intensity of SH flux over Asian continent in Ens-Noah-CLM is stronger than that in Ens-PX-SSiB, which induces the higher tropospheric temperature over land. The land-sea thermal contrast will be influenced. Then the adaptive modulation of GHT gradients affects wind flow (through geostrophic balance), especially at lower-level. As a result, the simulation of large-scale circulation, monsoon precipitation and 2-m temperature are influenced accordingly.",

Differences in latitude and specific climate conditions lead to strong contrasts in snowpack duration and accumulation, but also in the contribution of the various components of energy and mass balance of the snowpacks. Such differences lead also to different sensitivities to increasing temperature when snowpack is simulated for different warming scenarios. Mountain areas located at lower elevation and southernmost latitude are noticeably more sensitive to climate warming than others where currently accumulates a thicker and long lasting snowpack. Results clearly inform that projected changes on snowpack and hydrology of mountain areas for the future are not only dependent on the magnitude of simulated climate under different emission scenarios, but also on the differences of snowpack characteristics that is currently found when different mountains are compared. Thus, results highlight the need of more intercomparison exercises across mountainous regions of the world to better understand climate change impacts on mountain hydrology.",

During deformation, both seismic wave speeds and permeability decrease with increasing strain, due to the growth of sub-vertical microcracks and inelastic porosity reduction. During the static hold period under water-satured conditions, the seismic wave speeds recovered gradually, typically by around 5% (relative to their initial value) after two days, while permeability remained constant. The recovery in wave speed increases with increasing confining pressure, but decreases with increasing applied differential stress. The recovery is markedly lower when the samples are saturated with an inert fluid as opposed to water. The evolution in wave speed is interpreted quantitatively in terms of microcrack density, which shows that the post-deformation recovery is associated with an decrease in effective microcrack length, typically of the order to 10% after two days. The proposed mechanism for the observed damage recovery is microcrack closure due to a combination of backsliding on wing cracks driven by time-dependent friction and closure due to pressure-solution at contacts between propping particles or asperities and microcrack walls. The recovery rates observed in the experiments, and the proposed underlying mechanisms, are compatible with seismological observations of seismic wave speed recovery along faults following earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Most sophisticated probable maximum flood (PMF) estimations derive the PMF from the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) by applying deterministic hydrologic models calibrated with observed data. This method is based on the assumption that the hydrological system is stationary, meaning that the system behaviour during the calibration period or the calibration event is presumed to be the same as it is during the PMF. However, as soon as a catchment-specific threshold is reached, the system is no longer stationary. At or beyond this threshold, retention areas, new flow paths, and changing runoff processes can strongly affect downstream peak discharge. These effects can be accounted for by coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, a technique that is particularly promising when the expected peak discharge may considerably exceed the observed maximum discharge. In such cases, the coupling of hydrologic and hydraulic models has the potential to significantly increase the physical plausibility of PMF estimations. This procedure ensures both that the estimated extreme peak discharge does not exceed the physical limit based on riverbed capacity and that the dampening effect of inundation processes on peak discharge is considered.\nOur study discusses the prospect of considering retention effects on PMF estimations by coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models. This method is tested by forcing PREVAH, a semi-distributed deterministic hydrological model, with randomly generated, physically plausible extreme precipitation patterns. The resulting hydrographs are then used to externally force the hydraulic model BASEMENT-ETH (riverbed in 1D, potential inundation areas in 2D). Finally, the PMF estimation results obtained using the coupled modelling approach are compared to the results obtained using ordinary hydrologic modelling.",

            "abstract": "Along the steep flanks of the southern Central Andes (eastern margin of the Puna Plateau), fluvial fill terraces preserve archives of landscape response to climate change over millennial timescales. These archives record information about past erosion and aggradation rates, erosion processes, and even paleoclimate. In the Humahuaca Basin of NW Argentina, our 29 new optically stimulated luminescence ages of late Pleistocene fill terrace sediments demonstrate that past river aggradation occurred over different intervals on the west and east sides of the valley. On the west side, aggradation coincided with periods of increasing intensity of the South American Monsoon System and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (increasing precipitation), while on the east side, aggradation coincided with periods of decreasing intensities of both systems (decreasing precipitation) or with more variable conditions. Denudation rates and grain-size dependencies from 70 new cosmogenic 10Be analyses reveal that landslides were more important during periods of increasing precipitation compared to today. On the west side of the valley, a sudden pulse of sediment led to aggradation near the intersection with the trunk stream. In contrast, on the east side, the pulse of sediment likely blocked the narrow bedrock gorges that characterize those catchments, leading to temporary sediment storage in upstream perched basins; sediment evacuation into the main valley occurred preferentially during periods of decreasing precipitation and fewer landslides. Different levels of fluvial connectivity to the trunk stream for the western and eastern catchments within the Humahuaca Basin produces heterogeneity in the locus of aggradation and the timing of sediment movement through the system. Hence, for larger basins that integrate sub-basins with differing geometries or degrees of connectivity, sedimentary responses to climate forcing are likely to be attenuated.",

            "abstract": "In the perspective of the future CMIP exercise, turbulent Ocean Global Circulation Models (at about 1/4° resolution) are progressively replacing laminar OGCMs (2° to 1°) in ocean-atmosphere coupled systems. Unlike in laminar models, a substantial intrinsic and chaotic variability spontaneously emerges in turbulent OGCMs under climatological forcing, cascading up to multidecadal timescales.\nTo which extent may this chaotic low-frequency intrinsic variability (LFIV) be modified or paced by an interannually-varying atmosphere ? The objective of the OCCIPUT project is to perform an ensemble of 50 global 1/4˚ ocean hindcasts (1958-2014) driven by the same reanalyzed atmospheric forcing, after perturbation of their initial conditions. This ensemble provides the first opportunity to extract and study both the intrinsic and the forced components of the oceanic variability, and to measure the actual constraint exerted by the atmosphere on this variability.\nWe have analyzed a smaller regional ensemble hindcast (10 members, 20 years) run over the North Atlantic as a \"pilot experiment\" and we will illustrate the imprint of the LFIV, and compare its amplitude with the atmospherically-forced variability, on various ocean quantities relevant for the climate system: Sea-Surface Height (SSH) and Temperature (SST), Heat-Content and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We find that:\n- in the turbulent areas like the Gulf Stream, the intrinsic part of the variability on interannual timescales dominates the variability driven by the atmosphere,\n- for a basin-wide integrated quantity like the AMOC, at 26.5N, the intrinsic variability is about 30 % of the magnitude of the forced variability on interannual timescales.\nSome preliminary results will also be presented from the first years of the global 50-member ensemble which is currently being performed.",

The Solar2000 EUV (extreme ultraviolet) flux model, neutral atmosphere model (NRLMSISE-00), latest transition probabilities and updated reaction rate coefficients are incorporated in the present model. Three geomagnetic storms of varying intensities (strong, moderate and weak) are used in the present study. The volume emission rates of 732.0 nm dayglow emission are calculated for each storm at Tirunelveli (8.70N, 77.80E). A negative correlation is found between the volume emission rate (VER) and the Dst index for all the three geomagnetic storms. The present study also shows that the relative variation of VER with respect to the initial value of VER (before the onset of a geomagnetic storm) during the main phase increases above 260 km. A positive correlation is found between the zenith intensity of 732.0 nm dayglow emission and the atomic oxygen number density. Further, the atomic oxygen number densities obtained from the NRLMSISE-00 model during a geomagnetic storm are compared with the measurements. It is found that the atomic oxygen number densities given by NRLMSISE-00 model are significantly lower than the measured values. Consequently, the atomic oxygen number density in the present model is varied under the limit of measurements to study its effect on 732.0 nm dayglow emission. An increase of more than 50% in the zenith intensity above the normal level (before the onset of the storm) is found when the atomic oxygen number density is doubled in the model.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial biosphere models are necessary to project the integrated effects of processes and feedbacks on the climate system in 100 years. A tension exists between the representation of ecosystem processes in terrestrial biosphere models, which must be necessarily coarse, and the overwhelming complexity of processes that empiricists observe in the natural world. Working together, modelers and empiricists can diffuse this tension by targeting the experiments and observations needed to resolve model uncertainty. I have learned a few lessons in the recent realm of model-experiment interaction ‘Mod-Ex’: (1) Complaining about ‘bad’ or unrealistic representation of processes in models is unhelpful. Modelers are already in a position where they need to have expertise in any number of disciplines; no one person can be an expert in all. Instead, we (empirical scientists) need to proactively provide the information needed for model parameters and processes. This may require a global database. (2) Model needs are nearly always broader than narrow empirical questions. What ecologists might think of as ‘the boring background information’—meteorology, soil processes, site history—are all necessary to put important ecological processes in a modeling context. (3) Data collected to inform the model is more meaningful if it considers the way that models necessarily function (e.g., reaching an equilibrium state before projection into the future can begin). For example, the SPRUCE experiment was designed as a regression design, rather than an ANOVA design, to allow for models to predict response thresholds, rather than the experiment providing a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. (4) Empiricists have an important role to play in guiding and provide constraints on scaling their small-scale measurements to the temporal and spatial scales needed for large-scale global models. This interaction will be facilitated by a move to trait-based modeling, which seeks to capture the variation within a system rather than mean responses, and allows the development of predictive trade-offs between certain traits, and relationships between traits and environment.",

            "abstract": "Glacier and ice sheet mass balance is determined by climatic surface balance, which is the difference between snowfall and runoff, and ice dynamics, which governs iceberg discharge. Crevasses can influence both the climatic surface balance and ice dynamic components of glacier and ice sheet mass balance. We review the observational evidence for the notion of mutually exclusive “low” and “high” advection crevasse lifecycles. In the low advection lifecycle, crevasses are interpreted to be in highly transient equilibrium with their local stress fields at all times. In the high advection lifecycle, crevasses are interpreted to be out of equilibrium with their local stress fields during advection between upstream opening and downstream closing areas. We suggest that the notion of a high advection lifecycle, typically inferred for transverse crevasses in apparent non-equilibrium with their local stress field, generally results from failure to account for the rotation in crevasse geometry introduced by appreciable local tearing (mode III fracture). We therefore favor the notion that crevasses are always in equilibrium with their local stress field. We also review the observational evidence and theoretical support for ten distinct crevasse-related processes that influence surface mass balance and ice dynamics (see Figure). One of these processes is a crevasse-rheology-deformation feedback, whereby an increase in crevasse extent contributes to enhanced cryo-hydrologic warming and hydraulic weakening, which in turn contributes to an increase in deformational velocity and further increase in crevasse extent. We discuss this potential feedback in the context of recent observations at Jakobshavn Isbrae, West Greenland, as well as in the content of the end-member scenario of thermal-viscous collapse of the Greenland ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrological systems evolve spontaneously in response to geologic, hydroclimate and biodiversity drivers. The stability and resilience of these systems to multiple disturbances can be addressed over specific temporal extents, potentially embedded within long term transience in response to geologic or climate change. The limits of ecohydrological resilience of system state in terms of vegetation canopy and soil catenae and the space/time distribution of water, carbon and nutrient cycling is determined by a set of critical feedbacks and potential substitutions of plant functional forms in response to disturbance. The ability of forest systems to return to states functionally similar to states prior to major disturbance, or combinations of multiple disturbances, is a critical question given increasing hydroclimate extremes, biological invasions, and human disturbance. Over the past century, forest landscape ecological patterns appear to have the ability to recover from significant disturbance and re-establish similar hydrological and ecological function in humid, biodiverse regions such as the southern Appalachians, and potentially drier forest ecosystems. Understanding and prediction of past and future long term dynamics requires explicit representation of spatial and temporal feedbacks and dependencies between hydrological, ecosystem and geomorphic processes, and the spatial pattern of species or plant functional type (PFT). Comprehensive models of watershed ecohydrological resilience requires careful balance between the level of process and parameter detail between the interacting components, relative to the structure, organization, space and time scales of the landscape.",

            "abstract": "Ghana is the second largest producer of cocoa (Theobroma cacoa), exporting approximately 18 percent of global volumes. These cocoa farms are predominantly small-scale, ranging in size from 2-4 hectares (ha). Traditionally, the model of cocoa expansion in Ghana relied on clearing new areas of forest and establishing a farm under remnant forest trees. This is increasingly less practical due to few unprotected forest areas remaining and management practices favoring close to full sun cocoa to maximize short-term yields. This study is part of a larger project, ECOLMITS, which is an interdisciplinary, ESPA-funded\n[1]\ninitiative exploring the ecological limits of ecosystem system services (ESS) for alleviating poverty in small-scale agroforestry systems. The ecological study plots are situated within and around the Kakum National Forest, a well-protected, moist-evergreen forest of the Lower Guinea Forest region.\nNet primary productivity (NPP) is a measure of the rate at which carbon dioxide (CO2) is incorporated into plant tissues (e.g. canopy, stem and root). For this study, NPP was monitored in situ using methods developed by the Global Environmental Monitoring Network (GEM, http://gem.tropicalforests.ox.ac.uk/). By comparing NPP measured in intact forest and farms, the human appropriated NPP (HANPP) of this system can be estimated. The forest measures provide the “potential” NPP of the region, and then the reduction in NPP for farm plots is calculated for both land-cover change (HANPPLUC) and cocoa harvesting (HANPPHARV). The results presented are of the first year of NPP measurements across the cocoa landscape, including measurements from intact forest, logged forest and cocoa farms across a shade gradient and located at varying distances from the forest edge (e.g. 100 m, 500 m, 1 km and 5 km). These measures will have implications for carbon sequestration potential over the region and long-term sustainability of the Ghanaian cocoa sector.\n\n[1] Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation grant program, http://www.espa.ac.uk/",

            "abstract": "The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), a quasi-periodic oscillation of the stratospheric equatorial zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies, is known to affect the stratospheric circulation and transfer anomalies downward into the troposphere via a modulation of the winter polar vortex. However, the exact mechanism(s) governing this remain unclear. In this study, wave-mean-flow interactions associated with this effect, the so-called Holton-Tan effect (HTE), are studied using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Significant evidence of the HTE in isentropic coordinates is found, with a weaker and warmer polar vortex present when the lower stratospheric QBO is in its easterly phase (QBOe). For the first time, we quantify the QBO modulation of wave propagation, wave-mean-flow interaction and wave decay/growth via a calculation of potential vorticity (PV)-based measures, the zonal-mean momentum budget and up/down-gradient eddy PV fluxes. Stratosphere-troposphere coupling is also investigated with particular focus on the effect of the tropospheric subtropical jet on QBO modulation of the wave activity. In the subtropical to midlatitude lower stratosphere, QBOe is associated with an enhanced upward flux of wave activity across the tropopause, and corresponding wave convergence and wave growth, which leads to a stronger zonal-mean Brewer-Dobson Circulation and consequently a warmer polar region. In the middle stratosphere, QBOe is associated with increased poleward wave propagation, leading to enhanced wave convergence and in-situ wave growth at high latitudes and contributing to the weaker polar vortex. In agreement with recent studies, our results suggest that the critical-line effect cannot fully account for the wave anomalies associated with the HTE. Instead, it is suggestive of a new, additional mechanism that hinges on the QBO-induced meridional circulation effect on the latitudinal positioning of the subtropical jet. Under QBOe, the QBO-induced meridional circulation causes a poleward shift of the subtropical jet, encouraging more waves to propagate into the stratosphere at midlatitudes.",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is one of the most ubiquitous geological processes in the Solar System and has had a significant influence on the geological evolution of Mars. Unlike the Moon and Mercury, the Martian impact cratering record is notably diverse, which is interpreted to reflect interactions during the impact process with target volatiles and/or the atmosphere. The Earth also possesses a volatile-rich crust and an atmosphere and so is one of the best analogues for understanding the effects of impact cratering on Mars. Furthermore, fieldwork at terrestrial craters and analysis of samples is critical to ground-truth observations made based on remote sensing data from Martian orbiters, landers, and rovers.\nIn recent years, the effect of target lithology on various aspects of the impact cratering process has emerged as a major research topic. On Mars, volatiles have been invoked to be the primary factor influencing the morphology of ejecta deposits – e.g., the formation of single-, double- and multiple-layered ejecta deposits – and central uplifts – e.g., the formation of so-called “central pit” craters. Studies of craters on Earth have also shown that volatiles complicate the identification of impactites – i.e., rocks produced and/or affected by impact cratering. Identifying impactites on Earth is challenging, often requiring intensive and multi-technique laboratory analysis of hand specimens. As such, it is even more challenging to recognize such materials in remote datasets.\nHere, observations from the Haughton (d = 23 km; Canada), Ries (d = 24 km; Germany), Mistastin (d = 28 km; Canada), Tunnunik, (d = 28 km; Canada), and West Clearwater Lake (d = 36 km; Canada) impact structures are presented. First, it is shown that some impactites mimic intrusive, volcanic, volcanoclastic and in some cases sedimentary clastic rocks. Care should, therefore, be taken in the identification of seemingly unusual igneous rocks at rover landing sites as they may represent impact melt rocks. Second, it is proposed that layered ejecta deposits on Earth and Mars form from a common multi-stage emplacement model. Third, in terms of the origin of central pit craters it is shown that based on current definitions, these central uplift morphologies also occur on Earth, which offers important insights in their formation.",

            "abstract": "The X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) on the MESSENGER spacecraft, in orbit about Mercury from March 2011 to April 2015, routinely detected fluorescent X-rays induced by low-energy (1-10 keV) electrons. These electrons are in general below the threshold energy response of the Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS), one of two sensors on MESSENGER’s Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) instrument that measures electrons at energies above 35 keV. Hence, the XRS provided a measure of this lower-energy suprathermal electron population at Mercury. We devised an automated algorithm to select these events from the XRS data set from April 2011 to March 2015 on the basis of the duration, location, and spectral slope of the events. We identified 3102 events in 3900 orbits around Mercury, sampling all Mercury longitudes multiple times over the four-year period. It is evident that these suprathermal electrons were present near the planet at all local times, but the majority were on the nightside of the planet, and a dawn–dusk asymmetry is clearly seen in the data. When the event locations are plotted in simplified B versus L coordinates (where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field, L defines an axisymmetric surface of those lines of magnetic force from the dipole component of Mercury’s internal field that intersect the magnetic equator at a distance L RM from the dipole center, and RM is Mercury’s radius), several distinct clusters of events can be seen. We infer that all of these are signatures of accelerated electrons being injected from Mercury’s tail region to form a quasi-trapped electron distribution at Mercury.",

            "abstract": "With an average elevation above 4,000 metres, the Third Pole (TP) is a unique region with many high mountains centered on the Tibetan Plateau stretching over 5 million square kilometers. Major environmental changes are taking place on the TP characterized by complex interactions of atmospheric, cryospheric, hydrological, geological and environmental processes. These processes are critical for the well-being of the three billion people inhabiting the plateau and the surrounding regions.\nGlacier melt is one of the most significant environmental changes observed on the TP. Over the past decade, most of the glaciers on the TP have undergone considerable melt. The Third Pole Environment (TPE) has focused on the causes of the glacier melt by conducting large-scale ground in-situ observation and monitoring, analyzing satellite images and remote sensing data, and applying numerical modeling to environmental research on the TP. The studies of long-term record of water stable isotopes in precipitation and ice core throughout the TP have revealed different features with regions, thus proposing significant influence of atmospheric circulations on spatial precipitation pattern over the TP. Validation of the result by isotope-equipped general circulation models confirms the spatial distribution of different atmospheric circulation dominances on the TP, with northern part dominated by the westerlies, southern part by the summer monsoon, and central part featuring the influences of both circulation systems. Such unique circulation patterns also bear directly on the status of glaciers and lakes over the TP and its surroundings. The studies therefore found the largest glacier melt in the monsoon-dominated southern part, moderate melt in the central part of transition, and the least melt, or even slight advance in the westerlies-dominated northern TP. It is clear that some mountains on the TP are undergoing rapid melt and the consequence of without ice and snow will be very soon. The glacier malt on the TP is causing to more intensified water cycles and more frequent hazards, including lake expansion, glacial lake outburst and discharge flood. Our society needs quick response to the process and to its potential consequence.",

            "abstract": "The Lucky Strike hydrothermal field is situated at the mid-Atlantic ridge, south of the Azores, on top of a central volcano within the axial valley. The volcano is composed of a fossil lava lake surrounded by three volcanic cones. An Axial Magma Chamber (AMC) is reported 3.4km below the seafloor. The active venting sites are situated around the fossil lava lake and are directly linked to the heat supplied by the AMC. High temperature fluids from the Lucky Strike field were sampled in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in order to document the depth of the reaction zone, subsurface mixing, geographical control and magmatic degassing.\nA new active site named Capelinhos was discovered approximately 1.5km eastward from the lava lake, during exploration by ROV Victor6000 - MoMARsat cruise, 2013. It is composed of 10m-high chimneys discharging black smoker-type fluid. Fluid temperatures were 328°C in 2013 and decreased to 318°C in 2014 and 2015. Capelinhos fluids are Cl-depleted by 55% compared to seawater indicating phase separation at depth. In comparison, the other sites range from 6% enrichment (2608/Y3 site) to 22% depletion (Eiffel tower site). Si geothermobarometry of Y3 site estimates quartz equilibration at P=300 bars and T=360-380°C, coherent with Fe/Mn geothermometer (T=370±10°C). For Capelinhos, Fe/Mn suggests 398°C (±10°C) which is close to the critical point of seawater (P=300 bars and T=407°C). Other geothermobarometer uses Si/Cl vapor-like fluid to constrain depth of the top of reaction zone and predicts significant bias due to mixing along the up-flow zone. Application gives P=~370 bars, T=~435°C at Capelinhos and P=~390 bars, T=~440°C at Eiffel tower. This is further sustained by end-member 87Sr/86Sr=0.7038, which indicates little interaction of Capelinhos vent fluids with seawater-derived fluid, compared to other vapor-like sites with 87Sr/86Sr=0.7043. Because of its external location, Capelinhos site isn’t influenced by the complex tectonic context of the lava lake.",

            "abstract": "Gas transport in the form of discrete microbubbles in saturated porous media is of importance in a number of processes relevant to many geo-environmental and engineering systems such as bubbling of greenhouse gases in river and sea beds, hydrocarbon gas migration in coal cleats and rock fractures, and air sparging for remediation of soil contaminated with volatile organic compounds. Under the assumption of no or minor volume expansion during gravity-driven migration, the transport of a single microbubble can be well described using various drag force models. However, not enough attention has been paid to the collective behavior of microbubbles during their ascend as a plume through the saturated porous medium, involving dynamic interactions between individual bubbles, bubbles and the ambient fluid, as well as bubbles and the solid matrix. With our quasi-2D, lab-scale microbubble migration experiments, where bubbles are continuously released from a diffuser at the bottom of a porous bed of hydrated gel beads, we establish a scaling relationship between the gas (bubble) release rate and various characteristic parameters of the bubble plume, such as plume tip velocity, plume width, and breakthrough time of the plume front. We find that the characteristic width of the bubble plume varies as a power of both the gas release rate and the bed thickness, with exponents of 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. Moreover, the characteristic breakthrough time also scales with both the gas release rate and the bed thickness with power-law exponents of -0.4 and 1.2, respectively. The mean pore-water velocity of the circulating ambient water also follows a power-law relationship with the gas release rate being an exponent of 0.6 of the gas release rate. This can be quantitatively proven using a simplified momentum exchange model together with the above power-law exponents for the bubble plume. These analyses on the experimental results are carried out on the basis of non-dimensional parameters and variables in order to explore the bubble transport mechanism in a way that is independent of the actual scale of the physical model. Our findings thus have implications for engineering processes and for fundamental research on bubble transport phenomena in porous media in general.",

            "abstract": "Rising CO2 is predicted to accelerate the expansion of forests into savannas. Although encroaching forests can sequester carbon over the short-term, the carbon pools may become increasingly sensitive to fire due to a shift towards plant communities more susceptible to fire-driven dieback. We quantify how functional traits determine the ability of individual tree species to tolerate fire and subsequently determine the fire-sensitivity of ecosystem carbon across 180 plots throughout the 2.2-million km2 Cerrado region in Brazil. We find that accounting for variation in functional traits fundamentally changes fire-driven dieback predictions: savannas and forests switched from having similar amounts of potential carbon losses to forests containing substantially greater potential carbon losses when differences in functional traits were considered. In fact, we find that not accounting for variation in functional traits underestimated carbon losses in forests by ~50%, summing to an underestimation of 0.22PgC across the Cerrado region. In total, shifts in the fire sensitivity of forests due to changes in community composition and functional traits may offset a third of carbon gains during forest encroachment. These results illustrate that functional traits are critical for determining the climate-carbon-fire feedback in tropical savanna-forest biomes.",

Although hydroclimate extremes result from many factors that sometimes act together, water is a central component of these extremes via either its excess or scarcity. Quantitative description of precipitation extremes is based upon different types of metrics, from simplified extreme indices to sophisticated estimates involving consideration of probability density functions. However, their applicability is critically dependent on the type and characteristics of data used. We will consider different data sources, namely in-situ rain gauge and pluviometer measurements, satellite data from different missions and also reanalyses and model data output mostly for European continent. For in-situ measurements we will analyse how the quality of observations and the density of the networks may affect estimates of extreme precipitation in different regions. In particular, we will demonstrate capabilities of daily precipitation grids built from relatively coarse resolution and very high resolution data for capturing characteristics of specific extreme events and long-term variability in the intensity of extremes. Of a special attention will be consideration of precipitation extremes associated with prolonged wet episodes and associated requirements for the data record completeness. Finally, when considering estimates of extreme precipitation based on satellite and model data, we will address the issue of scaling of extreme precipitation, which put serious quantitative and qualitative constrains on assessment of climatologies and climate variability in the intensity and frequency of hydroclimate extremes.",

Although the macroscale stratigraphy of this ice retreat is known fairly well, and has a simple layered structure, different brittle and ductile deformation structures within the sediments reveal more complex patterns of sediment deposition and reworking associated with ice margin stillstands and/or oscillations during overall ice retreat. Brittle deformation structures include clastic dikes, subglacial shears and mud bed brecciation/rip ups. Ductile deformation structures include passive density settling and fluidization in particular in proglacial outwash. Together, these structures are found in association with each other (i.e. they are commonly parasitic) and formed by high marginward porewater fluxes driven by high subglacial water availability and high sediment permeability.

            "abstract": "Considerable advances have been made in the last decade or so in the representation of aerosol indirect effects on resolved-scale cloud and precipitation in global climate models. However, the representation of effects on the convective scale is severely limited by the nature of the bulk mass-flux parameterizations used in most global models, contributing to the uncertainty in model estimates of the total effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci).\nIn this study, we investigate aerosol effects on convection at the global scale using the Convective Cloud Field Model (CCFM) within the ECHAM6–HAM2 global aerosol–climate model. This parameterization simulates a spectrum of cloud types interacting through their shared environment, each modeled by an entraining parcel model with explicit updraft velocity and embedded parameterizations of aerosol activation and cloud microphysics. This allows us to analyse the distributions of updraft velocity and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) in unresolved convective cloud, as well as the cloud field structure in terms of cloud number, area and depth. We then consider the effect of an aerosol perturbation on the system, from the change in CDNC, through modulation of precipitation and latent heating, to impacts on the cloud field structure which may be indicative of one or more of the proposed mechanisms for aerosol-induced changes on the single cloud or cloud field scale. From simulations in present-day and pre-industrial scenarios, we present an estimate of the convective contribution to global ERFaci, and consider how this might be further constrained.",

To estimate the transport and burial potential of contaminants, local sediment distribution and dynamics had to be assessed quickly.\nOur study made use of the benthic profiler NERIDIS III of the University of Bremen. 33 cross-shore profiles, each ca. 8 km long, have been surveyed. The main instrument is a controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) sensor, which is measuring the electric conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of the seafloor. High-resolution, overlapping seafloor photos have been taken by a bow-mounted digital camera. An on-board CTD with turbidity sensor complete the sensor arrangement.\nFrom the EM data, porosity and magnetite concentrations have been calculated and interpolated. The resulting maps show specific zones of magnetite enrichment, higher concentrations are correlated to low porosity.\nPhotos have been used along with acoustic backscatter measured by a sidescan sonar to sketch out a preliminary map of sediment facies. Based on this, sides for grab sampling were selected. By taking grain size and mineralogy into account, a detailed map of the regional lithofacies could be created.\nLocal sediment dynamics have been inferred by the observation of bedforms, the turbidity of bottom water and lithofacies. The results show two anti-parallel longshore transport paths dependent on differing weather conditions and water depths. The longshore magnetite distribution indicates that the heavy mineral fraction is mainly affected by storm-induced sediment transport.\nOur study demonstrates how integrated benthic profiling adds to the interpretability of data obtained by established methods. By bridging the gap between area-covering, but indirect data from hydroacoustics and precise, but punctual data from samples, benthic profiling enables fast and detailed assessment of sediment distribution and dynamics on a large scale.",

            "abstract": "The controversy on the origin of banded iron formations (BIFs) has lasted for many decades. Studies prior to the 1970s suggested that Fe in BIFs was supplied from continental riverine inputs[1], but discovery of midocean ridge hydrothermal systems in the 1970s and identification of positive Eu anomaly in BIF samples led to an alternative model where hydrothermal vents provided Fe in BIFs[2]. Although the latter model has became widely accepted, it should be noted that interpretations of Fe sources for BIFs using the abundance and isotopic composition of rare earth elements (REEs) are based on an assumption that transport and deposition of REEs and Fe were coupled.\nWe address the question of Fe sources and pathways for BIFs by combining stable Fe isotopes with radiogenic Nd isotopes as well as REE measurements to test proposals that Fe in BIFs was hydrothermally sourced. The samples investigated are from a type section of the Dales Gorge member of the 2.5 Ga Brockman Iron Formation, the world’s most extensive Superior-type BIF that represents the climax of BIF deposition in the geologic record. Large variations were observed in both Fe and Nd isotope compositions of the BIF samples, and there is a positive correlation between the bulk rock εNd and δ56Fe values. In addition, there is a negative corelation between εNd and Sm/Nd ratios. In order to explain the observed correlations in those isotopic and elemental data, a two-component model, where mixing between a high εNd, low Sm/Nd hydrothermal endmember and a low εNd, low δ56Fe, but high Sm/Nd continental endmember occurred prior to deposition of the BIF, is required. The low-δ56Fe, high-Sm/Nd endmember is best explained by microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) in the coastal sediments, which fractionated Fe isotopes and REEs and released these components back to water column that were ultimately precipitated in BIFs. The range and distribution of εNdvalues in the BIF samples suggest that the amount of continental Fe recycled by microbes was comparable to the amount of Fe provided by MOR hydrothermal activity in the ocean at 2.5 Ga, at least for the BIFs in Hamersley Group.\n[1] Lepp H, Goldich SS (1964) Econ Geol 59(6):1025–1060.\n[2] Bekker A, et al.

            "abstract": "Experimentally determined permeability results have provided the basis for numerous theories of magmatic degassing. Two recent eruptions in Chile, at Chaitén Volcano in 2008-10 and Cordón Caulle in 2011-12, allowed the first detailed observations of rhyolitic activity and provided insights into the evolution of highly silicic eruptions. Both events exhibited simultaneous explosive and effusive activity, with both lava and ash plumes emitted from the same vent [1]. The permeability of fracture networks that act as fluid flow pathways is key to understanding such eruptive behaviour. Here, we report results from a systematic experimental investigation of permeability in volcanic rocks, at magmatic temperatures and pressures, in the presence of pore fluids using our newly-developed high-temperature permeability facility. Enhancements to the High Temperature Triaxial Deformation Cell at UCL [2] have enabled us to make permeability measurements on 25mm x 50mm cores at both elevated temperature and elevated hydrostatic pressure [3]. We present results from several suites of permeability measurements on samples of dome dacite from the 2004-08 eruption of Mount St Helens, and rhyolite collected from the lava dome formed during the 2008-10 eruption of Chaitén, Chile. Tests were conducted at temperatures up to 900oC and under an effective pressure of 5 MPa, using the steady-state flow technique. Samples were cooled to room temperature between each high temperature test, and the permeability of each sample was re-measured before heating to the next temperature increment in the series. The results show a complex permeability evolution that includes a reduction in permeability by approximately 4 orders of magnitude up to 600oC. Together with TGA, FTIR and hot-stage data, these new experimental permeability results are applied to enhance our understanding of the complex issue of silicic magma degassing.\n[1] Castro JM et al, 2014 EPSL 405, 52-61\n[2] Rocchi V et al, 2004 JVGR 132,137-157\n[3] Gaunt HE et al 2013 IAVCEI Sci.

            "abstract": "We address the problem of optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The inverse problem seeks to infer a parameter field (e.g., the log permeability field in a porous medium flow model problem) from synthetic observations at a set of sensor locations and from the governing PDEs. The goal of the OED problem is to find an optimal placement of sensors so as to minimize the uncertainty in the inferred parameter field. We formulate the OED objective function by generalizing the classical A-optimal experimental design criterion using the expected value of the trace of the posterior covariance. This expected value is computed through sample averaging over the set of likely experimental data. Due to the infinite-dimensional character of the parameter field, we seek an optimization method that solves the OED problem at a cost (measured in the number of forward PDE solves) that is independent of both the parameter and the sensor dimension.\nTo facilitate this goal, we construct a Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) point, and use the resulting covariance operator to define the OED objective function. We use randomized trace estimation to compute the trace of this covariance operator. The resulting OED problem includes as constraints the system of PDEs characterizing the MAP point, and the PDEs describing the action of the covariance (of the Gaussian approximation to the posterior) to vectors. We control the sparsity of the sensor configurations using sparsifying penalty functions, and solve the resulting penalized bilevel optimization problem via an interior-point quasi-Newton method, where gradient information is computed via adjoints. We elaborate our OED method for the problem of determining the optimal sensor configuration to best infer the log permeability field in a porous medium flow problem. Numerical results show that the number of PDE solves required for the evaluation of the OED objective function and its gradient is essentially independent of both the parameter dimension and the sensor dimension (i.e., the number of candidate sensor locations). The number of quasi-Newton iterations for computing an OED also exhibits the same dimension invariance properties.",

These advisories and additional guidance products are used by the civil aviation community to make decisions on airspace flight management.\nLondon VAAC has specialist forecasters who use a combination of volcano source data, satellite-based, ground-based and aircraft observations, weather forecast models and dispersion models. Since the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, which resulted in the decision by many northern European countries to impose significant restrictions on the use of their airspace, London VAAC has been active in further developing its volcanic ash monitoring, modelling and forecasting capabilities, collaborating with research organisations, industry, other VAACs, Meteorological Services and the Volcano Observatory in Iceland. It has been necessary to advance operational capabilities to address evolving requirements, including for more quantitative assessments of volcanic ash in the atmosphere.\nHere we summarise advances in monitoring, modelling and forecasting of volcanic ash plumes over the past 5 years from the London VAAC perspective, and the realization of science into operations. We also highlight the importance of collaborative activities, such as the ‘VAAC Best Practice’ Workshop, where information is exchanged between all nine VAACs worldwide on the operational practices in monitoring and forecasting volcanic ash, with the aim of working toward a more harmonized service for decision makers in the aviation community. We conclude on an evaluation of how better we are prepared for the next significant ash-rich Icelandic eruption, and the challenges still remaining.",

            "abstract": "Arctic Ocean sea ice plays a critical role in the Earth’s climate system because of the positive ice-albedo feedback mechanisms as well as its control on ocean-atmospheric heat exchange and potential influence on the thermohaline circulation. Key to improving our understanding of Arctic sea ice cover and its reaction to external forcing is the reconstruction of past variability through paleo-records such as marine sediment cores. Although the observed recent sea ice loss seems to be the strongest of the last millennia, it is still uncertain whether the shift from perennial to seasonal ice cover expected for the near future was unprecedented during the current interglacial. High resolution sea ice reconstructions from the Arctic Ocean are rare, and specifically records from the Russian Arctic are underrepresented. In this study, we present results from marine sediment cores from the Herald Canyon in the East Siberian Sea. The area is one of the major conduits of Pacific water entering the Arctic Ocean basin from the Bering Strait and is thus an ideal place to study past variability of the inflow of these nutrient rich waters. Radiocarbon dating of mollusks indicates very high sedimentation rates at the coring sites which allowed for analyses at centennial resolution up to decadal resolution in the late Holocene. Core samples were analyzed for the biomarker IP25, which is produced by diatoms living in sea ice and is used as a proxy of past seasonal sea ice concentrations. Preliminary results indicate the presence of seasonal sea ice during the entire Late Holocene and show a significant increase of sea ice concentrations during the last millennia.",

Here we outline the methods and results of mapping soil organic carbon in highland areas (~2400 m) of eastern Lesotho, southern Africa, across different land uses. Bedrock summit areas with very thin soils are dominated by xeric alpine grassland; terrace agriculture with strip fields and thicker soils is found within river valleys. Multispectral Worldview 2 imagery was used to map LULC across the region. An overall accuracy of 88% and kappa value of 0.83 were achieved using a support vector machine model. Soils were examined in the field from different LULC areas for properties such as soil depth, maturity and structure. In situ soils in the field were also evaluated using a portable analytical spectral device (ASD) in order to ground truth spectral signatures from Worldview. Soil samples were examined in the lab for chemical properties including organic carbon. Regression modeling was used in order to establish a relationship between soil characteristics and soil spectral reflectance. We were thus able to map SOC across this diverse landscape. Results show that there are notable differences in SOC between upland and agricultural areas which reflect both soil thickness and maturity, and land use practices such as manuring of fields by cattle. Soil erosion and thus carbon (nutrient) export is significant issue in this region, which this project will now be examining.",

It aims to provide the first simultaneous, space-based measurements of inundation extent and water surface elevation in rivers, lakes, and wetlands around the world. Although the orbit repeat time is approximately 21 days, many areas of the earth will be viewed multiple times during this window. SWOT will observe rivers as narrow as 50-100 m and lakes as small as 0.01-0.06 km2, with height accuracies of ~10 cm for water bodies 1 km2 in area. Because SWOT will measure temporal variations in the height, width, and slope of rivers, several algorithms have been developed to estimate river discharge solely from SWOT measurements. Additionally, measurements of lake height and area will allow estimation of variability in lake water storage.\nThese new hydrologic measurements will provide important sources of information both hydrologic and hydrodynamic models at regional to global scales. SWOT-derived estimates of water storage change and discharge will help to constrain simulation of the water budget in hydrologic models. Measurements of water surface elevation will provide similar constraints on hydrodynamic models of river flow. SWOT data will be useful for model calibration and validation, but perhaps the most exciting applications involve assimilation of SWOT data into models to enhance model robustness and provide denser temporal sampling than available from SWOT observations alone.",

Developing a quantitative understanding of how biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems are affected by changes in these multiple processes is crucial for generating projections of the impacts of future change in the Southern Ocean. The changes occurring are not homogeneous, but instead show marked spatial and temporal variability, demonstrated most clearly by the regional nature of trends in sea-ice concentration over the last few decades. The impacts of these changes have also been observed at multiple trophic levels in Southern Ocean ecosystems, from primary producers to top predators, affecting the structure of the food webs in which they occur. Here, I consider briefly the changes occurring in the Southern Ocean and current views of expected future change, highlighting some of the complexity of the system interactions involved. I illustrate some of the major issues through a focus on sea-ice variability and change, noting the impacts on various ecosystem components, and particularly the effects on Antarctic krill. This perspective highlights that current knowledge of the detailed causes and consequences of change in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and hence future trajectories, are generally uncertain. It also shows the importance of understanding the intrinsic variability of the system and how interactions and feedbacks can influence the structure and functioning of ecosystems and associated biogeochemical cycles. Developing useful projections of the impacts of change requires integrated understanding of how physical, biogeochemical and ecological process interactions affect responses to change and provides a valuable focus for future research effort.",

This laboratory-scale study aimed to understand and quantify the influence of chemotaxis on residence times of pollutant-degrading bacteria within homogeneous treatment zones. Focus was placed on a continuous flow sand-packed column system in which a uniform distribution of naphthalene crystals created distributed sources of dissolved phase contaminant. A 10 mL pulse of Pseudomonas putida G7, which is chemotactic to naphthalene, and Pseudomonas putida G7 Y1, a non-chemotactic mutant strain, were simultaneously introduced into the sand-packed column at equal concentrations. Breakthrough curves obtained for the bacteria from column experiments conducted with and without naphthalene were used to quantify the effect of chemotaxis on transport parameters. In the presence of the chemoattractant, longitudinal dispersivity of PpG7 increased by a factor of 3 and percent recovery decreased from 21% to 12%. The results imply that pore-scale chemotaxis responses are evident at an interstitial fluid velocity of 1.7 m/d, which is within the range of typical groundwater flow. Within the context of bioremediation, chemotaxis may work to enhance bacterial residence times in zones of contamination thereby improving treatment.",

This research shows evidences on how this increase of vegetation has caused a severe reduction in the runoff generation that may not simply be explained by the recent climatic evolution. The reduction in water yield is already severely affecting to water resources availability and water management in the region. Scenarios for the future suggest that afforestation may continue or even be accelerated in the Pyrenees affecting mostly to the subalpine belt. Increasing vegetation around the current tree line is expected to continue enhancing evapotranspiration rates, but also to alter the accumulation and melting of the snowpack by increasing interception and producing an earlier melting onset.

However, current models of fault seal are inadequate, primarily focusing on juxtaposition and entrainment effects, despite the recognition that fault-zone cementation is common and can dramatically reduce permeability. We map the 3D cementation patterns of the variably cemented Loma Blanca fault from the land surface to ~40 m depth, using electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP). The carbonate-cemented fault zone is a region of anomalously low normalized chargeability, relative to the surrounding host material. Zones of low-normalized chargeability immediately under the exposed cement provide the first ground-truth that a cemented fault yields an observable IP anomaly. Low-normalized chargeability extends down from the surface exposure, surrounded by zones of high-normalized chargeability, at an orientation consistent with normal faults in the region; this likely indicates cementation of the fault zone at depth, which could be confirmed by drilling and coring. Our observations are consistent with: 1) the expectation that carbonate cement in a sandstone should lower normalized chargeability by reducing pore-surface area and bridging gaps in the pore space, and 2) laboratory experiments confirming that calcite precipitation within a column of glass beads decreases polarization magnitude. The ability to characterize spatial variations in the degree of fault-zone cementation with resistivity and IP has exciting implications for improving predictive models of the hydrogeologic impacts of cementation within faults.",

            "abstract": "Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) has already been proven to be a useful technique for measuring ground displacement at millimeter level. One major drawback of traditional DInSAR technique is that only 1-D deformation in slant range direction can be detected. In order to obtain along-track displacement using a single InSAR pair, two major attempts have been made. The first one is based on cross-correlation between two SAR amplitude images. The second attempt is based on split-beam processing to generate two SAR images from forward- and backward-looking beams. Comparing with the former method, this multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) can achieve much better measurement accuracy. The major drawback of the MAI method is degraded signal to noise ratio (SNR) and along-track resolution since total along-track integration time decreases in the split-beam procedure.\nIn order to improve the SNR and along-track resolution as well as to extract the terrain displacement in the along-track direction, a time domain along-track SAR interferometry method is proposed in this study. Using traditional time domain backprojection method, the phase component corresponding to slant range direction offset can be estimated and removed from the range compressed SAR signal. Then a phase estimation procedure is implemented to obtain the phase component in the along-track direction.

            "abstract": "The nature of Ti incorporation into garnet (substitution mechanisms, site occupancy) has been a matter of interest for decades. Most crustal garnets contain minor to trace quantities of Ti, yet crystallographically-aligned rutile needles in some high grade crustal and mantle garnets suggest Ti solubility can reach major-element concentrations (>1%TiO2) under certain conditions. Understanding Ti incorporation into garnet holds promise for evaluating and interpreting the history and evolution of metamorphic systems. In this study we will demonstrate that Ti is incorporated into garnets via at least three substitution mechanisms on multiple crystallographic sites.\nGarnets were grown in piston cylinder apparatuses at eclogite and granulite facies conditions in multiple bulk compositions. Chemical trends in the experimentally-grown garnets suggest Ti incorporation occurs on the octahedral crystallographic site (VITi) via at least two substitution mechanisms. Furthermore, Ti partitioning between garnets and their corresponding melts increases with decreasing temperature and increasing melt polymerization.\nTi Kα X-ray Absorption Near Edge Struture (XANES) pre-edge analysis was used to observe Ti coordination in experimental and natural garnets (contact metamorphic grade up to eclogite and granulite facies). XANES analyses confirm the observation of VITi in experimental garnets. However, natural garnets contain both VITi and IVTi (from ~90% IVTi to 100% VITi). Microprobe analyses of Ti in garnet were combined with the XANES analyses to determine VITi and IVTi concentrations. Increasing VITi is strongly correlated with increasing Ca content in garnet, while IVTi behaves similar to IVTi in other silicate minerals (e.g. quartz, zircon).\nThe complex nature of Ti incorporation into garnet diminishes the utility of a single-mineral Ti-in-garnet thermobarometer, but partitioning of Ti between garnet, clinopyroxene and melt could be useful for the development of novel empirical thermobarometers. Also, given this insight into the substitution mechanisms governing Ti incorporation, Ti depletion halos around exsolved rutile needles could be used to determine exhumation rates for high-grade metamorphic systems.",

            "abstract": "Teleseismic receiver function studies in the forearc of the Cascadia subduction zone have resolved structures associated with deep fluid cycling, such as the basalt-to-eclogite reaction and overpressure of the subducting oceanic crust, as well as the serpentinization of the forearc mantle wedge. Unfortunately, the updip extent of the overpressured zone and its possible control on the transition from episodic slow slip to seismic slip occur offshore and are not resolved in those studies. The Cascadia Initiative has provided an opportunity to extend our capabilities to study the locked zone using teleseismic receiver functions from the deployment of a dense line of ocean-bottom seismograph (OBS) stations offshore of Washington State, from the trench to the coastline. However, high quality receiver functions using OBS data are notoriously difficult to obtain and to interpret due to the presence of a water column that produces P-wave reverberation above the recording stations. Here we model receiver functions for a variety of oceanic lithospheric structures to investigate the possibilities and limitations of receiver functions using OBS data. These modeling results indicate that receiver functions from OBS data are difficult to interpret in the presence of marine sediments, but shallow-water sites in subduction zone forearcs are suitable for constraining various crustal elements around the locked megathrust fault. We also propose using a complementary approach based on transfer function modeling that bypasses receiver functions altogether and estimates crustal properties directly from the waveforms. Using real data examples from the Cascadia Initiative, we show how calculated receiver and transfer functions can be used to constrain seismic properties of the crust in both shallow (Cascadia forearc) and deep (Juan de Fuca Ridge) ocean settings. Interestingly, the elevated P-to-S velocity ratio of the downgoing oceanic crust interpreted as high pore-fluid pressure extends updip into the locked zone, indicating that the megathrust fault may be intrinsically weak at all depths, consistent with other geophysical data.",

            "abstract": "The Martian surface exhibits a strong dichotomy in elevation, crustal thickness and magnetization between the southern and northern hemispheres. A giant impact has been proposed to explain the formation of the Northern Lowlands on Mars. Such an impact probably led to strong and deep mantle heating and merging between the two cores. These processes will have implications on the thermal state and on the magnetic evolution of the planet. We model the effects of such an impact on the Martian magnetic field (1) by characterizing the thermochemical consequences of the sinking of the impactor’s core as a single diapir, (2) by imposing a heat flux heterogeneity on the Martian core-mantle boundary (CMB). Our results show that large viscosity contrasts between the impactor’s core and the surrounding mantle silicates can reduce the duration of the merging down to 1 kyr. Direct impact heating of Martian core favor thermal stratification of the core and core dynamo cessation. The merging of the impactor’s core with the Martian core only delays the re-initiation of the dynamo for a very short time. While the core thermal stratification is likely to be evacuated rapidly, the impact induced thermal anomaly within the mantle is likely to remain stable for a longer timescale above the CMB. This thermal anomaly generates a large scale cooling heterogeneity at the CMB and a magnetic field dichotomy. A polar impactor leads to a north–south hemispheric magnetic dichotomy that is stronger than an east–west dichotomy created by an equatorial impactor. The amplitude of the magnetic dichotomy is mostly controlled by the horizontal Rayleigh number that represents the vigor of the convection driven by the lateral variations of the CMB heat flux. Our results imply that an impactor radius of 1000 km could have recorded the magnetic dichotomy observed in the Martian crustal field only if very rapid post-impact magma cooling took place.",

            "abstract": "Globally, transpiration accounts for more than four-fifths of total evaporative flux (Jasechko et al., 2013), however virtually none of the major terrestrial hydrology land data assimilation systems (LDAS) explicitly simulate vegetation dynamics. This precludes assimilation of any of the plethora of the high-quality vegetation-monitoring products that are available from various remote-sensing platforms. In majority, existing LDAS rely on prescribed vegetation indexes, and thus cannot adapt either to landcover changes, or to dynamic vegetation response to terrestrial hydrology.\nRecently, the Noah land surface model was extended into a multi-physics platform (Noah-MP) that includes a dynamic vegetation component (Niu et al., 2011). This model now has the potential to facilitate assimilation of remote sensing vegetation products into terrestrial hydrologic forecast and monitoring systems – especially ones that currently utilize the Noah LSM (e.g., Ek et al., 2003, Xia et al., 2011, Case et al., 2011).\nIn this talk, we explore the assimilation of vegetation-related information into Noah-MP. We start by assimilating in-situ observations of sensible and latent heat fluxes to update soil water and plant carbon states, and investigate how this type of relatively precise data assimilation can be useful for exposing deficiencies in the new dynamic vegetation model. We then assimilate EVI observations from MODIS (MOD13 and MOD15), and explore the potential for satellite-observed changes in vegetation states to impact hydrological predictions. All model estimates are validated against FluxNet tower data.",

            "abstract": "The first observations of the storm-time ring current composition using AMPTE/CCE data showed that the O+ contribution to the ring current increases significantly during storms. The ring current is predominantly formed from inward transport of the near-earth plasma sheet. Thus the increase of O+ in the ring current implies that the ionospheric contribution to the plasma sheet has increased. The ionospheric plasma that reaches the plasma sheet can come from both the cusp and the nightside aurora. The cusp outflow moves through the lobe and enters the plasma sheet through reconnection at the near-earth neutral line. The nightside auroral outflow has direct access to nightside plasma sheet. Using data from Cluster and the Van Allen Probes spacecraft, we compare the development of storms in cases where there is a clear input of nightside auroral outflow, and in cases where there is a significant cusp input. We find that the cusp input, which enters the tail at ~15-20 Re becomes isotropized when it crosses the neutral sheet, and becomes part of the hot (>1 keV) plasma sheet population as it convects inward. The auroral outflow, which enters the plasma sheet closer to the earth, where the radius of curvature of the field line is larger, does not isotropize or become significantly energized, but remains a predominantly field aligned low energy population in the inner magnetosphere. It is the hot plasma sheet population that gets accelerated to high enough energies in the inner magnetosphere to contribute strongly to the ring current pressure. Thus it appears that O+ that enters the plasma sheet further down the tail has a greater impact on the storm-time ring current than ions that enter closer to the earth.",

Here we examine the seismic structure and anisotropy of the crust around the San Andreas Fault (SAF) near Parkfield, California, using teleseismic receiver functions. These data indicate that the crust is characterized by spatially variable and strongly anisotropic upper and middle crustal layers, with a Moho at ∼35 km depth. The upper layer is ∼5–10 km thick and is characterized by strong (≥30%) anisotropy with a slow axis of hexagonal symmetry, where the plane of fast velocity has a strike parallel to that of the SAF and a dip of ∼40 degrees. We interpret this layer as pervasive fluid-filled microcracks within the brittle deformation regime. The ∼10–15 km thick midcrustal layer is also characterized by a weak axis of hexagonal symmetry with ≥20% anisotropy, but the dip direction of the plane of fast velocity is reversed. The midcrustal anisotropic layer is more prominent to the northeast of the San Andreas Fault. We interpret the mid crustal anisotropic layer as fossilized fabric within fluid-rich foliated mica schists. When combined with various other geophysical observations, our results suggest that fault creep behavior around Parkfield is favored by intrinsically weak and overpressured crustal fabric.",

            "abstract": "One of the classical problems in sediment transport science is to predict the threshold flow strength below which a bed of loose sediment particles sheared by a homogeneous fluid flow ceases to move. Depending on the particle-fluid-density ratio (s), it has been believed for many decades that this threshold is a consequence of either fluid forces being just strong enough to dislodge particles resting on the bed (small s, e.g., water) or of particle-bed impacts being just strong enough to expel sufficient bed particles (large s, e.g., air). Here we challenge this believe. Through state-of-the-art numerical simulations of sediment transport, which are consistent with measurements in air and water (including the famous \"Shields diagram\"), we show that, regardless of s, the cessation of sediment transport is controlled by a dynamical critical condition which takes a form similar to a yield criterion. We show that this condition can be directly linked to the observation in our sediment transport simulations that the rate of collisional dissipation of granular temperature is usually much smaller than the rate of collisional transfer of horizontal into vertical granular temperature due to grazing particle-bed collisions.",

Continental inputs, including river waters, sediments and atmospheric dust are dominant sources (>95%) of iron into the ocean2. Therefore, understanding how continental inputs may have changed through time is important in understanding the secular evolution of the marine Fe cycle.\nWe analysed the Fe isotopic composition of twenty-four glacial diamictite composites, upper continental crust (UCC) proxies, with ages ranging from the Mesoarchean to the Paleozoic eras to characterize the secular evolution of the UCC. The diamictites all have elevated chemical index of alteration (CIA) and other characteristics of weathered regolith (e.g., strong depletion in soluble elements such as Sr), which they inherited from their upper crustal source region3. δ56Fe in the diamictite composites range from -0.59 to +0.23‰, however, most diamictites cluster with an average δ56Fe of 0.11± 0.20 (2s), overlapping juvenile continental material such as island arc basalts (IABs), which show a narrow range in δ56Fe from -0.04 to +0.14 ‰4. There is no obvious correlation between δ56Fe of the glacial diamictites and the CIA, except that the diamictite with the lowest δ56Fe at -0.59 ‰ also has the highest CIA = 89 (the Paleoproterozoic Makganyene Fm.). The data suggest that the Fe isotope compositions in the upper continental crust did not vary throughout Earth history. Interestingly, chemical weathering and sedimentary transport likely play only a minor role in producing Fe isotope variations in the upper continental crust. Anoxic weathering pre-GOE (Great Oxidation Event) does not seem to generate different Fe isotopic signatures from the post-GOE oxidative weathering environment in the upper continental crust. Therefore, large Fe isotopic fractionations observed in various marine sedimentary records are likely due to other processes occurring in the ocean (e.g., biological activity) instead of abiotic redox reactions on the continent.\n",

For Ubangui and Sangha, the flows remain weaker since 1970.\nWithin the bi-modal hydrological regimes of Sangha and Congo river, because they are equatorial, we also observe since many years a small decline of the secondary flood of april-june. This phenomenon was emphasized especially these last years and is founded in others rivers of Central Africa, where it reflects the variations of de rainfall patterns and the surfaces features.\nFor the Congo basin, the situation is worrying because that affects the inland waterway transport. Moreover that wakes also the project of junction by a canal of the Congo and Chari basins for fighting against the hydrological decline of Lake Chad.",

One cannot do everything, one cannot afford everything, so what to select?\nEssays and reports since Weinberg (1963) have suggested criteria for choosing science topics. Popper et al (2000) reviewed and summarized all that had gone before in the subject of setting priorities; their main conclusions were that the underlying principles were the promotion of excellence and relevance. Sea Change (2015) from the NRC/OSB focused on four criteria. From most important to least important, they were transformative science, societal impacts, readiness, and partnership potential; these four criteria embodied the essence of the suggestions from Weinberg on, framed with the pragmatism of ORPISS (2007).\nGetting to the final set of priorities from many candidates involves a sequence of formal or informal processes, only the last of which is the application of the selected, weighted criteria. As developed by professional prioritization experts, the best-practice steps and processes are:\nCollection of input candidates from the community.\nClustering and parsing/rephrasing of the input to eliminate redundancy and repetition and develop statements at a useful level of specificity. (NOTE:there is no counting of input to see how many times a particular topic was mentioned. The goal is diversity in the input, not a popularity contest.)\nDevelopment of the selection criteria, and weighting the chosen criteria.\nApplication of the selection criteria to the clustered/adjusted candidates.\nFinally, two more best practices:\nDo continuing sanity checks, to avoid losing sight of the goals of the effort.\nResist the temptation to just sit around a table and talk about it to arrive at the priorities, which depends too much on who the specific members of the prioritization team are, and provides no transparency or explanation of why those specific priorities were selected.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing advancements in recent years have enabled monitoring of the Earth's land surface with unprecedented scale and frequency. In the past decade, remote sensing observations of the land surface have become available from a number of satellite instruments and platforms including soil moisture (AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR2, SMOS, SMAP), snow depth (AMSR-E, AMSR2), snow cover (MODIS, VIIRS), terrestrial water storage (GRACE) and land surface temperature (MODIS, VIIRS, GOES). To support the effective exploitation of the information content of the remote sensing observations, computational tools such as data assimilation are necessary. In this presentation, I will describe the efforts towards the concurrent use of all available remote sensing observations in a multivariate data assimilation configuration in the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). Though NLDAS has produced over 34 years (Jan 1979 to present) of hourly land-surface meteorology and surface states using the best-available observations and reanalyses for “off-line” land surface model (LSM) simulations, to-date it has not included the assimilation of relevant hydrological remote sensing datasets. The new phase of NLDAS attempts to bridge this gap by assimilating all land relevant datasets in the NLDAS configuration using the NASA Land Information System (LIS). The results from individually assimilating the soil moisture, snow and terrestrial water storage datasets indicate that improvements can be obtained not only in soil moisture and snow states, but also on evapotranspiration and streamflow estimates. The results from the multivariate, multisensor assimilation of the above-mentioned remote sensing datasets in NLDAS and an evaluation of the resulting improvements and trends in soil moisture, snowpack, evapotranspiration and streamflow will also be presented. Through this talk, I will describe the advances made towards the effective utilization of remote sensing data for hydrologic prediction and some of the challenges and gaps that remain.",

            "abstract": "A new systematic review of diverse Holocene paleoenvironmental records (Kaufman et al., Quat. Sci. Rev., in revision) has clarified the primary multi-centennial- to millennial-scale trends across eastern Beringia (Alaska, westernmost Canada and adjacent seas). Composite time series from midges, pollen, and biogeochemical indicators are compared with new summaries of mountain-glacier and lake-level fluctuations, terrestrial water-isotope records, sea-ice and sea-surface-temperature analyses, and peatland and thaw-lake initiation frequencies. The paleo observations are also compared with recently published simulations (Bartlein et al., Clim. Past Discuss., 2015) that used a regional climate model to simulate the effects of global and regional-scale forcings at 11 and 6 ka. During the early Holocene (11.5-8 ka), rather than a prominent thermal maximum as suggested previously, the newly compiled paleo evidence (mostly sensitive to summer conditions) indicates that temperatures were highly variable, at times both higher and lower than present, although the overall lowest average temperatures occurred during the earliest Holocene. During the middle Holocene (8-4 ka), glaciers retreated as the regional average temperature increased to a maximum between 7 and 5 ka, as reflected in most proxy types. The paleo evidence for low and variable temperatures during the early Holocene contrasts with more uniformly high temperatures during the middle Holocene and agrees with the climate simulations, which show that temperature in eastern Beringia was on average lower at 11 ka and higher at 6 ka than at present (pre-industrial). Low temperatures during the early Holocene can be attributed in part to the summer chilling caused by flooding the continental shelves, whereas the mid-Holocene thermal maximum was likely driven by the loss of the Laurentide ice sheet, rise in greenhouse gases, higher-than-present summer insolation, and expansion of forest over tundra.",

            "abstract": "The 8.2 ka event is a key test case for simulating the coupled climate response to changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Most previous model experiments of this event were forced by the drainage of proglacial Lake Agassiz-Ojibway into the Hudson Bay and entering the Atlantic Ocean through the Hudson Strait. This drainage contained enough water to raise global sea level about 0.2 meters or more, but it likely had a short duration on the order of one year. Recent advances in quantifying the meltwater forcing associated with the 8.2 ka event point towards a forcing larger than the drainage of Lake Agassiz-Ojibway, probably involving the collapse of the Hudson Bay ice dome and raising global sea level on the order of 1.5 to 3.0 meters. Using the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3), we show that this larger forcing yields a better match to paleoclimate proxy records. Despite these improvements in forcing magnitude in model simulations, the forcing itself is still generally applied in an unrealistic geographic manner, across most of the Labrador Sea rather than only along the Labrador coast. We present additional experiments using the CCSM3, with an ocean model resolution only slightly coarser than that used in previous eddy-resolving simulations, to test the sensitivity to freshwater forcing location. When revised freshwater forcing is applied across the Labrador Sea, the AMOC is reduced by about 40% and climate anomalies compare well with proxy records of the 8.2 ka event in terms of magnitude and duration. When the forcing is added only along the Labrador coast, however, most meltwater joins the subtropical gyre and travels to the subtropics with minor impact to the AMOC (about 10% decrease). It is likely that model biases in the placement of the North Atlantic Current remain an important limitation for correctly simulating the 8.2 ka event, though the effects of icebergs or alternative freshwater sources cannot be completely ruled out.",

We present findings of soil investigations from the high Arctic Lena river delta. In total 50 soil pedons have been sampled from different geomorphological units (delta terraces) in the delta in late summer 2013. All pedons have been classified according to the U.S. soil taxonomy. We described and sampled 19 Turbels, 27 Orthels and 4 Histels. On average 7.9±2.7 samples have been analyzed from each profile, including samples of the upper permafrost down to one meter depth. Soil horizons are described from open soil pits and their respective thicknesses are calculated from perspective-corrected photographs. Soil samples were analyzed for bulk density, as well as content of water/ice soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N). The data is aggregated for the different geomorphological units and partitioned at centimeter level. High resolution vertical depth plots of different soil properties, including C%, N%, water and ice content and soil horizon distribution, are generated to demonstrate the information density of the dataset. A high-resolution land cover classification is generated for a subregion of the delta using advanced remote sensing classification methods. The soil pedon data and the land cover classification are combined for thematic upscaling of SOC and N stocks. We identify major geomorphological units of the Lena delta to control SOC storage in the subregion. We can show that SOC storage is highly variable with depth. Strong cryoturbation contributes to much deep SOC storages on the relatively stable first and third delta terraces, while fluvial deposition controls SOC storage in the recent alluvial floodplain. Soils sampled on thermokarst-affected rims of the third terrace show lower SOC storages indicating considerable reworking of the SOC.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane has an important role in changing climate, a role that may be gaining increased importance. It is emitted by a varied set of processes and sources. Emission rates are often small and variable, both temporally and spatially, making quantification of emissions difficult, except at global scales. NOAA observations of globally averaged atmospheric CH4 began in 1983, and the data are rich in features, capturing small changes in its budget of emissions and sinks. From the start of measurements through 2006, the rate of increase of atmospheric CH4 was decreasing and averaged less than 1 ppb yr-1 from 1999 to 2006. Assuming no trend in CH4 lifetime from 1983-2006, this implies that total global CH4 emissions were constant and atmospheric CH4 nearly achieved steady state. Since 2007, the growth rate has averaged ~6 ppb yr-1, implying an increase in emissions of ~16 Tg CH4 yr-1. Many potential explanations exist for this increase, but the most likely involves a significant contribution from increased emissions from tropical wetlands. One thing is clear: the increase that started in 2007 can no longer be considered a short-term anomaly in growth rate. It has persisted for 8 years, and analysis of preliminary data suggests the growth rate increased further in 2014.",

Recent observations have indicated that this may not be completely true. The dominant form of energy input to the IT system is electromagnetic, and not particle precipitation. Poynting flux measured on DMSP spacecraft during storms indicates that energy can be deposited at all local times (LTs) in both hemispheres at polar latitudes as well as in the auroral zones. One major effect of this energy input is Joule heating of the ionosphere and thermosphere. We have analyzed the ion temperature measured by DMSP for a number of storms. During storm main phases, the increase in ion temperature maximizes at polar latitudes. We have processed neutral densities from CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE which show localized Joule heating at extremely high latitudes in both hemispheres. We conclude that energy input and dissipation occurs in the polar cap as well as in the auroral zones.

Recent work has shown that rainfall-triggered landslides, while typically local hazards that occupy small spatial areas, can be approximated over regional scales in near real-time. By leveraging data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and other remote and in situ sources, we can represent the conditions for landslide triggering over broad regions. The landslide hazard assessment for situational awareness (LHASA) model integrates satellite precipitation data, a modeled and satellite-based soil moisture product and susceptibility information to improve the characterization of areas that may experience landslide activity at regional and global scales. The goal of LHASA is to better inform decision-making and disaster response agencies on landslide hazards at the regional and global scale. This system outputs straightforward landslide hazard assessment products available in near real-time that can be used to identify landslide-prone areas and the general timing of landslide initiation. This presentation summarizes the results of this modeling framework, discusses the utility of remote sensing products for landslide hazard characterization, and outlines the path forward for this modeling approach.",

            "abstract": "Too much or too little rain can serve as a tipping point for triggering catastrophic flooding and landslides or widespread drought. Knowing when, where and how much rain is falling globally is vital to understanding how vulnerable areas may be more or less impacted by these disasters. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is an international constellation of satellites coordinated through a partnership with NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to provide next-generation global observations of rain and snow. The GPM mission centers on the deployment of a Core Observatory satellite that serves as a reference standard to unify precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites. This satellite launched from Tanegashima Space Complex in Japan on January 28th, 2014 and carries advanced instruments setting a new standard for precipitation measurements from space. The GPM Core Observatory satellite measures rain and snow using two science instruments: the\nGPM Microwave Imager\n(GMI) and the\nDual-frequency Precipitation Radar\n(DPR). The GMI captures precipitation intensities and horizontal patterns, while the DPR provides insights into the three dimensional structure of precipitating particles. Together these two instruments provide a database of measurements against which other partner satellites’ microwave observations can be meaningfully compared and combined to make a global precipitation dataset.\nGPM has already provided unprecedented views of typhoons, extratropical systems, light rain, snow storms and extreme precipitation. Through improved measurements of precipitation globally, the GPM mission provides new insights into measuring the fluxes of Earth’s water cycle. This presentation will outline new findings and advancements of GPM in understanding and modeling of Earth's water and energy cycles, improving forecasting of extreme events that cause natural hazards and disasters, and extending current capabilities in using accurate and timely information of precipitation to directly benefit society.",

            "abstract": "Satellite data collected from 2003-2009 highlighted the Four Corners region in the Southwest US as having notable methane enhancements relative to the surrounding locale. Analysis of those satellite observations indicated significant methane emissions (~0.59 Tg CH4/yr) in the region. Ground-based observations made in 2012 were consistent with this finding. Observational estimates of emissions from recent years are lacking, and there remains a gap in understanding why emissions of this magnitude have been present in the Four Corners region. The TOPDOWN 2015: San Juan campaign applied a layered, multi-aircraft approach to the Four Corners region to quantify total field methane emissions in 2015, quantify the contribution of major point sources, determine their prevalence, and demonstrate new technologies and approaches to attribution and quantification. In this talk I will discuss preliminary results from the airborne campaign, focusing on total field methane emissions, the role of point sources in the San Juan basin, how these preliminary results align with previous studies, and implications for current and future emissions in the Four Corners region.",

Cover crop and N fertilization may provide additional crop residue C and sustain soil C storage compared with no cover crop and N fertilization. We evaluated the effect of four winter cover crops (control or no cover crop, cereal rye, hairy vetch, and hairy vetch/cereal rye mixture) and two N fertilization rates (0 and 90 kg N ha-1) on soil organic C (SOC) at 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm depths under forage and sweet sorghums from 2010 to 2013 in Fort Valley, GA. Cover crop biomass yield and C content were greater with vetch/rye mixture than vetch or rye alone and the control, regardless of sorghum species. Soil organic C was greater with vetch/rye than rye at 0-5 and 15-30 cm in 2011 and 2013 and greater with vetch than rye at 5-15 cm in 2011 under forage sorghum. Under sweet sorghum, SOC was greater with cover crops than the control at 0-5 cm, but greater with vetch and the control than vetch/rye at 15-30 cm. The SOC increased at the rates of 0.30 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 at 0-5 cm for rye and the control to 1.44 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 at 15-30 cm for vetch/rye and the control from 2010 to 2013 under forage sorghum. Under sweet sorghum, SOC also increased linearly at all depths from 2010 to 2013, regardless of cover crops. Nitrogen fertilization had little effect on SOC. Cover crops increased soil C storage compared with no cover crop due to greater crop residue C returned to the soil under forage and sweet sorghum and hairy vetch/cereal rye mixture had greater C storage than other cover crops under forage sorghum.",

            "abstract": "Global mean sea level is rising in response to two primary factors: warming oceans and diminishing glaciers and ice sheets. If melted completely, glaciers would raise sea levels by half a meter, much less than that the 80 meters or so that would result from total melt of the massive Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. That is why glacier contributions to sea level rise have been less studied, allowing estimates of to vary widely. Glacier contributions to sea level change are challenging to quantify as they are broadly distributed, located in remote and poorly accessible high latitude and high altitude regions, and ground observations are sparse. Advances in satellite altimetry (ICESat) and gravimetry (GRACE) have helped, but they also have their own challenges and limitations. Here we present an updated (2003-2014) synthesis of multiple techniques adapted for varying regions to show that rates of glacier loss change little between the 2003-2009 and 2003-2014 periods, accounting for roughly one third of global mean sea level rise. Over the next century and beyond glaciers are expected to continue to contribute substantial volumes of water to the world’s oceans, motivating continued study of how glaciers respond to climate change that will improve projections of future sea levels.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust accounts for more than 50% of the atmospheric dust loading and plays an important role in the marine and terrestrial geochemical cycles. The deserts in North Africa, Northern China and Southern Mongolia are the major sources of mineral dust and have been studied intensively over past decades, especially with Sr, Nd and recently Hf isotopes which are seen as powerful tools to identify source areas. However, the isotopic compositions of dust are highly dependent on particle size hindering the ability to accurately identify dust provenance.\nThe clay fraction (<2 μm) comprises about half of all mineral dust and has unique minerals phases dominanted by clay minerals. Once the clay-sized particles are deflated to the upper troposphere, they are transported over long distances and are removed from the atmosphere mainly by wet deposition. Thus, the clay-sized isotopic fingerprints from deserts may be ideal targets not only for tracking the provenance tracing of long-distance transported mineral dust, but also to provide an unparalleled window for understanding the global dust cycle, especially eolian dust preserved in deep-sea sediments and ice cores.\nIn this work we investigate multivariate joint radiogenic Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic compositions obtained from complete dissolution of clay-sized fractions of surface sediments from Asian and North African deserts. Asian dust source samples included the ten Northern China deserts and sandy lands - the Taklimakan, Gurbantunggut, Qaidam, Badaim Jaran, Tengger and Mu Us deserts, and the Hobq, Hulun Buirm, Onqin Daga and Horqin sandy land - and Mongolian Gobi desert. North African dust samples were from four transects in the Sahara and Sahel from Mali, Togo, Egypt and Morocco .\nOur results on the clay-sized isotopic measurements of these samples describe (1) the general characteristics of dusts from the Asian with εNd from -17.3 to 0.98, εHf from -5.95 to 3.68 and 87Sr/86Sr from 0.710113 to 0.73306, and North African with εNd -18.55 to -4.75, εHf from -14.89 to 3.47 and 87Sr/86Sr from 0.708007 to 0.739651; (2) the tectonic and weathering controls on clay-sized Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition of deserts and (3) the implications for the source and transport pathway of eolian dusts found in the North Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Greenland ice cores.",

            "abstract": "The natural and anthropogenic cover on the surface of the Earth, more commonly referred to as land cover (LC), is a critical variable driving many environmental processes, including biogeochemical cycling, hydrologic processes, soil erosion, and ecosystems productivity. Thus, the assessment, monitoring, and characterization of LC is essential for global-change research. The previous tasks have become primary applications of remote sensing, resulting in increased availability of LC products. Although those products typically are spatially continuous, they rarely provide the temporal frequency and/or total duration required for environmental studies. Limited research has focused on the assimilation and synthesis of existing LC datasets using statistical interpolation techniques. In this study, we will integrate the two lines of research, one on space-time interpolation of a single LC product and one on fusing multiple existing LC products, to create a methodology for fusing multiple existing LC products over space and time to produce a single high-frequency LC record over a longer time period and a large spatial domain. LC maps of various spatial and temporal resolutions will be constructed, which can be used in a variety of applications. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by application to a region of the conterminous U.S. that comprises the Rocky Mountains (RM). The RM region is one of the most important mountain regions in the world because it has a considerably high ratio of water demand with respect to water availability, has a high ecosystem diversity, and is a global sink of atmospheric carbon. The LC products available for this case study and that are detailed enough spatially to be applied in environmental studies at a regional scale are fused using the proposed methodology. The fused products include the NLCD, Collection 5 MODIS Global LC Type, Historical LC Data Sets of the USGS, and LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Cover.",

During enhanced convection the outer plasmasphere is eroded - these ions are convected to the dayside magnetopause. LANL/MPA instruments regularly measure plumes which last for many days. On occasion, plumes can last more than two weeks. Such observations raise questions as to the production mechanisms that can continually supply high-number-density material to geosynchronous orbit, and onwards to the magnetopause.

Examples, will be drawn from our work across a network of agricultural and wetland sites in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Delta and from examples drawn from the AmeriFlux and FluxNet networks. Planting date, type of irrigation, burning, grazing, plowing/discing/no till, herbicide application and harvesting will be some of the management practices discussed. In sum, different management practices affect timing of phenology, the state of leaf area index and the activity of soil reservoirs.

            "abstract": "Spatially variable orientation of anisotropy can cause helical flow in porous media. Previous studies predominantly analyzed systems in which stripes of materials with different hydraulic anisotropy are aligned with the mean direction of flow. Bakker and Hemker (2002, 2004) presented closed-form expressions for flow in uch systems, pointing to the occurrence of secondary flow. Chiogna et al. (2015) and Cirpka et al. (2015) analyzed locally isotropic hydraulic conductivity fields with blockwise constant anisotropic correlation structure showing that macroscopically helical flow evolves despite a local helicity density of zero. The latter studies also included various metrics to characterize the flow field and kinematic deformation (correlation structure of transverse velocity components, two-point semi-variogram of displacement, stretching, folding) and numerical simulations of steady-state advective-dispersive transport, analyzed by the flux-related dilution index emphasizing that helical flow causes an increase in transverse mixing that cannot be achieved by any other mechanism by which heterogeneity enhances transverse mixing. While these studies demonstrated the potential importance of helical flow in heterogeneous porous media the likelihood of its occurrence remained unclear. In particular, natural sediments do not exhibit extended stripes of materials with diagonally oriented internal anisotropy.\nIn the present study, we generated realistic looking sedimentary structures mimicking scour fills. The individual geobodies have a spoon-like shape and are filled with anisotropic porous material. Cross-sections show typical cross-bedding. In particular we analyzed how the variability in bulk hydraulic conductivity between the geobodies and the differences in the orientation of anisotropy affect flow and transverse solute mixing. While the variance of log-hydraulic conductivity controls longitudinal spreading and mixing, the variability in the orientation of anisotropy is decisive for folding and mixing perpendicular to the mean flow direction. The importance of non-stationary anisotropy for transverse mixing poses a challenge for the hydraulic characterization of sediments in the context of predicting lengths of quasi steady-state plumes.",

However, our understanding of CMEs and their propagation in the heliosphere is limited by the insufficient observations. Therefore, the development of first-principals numerical models plays a vital role in both theoretical investigation and providing space weather forecasts. Here, we present results of the simulation of CME propagation from the Sun to 1AU by combining the analytical Gibson & Low (GL) flux rope model with the state-of-art solar wind model AWSoM. We also provide an approach for transferring this research model to a space weather forecasting tool by demonstrating how the free parameters of the GL flux rope can be prescribed based on remote observations via the new Eruptive Event Generator by Gibson-Low (EEGGL) toolkit. This capability allows us to predict the long-term evolution of the CME in interplanetary space. We perform proof-of-concept case studies to show the capability of the model to capture physical processes that determine CME evolution while also reproducing many observed features both in the corona and at 1 AU. We discuss the potential and limitations of this model as a future space weather forecasting tool.",

            "abstract": "Layered pyroxenites are the dominant type of ultramafic heterogeneities associated with exhumed peridotites. Although they usually represent less than 5% in volume of exposed mantle rocks, they are widely observed in various tectonic environments such as the sub-continental, sub-arc and sub-oceanic mantle. Here we show that mm-scale chemical variations across layered pyroxenites and peridotites can provide a wealth of information on the timing and pathways of migrating melts in the Earth’s mantle, and on temperatures and timing of equilibration of lithospheric peridotites. We describe a novel approach that uses a combination of diffusion and temperature calculations with isotope ages, on multiple pyroxenite layers formed by melt migration in the Lherz massif, to reconstruct the timing of melt migration. We show that after melt fronts froze into the lithosphere, they were preserved in the lithospheric mantle for hundreds of Ma. To constrain the timing of melt migration, we determine the trace element composition of the percolating melt; we use isotopes to estimate the maximum age at which minerals reacted and precipitated from that melt; based on the melt percolation age, and the age of exhumation, we obtain a maximum amount of time between the end of melt percolation event and the exhumation age. In parallel, we calculate closure temperatures based on major elements and rare-earth element thermometers. Then, we use partition coefficients and mineral diffusivities to retrieve the cooling rates recorded by the thermometers. Finally, we will discuss the critical relationship between ‘heterogeneities’ in the source of basalts and the presence of veins in the lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "Music can communicate science at times when words and graphs fail. For this reason, earth scientists are increasingly using sounds and rhythms to capture the public’s imagination while demonstrating technical concepts and sharing the societal impacts of their research. Musical approaches reach across the boundaries of perceptual learning style, age, gender, and life history. Music therefore makes science (and scientists) more approachable to a wide range of people. But in addition to its unique power for engaging diverse audiences, music-based outreach also sets an example for the geosciences’ untapped potential as a public empowerment tool. Like many STEM fields, the music industry has long been criticized for poor inclusion of women and minorities. Rock n’ roll camps for girls are answering this challenge by teaching music as a vessel for empowerment, with principles that can easily be adapted to geoscience outreach and education. The process of observing the planet is innately empowering; outreach programs that emphasize this in their design will take their impacts to the next level.\nJust as diversity in the scientific community benefits geoscience, geoscience also benefits diverse communities. This presentation will outline some principles and applications from the music world to achieving both of these aims.",

            "abstract": "Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios (δ18O, δD) in precipitation, terrestrial water bodies, groundwater, and surface seawater are powerful integrators of the atmospheric water cycle. As such, proxy archives of δ18O and δD form the basis for much of our understanding of past changes in Indo-Pacific climate. Water isotope studies of the past millennium suggest that both internal variability and forced changes in global temperature drove decadal to centennial changes in monsoons, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, ENSO, and other modes of variability. However, recent observations as well as proxy data have shown that δ18O and δD signatures are far more complex than previously believed. Testing hypotheses about the drivers of past Indo-Pacific hydroclimate therefore requires an improved understanding of modern-day isotope ratios.\nIn this study, we present new analyses of Indo-Pacific climate/isotope relationships from satellite and in situ observations, as well as new simulations with water isotope-enabled components of the Community Earth System Model. We evaluate the mechanisms that reinforce or weaken the tropical amount effect, which is often invoked in interpreting paleo-isotope data as hydroclimate proxies. We find that the amount effect is highly variable through space and time. Generally, it is strongest at sites with large-amplitude variations in the seasonal cycle. Circulation and moisture convergence play key roles in determining the strength of the amount effect, although cloud processes such as Rayleigh distillation and rain evaporation are still important, especially in determining initial isotope ratios of transported moisture. The relative influence of these mechanisms on vapor δ18O and δD varies in different parts of the tropics, affecting how regional archives record ENSO and other circulation patterns. We discuss these differences, and their implications for reconstructing Indo-Pacific atmospheric variability on decadal and longer timescales.",

The last steps for important contributions in seismology will request however these data to be modeled and inverted in a way precise enough for new and original constraints on the seismic sources, amplitude of tsunamis and atmospheric/interior seismic/acoustic velocities profiles.\nIonospheric observations are now able to provide time depending maps of the ionospheric waves, enabling the location of the sources, measurement of the wave speed and amplitude, for both acoustic waves above or close the epicenter or remotely observed Rayleigh and Tsunami waves. Are these data good enough for inversions? Are the modelling techniques good enought for inversions?\nWe therefore first compare and illustrate the different observation techniques: ground, air-based and space-based GPS and airglow, focusing on the Tohoku 2011 and Haida Gwai earthquake and tsunamis, discuss the physics enabling the conversion of seismic waves into electron perturbation (for GPS data) and light emission (for airglow) and signal to noise issues.\nComparison between data and waveforms modelling are then shown by using either Normal Mode summations for remote detections or Spectral Element techniques for local detections, with an emphasis in the later case on non-linear effects and TEC post-seismic depletions. A special attention is made on the sensitivity of the waveforms to the various parameters of the models, including the sensitivity of the conversion of the seismic to atmospheric signals with the atmosphere structure, the crust subsurface and the ocean thickness and the sensitivity of the conversion of the atmospheric to ionospheric signal with respect to local time, ionospheric state and magnetic latitude.\nWe then present the perspectives in term of inversion for both the source location, early estimation of the maximum uplift generated by oceanic mega Earthquakes and the remote observations of tsunami and discuss the limitation of ionospheric seismology for future near real time measurement of the ocean vertical displacement associated to tsunami.

            "abstract": "The cascade of energy by plasma turbulence has been shown to occur in, and heat, the solar wind. Recent work in the study of solar wind turbulence has focussed, in the most part, on advanced data analysis techniques, such as third moment structure functions, wavelets, conditional data sampling, multi-spacecraft observations and reconstruction of 2D k-spectra with tomography, and statistical studies from long time series of spacecraft observations. These techniques are complex and contain different assumptions about the qualities of the data underpinning the measurements. Here, we will review recent advances and discoveries in the study of plasma turbulence from solar wind data analysis and discuss how benchmarking of techniques against one another could be pursued and how simulations can be used to aid in the understanding of the results of solar wind data analysis, in particular in the framework of the “Turbulence Dissipation Challenge” (Parashar et al., Journal of Plasma Physics, Volume 81, Issue 05, 905810513, 2015). We will pay particular attention to observing two different heating mechanisms: stochastic heating and resonant wave-particle interactions. The magnetic helicity of the solar wind is shown to separate into two distinct components, one originating from pseudo-Alfvenic (k may have a component parallel to the magnetic field) and one from the Alfvenic fluctuations (k is strictly perpendicular). The solar wind results are compared with “pseudo-spacecraft” data from large 3D PIC simulations.",

            "abstract": "Provenance studies of aeolian dust in East Asia had made much progress. The interpretations of the provenance of modern aeolian dust and paleo-dust (loess) sequences, however, still suffer disputes. To provide more scientific evidence, we present a provenance study using oxygen isotope (δ18O) of quartz as a tracer. We studied the quartz δ18O of both fine (<16μm) and coarse (16-63μm) dust fractions from major dust sources in East Asia, including the Taklimakan desert, Mongolian Gobi, Badain Juran desert, Tengger desert, Mu Us desert, and Qaidam Basin. Among them, quartz δ18O of both fractions shows consonant increasing trend from the Mongolian Gobi, to the northern Chinese deserts (i.e. Badain Juran, Tennger, and Mu Us deserts), Qaidam Basin, and then to the Taklimakan desert, indicating a decreasing igneous rock coverage in the sources. The coverage ratio survey of the igneous rocks in different sources corroborated this inference. Using quartz δ18O of both fractions can differentiate dust from the Mongolian Gobi, Taklimakan desert and the northern Chinese deserts. Combination of quartz δ18O and quartz Electronic Spinning Resonance signal intensity (ESR) - Crystalinity Index (CI) from previous studies helps further the differentiation. The bivariate plot of quartz δ18O and CI of fine fraction can make clear separation of dust from different sources, regardless of single-sourced or mixed dust, while the trivariate plot of quartz δ18O, ESR, and CI of fine fraction can further increase the differentiability. Applying quartz δ18O-CI, we found that the four natural dust storm events happening in Xi'an in the spring of 2012 mainly originated from the northern Chinese deserts. Dust entrainment monitoring by MODIS images and air mass transport route simulation by back trajectory modeling show that the dust plumes or dust-containing air parcels originating from the northern Chinese deserts reached Xi'an on those dust storm days, thus confirmed the source tracer comparison results. Our study supports the previous proximal-accumulation theory of loess formation and shows that quartz δ18O could provide valuable insights into the provenance study of aeolian dust.",

This awareness differs sharply across ideological and educational subgroups, however. It does not appear to shift in response to scientific and media discussion following a September with unusually low (2012) or somewhat higher (2013) sea ice extent. Other perceptions about Arctic change, such as impacts on mid-latitude weather, follow similar patterns with sharp ideological difference and limited response to external events, including science reports. On the other hand, public accuracy on basic factual questions that do not by themselves imply directional change (such as location of the North Pole) may be very low, and among some subgroups accurate knowledge shows an oddly negative correlation with self-confidence about understanding of climate change.

            "abstract": "Distribution of supercritical (sc) CO2 has a large impact on its flow behavior as well as on the properties of seismic waves used for monitoring. Simultaneous imaging of scCO2 distribution in a rock core using X-ray computed tomography (CT) and measurements of seismic waves in the laboratory can help understand how the distribution evolves as scCO2 invades through rock, and the resulting seismic signatures. To this end, we performed a series of laboratory scCO2 core-flood experiments in intact and fractured anisotropic Carbon Tan sandstone samples. In these experiments, we monitored changes in the CO2 saturation distribution and sonic-frequency acoustic resonances (yielding both seismic velocity and attenuation) over the course of the floods. A short-core resonant bar test system (Split-Hopkinson Resonant Bar Apparatus) custom fit into a long X-ray transparent pressure vessel was used for the seismic measurements, and a modified General Electric medical CT scanner was used to acquire X-ray CT data from which scCO2 saturation distributions were determined. The focus of the experiments was on the impact of single fractures on the scCO2 distribution and the seismic properties. For this reason, we examined several cases including 1. intact, 2. a closely mated fracture along the core axis, 3. a sheared fracture along the core axis (both vertical and horizontal for examining the buoyancy effect), and 4. a sheared fracture perpendicular to the core axis. For the intact and closely mated fractured cores, Young’s modulus declined with increasing CO2 saturation, and attenuation increased up to about 15% CO2 saturation after which attenuation declined. For cores having wide axial fractures, the Young’s modulus was lower than for the intact and closely mated cases, however did not change much with CO2 pore saturation. Much lower CO2 pore saturations were achieved in these cases. Attenuation increased more rapidly however than for the intact sample. For the core-perpendicular fracture, the Young’s modulus decreased quickly with increasing CO2 saturation. Attenuation increased with increasing CO2 saturation until the CO2 front reached the fracture, after which it fell to below that for the brine-saturated case, increasing again as the CO2 invaded the downstream core region.",

            "abstract": "In South America, larger magnitude seismic events originate in the subduction zone between the Nazca and Continental plates, as opposed to crustal events. Crustal seismic events are important in areas very close to active fault lines; however, seismic hazard analyses incorporate crust events related to a maximum distance from the site under study. In order to use crustal events as part of a seismic hazard analysis, it is necessary to use the attenuation relationships which represent the seismic behavior of the site under study. Unfortunately, in South America the amount of compiled crustal event historical data is not yet sufficient to generate a firm regional attenuation relationship. In the absence of attenuation relationships for crustal earthquakes in the region, the conventional approach is to use attenuation relationships from other regions which have a large amount of compiled data and which have similar seismic conditions to the site under study. This practice permits the development of seismic hazard analysis work with a certain margin of accuracy.\nIn South America, in the engineering practice, new generation attenuation relationships (NGA-W) are used among other alternatives in order to incorporate the effect of crustal events in a seismic hazard analysis. In 2014, the NGA-W Version 2 (NGA-W2) was presented with a database containing information from Taiwan, Turkey, Iran, USA, Mexico, Japan, and Alaska.\nThis paper examines whether it is acceptable to utilize the NGA-W2 in seismic hazard analysis in South America. A comparison between response spectrums of the seismic risk prepared in accordance with NGA-W2 and actual response spectrums of crustal events from Argentina is developed in order to support the examination. The seismic data were gathered from equipment installed in the cities of Santiago, Chile and Mendoza, Argentina.",

            "abstract": "In tracer tomography several tracer tests are performed within an aquifer and breakthrough curves are observed at multiple observation points. In the analysis, hydraulic conductivity is estimated as spatially variable, 3-D field subject to some smoothness constraint. Coupled flow and transport models using this conductivity fields are requested to meet observed tracer data. The approach can be combined with hydraulic tomography.\nWe have performed hydraulic-tomography and tracer-tomography tests using heat and fluorescein as tracers at a field site close to Tübingen, Germany. The aquifer consists of 8-9m alluvials sands and gravels overlain by 1-2m alluvial fines. The hydraulic setup consists of a forced flow field between an injection/extraction well couple, embedded in the forced flow field of another well couple. By turning injection to extraction wells, and vice versa, two different flow fields were considered. Injection wells were separated into several sections by packers, and water was injected into each section proportional to its transmissivity. The water injected into one of the sections contained the tracer. Multi-level observation wells were equiped with thermometers (for heat-tracer tests), on-line fluoremeters (for teh dye tracers), and pressure transducers. Processing of the breakthrough curves included data cleaning, non-parametric deconvolution, and calculation of temperal moments of the estimated transfer functions.\nThe joint inversion of hydraulic-head measurements and temporal moments of heat-tracer transfer functions was done by the quasi-linear geostatistical approach on a computing cluster. As alternative, we directly invert the time series (without temporal moments) by Ensemble-Kalman filtering.\nThe high diffusion coefficient of temperature diminishes the penetration of the heat-tracer into the aquifer, which can partially be compensated by reverting the flow field and repeating the tracer tests. In tests with fluorscent tracers the signal disappeared considerably slower, implying that a longer time is needed between individual tracer tests to make sure that the entire tracer has been removed before the start of the next experiment.",

            "abstract": "Biological N2 fixation, catalyzed by the metalloenzyme nitrogenase, is a critical process that makes life possible on Earth. Environmental N2 fixation has been automatically attributed to canonical Mo-based nitrogenases despite over two decades of knowledge that two other metalloenzyme forms of nitrogenase exist: those containing catalytic V or Fe-only. A key area of missing information is the contribution of the “alternative” V and Fe-only nitrogenases, as the interpretation of field data to construct budgets and assess N availability depends on the type of nitrogenase metalloenzyme used to fix N2. Additionally, substantial changes in metal speciation over geological time may have favored the use of different metalloenzymes, with implications for evolution of the biosphere. Despite the potential importance of alternative nitrogenases in modern and ancient N cycling, few methods can determine their contributions to environmental N2 fixation. Here, we present new isotopic methods to distinguish between the activities of Mo, V, and Fe-only nitrogenases. We show evidence for alternative N2 fixation in diverse environments (cyanolichens, microbial mats, sediments, leaf litter), thereby linking a key process in the nitrogen cycle to specific metalloenzyme forms of nitrogenase. The results invite a reexamination of the conditions under which the different nitrogenase metalloenzymes are active and may lead to new insights into the coupling of the cycles of nitrogen and trace metals.",

            "abstract": "The central task in estimating forest biomass from spaceborne sensors is the development of calibration equations that relate observed forest structure to biomass at a variety of spatial scales. Empirical methods generally rely on statistical estimation or machine learning techniques where field-based estimates of biomass at the plot level are associated with post-launch observations of variables such as canopy height and cover. For global-scale mapping the process is complex and leads to a number of questions: How many calibrations are required to capture non-stationarity in the relationships? Where does one calibration begin and another end? Should calibrations be conditioned by biome? Vegetation type? Land-use? Post-launch calibrations lead to further complications, such as the requirement to have sufficient field plot data underneath potentially sparse satellite observations, spatial and temporal mismatches in scale between field plots and pixels, and geolocation uncertainty, both in the plots and the satellite data. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is under development by NASA to estimate forest biomass. GEDI will deploy a multi-beam lidar on the International Space Station and provide billions of observations of forest structure per year. Because GEDI uses relatively small footprints, about 25 m diameter, post-launch calibration is exceptionally problematic for the reasons listed earlier. Instead, GEDI will use a kind of \"crowd-sourced\" calibration strategy where existing lidar observations and the corresponding plot biomass will be assembled from data contributed by the science community. Through a process of continuous updating, calibrations will be refined as more data is ingested. This talk will focus on the GEDI pre-launch calibration strategy and present initial progress on its development, and how it forms the basis for meeting mission biomass requirements.",

            "abstract": "Lidar remote sensing provides one of the best means for acquiring detailed information on forest structure. However, its application over large areas has been limited largely because of its expense. Nonetheless, extant data exist over many states in the U.S., funded largely by state and federal consortia and mainly for infrastructure, emergency response, flood plain and coastal mapping. These lidar data are almost always acquired in leaf-off seasons, and until recently, usually with low point count densities. Even with these limitations, they provide unprecedented wall-to-wall mappings that enable development of appropriate methodologies for large-scale deployment of lidar. In this talk we summarize our research and lessons learned in deriving forest structure over regional areas as part of NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS). We focus on two areas: the entire state of Maryland and Sonoma County, California. The Maryland effort used low density, leaf-off data acquired by each county in varying epochs, while the on-going Sonoma work employs state-of-the-art, high density, wall-to-wall, leaf-on lidar data. In each area we combine these lidar coverages with high-resolution multispectral imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and in situ plot data to produce maps of canopy height, tree cover and biomass, and compare our results against FIA plot data and national biomass maps. Our work demonstrates that large-scale mapping of forest structure at high spatial resolution is achievable but products may be complex to produce and validate over large areas. Furthermore, fundamental issues involving statistical approaches, plot types and sizes, geolocation, modeling scales, allometry, and even the definitions of \"forest\" and \"non-forest\" must be approached carefully. Ultimately, determining the \"price of precision\", that is, does the value of wall-to-wall forest structure data justify their expense, should consider not only carbon market applications, but the other ways the underlying lidar data may be used.",

Previously, [1] used major element geothermometers to investigate spatial variations in temperatures recorded in mantle peridotites and observed that samples near the paleo-Moho have higher closure temperatures than samples at the base of the mantle section. Motivated by these observations, we measured major and trace elements in orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in peridotites from depths of ~1-8km beneath the Moho to determine closure temperatures of REE in the samples using the REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer [2].\nClinopyroxene are depleted in LREE and have REE concentrations that vary depending on distance from the Moho. Samples nearer the Moho have lower REE concentrations than those deeper in the section (e.g., chondrite normalized Yb ranges from ~1.5 at the Moho to 4 at 8km depth), consistent with near fractional melting along a mantle adiabat. Orthopyroxene are highly depleted in LREE but measurements of middle to heavy REE have good reproducibility.\nWe find that REE-in-two-pyroxene temperatures decrease with increasing distance from the Moho, ranging from 1325±10°C near the Moho to 1063±24°C near the base of the mantle section. Using methods from [3], we calculate cooling rates of >1000°C/Myr near the Moho, dropping to rates of <10°C/Myr at the bottom of the section. The faster cooling rate is inconsistent with conductive cooling models. Fast cooling of the mantle lithosphere could be facilitated by infiltration of seawater to or beneath the petrologic Moho. This can explain why abyssal peridotites from ultra-slow spreading centers (which lack a crustal section) have cooling rates comparable to those of Oman peridotites [3].\n[1] Hanghøj et al.

            "abstract": "Primitive basalts provide an invaluable probe of the mantle's thermo-chemical structure. What these samples show is that the Earth's interior is widely variable in its trace element, isotopic and even major element composition, on the km to the hemispherical scale. This heterogeneity has profound implications for not only the history of the solid Earth, but the oceans and atmosphere as well, as it represents ~4 billions of years of elemental transport back into the mantle via subduction recycling of oceanic crustal to mantle sections. Reconstructing planetary evolution through the volcanic record of mantle composition is therefore a primary aim of igneous geochemistry.\nHowever, between the solid mantle and our chemical analyses lie a series of melt generation, aggregation and transport processes, themselves poorly understood, that are potentially critical in controlling the amplitude and style of chemical heterogeneity preserved in an erupted basalt. If these processes are also sensitive to mantle potential temperature, the degree of melting and the presence of lithological heterogeneity, then the geochemical record may not only be biased as a whole, but biased in a relative sense between different geodynamic settings: such a dichotomy may be represented by ocean islands and mid-ocean ridges.\nHere we combine observational and modelling approaches to understand how varying conditions of melt generation and transport affect basalt chemical variability. Focusing first on Iceland, we combine new and existing melt inclusion data to investigate how chemical variability may be controlled by tectonic parameters (on versus off rift) and source enrichment. We find that on Iceland the key parameter controlling variability is enrichment, with the most enriched basalts preserving diminished variability compared with more depleted eruptions. However, on a larger scale enriched sources preserve the greatest variability: we see this both in terms of the greater variability of Iceland as a whole compared to that preserved in primitive Reykjanes Ridge melt inclusions, and from a statistical analysis of global mid-ocean ridge basalts. On the local scale enrichment-variability systematics can be understood in the context of simple statistical models of melt aggregation and mixing. On larger scales source dominates.",

            "abstract": "Continental rifting is often associated with extensive magmatic activity, emplacing millions of cubic kilometres of basalt and triggering environmental change. The lasting geological record of this volcanic catastrophism are the large igneous provinces found at the margins of many continents and abrupt extinctions in the fossil record, most strikingly that found at the Permo-Triassic boundary. Rather than being considered purely a passive plate tectonic phenomenon, these episodes are frequently explained by the involvement of mantle plumes, upwellings of mantle rock made buoyant by their high temperatures. However, there has been debate over the relative role of the mantle's temperature and composition in generating the large volumes of magma involved in rift and intra-plate volcanism, and even when the mantle is inferred to be hot, this has been variously attributed to mantle plumes or continental insulation effects.\nTo help resolve these uncertainties we have combined geochemical, geophysical and modelling results in a two stage approach:\nFirstly, we have investigated how mantle composition and temperature contribute to melting beneath Iceland, the present day manifestation of the mantle plume implicated in the 54Ma break up of the North Atlantic. By considering both the igneous crustal production on Iceland and the chemistry of its basalts we have been able to place stringent constraints on the viable temperature and lithology of the Icelandic mantle. Although a >100°C excess temperature is required to generate Iceland's thick igneous crust, geochemistry also indicates that pyroxenite comprises 10% of its source. Therefore, the dynamics of rifting on Iceland are modulated both by thermal and compositional mantle anomalies.\nSecondly, we have performed a global assessment of the mantle's post break-up thermal history to determine the amplitude and longevity of continental insulation in driving excess volcanism. Using seismically constrained igneous crustal thicknesses as a proxy for mantle temperature, we find that break-up is rarely accompanied by significant thermal excesses. Importantly, even when high breakup temperatures are inferred within several million years these have decayed to background levels, limiting the long-term significance of continental insulation on rifting.",

As one of the goals of the wave problem as it is outlined is to identify how well various models capture linear physics, we compare our results to linear Vlasov and gyrokinetic theory. Preliminary gyrokinetic results match linear theory extremely well due to the geometry of the problem, which eliminates the dominant nonlinearity. With the non-reduced models, we explore how the subdominant nonlinearities manifest and affect the evolution of the turbulence and the energy budget. We also take advantage of employing continuum methods to study the dynamics of the distribution function, with particular emphasis on the full Vlasov results where a basic collision operator has been implemented. As the community prepares for the next stage of the turbulence dissipation challenge, where we hope to do large 3D simulations to inform the next generation of observational missions such as THOR (Turbulence Heating ObserveR), we argue for the consideration of hybrid Vlasov and full Vlasov as candidate models for these critical simulations. With the use of modern numerical algorithms, we demonstrate the competitiveness of our code with traditional particle-in-cell algorithms, with a clear plan for continued improvements and optimizations to further strengthen the code’s viability as an option for the next stage of the challenge.

The primary component of natural gas is methane (CH4), a powerful greenhouse gas; therefore, natural gas leakage into the atmosphere affects its climate impact.\nWe present estimates of regional methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) emissions from oil and natural gas operations in the Barnett Shale, Texas, made in March and October 2013 as part of the Environmental Defense Fund’s Barnett Coordinated Campaign. The Barnett is one of the largest production basins in the United States, with 8% of total U.S. natural gas production, and thus, our results represent a crucial step toward determining the greenhouse gas footprint of U.S. onshore natural gas production. Using a mass balance approach on eight different flight days the total CH4 emissions for the region are estimated to be 76 ± 13x 103 kg/hr, or 0.66 ± 0.11 Tg CH4 /yr; (95% CI). Repeated mass balance flights in the same basin on eight different days and two seasons demonstrate the consistency of the mass balance approach. On the basis of airborne C2H6 and CH4 measurements, we find 71-85% of the observed CH4 emissions quantified in the Barnett Shale are derived from fossil sources. The average C2H6 flux was 6.6 ± 0.2 x 103 kg/hr and consistent across six days in spring and fall of 2013. This result is the first demonstration of this approach for C2H6.\nWe estimate that 60±11x103 kg CH4/hr (95% CI) are emitted by natural gas and oil operations, including production, processing, and distribution in the urban areas of Dallas and Fort Worth. This estimate is significantly higher than emissions reported by the EDGAR inventory or by industry to EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.",

This work integrates ground- and aircraft-based measurements of site-level emissions from the campaign and a recent national study of gathering and processing facilities to construct a spatially resolved emission inventory for the Barnett Shale. Spatially referenced activity data including O&G site locations were obtained from multiple databases. O&G site emission factors were estimated with two-step Monte Carlo simulations that integrated emission rates from unbiased datasets with higher measurements obtained with targeted sampling. Emissions from other fossil and biogenic sources were estimated from reported emissions data or published emission factors. We constructed a 4 km x 4 km gridded emission inventory to estimate emissions by source category in the 25-county Barnett region. Total methane emissions in October 2013 were estimated to be 72.3 (+10.1/-8.9) Mg CH4 h-1 with 46.2 (+7.9/-6.2) from O&G sources. Fat-tail sites, which were defined as emission rates above the unbiased sampling distributions, accounted for 19% of O&G emissions but less than 2% of sites. In comparison to alternative estimates of O&G emissions based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Inventory, EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, our custom inventory was higher by factors of 1.5, 2.7, and 4.3, respectively, similar to published ratios of top-down and bottom up estimates. Our custom inventory was higher than alternatives primarily due to more complete activity data and the inclusion of fat-tail site emissions. Gathering facilities, which accounted for 40% of our O&G emission estimate, had the largest difference from alternative inventories.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed that the fabric of seafloor formed at mid-ocean ridges (MORs) records rapid (23-100 kyr) fluctuations in ridge magma supply caused by sea level changes modulating melt production in the underlying mantle. We assess the plausibility of this claim using models of crustal emplacement and faulting to derive the response function of seafloor bathymetry to a fluctuating ridge magmatic flux.\nFirst, we show that crustal thickness variations inherited from melt supply modulation on Milankovitch time scales cannot generate any sizeable topography through isostatic or flexural compensation. Further, we expect this modulation to only generate limited (<< 600 m) crustal thickness variations, because the magma storage region beneath the ridge axis is sufficiently wide to damp rapid oscillations in melt flux.\nSecond, we consider the development of topography related to volcanic extrusion on the seafloor modulated by changes in crustal thickness. We estimate this process to generate at most 40 m of topography, which could be significantly reduced by cross-axis lava flow emplacement.\nFinally, if seafloor bathymetry did record Milankovitch cycles, its dominant wavelengths should increase with increasing spreading rate. This is opposite to the observation of abyssal hill spacing decreasing from ~10 km down to ~2 km at slow to fast-spreading MORs. This observation is best explained by a model in which dominant seafloor wavelengths correspond to the spacing between successive normal faults that interact with dike injection at the ridge axis as they grow. Our models show that fault spacing is controlled by the time-average rate of magma injection and is insensitive to variations in injection rates on all Milankovitch frequencies.\nThus, we conclude that the \"climate frequencies\" found in some bathymetry datasets reflect only the inherent spacing of faults, set by the mechanical properties of the lithosphere and the average MOR magma supply.",

With increasing resolution of hydrological networks, optimized methods for storage of network representation in databases, and efficient queries and actions on the river network structure become critical. This presentation provides a comprehensive study on analysis of network models in relational databases for hydrological networks, and benchmarking common queries and operations on the network structure using these methods. The analysis has been applied to the hydrological network of the State of Iowa based on 90m DEM consist of 600,000 network nodes. The application results indicate that certain representation methods provide massive improvements on query times and storage of network structure in the database. Suggested method allows watershed delineation tools running on the client-side with desktop-like performance.

            "abstract": "The interaction of the Jovian magnetospheric environment with an atmosphere and induced dipole at Callisto is investigated by applying a hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulation code. Callisto is unique among the Galilean satellites in its interaction with the ambient magnetospheric plasma as the gyroradii of the impinging plasma and pickup ions are large compared to the size of the moon. A kinetic representation of the ions is therefore mandatory to adequately describe the resulting asymmetries in the electromagnetic fields and the deflection of the plasma flow near Callisto. When Callisto is embedded in the magnetodisk lobes of Jupiter, a dipolar magnetic field is generated via induction in a subsurface ocean. This field creates an obstacle to the impinging magnetospheric plasma flow at the moon. However, when Callisto is located near the center of the Jovian current sheet, local magnetic perturbations due to the magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction are more than twice the strength of the background field and may therefore obscure any magnetic signal generated via induction in a subsurface ocean. Our simulations demonstrate that the deflection of the magnetospheric plasma into Callisto's wake cannot alone explain the plasma density enhancement of two orders of magnitude measured in the wake of the interaction region during Galileo flybys of the moon. However, through inclusion of an ionosphere around Callisto, modeled densities in the wake are consistent with in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "When we analyze a large ensemble RCP8.5 climate change experiment we find that heat waves have become more common and intense in the Great Plains during 2070-2100 compared to 1980-2010. Much of this can be attributed to the simple direct additive effect of a 5.8°C increase in Jun-Aug surface mean temperatures in that region. But there is also a non-additive effect in that daily temperature departures from the new mean during heat waves are about 0.6°C warmer in the future epoch. Here we consider two often-proposed mechanisms by which this change in the variability of surface temperature could result from indirect influences of changes in the mean state.\nOne mechanism involves changes in the variability of upper tropospheric planetary waves, which we are especially interested in because we have found planetary wave structures that both affect the likelihood of heat waves and have unusually high predictability on subseasonal time scales. Our analysis does show that the amplitude of planetary wave variability has been modified in the future modeled climate. And calculations with a mechanistic model show this is indeed a consequence of the change in the mean circulation. But further analysis indicates this modification of planetary wave fluctuations is probably not responsible for the increase in Great Plains heat waves. By contrast we find changes in the magnitude of surface fluxes during heat wave events could be responsible for their strengthening and these can be attributed to the decrease in soil moisture that occurs during the future period. Hence it is changes in zonally asymmetric mean land surface quantities rather than changes in upper tropospheric fluctuations brought on by changes to the mean circulation that are of primary importance in producing the enhanced variability of surface temperature in the future climate.",

Plate reconstructions assume the continental island behaves as a rigid block, but studies of geologically recent kinematics suggest Madagascar undergoes extension related to the broader EARS. In this work we test for rigidity of Madagascar in two steps. First, we quantify surface motions using a novel dataset of episodic and continuous GNSS observations that span Madagascar from north to south. We established a countrywide network of precision benchmarks fixed in bedrock and with open skyview in 2010 that we measured for 48-72 hours with dual frequency receivers. The benchmarks were remeasured in 2012 and 2014. We processed the episodic GNSS data with ABPO, the only continuous GNSS station in Madagascar with >2.5 years of data, for millimeter precision positions and velocities at 7 locations using GAMIT-GLOBK. Our velocity field shows 2 mm/yr of differential motion between southern and northern Madagascar. Second, we test a suite of kinematic predictions from previous studies and find residual velocities are greater than 95% uncertainties. We also calculate angular velocity vectors assuming Madagascar moves with the Lwandle plate or the Somalian plate. Our new velocity field in Madagascar is inconsistent with all models that assume plate rigidity at the 95% uncertainty level; this result indicates the continental island undergoes statistically significant internal deformation.",

            "abstract": "Forest harvest regimes are changing as land managers cope with fires, drought, and insect damage. Thinning on public lands, typically focused on removal of small trees that could act as fuel ladders, is increasing to reduce risk of crown fires and reduce competition for water in crowded stands. On private lands, drought and wildfires could lead to further shortening of harvest cycles (e.g. from 80 to 45 years) or thinning. To examine the effects of potential changes in management regimes vs climate on carbon processes in forests of Oregon, California and Washington, we used data from ancillary plots, inventories, and satellites to parameterize and test the CLM4.5 model. We first examined contemporary biomass loss over the western US to determine the baseline conditions prior to implementing harvest scenarios. Annual biomass mortality from fires and insects increased significantly (1996-2011), and mortality from insects was about twice that of fires. California, Oregon and Idaho were most impacted by fire-related biomass mortality, whereas Colorado, Montana and Washington were most impacted by insects. Harvest scenarios implemented in CLM4.5 include two thinning scenarios to reduce crown fire risk and drought stress, and a salvage scenario to remove trees remaining after recent beetle or fire related mortality; taking into account our previous work showing 70 – 85 % of salvaged biomass is removed and the remainder is left on-site. We simulated the effect of treatments on current and future net ecosystem carbon balance. Challenges of regional modeling of management effects on carbon and other important considerations are addressed.",

Although both the hydrological and socio-economic dimensions are complex, practitioners need simple and credible models to address pressing questions brought by global change.\nWe developed such a model for the supply, service, and value of water provisioning; available to the ES community through the open-source InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosytem Services and Trade-offs) software. The model is characterized by i) low data requirements, with the aim of being applied in data-scarce environments; ii) spatially-explicit outputs, to easily address spatial planning questions; iii) a seasonal time-step, representing a compromise between data knowledge and ability to address season-dependent questions (water supply for irrigation, hydropower production); iv) explicit representation of beneficiaries, to facilitate valuation of the provisioning service for different groups; v) flexible valuation framework, to address a variety of ES questions.\nThe model theory is based on the recent advances in hydrology, using the “limits” concept for water balance modeling and spatial indices for subsurface and surface runoff. We tested the model performance in the Mad River catchment, Vermont, USA, comparing its results with the data-intensive RHESSys model for two typical ES questions: the identification of hotspots of service and valuation of the provisioning service for hydropower production. Uncertainty analyses, including sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo analyses, were performed to quantify uncertainty in both hydrological outputs and service provisioning, and improve guidance for users. We present these results through a range of spatial and non-spatial outputs, emphasizing the importance of results interpretation and visualization for ES assessments.",

Users of these data must therefore take these aspects formally into account when comparing these remotely sensed data to models or independent measurements.\nIn this presentation I will summarize how profiles of the HDO/H2O ratio are inferred from Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer thermal IR radiances and then how to account for the vertical resolution and regularization used in this “retrieval” when comparing to other models and data. In particular I will show comparisons of these satellite data to aircraft and model profiles of HDO and H2O as well as discuss previous and ongoing research into the global water cycle, climate, and paleo-climate that use these data.",

Regions containing significant pickup ion populations have been observed to exhibit a rich variety of electromagnetic plasma wave phenomena, the characteristics and properties of which can be used to infer the ion species present, their spatial and temporal distributions, and the global ionisation rates of the neutral material. In this study we present hybrid (kinetic ion, massless fluid electron) simulations of ion pickup and Ion Cyclotron (IC) waves observed in the Jovian magnetosphere and draw comparisons to sub-alfvénic pickup observed by Cassini in the Saturnian system, and also to supra-alfvénic pickup at planetary bodies immersed directly in the solar wind. At Jupiter, Europa has been identified as the secondary mass loader in the magnetosphere, orbiting within a neutral gas torus at ~9.38 Rj. Near Europa, Galileo magnetometer observations displayed bursty IC wave characteristics at the gyrofrequency of a number of species including SO2, K, Cl, O2, and Na, suggesting a complex mass loading environment. A particular deduction from the dataset was the presence of both positively and negatively charged pickup ions, inferred from the left and right hand polarisations of the transverse waves. Using hybrid simulations for both positively and negatively charged Cl pickup ions we are able to self-consistently reproduce the growth of both right and left hand near-circularly polarised waves in agreement with linear theory and, using the observed wave amplitudes, estimate Cl pickup ion densities at Europa.",

Multivariate pattern recognition techniques of principle component and factor analyses, in concert with Pearson correlation analysis, were applied to map interrelations and identify latent patterns of the participatory variables. Relative linkages of the in-stream water quality variables with their associated drivers were then quantified by developing dimensionless partial least squares (PLS) regression model based on standardized data. Model fitting efficiency (R2=0.71-0.87) and accuracy (ratio of root-mean-square error to the standard deviation of the observations, RSR=0.35-0.53) suggested good predictions of the water quality variables in both wet and dry seasons. Agricultural land and groundwater exhibited substantial controls on surface water quality. In-stream TN concentration appeared to be mostly contributed by the upstream water entering from Everglades in both wet and dry seasons. In contrast, watershed land uses had stronger linkages with TP and Chla than that of the watershed hydrologic and upstream (Everglades) components for both seasons. Both land use and hydrologic components showed strong linkages with DO in wet season; however, the land use linkage appeared to be less in dry season. The data-analytics method provided a comprehensive empirical framework to achieve crucial mechanistic insights into the urban stream water quality processes. Our study quantitatively identified dominant drivers of water quality, indicating key management targets to maintain healthy stream ecosystems in complex urban-natural environments near the coast.",

However, observations and 3D particle-in-cell simulations show that the primary process in the formation of dipolarization fronts, new X-lines, interchange fingers and flapping motions may be the spontaneous formation of bulk earthward plasma flows. It appears in tearing-unstable configurations with a tailward gradient of the normal magnetic field Bz. The earthward motion arising in these regions results in the formation of dipolarization fronts (DFs). While monopolar Bz variations in DFs can be explained by the MHD snowplow compression of plasma ahead of the front, the formation of new X-lines ahead of and behind the front occurs as a part of the kinetic process of the plasma bubble formation. This process enhances (initially mild) buoyancy of the magnetotail plasma sheet and thus instigates ballooning/interchange and flapping instabilities. We compare the properties of reconnection, buoyancy and flapping transients at the front, ahead and behind it as well as the corresponding energy conversion and plasma heating.",

            "abstract": "Recent findings in theory, observations and 3D particle-in-cell simulations of magnetotail explosions reveal a complex picture of reconnection, buoyancy and flapping motions, which have interesting correlations with the auroral morphology. First, the formation of the tailward Bz gradient as a theoretical prerequisite for tearing, ballooning/interchange and flapping instabilities is consistent with the structure of the pre-onset quiet arc and the associated deep minimum of Bz. Another distinctive pre-onset feature, equatorward extension of the auroral oval in the late growth phase, is conventionally associated with earthward motion of the inner edge of the plasma sheet. However, if open magnetic flux saturates in the late growth phase, it may also be treated as a signature of magnetic flux accumulation tailward of the Bz minimum, which is also favorable for the tail plasma sheet instabilities. 3D PIC simulations of similar magnetotail equilibria with a tailward Bz gradient show spontaneous formation of earthward flows led by dipolarization fronts. They are structured in the dawn-dusk direction on the ion inertial scale, consistent with the minimum scales of the observed auroral beads. At the same time, simulations show the formation of a new X-line in the wake of the dipolarization front with no significant spatial modulation in the dawn-dusk direction suggesting smooth profiles of the substorm current wedge as well as poleward parts of auroral streamers. Flapping motions, which also grow at the dipolarization front, extend beyond it, up to the new X-line region. To understand auroral manifestations of tail structures in our simulations we investigate the plasma moments at the plasma sheet boundary.",

            "abstract": "The Central and Eastern Anatolian plateaus are integral parts of the world’s third largest orogenic plateau. Geophysical surveys that have provided insights into the crust, lithosphere, and mantle beneath Eastern Anatolia are now accompanied by recent work in Central Anatolia constraining uplift along its northern and southern margins. Together with predictions from geodynamic models, the observations can be integrated to identify probable mechanisms of plateau growth.\nA changeover from shortening to extension along the southern margin of Central Anatolia coeval with the start of uplift in the latest Miocene is likely associated with oceanic slab break-off following Arabia-Eurasia collision. This interpretation is supported by tomography, seismicity, and the pattern of uplift. Based on geological observations and model predictions, slab break-off likely occurred first beneath Eastern Anatolia in middle Miocene time and propagated westward toward Cyprus by the latest Miocene. Uplift at the northern margin of Central Anatolia appears to result from crustal shortening starting in the late Miocene, which has been linked to the broad restraining bend of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). The uplift history of the Central Anatolian interior is unclear, although shortening was superseded by extension in the late Miocene. This change in the deformation style coincides with faster retreat of the Hellenic trench as well as uplift of the northern and southern margins of Central Anatolia.\nThese different events may be linked, as faster retreat of the Hellenic trench has been predicted to occur after slab break-off, which could have induced extension of Central Anatolia and helped to form the NAF through accelerated westward escape of Anatolia. Overall, geochronologic evidence supports the hypothesis that tectonic and geodynamic plateau-forming activity throughout the Aegean-Anatolian domain in the Miocene defines a series of events that may all be linked to slab break-off.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater in sub-Saharan Africa where rainfall and river discharge are unreliable and per-capita reservoir storage is among the lowest in the world. Groundwater is widely considered a distributed, low-cost and climate-resilient option to meet rapidly growing freshwater demand and alleviate endemic poverty by expanding access to safe water and improving food security through irrigation. Recent research indicates that groundwater storage in Africa is about 100 times greater than annual river discharge yet major uncertainties remain in the magnitude and nature of replenishment through recharge as well as the impacts of land-use and climate change. Here, we present newly compiled, multi-decadal observations of groundwater levels from 5 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, Tanzania, Uganda) and paired measurements of stable isotope ratios of O and H in precipitation and groundwater at 11 locations. These data reveal both a distinct bias in groundwater recharge to intensive rainfall and rapid recharge pathways (e.g. focused, macropore flow) that are inconsistent with conventional recharge models assuming pore-matrix flow defined by the Darcy-Richards equation. Further the records highlight the substantial influence of land-use change (e.g. conversion of natural, perennial cover to croplands) on groundwater recharge. The compiled observations also provide, for the first time, a pan-African baseline to evaluate the performance of large-scale hydrological models and Land-Surface Models incorporating groundwater in this region. Our results suggest that the intensification of precipitation brought about by global warming favours groundwater replenishment in sub-Saharan Africa. As such, groundwater may prove to be a climate-resilient source of freshwater in the tropics, enabling adaptive strategies such as groundwater-fed irrigation and sustaining domestic and industrial water supplies.",

            "abstract": "In-situ isotopic analyses can be used to identify diffusion-controlled zoning in minerals. Recent studies [1,2] show that in olivine, diffusion-driven chemical zoning is associated with negatively coupled Mg-Fe isotopic profiles. Crystallization in a slowly cooled magmatic body, on the other hand, produces no isotopic fractionation. A wealth of information can be obtained from chemical-isotopic profiles measured in olivines if the ß-exponent, as in D1/D2 = (m2/m1)^ß (where D is diffusivity and m is mass), can be experimentally determined. For this purpose, we have performed diffusion experiments at 1,400 °C using crystallographically oriented Fo90-Fo100 crystals.\nWe will present the experiments as well as modeling results to show how at a given ß-exponent, isotopic fractionations are affected by crystal growth rates and boundary conditions (e.g. changes in melt composition driven by changes in temperature) used in the model. When the Péclet number (νR/D, where ν is the crystal growth rate, R is radius and D is diffusivity) is less than 100, crystal growth does not affect isotopic fractionations significantly. As for the effect of boundary conditions, isotopic fractionation increases with increasing compositional contrast between olivine and melt. This means that isotopic fractionations may be used to constrain boundary conditions, which in turn affect calculated cooling timescales.\nWe will demonstrate the virtue of modeling both chemical and isotopic profiles in a zoned olivine using a natural sample. While a large number of randomly generated time-temperature histories can produce good fits to the measured Mg-Fe chemical profile, only a few can produce acceptable fits to the measured Mg-Fe isotopic profiles in the zoned olivine. Thus, by modeling both chemical and isotopic profiles in zoned minerals, thermal histories of magmatic bodies may be determined with a new level of confidence.\n[1] Sio et al.

            "abstract": "Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is increasingly recognised as an essential technique for a structured and quantitative approach to the calibration and diagnostic evaluation of environmental models. However, the implementation and interpretation of GSA is complicated by a number of choices that users need to make and for which multiple, equally sensible, options are often available. These choices include in the first place the choice of the GSA method, as well as many implementation details like the definition of the sampling space and strategy. The issue is exacerbated by computational complexity, in terms of both computing time and storage space needed to run the model, which might strongly constrain the number of experiments that can be afforded. While several algorithmic improvements can be adopted to reduce the computing burden of specific GSA methods, in this talk we discuss how a multi-method approach can be established to maximise the information gathered from an individual sample of model evaluations. Using as an example the GSA of a land surface model, we show how different analytical and approximation techniques can be applied sequentially to the same sample of model inputs and outputs, providing complimentary information about the model behaviour from different angles, and allowing for testing the impact of the choices made to generate the sample. We further expand our analysis to show how GSA is interconnected with model calibration and uncertainty analysis, so that a careful design of the simulation experiment can be used to address different questions simultaneously.",

Model experiments were conducted on synthetic samples containing single-domain (SD), pseudosingle-domain (PSD), or multidomain (MD) magnetite grains, as well as mixture of SD and MD magnetite. In order to model a natural remanent magnetization (NRM) before the experiments, a thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) was imparted in the samples in a 50 μT magnetic field. LTD was performed after each Thellier heating by three successive cycles of the samples through the Verwey transition temperature (~120 K) in a field-free environment. The magnetic remanence was measured both before and after each LTD. The effect of LTD on paleointensity determinations from SD samples was negligible; both pre-LTD and post-LTD data defined linear high-temperature (>300°C) segments on the Arai plots that yielded paleofield values statistically indistinguishable from the field of original TRM acquisition. The PSD and SD/MD mixture samples yielded concave-up Arai plots underestimating the laboratory field by 10-20 percent. The LTD treatment resulted in steeper and more linear high-temperature (>350°C) segments on the Arai plots giving accurate estimates of the TRM acquisition field. The Arai plots measured from MD samples were substantially non-linear and failed to provide acceptable paleointensity results both before and after LTD. Our experimental results indicate that the integration of LTD with the Thellier experimental protocol improves the accuracy and quality of paleointensity determinations from samples containing SD and PSD magnetite, but is ineffective for very large, MD grains.",

            "abstract": "Rejuvenation of crystal-rich magma bodies leading to eruption can occur on a variety of scales and in varied tectonic settings. Two examples from the Aleutian arc highlight 1) segregation of silicic melt from an intermediate mush, and 2) “defrosting” of a shallowly emplaced intrusion. Augustine Volcano erupted a late Pleistocene rhyolite pumice fall that we link through zircon geochronology to cumulate dioritic blocks, ripped from Augustine’s shallow magmatic plumbing system and ejected during the 2006 eruption. Unpolished zircon rims from the rhyolite yield a U-Th age of ~25 ka, and interiors yield a dominant age population of ~26 ka. Zircons from diorites have interior ages and compositions indistinguishable from those of the rhyolite. The diorites, rhyolite, and early Holocene dacites define whole-rock linear unmixing trends consistent with melt (rhyolite) extraction from a mush (dacites), leaving behind a cumulate residue (diorites). A volatile-rich basalt erupted just prior to the rhyolite likely facilitated melt extraction from the mush. The rhyolitic Hayes River ignimbrite, erupted from Hayes volcano, contains dense porphyry blocks that match pumices in composition and phenocryst content and are samples of a shallow intrusion. Autocrystic monazite accommodated up to several weight % Th and significantly affected the U-Th ratio of the magma during differentiation. An isochron for early melt and low-U monazites yields an age of ~67 ka, whereas one for late melt and high-U monazites yields ~42 ka. This younger age is indistinguishable from the laser single crystal Ar-Ar age for sanidine of 41±2 ka (1 sigma). We interpret the apparent ~25 k.y. crystallization interval to represent the assembly and differentiation timescale associated with the Hayes magma body. Sharp reverse zoning in sanidine from pumice (but not porphyry) records a thermal pulse not seen in the more slowly reacting phases, suggesting that a rejuvenation event occurred just prior to eruption.",

            "abstract": "We use volatile and trace element contents from quartz-hosted melt inclusions to place constraints on the pre-eruptive storage and evolution of 6 lavas and 3 tuffs from the Central Plateau Member Rhyolites, Yellowstone. Overall, inclusions contain 1.0-2.5% H2O and 50-600 ppm CO2. Individual units have more restricted volatile contents, and define regions in H2O and CO2 space with internal variability of ±0.5 wt.% and ±100 ppm, respectively. Water contents in both lavas and pyroclastic units are similar, but CO2 contents vary and can be used to separate the units as CO2-rich and CO2-poor. CO2-rich units contain 300 to 600 ppm CO2 (Tuff of Bluff Point, Pitchstone Plateau, Trischmann Knob, Buffalo Lake, Summit Lake). CO2-poor units contain 50 to 200 ppm CO2 (Solfatara Plateau, West Yellowstone, Tuff of Cold Mountain Creek, unnamed tuff on Douglas Knob). Volatile contents do not correlate with eruption age, volume, or style. Inclusions from individual units contain incompatible trace-element concentrations that range from primitive to evolved. Incompatible elements within each unit increase systematically from primitive inclusions (units differ by <20%), to more evolved inclusions, and finally to highly evolved matrix. The inclusions preserve a systematic evolution produced by crystal fractionation, which we estimate to range from 38±8 wt.% to 54±11 wt.%. Inclusions from the Tuffs of Bluff Point and Cold Mountain Creek display similar evolution, except that matrix glass in those tuffs is less evolved than the inclusions. We infer the magmas were volatile-saturated at depth because H2O and CO2 do not correlate positively with incompatible elements. If true, then the CO2-rich magmas were stored at 90 to 150 MPa and contained a fluid that was 60-75 mol.% CO2, whereas CO2-poor magmas were stored at 50 to 70 MPa and contained a more H2O-rich fluid (XCO2 = 40-60%). The variations in pressure/depth suggest the magmas were at least temporarily stored as separate batches that followed similar evolutionary paths in the shallow crust.",

This communication reports on studies carried out for a set of river basins in equatorial Africa, tributaries of the Atlantic Gulf of Guinea: the Ogooue River in Gabon, the Kouilou River in Congo, and the basins of South Cameroon. These rivers are compared to the Congo River. A new monthly gridded rainfall dataset, and streamflow from selected rivers where used in the analysis. The observed changes include changes in seasonal pattern of rainfall and changes in monthly streamflow regimes. The study shows a decrease of rainfall in the southern hemisphere during February to May since the end of the 80s, while the decrease is much more limited in the Northern hemisphere.\nFor the equatorial rivers, the March–June flood decreased steadily between the 70s and 80s, in correlation with a slight decrease of the rainfall between March and June, while the October–December flood showed no change. This trend was confirmed during the 2000s for the Ogooue River from updated times series, including a shift of the maximum in April instead of May. Locally, the dry season (July–September) disappeared on the coastal basin of the Kienke River at Kribi in Cameroon. It seems that these two months of July and August have become part of a ‘single’ large rainy season instead of separating the former two rainy seasons.\nA slight decrease in seasonal rainfall together with a small change in the intra-seasonal rainfall distribution, most probably led to one of the biggest change in hydrological regimes in Equatorial Africa, which could be a clue to understanding climate change in the region. This rainfall change is different for the Congo River which large basins integrates various climatic forcings.",

            "abstract": "Cereal grains remain as the most important source of calories for the majority of human population. Yet drought has adversely affected their production which co-varies with factors such as crop species, phenological phases and agro-ecosystem. The extent to which those factors affect the vulnerability of cereal agriculture to drought, however, remains unclear. Using a meta-analysis approach, this study aims to better characterize the effects of these factors and to provide critical information on minimizing yield loss. We collected data from peer-reviewed publications between 1980 and 2015 which examined cereal yield responses to drought using field experiments. We performed unweighted analysis using the log response ratio to calculate the bootstrapped confidence limits of yield responses and calculated drought sensitivities for different species (i.e., maize, wheat, rice, barley, sorghum, millet), phenological phases (i.e., vegetative, reproductive, and throughout growing season), soil texture (i.e., fine, medium, coarse), and agro-ecosystems (i.e., dryland vs non-dryland). Our result showed that yield reduction varied with species, with wheat having lower sensitivity and yield reduction (20.6%) compared to maize (39.3%) at approximately 60% water reduction. Millet had the lowest yield reduction compared to other cereal species while rice showed a sharp decline in yield with greater than 50% of water reduction. Drought that occurred during crop reproductive phase caused greater yield reduction (30%) than that occurred during vegetative phase (20%). Maize was particularly sensitive to yield loss when drought occurred during reproductive phase while other cereal species tended to have similar sensitivity to drought during vegetative or reproductive phase. We also found that cereal cultivation in the drylands was more prone to yield loss than in the non-dryland regions, but no difference was observed among different soil textures.",

            "abstract": "Surface temperatures in Alaska have increased by 2° C since 1950, causing an acceleration in glacier mass loss and an increasing contribution to global sea level rise. This glacial retreat began at the end of the Little Ice Age in the late 19th century, and early glacial fluctuations during the Medieval Climate Anomaly are known from AK moraine chronologies. Glacier mass balance is most susceptible to summertime temperatures, but instrumental records only extend to the early 20th century, and few paleoclimate records preserve a pure summertime record of past temperatures. A high-resolution record of past Alaskan summertime temperatures would improve glaciological model hindcasts of MCA and LIA advances and retreats, and improve predictions of future glacial melt under various warming scenarios. Here we present an ice core melt layer record from a plateau location on Mt. Hunter (63° N, 151° W, 4,000 meters above sea level), providing a robust proxy of central AK summertime temperatures over the past 1000 years. Melt layers in the ice core were identified visually and quantified by brightness contrast with the surrounding ice matrix. Melt layer taphonomy due to densification, thinning and ice core quality was taken into account in developing the record. Our results show that melt layers were present in the ice core between the years 1000-1500 before nearly disappearing between the years 1500 and 1900 (about 0-3 events/century). During the early 20th century, the study site experienced a rapid 20-fold increase in the frequency of melt events. Since the year 1900, melt events have occurred during 35% percent of summers, with an acceleration of melt frequency in the late 20th century. Using modern meteorological records from the Alaska Range, we estimate that this increase in melt equates to an increase of 3-4° C in mean summer temperature.",

A coordinated research campaign in October 2013 used simultaneous top-down and bottom-up approaches to quantify total and fossil methane emissions in the Barnett Shale region of Texas. Research teams have published individual results including aircraft mass-balance estimates of regional emissions and a bottom-up, 25-county region spatially-resolved inventory. This work synthesizes data from the campaign to directly compare top-down and bottom-up estimates. A new analytical approach uses statistical estimators to integrate facility emission rate distributions from unbiased and targeted high emission site datasets, which more rigorously incorporates the fat-tail of skewed distributions to estimate regional emissions of well pads, compressor stations, and processing plants. The updated spatially-resolved inventory was used to estimate total and fossil methane emissions from spatial domains that match seven individual aircraft mass balance flights. Source apportionment of top-down emissions between fossil and biogenic methane was corroborated with two independent analyses of methane and ethane ratios. Reconciling top-down and bottom-up estimates of fossil methane emissions leads to more accurate assessment of natural gas supply chain emission rates and the relative contribution of high emission sites. These results increase our confidence in our understanding of the climate impacts of natural gas relative to more carbon-intensive fossil fuels and the potential effectiveness of mitigation strategies.",

These seeps are located along the upper feather-edge of the methane clathrate hydrate stability zone. Water column samples were collected guided by the acoustic identification of bubble streams in a 32 km2 region. This presentation details the measurements of dissolved methane concentration, natural stable isotopes, potential methane oxidation rates, and current velocity which were used in chemical and isotopic models to quantify (1) the total emission of methane to the water column in this region and (2) the extent of aerobic methane oxidation. In addition, the timing, efficiency, and kinetics of aerobic methane oxidation were investigated with mesocosm incubations of seawater in a unique experimental design that enabled high temporal resolution data acquisition.

            "abstract": "Methane emissions across the natural gas supply chain are dominated at any one time by a few high-emitters (super-emitters or fat-tail of the distribution), often underrepresented in published datasets used to construct emission inventories. Characterization of high-emitters is essential for improving emission estimates based on atmospheric data (top-down) and emission inventories (bottom-up).\nThe population of high-emitters (e.g. 10-20% of sites that account for 80-90% of the emissions) is temporally and spatially dynamic. As a consequence, it is challenging to design sampling methods and construct estimates that accurately represent their frequency and magnitude of emissions.\nWe present new methods to derive facility-specific emission distribution functions that explicitly integrate the influence of the relatively rare super-emitters. These methods were applied in the Barnett Shale region to construct a custom emission inventory that is then compared to top-down emission estimates for the region. We offer a methodological framework relevant to the design of future sampling campaigns, in which these high-emitters are seamlessly incorporated to representative emissions distributions. This framework can be applied to heterogeneous oil and gas production regions across geographies to obtain accurate regional emission estimates.\nAdditionally, we characterize emissions relative to the fraction of a facility’s total methane throughput; an effective metric to identify sites with excess emissions resulting from avoidable operating conditions, such as malfunctioning equipment (defined here as functional super-emitters). This work suggests that identifying functional super-emitters and correcting their avoidable operating conditions would result in significant emission reductions. However, due to their spatiotemporal dynamic behavior, achieving and maintaining uniformly low emissions across the entire population of sites will require mitigation steps (e.g. leak detection and repair) at a large fraction of sites.",

            "abstract": "Radiative forcing resulting from major volcanic eruptions has been a dominant driver of climate variability during Earth’s history. Including volcanic forcing in climate model simulations is therefore essential to recreate past climate variability, and provides the opportunity to test the ability of models to respond accurately to external forcing. Ice cores provide estimates of the volcanic sulfate loadings from past eruptions, from which radiative forcing can be reconstructed, with associated uncertainties. Using prior reconstructions, climate models have reproduced the gross features of global mean temperature variability reconstructed from climate proxies, although some significant differences between model results and reconstructions remain. There is much less confidence in the accuracy of the dynamical responses to volcanic forcing produced by climate models, and thus the regional aspects of post-volcanic climate anomalies are much more uncertain—a result which mirrors uncertainties in the dynamical responses to future climate change. Improvements in model’s response to volcanic forcing may be possible through improving the accuracy of the forcing data. Recent advances on multiple fronts have motivated the development of a next-generation volcanic forcing timeseries for use in climate models, based on (1) improved dating and precision of ice core records, (2) better understanding of the atmospheric transport and microphysical evolution of volcanic aerosol, including its size distribution, and (3) improved representations of the spatiotemporal structure of volcanic radiative forcing. A new volcanic forcing data set, covering the past 2500 years, will be introduced and compared with prior reconstructions. Preliminary results of climate model simulations using the new forcing will also be shown, and current and future applications of the forcing set discussed.",

However, the potential for threshold crossing events in polar climate elements with untenable consequences for society and ecosystems may motivate consideration of additional “climate interventions”. A recent National Research Council study identified risks and research needs associated with global scale intervention options such as atmospheric carbon removal and albedo modification. In addition to the issues raised by the NRC panel, any serious study of climate interventions would likely transcend the traditional scope of earth system science. Current observational systems are not designed to detect, attribute or monitor climate intervention attempts and would warrant significant augmentation. Potential field experiments to improve scientific understanding of albedo modification options would likely span a huge range of physical scales, material and energy (some in-family with established atmospheric research but others that would be wholly unprecedented). Targeted interventions focused on polar climate elements have received even less study than global-scale intervention and their consideration could present unique challenges. Finally, research priorities have not yet been informed by any strategy or scenarios about where and when climate interventions might fit in society’s portfolio of climate responses.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) play key roles in atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and radiative forcing, and contribute to nitric acid deposition. Sources of NOx include both natural and anthropogenic emissions, which vary significantly in space and time. NOx isotopic signatures offer a potentially valuable tool to trace source impacts on atmospheric chemistry and regional acid deposition. Previous work on NOx isotopic signatures suggests large ranges in values, even from the same emission source, as well as overlapping ranges amongst different sources, making it difficult to use the isotopic composition as a quantitative tracer of source influences. These prior measurements have utilized a variety of methods for collecting the NOx as nitrate or nitrite for isotopic analysis, and testing of some of these methods (including active and passive collections) reveal inconsistencies in efficiency of collection, as well as issues related to changes in conditions such as humidity, temperature, and NOx fluxes. A recently developed method allows for accurately measuring the nitrogen isotopic composition of NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) after capturing the NOx in a potassium permanganate/sodium hydroxide solution as nitrate (Fibiger et al., Anal. Chem., 2014). The method has been thoroughly tested in the laboratory and field, and efficiently collects NO and NO2 under a variety of conditions. There are several advantages to collecting NOx actively, including the ability to collect over minutes to hourly time scales, and the ability to collect in environments with highly variable NOx sources and concentrations. Challenges include a nitrate background present in potassium permanganate (solid and liquid forms), accurately deriving ambient NOx concentrations based upon flow rate and solution concentrations above this variable background, and potential interferences from other nitrogen species. This method was designed to collect NOx in environments with very different emission source loadings in an effort to isotopically characterize NOx sources. Results to date suggest very different values, and less variability than previous work, particularly for vehicle emissions. Ultimately, we aim to determine whether the influence of NOx sources can be quantitatively tracked in the environment.",

The data may also provide the insight necessary for constraining the timing of important transitions within the Earth’s interior, and for investigating potential causative links between the long-term behavior of the geomagnetic field and the evolution of atmosphere and biosphere. In the absence of strict theoretical constraints, paleomagnetic data represent a principal source of information about the Precambrian field. However, paleointensity determination represents one of the most challenging aspects of paleomagnetic research so that the paleointensity database remains rather limited especially for older epochs. Detailed analysis of the Precambrian paleointensity database indicates that some accepted paleointensity values might be biased by a variety of factors including the presence of non-ideal magnetic carriers, geological and laboratory alteration, and others. In addition, the abundance of low field values in the database may reflect the effect of thermochemical remanent magnetization (TCRM). We will discuss non-conventional experimental approaches that may circumvent or mitigate some of these problems and hence result in a significant increase in the number of reliable paleointensity determinations for the Precambrian. We also will discuss the Precambrian paleointensity database in the context of current models of the long-term geomagnetic and thermal evolution of our planet.",

With more than 1480 peer-reviewed journal publications and 40 books to its credit, NEESPI’s activities resulted in significant scientific outreach. This created a new research realm through self-organization of NEESPI scientists in a broad research network, accumulation of knowledge while developing new tools (observations, models, and collaborative networks) and producing new, exciting results that can be applied to directly support decision-making for societal needs. This realm was summed up at the Synthesis NEESPI Workshop in Prague, Czech Republic (April 9-12, 2015) where it was decided to shift gradually the foci of regional studies in Northern Eurasia towards applications with the following major Science Question: “ What dynamic and interactive change(s) will affect societal well-being, activities, and health, and what might be the mitigation and adaptation strategies that could support sustainable development and decision-making activities in Northern Eurasia?”. To answer this question requires a stronger socio-economic component in the ongoing and future regional studies focused on sustainable societal development under changing climatic and environmental conditions, especially, under conditions when societal decision-making impacts and feeds back on the environment. This made the NEESPI studies closer to the ICSU research initiative “Future Earth”. Accordingly, the NEESPI Research Team decided to reorganize in the nearest future NEESPI into “Northern Eurasia Future Initiative” (NEFI) and began development of its Programmatic White Paper (in preparation at the time of this abstract submission). The NEFI research foci emerged in discussions within the NEESPI community during the past 12 months. Presentation will provide justification of these foci and approach examples addressing them.

The main idea of the method is an improving the traditional linear methods for data decomposition by taking into account nonlinear couplings between the variables. Actually, the method is aimed to reveal a few hidden dynamical signals which explain an essential part of data and are interpreted as dominant internal modes driving the observed multivariate dynamics. Bayesian optimality is used for selecting relevant structure of the nonlinear transformation, including both the number of principal modes and the degree of nonlinearity. We applied the expansion to monthly SST data covering the Globe. It is shown that the obtained nonlinear modes capture more part of SST variability than principal components (PCs) constructed by either EOF decomposition or its spatio-temporal extension. In particular, only a few modes explain a set of key SST-based Pacific and Atlantic indices with correlation coefficient more than 0.7. A relation of the obtained modes to decadal natural climate variability including current hiatus in global warming is exhibited and discussed in the report. Advances of the proposed expansion in relation to phase space reconstruction for data-driven stochastic modeling are demonstrated.\nThis research was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Agreement No. 14.Z50.31.0033 with the Institute of Applied Physics RAS)",

            "abstract": "Widespread tree mortality has been documented across the western United States in recent decades. Climate change has been implicated in these events, in particular warming and associated effects on tree stress and biotic disturbance agents. Given projected future warming, the capability of accurately predicting future tree mortality is critical. However, sufficient ecological understanding is needed to do so. Here we describe differences in various mortality types associated with spatial characteristics and climate drivers. We loosely classify mortality types into four categories: 1) widespread but low severity background mortality that has been increasing mainly because of greater stress associated with rising climatic water deficit; 2) tree die-offs that are driven by severe, hotter drought in which biotic agents play minor roles, such as sudden aspen decline; 3) tree die-offs in which hotter droughts combined with outbreaks of biotic agents, often less aggressive bark beetles, to cause mortality, such as piñon pine mortality in the Southwest; and 4) tree die-offs that were initiated or facilitated by droughts but which were associated with aggressive biotic agents that can kill healthy trees at high populations, such as mountain pine beetle outbreaks. An important use of this classification is the different pathways by which climate change can cause tree mortality. For some classes (background and primarily drought-driven mortality), predictions may be sufficiently accurate based on climate (drought) metrics. For classes in which biotic agents play a role, the direct warming effect on insects may occur through mechanisms not related to drought, and therefore predictions may need to include mechanisms other than drought.

            "abstract": "High-frequency sensor-based datasets are driving a paradigm shift in the study of environmental processes. The online availability of high-frequency data creates an opportunity to engage undergraduate students in primary research by using large, long-term, and sensor-based, datasets for science courses. Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry & Exploration) is developing flexible classroom activity modules designed to (1) improve quantitative and reasoning skills; (2) develop the ability to engage in scientific discourse and argument; and (3) increase students’ engagement in science. A team of interdisciplinary faculty from private and public research universities and undergraduate institutions have developed these modules to meet a series of pedagogical goals that include (1) developing skills required to manipulate large datasets at different scales to conduct inquiry-based investigations; (2) developing students’ reasoning about statistical variation; and (3) fostering accurate student conceptions about the nature of environmental science. The modules cover a wide range of topics, including lake physics and metabolism, stream discharge, water quality, soil respiration, seismology, and climate change. Assessment data from questionnaire and recordings collected during the 2014-2015 academic year show that our modules are effective at making students more comfortable analyzing data. Continued development is focused on improving student learning outcomes with statistical concepts like variation, randomness and sampling, and fostering scientific discourse during module engagement. In the coming year, increased sample size will expand our assessment opportunities to comparison groups in upper division courses and allow for evaluation of module-specific conceptual knowledge learned. This project is funded by an NSF TUES grant (NSF DEB 1245707).",

Plasmasphere refilling rates depend on both the ionospheric sources and on the thermalization of streaming ions. We use the NRL SAMI3 ionosphere/plasmasphere code[1] coupled to the NRLMSIS empirical atmosphere model and the HWM14 empirical wind model, to simulate H+, He+ and O+ populations in the plasmasphere. The SAMI3 ionosphere code includes 7 ion species (H+, He+, O+, N+, O2+, N2+, NO+), each treated as a separate fluid, with temperature equations being solved for H+, He+, O+ and e. Measurements show that refilling rates decrease with increasing solar activity, an effect reproduced by SAMI3 and its two-dimensional cousin, SAMI2.\nWe find that the refilling rate and the resulting the plasmasphere electron content are sensitive to the thermospheric composition and temperature, as well as photoelectron heating and photoproduction rates. Depending on conditions, simulations suggest that the plasmaspheric contribution to the total electron content can either increase or decrease with solar activity, as represented by the daily and 81-day-average F10.7 indices.\n[1] Huba, J. and J.

            "abstract": "For more than a decade, NASA’s Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors have provided quantitative information about aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land and ocean and Angstrom Exponent (AE) over ocean. Yet, this period is still too short to create an aerosol climate data record (CDR) and rigorously detect aerosol trends. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched on the Suomi-NPP satellite in late 2011, with additional copies planned for future satellites. Can the MODIS aerosol data record be continued with VIIRS to create a consistent CDR? By using consistent radiative transfer assumptions, and applying consistent thresholds for cloud masking and other pixel filtering, we have developed an initial version of the MODIS “dark-target” (DT) retrieval algorithm to be used on VIIRS. We have run this DT retrieval on global VIIRS data between March 2012 and May 2014, and compared the products with the routine Collection 6 products from MODIS aboard Aqua, as well as to the operational aerosol products from VIIRS provided by NOAA. Focusing on the March-April-May (MAM) 2013 period, we compared a number of statistics, including global averages and maps of AOD, histograms, sampling frequencies, and collocations with ground-based AERONET. Over land, use of the DT algorithm clearly reduced the discrepancy between VIIRS and MODIS -derived AOD. However, although global offsets are near zero, some regional biases remain, especially in cloud fields and over brighter surface targets. Over ocean, use of the DT algorithm on VIIRS increased the offset between VIIRS and MODIS –retrieved AOD (to ~0.025), but reduced the difference between AE. We characterized the retrieval fraction to show that DT algorithms on each sensor will make similar decisions about “whether to retrieve” on a given pixel. As examples of obstacles for a joint MODISàVIIRS aerosol CDR, we discuss issues of calibration, instrument spatial resolution, and cloud maskng based on shifted wavelength bands.",

            "abstract": "This paper identifies the physical drivers of the subtropical drying and extratropical moistening that are simulated ubiquitously in the current climate models. The direct impacts of CO2 forcing, mean sea surface temperature (SST) warming, and pattern of SST change are isolated in an ensemble of AMIP and aqua planet simulations, in which the forcing agents are specified individually. The subtropical drying is found to be primarily driven by the direct CO2 forcing and the pattern of SST change, whereas the extratropical moistening is mainly induced by the mean SST warming. The CO2 forcing dries the subtropical oceans through reduced evaporation and anomalous divergence. The latter is mainly associated with the land-sea warming contrast. The pattern of SST change also plays an important role in subtropical drying due to the reduced warming in the subtropics. The mean SST warming is overall ineffective in the subtropical drying zones, which are generally poleward of regions of the strongest thermodynamic moisture export. On the other hand, the mean SST warming is the primary driver of the extratropical moistening through its dominance over evaporation and eddy moisture transport. Because the radiative forcing of CO2 and the adjustments in land surface and SST patterns generally have much shorter timescales than the mean SST warming, the subtropical drying is a much faster response than the extratropical moistening. In the abrupt CO2 quadrupling simulation, the subtropics dry immediately upon CO2quadrupling whereas the extratropics moisten slowly following the warming of the SST",

            "abstract": "The aerobic/anaerobic interface is a transition zone, where conditions, from chemical concentrations to pH, vary along the oxycline. It has long been known that microbes flourish at such interfaces, presumably due to the potential energy available from catalyzing reduction-oxidation reactions using chemicals derived from the anaerobic and aerobic milieus. Indeed, some studies suggest that both microbial diversity and activity is greatest in such settings, and evidenced by the 2-10 fold greater cell abundances associated with such transition zones. That said, the nature of microbial activity found in such transition zones, and the precise extent of their activity, is usually poorly constrained. At hydrothermal vents, for example, scientists have found that distinct communities are associated with each microhabitat, yet our recent studies have shown that canonical anaerobic microbes are found to be active in fully aerobic waters, seemingly well beyond the aerobic/anaerobic interface. Moreover, our research has also shown that the activity of microbes at the aerobic/anaerobic interface can -through extracellular electron transfer- directly influence the activity of microbes in canonically reduced or oxidized habitats. Here we will present these results and discuss the implications for our understanding of how aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities are physiologically coupled across the aerobic/anaerobic interface.",

            "abstract": "Soils provide abundant geochemical sources of energy for life, and when soils are buried as paleosols, their mineralogy and geochemistry can be used to reconstruct ancient surface environments and paleoclimates. Here we analyze how the clay mineralogy and spectral properties of the paleosol sequence preserved in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in eastern Oregon relate to environmental and climatic conditions at the time of soil formation. This 440-meter thick volcaniclastic deposit contains over 500 individual clay-rich (30-90%) paleosols. The deposits span 15 My around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, a period of global cooling. The paleosol mineralogy reflects this climatic shift by transitioning from kaolinites, to smectites, to poorly-crystalline phases, with local variations due to environmental variables like water saturation, pH, salinity, and organic content.\nAnalog studies of this and other paleosol sequences are helping us to better understand surface environments and climates on ancient Mars. Possible paleosol sequences on Mars are best exemplified by the regionally extensive clay-rich deposits in the region of Mawrth Vallis. Using our terrestrial analogs, we can interpret the mineralogy and physical stratigraphy at Mawrth. Under a paleosol framework, the Mawrth clays are consistent with regional paleosols formed under a temperate climate, with local variations due to chemical gradients in a wetlands-like surface environment, providing many energy pathways for life and high preservation potential.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the flow of air, and how it transports heat and trace gases, in the atmospheric boundary layer are increasingly becoming critical to a wide range of applications including wind and solar energy, urban design, agriculture, and assessment of climate change impacts and adaptations. These applications all require a level of sophistication and detail in our ability to probe and model the ABL and its interaction with the earth surface that manifestly exceeds our current capabilities. Previous work largely focused on the “textbook ABL”, which is barotropic, in (quasi) steady-state, and interacts with a horizontal and homogeneous earth surface; it is evident that the “real-world ABL”, even over flat terrain, rarely meets these simplifying conditions. In this talk we overview two complicating features that have been largely overlooked thus far despite their ubiquity: baroclinicity and unsteadiness. Large-eddy simulations of ABL flow with a time-varying (unsteady) or height-varying (baroclinic) pressure forcings are analyzed to understand how they modulate the bulk structure (mean fields) and turbulence (higher order moments). Our results indicate that for the unsteady ABL, the dynamics are primarily controlled by the relative magnitudes of three times scales: the inertial time scale (~ 12 hours in mid latitude), the turbulent time scale (~ 0.5 hours), and the forcing variability time scale (varies depending on meso and synoptic scale dynamics). For the baroclinic simulations, the strength and more importantly the direction of the baroclinicity can result in profiles that are vastly different from the classic barotropic case, with for example peaks in the turbulent kinetic energy that are in the middle of the layer. Both features also results in first and second order moments that, if interpreted to results from a steady barotropic case, can be highly misleading when experimental results are analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The most recent eruption of Fogo Volcano, Cape Verde Islands started on the 23 November 2014 at 10h15 (CVT), after 19 years of quiescence. Several months before the begging of the eruption, the seismic activity started to deviate from the baseline, with the appearance of a class of events that was not recorded before then. This activity was characterized by a significant number of instrumentally detected, very low magnitude seismic events, sometimes more than 100 per day. In September those events became more energetic and analysis indicated that they could be of volcano-tectonic (VT) origin. The first VT event to be located was on 4 October with a 2.5 local magnitude: it was located slightly to the south of the middle of the island at between 15.5 and 16 km depth. This was deeper than normal for background VT events and coincided with the depth of last magma equilibration in the 1995 eruption. It was therefore interpreted as a possible precursor of an eruption: thus the alert level was raised to level 2, and the civil protection authorities were informed. On the following weeks the rate of VT events slightly increased and the focal depths became shallower. Very sporadic harmonic volcano tremor episodes and very few and weak long-period events were also recorded. From about the 15 to 21 November, the VT activity rate oscillated, and hypocentres tended to gather in the vicinity of an inferred dike emplacement and at shallower depth - 6 to 5 km b.s.l. On the first hours of the 22 November seismic rate increased from 3 to 6 events per hour and the events became more energetic. After 19h30 (CVT), when the magma reached the ductile-brittle transition zone (5 to 4 km b.s.l), the seismic rate increased again to more than one event per minute; earthquake magnitudes increased as well. At about 03h00 (CVT) the tilt records shown a prominent ground deformation. Continuous volcanic tremor started only one to half an hour before the start of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Seismic wave radiation from megathrust earthquakes provides an important probe of fault zone properties and interplate rupture attributes. To quantify the source scaling relationships and any depth-dependence more extensively, we analyzed 114 Mw ≥ 7.0 thrust-faulting earthquakes on circum-Pacific megathrusts using the finite-fault inversions and source spectrum determinations. To address the limited resolution of source spatial extent from teleseismic observations, we performed finite-fault inversions with rupture expansion velocity Vr = 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 km/s for 96 events lacking independent Vr constraints.\nSource duration Td and centroid time shifts Tc vary systematically with the cube root of seismic moment; and there is no strong dependence on Mw for moment-scaled radiated energy ER/M0, apparent stress σa, or radiation efficiency ηR. The slip-weighted stress drop ΔσE from finite-fault slip models, with direct trade-off from Vr, has little dependence on Mw. However, the product Vr3ΔσE is very stable for each event across the suite of models considered, and has little trend with MW. Radiation efficiency tends to decrease with average slip for large events, and estimates of fracture energy increase steadily with slip.\nLarge tsunami earthquakes and some other shallow events (depth < ~18 km) have unusually long Td, low ΔσE and strongly depleted short-period radiation. Deeper events have no clear trend with source depth for moment-normalized Tc, ΔσE, ER/M0, σa, or ηR. There is relative enrichment in short-period spectral levels with increasing depth manifested in reduced high-frequency spectral decay slope. The ratio of high-frequency (0.3-1Hz) radiated energy to total energy increases correspondingly. These observations suggest that overall dynamic rupture processes are relatively insensitive to depth, but varying scale lengths of megathrust heterogeneity may contribute to enrichment of short-period seismic radiation for deep events.",

Global and regional climate models must account for this heat content to more realistically simulate the altered regime of Arctic climate and its heat budget.

On July 9, the four spacecraft were stationed in a tetrahedral formation with separations of 160 km. During the period ending December 1, the four spacecraft drift around to noon, exploring the magnetopause with a well formed tetrahedron, with sides as short as 10 km allowing us to study the magnetic and electric current structure of the magnetopause. This structure is complex. There is large-scale reconnection often resulting in the formation of fluxropes connected to the magnetosphere such as FTEs.

            "abstract": "Energetic electrons in the inner magnetosphere are distributed into two regions: the inner radiation belt and the outer radiation belt, with the slot region in between separating the two belts. Though many studies have focused on the outer belt dynamics, the energetic electrons in the slot region and especially inner belt did not receive much attention until recently. A number of new features regarding electrons in the low L region have been reported lately, including the abundance of 10s-100s of keV electrons in the inner belt, the frequent deep injections of 100s of keV electrons, and 90°-minimum pitch angle distributions of 100s of keV electrons in the inner belt and slot region. In this presentation, we focus on the relative deep injections into the slot region and inner belt of energetic electrons and ions using observations from HOPE and MagEIS instruments on the Van Allen Probes. It is shown that while 10s – 100s of keV electrons penetrate commonly deep into the low L region and are persistent in the inner belt, the deep injections of ions with similar energies occur rarely, possibly due to the fast loss of ions in the low L region. The energy spectra and pitch angle distributions of electrons and ions during injections are also very different, indicating the existence of different physical mechanisms acting on them. In addition, some intriguing similarities between lower energy ions and higher energy electrons will also be discussed.",

To address this issue, short incubations (4 days) of northeast subarctic Pacific waters enriched with either FeSO4 or dust, and maintained at pH 8.0 (in situ) and 7.8 were conducted in August 2010. We assessed the impact of a decrease in pH on dissolved Fe concentration, phytoplankton biomass, taxonomy and productivity, and the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its algal precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Chlorophyll a (chl a) remained unchanged in the controls and doubled in both the FeSO4-enriched and dust-enriched incubations, confirming the Fe-limited status of the plankton assemblage during the experiment. In the acidified treatments, a significant reduction (by 16-38%) of the final concentration of chl a was measured compared to their non-acidified counterparts, and a 15% reduction in particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration was measured in the dust-enriched acidified treatment compared to the dust-enriched non-acidified treatment. FeSO4 and dust additions had a fertilizing effect mainly on diatoms and cyanobacteria. Lowering the pH affected mostly the haptophytes, but pelagophyte concentrations were also reduced in some acidified treatments. Acidification did not significantly alter DMSP and DMS concentrations. These results show that dust deposition events in a low-pH iron-limited Northeast subarctic Pacific are likely to stimulate phytoplankton growth to a lesser extent than in today’s ocean during the few days following fertilization and point to a low initial sensitivity of the DMSP and DMS dynamics to OA.",

The snowpack that accumulates during winter storms provides about 70-90% of water supply for the region. Associated with the warm sector of extratropical cyclones over the Pacific Ocean, atmospheric rivers (ARs) provide enhanced water vapor transport from the tropics to produce heavy precipitation upon landfall in the mountainous terrain of the western North America. Using a suite of idealized aqua-planet simulations and AMIP simulations with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) physics parameterizations at multiple resolutions ranging from 30km to 240km, we investigate the sensitivity of simulated AR frequency to model resolution. The impacts of global warming on ARs and heavy precipitation are investigated using model outputs from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (CESM-LE) and the multi-model ensemble of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to evaluate the thermodynamical and dynamical contributions to changes in extreme precipitation. Analysis of the hierarchy of climate simulations highlights uncertainty in model simulation of the jet position as a major source of uncertainty in simulating AR frequency and a possible dynamical convergence as model resolutions approach roughly 50km resolution. To extend the modeling hierarchy for improved representation of the interactions between ARs and the complex terrain that generate high intensity precipitation and floods, MPAS global variable resolution simulations with a regional refinement down to sub-10km resolution will be discussed.",

The field campaign, including collaborations between CalWater 2 and ACAPEX, aims to improve understanding and modeling of large-scale dynamics and cloud and precipitation processes associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs) and aerosol-cloud interactions that influence precipitation variability and extremes in the western U.S. An observational strategy was employed using land and offshore assets to monitor (1) the evolution and structure of ARs from near their regions of development, (2) long range transport of aerosols in eastern North Pacific and potential interactions with ARs, and (3) how aerosols from long-range transport and local sources influence cloud and precipitation in the U.S. During the field campaign, an AR developed in the Northeast Pacific Ocean in early February and made landfall in northern California. In-situ aerosol and cloud measurements from the G-1 aircraft; remote sensing data of clouds and aerosols; and meteorological measurements from aircraft, ship, and ground-based instruments collected from February 5 – 8, 2015 are analyzed to characterize the large-scale environment and cloud and precipitation forming processes. Modeling experiments are designed using a regional model for simulations with a cloud resolving limited area domain and quasi-global coarser resolution domain to evaluate the impacts of aerosols on clouds and precipitation, and to explore the relative contributions of long-range transported and regional aerosols that interacted with the clouds before, during, and after AR landfall. Preliminary results will be discussed in the context of the field data as well as a multi-year simulation of the climatological contributions of long-range transported dust during AR landfall in California.",

In the U.S., our gridded historical cropland maps show potential for production in the U.S. on 68 Mha of abandoned croplands in the U.S. which is as much as 70% larger than previous estimates due to a reduction in aggregation effects. In Brazil, a critical land-use impact is associated with non-GHG air pollutants from the management and expansion of sugarcane feedstocks. Our bottom-up estimate for these Brazilian land-use emissions is seven times larger than estimated from remote-sensing data due to the improved spatial resolution of our approach.

            "abstract": "We acquired gridded ground-based radar data at the WIS grounding zone where the transition from limited- or no-slip conditions at the base of grounded ice to free-slip conditions beneath floating ice occurs across a region only a few kilometers wide. This transition is either an elastic-flexural transition from bedrock to hydrostatically-supported elevations (often tidally influenced), a transition from thicker to thinner ice over a flat bed, or some combination of these. In either case, the stress field of the ice changes as it flows across the grounding zone, often resulting in brittle deformation, which is manifested as basal crevassing at the ice-sheet base and sometimes as strand cracks at the surface. The position and morphology of these features reveal important information about the stress state across this transition where ice and ocean interact.\nOur surveys indicate a complex pattern of basal crevassing with many imaged in two or more profile segments as a linear feature at the bed, usually trending oblique to flow and often extending for several kilometers. Due to the wide beam pattern of our antennas, we image many of the crevasses from off-nadir reflections. Thus their arrival times are later than the primary basal reflection and segments of the crevasse appear “below” the bed, when in fact they are merely trending oblique to the profile. Often these returns have a reversed phase relative to the bed echo because the high dielectric contrast of seawater and a favorable geometry enable reflections with little loss (but a second phase reversal) from the ice-water interface near the crevasse base. In a few cases, these crevasse echoes from targets trending oblique to the profile appear to mimic the geometry of a sub-ice sediment “wedge”, while in reality the radar never penetrates below the basal interface. Only about 25% of the crevasses appear to extend any significant distance upward into the basal ice, typically at low angles. A subset of these are doubly imaged by direct returns as well as by delayed reflections from the bright planar basal interface, giving curious mirror-like signatures.\nOur results indicate that basal crevasses offer a rich dataset for diagnosing basal stress state across ice-sheet grounding zones and that special care is needed when interpreting subglacial returns in radar data.",

We determine elevations trends from Cryosat-2 (2010-2014) of the North-Atlantic glaciers and ice caps and compare these to observations obtained from ICESat laser altimetry (2003-2009). The results show a general glacier imbalance with current climate, characterized by rapid thinning at the lower elevations where surface melting is stronger. Using a firn and surface mass balance model, we estimate the contribution of the North Atlantic glaciers to sea level rise over the 2003-2014 period to be ~ 1/3 mm per year. In general, our altimetry results are in good agreement with large-scale glacier mass anomalies from GRACE. Regional glacier mass changes appear to be linked to distinct atmospheric circulation patterns, with some regions being in ‘status quo' and others experiencing rapid shrinkage. Regional changes in elevation are primarily driven by changes in surface forcing with glacier dynamics dominating the local signal of several tidewater basins.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of induced and triggered microseismicity is of increasing concern to the general public. The underlying human causes are numerous and include hydrocarbon production and geological storage of CO2. The concerns of induced seismicity are the potential hazards from large seismic events and the creation of fluid pathways. However, microseismicity is also a unique tool to gather information about real-time changes in the subsurface, a fact generally ignored by the public. The ability to detect, locate and characterize microseismic events, provides a snapshot of the stress conditions within and around a geological reservoir. In addition, data on rapid stress changes (i.e. microseismic events) can be used as input to hydro-mechanical models, often used to map fluid propagation.\nIn this study we investigate the impact of microseismic event location accuracy using surface seismic stations in addition to downhole geophones. Due to signal-to-noise conditions and the small magnitudes inherent in microseismicity, downhole systems detect significantly more events with better precision of phase arrival times than surface networks. However, downhole systems are often limited in their ability to obtain large enough observational apertures required for accurate locations. We therefore jointly locate the largest microseismic events using surface and downhole data. This requires careful evaluation in the weighting of input data when inverting for the event location. For the smaller events only observed on the downhole geophones, we define event clusters using waveform cross-correlation methods.\nWe apply this methodology to microseismic data collected in the Illinois Basin-Decatur Project. A previous study revealed over 10,000 events detected by the downhole sensors. In our analysis, we include up to 12 surface sensors, installed by the USGS. The weighting scheme for this assembly of data needs to take into account significant uncertainties in the near-surface velocity structure. The re-located event clusters allow an investigation of systematic spatio-temporal variations of source parameters (e.g. stress drop) and statistical parameters (e.g. b-value). We examine these observations together with injection parameters to deduce constraints on the long-term stability of the injection site.",

Suspended particles can carry viruses and pathogenic bacteria affecting human health and foster their development. High SSS, associated with high turbidity, can therefore be considered as a vector of microbiological contaminants, causing diarrheal diseases. Few studies have focused on the turbidity parameter in rural Africa, while many cases of intestinal parasitic infections are due to the consumption of unsafe water from ponds, lakes, and rivers. Monitoring turbidity may therefore contribute to health hazard monitoring.\nTurbidity refers to the optical properties of water and is known to impact water reflectance in the visible and near-infrared domain. Ideally, its spatial and temporal variability requires the use of high temporal resolution (MODIS) and spatial resolution (Landsat, SPOT, Sentinel-2).\nHere we investigate turbidity in West-Africa. Various algorithms and indices proposed in the literature for inland waters are applied to MODIS series and to Landsat 7 and 8 CDR images, and SPOT5 images. The data and algorithms are evaluated with field measurements: turbidity, SSS, and hyperspectral ground radiometry. We show that turbidity of the Bagre Lake displays a strong increase over 2000-2015, associated with the corresponding increase of the red and NIR reflectances, as well as a reduction of the seasonal variations. Water level derived from the Jason 2 altimeter does not explain such variations. The most probable hypothesis is a change in land use (increase in bare and degraded soils), that leads to an increase in the particles transported by surface runoff to the lake.\nSuch an increase in turbidity reinforces the health risk. We will discuss the link between turbidity and health in view of data from health centers on diarrheal diseases as well as data on practices and uses of populations.",

            "abstract": "Variations in pore fluid pressure are of paramount importance in controlling fault stability. Recent studies have focused on investigating the underlying causes of pore fluid pressure, but natural constraints for lateral fluid migration have not yet been described. Here, we investigate the evolution of the plate interface kinematics and fluid pressure migration leading up to the Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake. We present the deformation evolution of the last decade from a combination of ~40 continuous and ~70 survey-type GPS. The slip distribution of Iquique event covered areas that were previously intermediately to highly locked and enclosed by creeping interface zones. The seismicity recorded in the years before the mainshock tended to encircle the central locked patch (~40 km length asperity), which itself exhibited a low amount of seismicity. This earthquake was preceded by a series of foreshocks and transient deformation that was initiated by an Mw=6.7 event and which lasted for 16 days. The observed transient GPS signals can be explained by deformation due to foreshocks, indicating that slow slip was not a dominant factor in the stress build up that led to the mainshock. Foreshocks initiated at the edge of the asperity and migrated along the plate interface towards the mainshock hypocentre. The spatial and temporal proximity to the mainshock, as well as the migration pattern of events suggest that the foreshocks and mainshock were mechanically coupled. We suggest that the Mw 6.7 (that likely occurred on a splay fault) is responsible for a transient pore fluid pressure increase in the plate interface region, hence diminishing the effective normal stress on the interface. This segment of the plate interface, presumably mechanically weakened by near-lithostatic pore fluid pressures, was subsequently subjected to a propagation of foreshocks. We propose that the 16-days seismicity swarm could represent the lateral propagation of a fluid front through the place interface, possibly as a porosity-wave mechanism.

            "abstract": "While seismic anisotropy is known to exist within the Earth’s crust and even deeper, isotropic or simple anisotropy assumptions for seismic imaging is an over simplification resulting in artifacts in the seismic image, wrong target positioning and hence interpretation. To partly overcome issues with anisotropic medium, approximations to the full solutions for wave propagation and reflectivity for specific material symmetries are used. Here, we have developed an algorithm to extend these capabilities to the general case of reflectivity from the interface between two anisotropic slabs of arbitrary symmetry and orientation. To achieve this, the algorithm solves full elastic wave equation for polarization, amplitude and slowness of all six wave modes generated by an incident plane-wave from welded interface. In the first step, the plane-wave slownesses and polarizations of all three orthogonal wave modes are calculated for a given incidence angle. Later, the algorithm determines the reflection and transmission angles of all possible scattered modes followed by their respective velocities and polarization vectors. With this information, the algorithm solves a system of equations incorporating the imposed boundary conditions to arrive at the scattered wave amplitudes. By comparing this reflectivity algorithm against leading approximate solution in a much simpler anisotropic environment, we understood that unlike other simplified linear solution, this algorithm is stable in almost all propagation direction and like its predecessor is not limited to near vertical range. There is no need to emphasis that the algorithm capability to quickly solve plane-wave properties in low symmetric anisotropic medium with arbitrary orientation opens new doors to better understand elasticity.",

Understanding these effects has proven to be a considerable challenge. Advances in this field have been hindered by the difficulty of modeling and visualizing these multi-phase non-linear effects across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. To address these issues, we are developing a strategy that combines imaging techniques based on x-ray micro-tomography with homogenization of pore-scale transport equations. Here, we review recent progress in x-ray imaging of biofilms in porous media, with a particular focus on the contrast agents that are used to differentiate between the fluid and biofilm phases. We further show how the 3D distribution of the different phases can be used to extract specific information about the biofilm and how effective properties can be calculated via the resolution of closure problems. These closure problems are obtained using the method of volume averaging and must be adapted to the problem of interest. In hydrological systems, we show that a generic formulation for reactive solute transport is based on a domain decomposition approach at the micro-scale yielding macro-scale models reminiscent of multi-rate mass transfer approaches.",

As a community we need to strengthen our support of young scientists from all backgrounds to sustain their enthusiasm and ensure their success in our field. Investing in mentoring programs that empower students and young professionals is one of the best ways to do so. The Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program, now entering its 20th year, has successfully developed and tested several mentoring models. The personalized, caring and consistent support is one of the key elements of the program's success; since its inception, 90% of SOARS participants have entered graduate school, research or science related careers after graduation. Many of our alumni who are now faculty apply the same mentoring strategies to build self-esteem and perseverance in their students. This presentation will cover the design and implementation of our four mentoring strategies, and provide insights on potential challenges, training aspects and impact assessment. The mentoring strategies include: 1) Multi-faceted, long-term mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds. 2) Empowering advanced students to serve as peer mentors and role models. 3) Training faculty and professional scientists from all backgrounds to become mentors who are aware of diversity issues. 4) Providing mentor training for partner programs and laboratories.

            "abstract": "Arid and semiarid ecosystems cover ~40% of Earth’s terrestrial surface and make up ~35% of the U.S., yet we know surprisingly little about how climate change will affect these widespread landscapes. Like many dryland regions, the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern U.S. is predicted to experience climate change as elevated temperature and altered timing and amount of annual precipitation. We are using a long-term (>10 yr) factorial warming and supplemental rainfall experiment on the Colorado Plateau to explore how predicted changes in climate will affect vascular plant and biological soil crust community composition, biogeochemical cycling, and energy balance (biocrusts are a surface soil community of moss, lichen, and cyanobacteria that can make up as much as 70% of the living cover in drylands). While some of the responses we have observed were expected, many of the results are surprising. For example, we documented biocrust community composition shifts in response to altered climate that were significantly faster and more dramatic than considered likely for these soil communities that typically change over decadal and centennial timescales. Further, while we continue to observe important climate change effects on carbon cycling – including reduced net photosynthesis in vascular plants, increased CO2 losses from biocrust soils during some seasons, and changes to the interactions between water and carbon cycles – we have also found marked treatment effects on the albedo and spectral signatures of dryland soils. In addition to demonstrating the effects of these treatments, the strong relationships we observed in our experiments between biota and climate provide a quantitative framework for improving our representation of dryland responses to climate change. In this talk we will cover a range of datasets that, taken together, show: (1) large climate-driven changes to dryland biogeochemical cycling may be the result of both effects on existing communities, as well of relatively rapid shifts in community composition; (2) drylands could provide feedbacks to future climate not only though altered carbon cycling but also via changes to surface albedo; and (3) models of dryland responses to climate change may need significant revision, but such a revision is well within reach.",

            "abstract": "Human societies have emerged as a global force capable of transforming the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere and climate. As a result, the long-term dynamics of the Earth system can no longer be understood or predicted without understanding their coupling with human societal dynamics. Here, a general causal theory is presented to explain why behaviorally modern humans, unlike any prior multicellular species, gained this unprecedented capacity to reshape the Earth system and how this societal capacity has changed from the Pleistocene to the present and future. Sociocultural niche construction theory, building on existing theories of ecosystem engineering, niche construction, the extended evolutionary synthesis, cultural evolution, ultrasociality and social change, can explain both the long-term upscaling of human societies and their unprecedented capacity to transform the Earth system. Regime shifts in human sociocultural niche construction, from the clearing of land using fire, to shifting cultivation, to intensive agriculture, to global food systems dependent on fossil fuel combustion, have enabled human societies to scale up while gaining the capacity to reshape the global patterns and processes of biogeography, ecosystems, landscapes, biomes, the biosphere, and ultimately the functioning of the Earth system. Just as Earth’s geophysical climate system shapes the long-term dynamics of energy and material flow across the “spheres” of the Earth system, human societies, interacting at global scale to form “human systems”, are increasingly shaping the global dynamics of energy, material, biotic and information flow across the spheres of the Earth system, including a newly emerged anthroposphere comprised of human societies and their material cultures. Human systems and the anthroposphere are strongly coupled with climate and other Earth systems and are dynamic in response to evolutionary changes in human social organization, cooperative ecosystem engineering, non-kin exchange relationships, and energy systems. It is hoped that intentional societal efforts to alter the dynamics of human systems can ultimately move Earth systems towards more beneficial and less detrimental outcomes for both human societies and nonhuman species.",

This spatially integrated vegetation drought response at this scale can not be measured from laboratory experiments or field studies and the atmosphere thus offers a unique perspective on large-scale vegetation drought dynamics.

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic substorms represent a fundamental energy release mechanism for the terrestrial magnetosphere. Specifically, the evolution of thin currents sheets during the substorm growth phase plays a key role for substorms because such current sheets present a much lower threshold for the onset of tearing modes and magnetic reconnection than the usually thick magnetotail current sheet. Here we examine and compare two basic processes for current sheet thinning in the Earth’s magnetotail: Current sheet thinning (1) through closed magnetic flux depletion (MFD) in the near Earth magnetotail caused by divergent flux transport to replace closed flux on the dayside and (2) through accumulation of open flux magnetic flux in the tail lobes also caused by dayside reconnection. Both processes are expected to operate during any period of enhanced dayside reconnection. It is demonstrated that closed magnetic flux depletion (MFD) in the near Earth magnetotail and the increase of open lobe magnetic flux can lead to the evolution of two separate thin current sheets in the near Earth and the mid tail regions of the magnetosphere. While the auroral morphology associated with MFD and near Earth current sheet formation is well consistent with typical substorm growth observation, midtail current sheet formation through lobe flux increase shows only a minor influence on the auroral ionosphere. We discuss the physics of the dual current sheet formation and local and auroral properties of magnetic reconnection in either current sheet. It is suggested that only reconnection onset in the near Earth current sheet may be consistent with substorm expansion because the flux tube entropy depletion of mid tail reconnection appears insufficient to cause geosynchronous particle injection and dipolarization. Therefore reconnection in the mid tail current sheet is more likely associated with bursty bulk flows or dipolarization fronts which stop short of geosynchronous distances.",

We estimate a pre- to early syn-collisional (~54 ± 2 Ma) paleo-elevation of the Penbo/Linzhou region of >4100 ± 550 meters. This provides the first well-constrained elevation estimate of the pre-collisional Linzizong Volcanic arc in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that high relief at low latitude did indeed prevail on the Asian “Andean” margin prior to collision. We use the most recent plate kinematic constraints to compute the mass flux associated with India-Asia convergence with uncertainty as a function of time. Integration of mass flux as a function of time, together with estimates of the diachronous collision age with uncertainty and corresponding suture zone length with uncertainty allow explicit estimates with uncertainties of pre-collisional crustal mass. Mass balance is estimated using estimates of pre-collisional elevation and crustal thickness with their associated uncertainties relative to the pre-collisional mass. We find that ~50±25% of the collision-related crustal mass cannot be accounted for by the mass preserved in excess crustal thickness (in Himalaya, Tibet, and adjacent Asia), southeast Asian tectonic escape, and exported eroded sediments. This implies large-scale subduction of continental crust, amounting to ~15% of the total oceanic subduction flux since 56 Ma during this continent-continent collision. Contamination of the mantle by direct input of continental crustal materials rather than crust-derived sediments may be more significant than previously thought and may be responsible for crustal geochemical anomalies in mantle-derived melts.",

            "abstract": "Descriptions of normal versus anomalous bed load particle diffusion appeal to qualities of the mean squared displacement R(τ) as this varies with the time interval τ, and the rate of convergence of the particle velocity autocorrelation function A(τ). These measures of spreading were originally formulated within the context of particles that move continuously and indefinitely while subjected to statistically homogeneous, time invariant conditions. In this situation R(τ) calculated for an individual particle is the same as that calculated for a great number of particles, and the statistically expected behavior measured from any instant is the same. This is quite different from the expected behavior of bed load particles that start and stop. Here we focus on particle motions measured from high-speed (250 Hz) imaging of coarse sand transported in a flume experiment. Particle tracking (using ImageJ) involved ~150,000 coordinate positions for ~10,000 particles (R1), and ~170,000 positions for ~11,000 particles (R2). We identified ~4,000 complete hops (measured start-to-stop) for R1 and ~3,500 hops for R2. These data, based on sub-pixel resolution, provide high fidelity characterization of particle motions, notably including small motions that dominate the probability distributions of particle velocities, hop distances and travel times. The random-walk behavior of each particle as measured by R(τ) and A(τ) is unique, and reflects the primary effect of a dominant harmonic in the motion of the particle which arises because the particle starts then stops, with an intervening peak velocity. The ensemble calculation of R(τ), averaging over all paired coordinate positions separated by τ, lacks the ballistic-like behavior for small τ apparent in R(τ) of individual particles, and at intermediate τ reflects an approximate Fickian behavior. A “tracer” calculation of R(τ), averaging over particles rather than all paired coordinates, yields apparent anomalous behavior. This calculation is a measure of the heteroscedastically increasing variance in the power function relating hop distances to travel times. This behavior represents particle spreading, but is inhomogeneous diffusion, not time invariant behavior. The ensemble calculation of R(τ) is appropriate in describing a diffusive particle flux.",

Gains in learning across all participants are minor, and not statistically different between intervention and control groups. Predictors of gains in content comprehension for all three modules are the students’ initial interest in the subject and their base level knowledge. For the Geologic Time and Structures modules, being a STEM major is an important predictor of student success. Most pertinent for this research, for Geologic Time and Hydrologic Processes, gains in student learning can be predicted by having completed those particular virtual field trips. Gender and race had no statistical impact, indicating that the virtual field trip modules have broad reach across student demographics. In related research, these modules have been shown to increase student interest in the geosciences more definitively than the learning gains here. Thus, future work should focus on improving the educational impact of mobile-device field trips, as their eventual incorporation into curricula is inevitable.",

            "abstract": "At the broadest scale, like many orogens the Himalaya encompass a range of orogenic features that are remarkably similar along much of the length of the mountain belt and its neighboring terranes. At one scale of consideration, these similarities appear to be a signal that fundamental processes associated with lithospheric collision have been active. However, the vast size of the Himalaya and Tibet, the different climate regimes experienced by the orogen across time and space, and the along-strike variations in the continental and arc margins that faced one another before collision, make it at once remarkable that any similarities exist, and important to more critically evaluate their nature.\nThe eastern and western Himalayan syntaxes confound any attempt to generalize too much about the Himalaya-Tibet orogen. By area these features occupy at least 25% of the orogenic belt, and compared to the “main” portions of the arc they show clear differences in their lithospheric structures, landscapes, and evolution. The boundary and initial conditions that shaped the eastern and western indentor corners were and are different, as is the nature and timing of erosional exhumation. Some of the most active geologic processes on Earth have recently been in play within the syntaxes, and the evolution of landscapes and fluvial systems, important in developing the sedimentary record of the Himalaya-Tibet system, has been complex and variable in space and time. Southeasternmost Tibet and the Lhasa Block in particular exemplify this complexity both in its complex topographic evolution linked to surface processes and climate, and in lateral variability in lithospheric structure.\nTaking a system viewpoint, an important question to debate is the degree to which there are features in the Himalaya-Tibet system that are robustly emergent, given the broad boundary conditions of the continental collision plus the suite of local and regional geodynamical processes that have operated during orogenesis. A related question is the degree to which the variability seen within the orogen represents important information about process that is exportable to other orogens, or is in effect tectonic noise contingent on local geologic details and secular changes.",

            "abstract": "Modern views of ice sheets provided by satellites, airborne surveys, in situ data and paleoclimate records while transformative of glaciology have not fundamentally changed concerns about ice sheet stability and collapse that emerged in the 1970's. Motivated by the desire to learn more about ice sheets using new technologies, we stumbled on an unexplored field of science and witnessed surprising changes before realizing that most were coming too fast, soon and large. Ice sheets are integrant part of the Earth system; they interact vigorously with the atmosphere and the oceans, yet most of this interaction is not part of current global climate models. Since we have never witnessed the collapse of a marine ice sheet, observations and exploration remain critical sentinels. At present, these observations suggest that Antarctica and Greenland have been launched into a path of multi-meter sea level rise caused by rapid climate warming. While the current loss of ice sheet mass to the ocean remains a trickle, every mm of sea level change will take centuries of climate reversal to get back, several major marine-terminating sectors have been pushed out of equilibrium, and ice shelves are irremediably being lost. As glaciers retreat from their salty, warm, oceanic margins, they will melt away and retreat slower, but concerns remain about sea level change from vastly marine-based sectors: 2-m sea level equivalent in Greenland and 23-m in Antarctica. Significant changes affect 2/4 marine-based sectors in Greenland - Jakobshavn Isb. and the northeast stream - with Petermann Gl. not far behind. Major changes have affected the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica since the 1980s. Smaller yet significant changes affect the marine-based Wilkes Land sector of East Antarctica, a reminder that not all marine-based ice is in West Antarctica. Major advances in reducing uncertainties in sea level projections will require massive, interdisciplinary efforts that are not currently in place but are getting there. Projection scenarios are overwhelmingly conservative, pushed up by observations, awaiting more detailed knowledge of ocean circulation, winds, ice-ocean interaction, and mechanics of rapid ice fracture, not to mention the mere definition of static boundaries (ice thickness and sea floor bathymetry).",

Real-time prediction framework operating on our web site based on GOES, RBSP A, B and ACE data and 3D VERB is presented and discussed. In this paper we present a number of application of the data assimilation with the VERB 3D code. 1) Model with data assimilation allows to propagate data to different pitch angles, energies, and L-shells and blends them together with the physics based VERB code in an optimal way. We illustrate how we use this capability for the analysis of the previous events and for obtaining a global and statistical view of the system. 2) The model predictions strongly depend on initial conditions that are set up for the model. Therefore the model is as good as the initial conditions that it uses. To produce the best possible initial condition data from different sources ( GOES, RBSP A, B, our empirical model predictions based on ACE) are all blended together in an optimal way by means of data assimilation as described above. The resulting initial condition does not have gaps. That allows us to make a more accurate predictions.",

            "abstract": "From the CAP-MBL long-term measurement campaign over the Azores, two low-cloud periods are selected via analysis of ISCCP cloud property matrices. Each is a persistent instance of a low-cloud weather state that the GISS climate model severely underpredicts both over the Azores and globally. Meteorologically, one period is characterized by shallow cumulus clouds in a cold-air outbreak behind a cold front, and the other by overcast stratocumulus clouds in a region dominated by a high-pressure system. Observations and MERRA reanalysis are used to derive specifications used for large-eddy simulations (LES) of each period. For both periods, 6-hour and longer simulations with periodic boundary conditions and uniform large-scale forcings over 10 to 100-km domains capture the structural differences between the two low-cloud periods, only modestly influenced by domain size. Simulations of both periods underestimate sub-mesoscale variability, but represent distributions of cloud top, cloud base, and drizzle extents reasonably well in comparison with observations. Simulated mean Doppler velocities as a function of reflectivity also reproduce observed relationships reasonably well; the most notable deviation is lesser-than-observed Doppler velocity where reflectivity exceeds about –10 dBZ, which occurs only in the cumulus case. However, the range of simulated spectral skewness is substantially underestimated in both cases. To help identify likely causes, the overcast stratocumulus case is also simulated with an independent LES code with size-resolved microphysics, which exhibits some similar biases. Although unavailable from CAP-MBL, in situ measurements of drizzle size distribution from two other campaigns are used to gain insight into the biases. Finally, the significance of Doppler moment biases is evaluated in part by deriving autoconversion and accretion parameterization expressions from simulations with varying collision-coalescence kernel assumptions.",

The diffusion coefficient (i.e., diffusivity) is then computed by dividing the diffusive flux by the temperature gradient in the 20-m transition layer just below the base of the mixed layer. At Station Papa in the NE Pacific subpolar gyre, this diffusivity is 1×10-4 m2/s during summer, increasing to ~3×10-4 m2/s during fall. During late winter and early spring, diffusivity has large errors. At other times, diffusivity computed from the mixed layer salt budget at Papa correlate with those from the heat budget, giving confidence that the results are robust for all seasons except late winter-early spring and can be used for other tracers. In comparison, at the Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO) in the NW Pacific subtropical recirculation gyre, somewhat larger diffusivity are found based upon the mixed layer heat budget: ~ 3×10-4 m2/s during the warm season and more than an order of magnitude larger during the winter, although again, wintertime errors are large. These larger values at KEO appear to be due to the increased turbulence associated with the summertime typhoons, and weaker wintertime stratification.",

            "abstract": "Cloud radiative effects remain a major weakness in our understanding of the climate system and consequently in developing accurate climate projections. This is mainly true for Arctic low–level clouds in their key role of regulating surface energy fluxes which affect the freezing and melting of sea ice. The radiative properties of clouds are strongly dependent on the number concentration of airborne water-soluble particles, known as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In the Arctic, the aerosol-cloud-radiation relationship is more complex than elsewhere and the clouds constitute a warming factor for climate, rather than cooling, most of the year. This is due to the semi-permanent ice cover, which raises the albedo of the surface, and the clean Arctic air, which decreases the albedo of the clouds. There has been much discussion on the relative magnitude of the biogenic source of polar CCN: Primary organic marine aerosols and/or sulfate-containing aerosols, derived from marine emissions. Regional field measurements and pan- (Ant)Arctic model simulations don’t necessarily agree. Arctic CCN are formed primarily by aggregates of marine organic material and may grow in mass by condensation. Southern Ocean aerosols may be dominated by sulfate particles and organic particles at lower and higher Antarctic latitudes, respectively. The interaction of polar marine microorganisms, seasonality, sea ice cover, presence or absence of sea spray, and atmospheric heterogeneous processes combine to control natural aerosol concentrations and mass, thus modulating the sensitivity of cloud properties, including their reflectivity and the resulting regional radiation budget. We discuss Arctic and Antarctic field and satellite observations and establish a strong and fundamental link between the biology at the ocean/sea ice interface, clouds and climate over polar regions.",

In this review, the performances of traditional technologies and nanotechnology for water treatment and environmental remediation were compared with the goal of providing an up-to-date reference on the state of treatment techniques for researchers, industry, and policy makers. Pollutants were categorized into broad classes, and the most cost-effective techniques (traditional and nanotechnology-based) in each category reported in the literature were compared. Where information was available, cost and environmental implications of both technologies were also compared. Traditional treatment technologies were found to currently offer the most cost-effective choices for removal of several common pollutants from drinking water and polluted sites. Nano-based techniques may however become important in complicated remediation conditions and meeting increasingly stringent water quality standards, especially in removal of emerging pollutants and low levels of contaminants.

            "abstract": "Precipitation scavenging (i.e., wet removal) has long been recognized as one of the major removal processes for tropospheric aerosol particles, and the dominant one for accumulation-mode size particles. When rain drops evaporate, the aerosol material contained in drops is resuspended, and this process has received much less attention. Unlike the resuspension from evaporated cloud droplets, the aerosol particles resuspended from evaporated rain drops have much larger sizes than most of the aerosol particles that acted as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), became cloud borne, and then were collected by rain drops, because each rain drop generally collects thousands of cloud droplets. Here we present some aspects of this resuspension process obtained from modeling studies. First, we investigate some details of the process using a simple drop-size resolved model of raindrop evaporation in sub-saturated air below cloud base. Using these results, we then investigate different treatments of this process in a global aerosol and climate model that employs a modal aerosol representation. Compared to the model’s original treatment of this process in which rain-borne aerosol is resuspended to the mode that it came from with its original size, the new treatment that resuspends to the coarse mode produces notable reductions in global CCN concentrations, as well as sulfate, black carbon, and organic aerosol mass, because the resuspended aerosol particles have much shorter lifetimes due to their larger sizes. Somewhat surprisingly, there are also notable reductions in coarse-mode sea salt and mineral dust burdens. These species are resuspended to the coarse mode in both the original and new treatments, but these resuspended particles are fewer in number and larger in size in the new treatment. This finding highlights some issues of the modal aerosol treatment for coarse mode particles.",

While prior studies have found some evidence of human influence on precipitation changes, the detection of streamflow changes is not robust. Here, we show that the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle, namely the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff, is an important piece of the puzzle that may explain the apparent disconnect between the detectability of precipitation and streamflow changes. We apply Budyko framework to quantify sensitivity of hydrological changes to climate driven changes in water balance regionally. We demonstrate that the hydrological sensitivity is 3 times greater in regions where the hydrological cycle is energy limited (wet regions) than water limited (dry regions), and therefore the detectability of streamflow changes is also greater by 30-40% in wet regions. Evidence from observations in western North America and an analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models at global scales indicate that use of the Budyko framework can help identify robust and spatially heterogeneous hydrological responses to external forcing on the climate system.",

It is suggested that the ASL is the primary large/regional scale atmospheric circulation feature contributing to the variability of sea ice in the Ross Sea during the advance and retreat periods of the ice. Using observed sea ice concentration data, geopotential height and indices describing the depth and location of the ASL this research establishes statistical links between the variability of the ASL during the advance and retreat periods of the ice. The results clarify which characteristic of the ASL exerts the strongest influence on the variability of ice in the Ross Sea and also in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas.

            "abstract": "The lower Xe abundance in Earth's atmosphere, in comparison to other noble gases like Ar and Kr, is one of the most challenging open questions in geosciences [1]. The origin of the so-called \"missing Xe paradox\" is usually attributed to the inclusion of Xe in the interior of Earth[2]. Although Xe is known to form compounds (e.g. with hydrogen, oxygen), none of them can be related with Earth's interior. Indeed, only a very low amount of Xe can be incorporated in silica at <1 GPa and 500K [3]. On the other hand, experimental attempts have failed to trace possible formation of Fe-Xe compounds up to 155 GPa and bellow 2500K [4]. A very recent theoretical study, suggests that Xe-Ni and Xe-Fe compounds can form at thermodynamic conditions representative of Earth's outer core [5].\nHere we explored the possible formation of stable compounds in the Xe-Fe/Ni system at thermodynamic conditions representative of Earth's outer core starting from the following mixtures: a) Xe-Fe, b) Xe-Ni and c) Xe and an Fe/Ni alloy representative of Earth’s core (ca 6% Ni). Using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy we report the formation of: a) a XeNi3 compound, in the form of a CrNi3-type FCC solid solution, above 150 GPa and 1500K, b) a Xe(Fe/Ni)3 compound, tentatively characterized as an orthorhombic NbPd3-type solid solution, above 190 GPa and 2000K and c) a still not completely characterized XeFexcompound above 180 GPa and 2000K. This work provides a plausible explanation of the \"missing Xe paradox”, and underscores the importance of understanding the novel rules of high-pressure chemistry for an improved understanding of the structure and chemistry of the Earth’s core.\n[1] E.

            "abstract": "Flow of natural fluids is often associated with dispersion of dissolved chemical species and their surface deposition either by precipitation kinetics or aggregation. For most industrial or practical flows, this wall deposition has a detrimental effect that hiders transport by clogging or alters the fluid container; therefore it is important to gain a better understanding of transport in reactive flows and the range of deposition patterns developed.\n This talk has two main aims. Firstly, it is to present a combined theoretical and numerical approach to explore the diverse yet generic wall morphologies that develop in channel flows either due to precipitation kinetics or aggregation of spherical particles. These deposition patterns range from dendrites to needles and fan-like structures growing against the mean flow direction, and depend strongly on flow perturbations and dispersion properties. The second goal is to revisit classical Taylor’s theory of dispersion in turbulent pipe flows and to show that, in fully developed turbulence, it predicts a nontrivial connection between longitudinal dispersion and the turbulent energy spectrum that we can also test and observe in numerical simulations.",

The CICE5 also includes a melt pond parameterization that takes into account the deformed and non-deformed ice within a model grid cell. Snow on sea ice processes allow for an evolving effective snow grain radius as a function of temperature, which is used in the shortwave radiative transfer and surface albedo calculation. I will discuss the results from coupled climate model sensitivity simulations that consider the subgridscale representations of some of these processes.

            "abstract": "Transverse, non-compressive turbulence (Alfven-wave turbulence) is likely an important mechanism for heating the corona and inner heliosphere. Turbulent heating relies upon the cascade of fluctuation energy from large scales to small scales, and in Alfven-wave turbulence this energy cascade arises from nonlinear interactions between counter-propagating fluctuations. Because the Sun launches only outward-propagating Alfven waves, a turbulent energy cascade in open-magnetic-field regions requires some source of inward-propagating waves. One of the most important sources of such inward-propagating waves is non-WKB reflection. In this talk I will briefly review previous studies of Alfven-wave turbulence and non-WKB wave reflection. I will then describe recent work by Dr. Jean Perez and myself, including a new direct numerical simulation of reflection-driven Alfven-wave turbulence from the Sun out to a heliocentric distance of 65 solar radii. The numerical domain of this simulation consists of 512x512x32769 grid points that span a narrow magnetic flux tube centered on a radial magnetic field line with periodic boundary conditions in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction. This flux tube extends from the photosphere, through the chromosphere and corona, and into the solar wind. The simulation accounts for the radial inhomogeneity in the solar-wind outflow velocity, density, and background magnetic field strength. I will describe the basic properties of the turbulence in this simulation as well as the key phenomenologies that control the radial evolution of the amplitudes and power spectra of both inward and outward-propagating Alfven fluctuations. I will also discuss predictions from the simulation that can be tested by Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter.",

Many, but not all, of the thick ice shelves located along the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas are experiencing rapid thinning due to enhanced basal melting driven by the intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water. Determination of their mass balance provides an indicator as to the future of the shelves buttressing capability; however, measurements of surface accumulation are few, limiting the precision of the mass balance estimates. Here, we present new radar-derived measurements of snow accumulation primarily over the Getz and Abbott Ice Shelves, as well as the Dotson and Crosson, which have been the focus of several of NASA’s Operation IceBridge airborne surveys between 2009 and 2014. Specifically, we use the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) snow radar to map the near-surface (< 30 m) internal stratigraphy to measure snow accumulation. Due to the complexities of the local topography (e.g., ice rises and rumples) and their relative proximity to the ocean, the spatial pattern of accumulation can be equally varied. Therefore, atmospheric models might not be able to reproduce these small-scale features because of their limited spatial resolution. To evaluate whether this is the case over these narrow shelves, we will compare the radar-derived accumulation rates with those from atmospheric models.",

Surface albedo feedback (SAF) has been shown to contribute prominently to the currently observed PA along with other mechanisms, e.g. involving atmospheric heat transport. SAF is believed to be a strong positive local feedback, while the atmospheric heat transport makes the connection between the Arctic and the low latitudes non-local. We will discuss several PA mechanisms and feedbacks suggested by different researchers. We will also discuss a more general method of feedback analysis that results in feedback and gain matrices. These matrices generalize (both globally and locally) the classically defined numerical gains and feedback factors and are independent of the applied forcing. The gain matrix, in particular, is shown to reveal, under any forcing scenario, the global pattern by which a given feedback process amplifies or dampens fixed-feedback temperature anomalies. Moreover, in the case of a feedback process that is not purely a function of local temperature, these matrices will show the degree to which this \"local feedback process\" depends on non-local perturbations. We apply this method in the context of a simple box model as well as a one-dimensional energy balance climate model.",

            "abstract": "According to the early anthropogenic hypothesis proposed by Ruddiman (2003), human influence on Earth’s climate began several thousand years before the beginning of the industrial era. Agriculture and deforestation starting around 8000 years before present (BP) and slowly increasing over the Holocene, would have led to an increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, preventing a natural cooling of Earth’s climate.\nHere, the emphasis is not on testing Ruddiman’s hypothesis, but rather on exploring the carbon cycle and climate commitment from potential early CH4 and CO2 emissions. In contrast to modern greenhouse gas emissions, early emissions occurred over millennia, allowing the climate system to come to near-equilibrium with the applied forcing.\nWe perform two transient Holocene simulations with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity – the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). The first simulation is a standard transient Holocene simulation, forced with reconstructed changes in CO2 and CH4 concentrations and orbital and volcanic forcing. The second simulation is forced with CO2 and CH4 concentrations corrected for the net anthropogenic contribution postulated by Ruddiman (2007), with other forcings evolving as in the standard simulation. The difference in diagnosed emissions between the two simulations allows us to determine the anthropogenic emissions. After year 1850, anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 emissions are set to zero and the simulations continued for several hundred years. In this paper, we analyze the carbon cycle and climate response to the applied forcings, and quantify the resulting (post 1850) commitment from early anthropogenic interference.",

            "abstract": "Have you watched YouTube lately? Did you notice the plethora of cute animal videos? Researchers, including members of our Beaver Restoration Research team, have been studying the restoration potential of beaver for decades, yet in the past few years, beaver have gained broad acclaim and some much deserved credit for restoration of aquatic systems in North America. Is it because people can now see these charismatic critters in action from the comfort of their laptops? While the newly released Beaver Restoration Guidebook attempts to answer many questions, sadly, this is not one of them. We do, however, address the use of beaver (Castor canadensis) in stream, wetland, and floodplain restoration and discuss the many positive effects of beaver on fluvial ecosystems. Our team, composed of researchers from NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Forest Service, and Portland State University, has developed a scientifically rigorous, yet accessible, practitioner’s guide that provides a synthesis of the best available science for using beaver to improve ecosystem functions. Divided into two broad sections -- Beaver Ecology and Beaver Restoration and Management -- the guidebook focuses on the many ways in which beaver improve habitat, primarily through the construction of dams that impound water and retain sediment. In Beaver Ecology, we open with a discussion of the general effects that beaver dams have on physical and biological processes, and we close with “Frequently Asked Questions” and “Myth Busters”. In Restoration and Management, we discuss common emerging restoration techniques and methods for mitigating unwanted beaver effects, followed by case studies from pioneering practitioners who have used many of these beaver restoration techniques in the field. The lessons they have learned will help guide future restoration efforts. We have also included a comprehensive beaver ecology library of over 1400 references from scientific journals, “grey” literature, websites, legislation, regulations and presentations. In summary, the guidebook supports beaver restoration underpinned by science, such that a more comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of beaver ecology, restoration and management emerges.",

Response to each of these methods is sensitive to the individual asteroid’s characteristics, some of which may not be well constrained before an actual deflection mission. Numerical simulations of asteroid deflection, using both hypervelocity impacts and nuclear ablation of the asteroid’s surface, provide detailed information on asteroid response under a range of initial conditions. Here we present numerical results for the deflection of asteroids by both kinetic and nuclear methods, focusing on the roles of target body composition, strength, porosity, rotational state, shape, and internal structure. These results provide a framework for evaluating the planetary defense-related value of future asteroid characterization missions and capture some of the uncertainty that may be present in a real threat scenario.\nPart of this work was funded by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at LLNL under project tracking code 12-ERD-005, performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "We used geologic mapping applied to Dawn spacecraft data as a tool to understand the geologic history of the Ac-H-7 Kerwan Quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres. This region, located between 22˚S-22˚N and 72-144˚E, hosts four primary features: 1) the northern part of the 284 km diameter impact basin Kerwan in the center and SE corner of the quadrangle, whose rim is degraded and whose interior has been filled with a ‘smooth material’ that hosts a significantly lower impact crater density than most of the rest of Ceres’ surface; 2) a portion of the 125 km diameter crater Dantu, whose ejecta field covers the NE corner of the quadrangle and where color data show both bright and dark materials, suggesting excavation of terrains of different compositions; 3) an unnamed double crater in the NW corner of the quadrangle surrounded by an ejecta field; and 4) a heavily cratered plains unit in the SW corner of the quadrangle that appears to be part of the dominant unit across Ceres surface. Key goals of the ongoing mapping are to assess the types of processes that might be responsible for resurfacing by the smooth unit, and understanding the nature of the variably-colored Dantu ejecta. The Dantu region is one of two longitudinally distinct regions on Ceres where ESA Hershel space telescope data suggested a release of water vapor (1). At the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including grayscale and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) images in January 2016.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "Over the length of the observational record, the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been loosing ice to the ocean, significantly contributing to global sea level rise. This signal is largely due to glacial flow acceleration in West Antarctica, driven by oceanic melting at its margin and the induced thinning of the glacier buttressing ice shelves. Pine Island Glacier is one stellar example where vigorous oceanic melting fundamentally modifies the geometry of the ice-ocean interface and the associated ice dynamics. Since the early 1970's, the glacier terminating ice shelf has thinned, its grounding line has retreated, and its speed has doubled, now reaching close to 11 m/day. During that time, oceanic melting has increased, injecting fresh and nutrient-rich waters between the surface and intermediate depth in the coastal southern ocean. Using autonomous platforms, ship-borne ocean observations, ground-based and airborne radar observations, satellite observations and numerical modelling, this talk will review the mechanisms behind this trajectory of change and open perspectives on its potential impacts in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Warming of high-latitude continental-margin oceans has the potential to release large quantities of carbon from gas hydrate and other sedimentary reservoirs. To assess how carbon mobilized from the seafloor might amplify global warming or alter ocean chemistry, a robust analysis of the concentrations and isotopic content of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the water column and atmosphere is required. To this effect, a gas analysis system consisting of three cavity ring-down spectrometers was developed to obtain a real-time, three-dimensional characterization of the distribution and isotopic variability of methane and CO2 at a shallow (<100 m water depth) bubbling methane seep offshore of western Svalbard. Surface water methane concentrations from the continuous-flow CRDS system agreed remarkably well with discrete samples analyzed by the GC-based headspace analysis technique and with a CRDS-based discrete sample analysis module. Reliable carbon isotope data were also obtained from the CRDSs once an isotopic calibration routine was applied.\nThe resulting data revealed that CO2 uptake from the atmosphere within the surface water methane plume overlying the gas seep was elevated by 36-45% relative to surrounding waters. In comparison to the positive radiative forcing effect expected from the methane emissions, the negative radiative forcing potential from CO2 uptake was 32-43 times greater. Lower water temperatures, elevated chlorophyll-fluorescence and 13C-enriched CO2 within the surface methane plume suggest that bubble-driven upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water stimulated CO2 uptake by phytoplankton. The observation that a shallow methane seep has a net negative radiative forcing effect challenges the widely-held perception that methane seeps contribute to the global atmospheric greenhouse gas burden.",

We found that specific subsets of geysers appear to be the\nsources of identifiable tendril features present in the images.\nHowever, there remained features not captured by our initial\nsimulations: a shift in longitude for the brightest part of the\ntendrils and two features which only appear in some images.\nIn this initial work, we neglected Enceladus’ orbital eccentricity as\nwell as the periodicity and phase of the variability in geysering\nactivity recently discovered and attributed to a ~5-hour delay in the\ndiurnally variable tidal stresses at the surface (Nimmo et al. 2014).\nAnd we made no attempt to do a photometric determination of the mass\nlost from the moon into orbit around Saturn.\nWe will report on our progress in rectifying these inadequacies. We\nwill present the result of including Enceladus's orbital eccentricity,\nas well as a diurnally variable particle flux out of each geyser, in\naccord with the observed plume variability. Eventually, we will use\nthe absolute brightness of the tendrils, together with a photometric\nmodel and information on the particle size distribution from our work,\nand the work of other Cassini teams on E ring particles, to arrive at\nthe amount of mass leaving the moon and entering Saturn orbit.\nMitchell et al., 2015, AJ, 149, 156.\nNimmo et al., 2014, AJ, 148, 46.\nPorco et al., 2014, AJ, 148, 45.\nIngersoll and Ewald, 2011, Icarus, 216, 492",

            "abstract": "Given the explosive growth in urbanization and its dominant role in current and future global greenhouse gas emissions, urban areas have received increasing research attention from the carbon cycle science community. The emerging focus is driven by the increasingly dense atmospheric observing capabilities – ground and space-based – in addition to the rising profile of cities within international climate change policymaking. Dominated by anthropogenic emissions, urban carbon cycle research requires a cross-disciplinary perspective with contributions from disciplines such as engineering, economics, social theory, and atmospheric science. We review the recent results from a sample of the active urban carbon research efforts including the INFLUX experiment (Indianapolis), the Megacity carbon project (Los Angeles), Salt Lake City, and Boston. Each of these efforts represent unique approaches in pursuit of different scientific and policy questions and assist in setting priorities for future research. From top-down atmospheric measurement systems to bottom-up estimation, these research efforts offer a view of the challenges and opportunities in urban carbon cycle research.",

FFDAS is based on the Kaya identity constrained by multiple ground and space-based observations. Among these are the DMSP nightlights, Landscan population, and the Ventus power plant database. We have recently downscaled the FFDAS version 2.0 to 1 km x 1 km resolution using nighlights. The finer spatial resolution allows for the examination of urban emissions across the planet. We take two approaches to examination of urban FFCO2 emissions. The first, utilizes named administrative boundaries combined with manual GIS identification (supported by LandSat and ISA) to identify the top emitting urban areas of the planet. We also utilize an urban land mask, without governmental boundary identification, to analyze all urban area by country across the planet. We perform multiple regression to identify key drivers and patterns. The results demonstrate the change in urban emissions during the last decade and assess the question of whether urban areas exhibit scaling properties vis a vis FFCO2 emissions.",

The three-dimensional flow is simulated by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations utilizing a variational multiscale method (VMS) turbulence model and the finite-element method (i.e. Elmer-FEM software), which also solves the heat equation. By studying a wide range of key parameters of the system, e.g. channel diameter, Reynolds number, water flux, water temperature and Darcy–Weisbach wall roughness (which is explicitly represented on the wall geometry), it is found that the Dittus–Boelter equation is inadequate for glaciological applications and a new, highly suitable heat transfer parameterization for englacial/subglacial channels will be presented. This new parameterization utilizes a standard combination of dimensionless numbers describing the flow and channel (i.e. Reynolds number, Prandtl number and Darcy–Weisbach roughness) to predict a suitable Nusselt number describing the effective heat transfer and thus can be readily used in existing englacial/subglacial hydrology models.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory creep experiments conducted using organic-rich shales show that these rocks exhibit some ductility under sustained loading conditions although they may appear to be elastic and brittle (Young’s modulus 15-80 GPa) at shorter time scales. At room-temperature and in-situ pressure conditions, creep strain observed after 3 hours of sustained loading reach strains on the order of 10-5per megapascal of applied differential stress. The creep behavior is highly anisotropic such that creep occurs more in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane than in the direction parallel to the bedding plane.\nIn general, we find that the creep behavior is largely controlled by the amount of clay mineral and organic content. This is also supported by evidences of elastic stiffening and sample volume reduction during creep which imply that the creep is accommodated by localized compaction occurring within clay-aggregates and/or organic materials, the relatively porous members in the rock. We also find that the tendency to creep has a unique relation with the Young’s modulus regardless of the loading direction or the mineral composition. Sone and Zoback (2013) explained this correlation by appealing to the stress partitioning behavior that occurs between the relatively stiff and soft components of the rock, and also by assuming that creep only occurs within the soft components, namely the clay and organic contents, with a specific local 3-hour creep compliance value of 10-4 MPa-1.\nIn order to confirm that such strain-partitioning occurs during creep deformation, we also performed creep experiments under a scanning electron microscope using a deformation stage setup. Such experiments allow us to directly observe the deformation and quantify the strain-partitioning occurring between the different mineral constituents with the aid of digital image correlation analysis. Results suggest that strain-partitioning do occur during creep deformation and inferred creep properties of clay aggregates and organic materials are close to those assumed in previous analyses.",

The resulting high-resolution numerical model is typically computationally demanding. Here, we compare two methods for approximating high-resolution solutions: the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) Mapping method, and the POD-Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method. The POD Mapping method utilizes an efficient low-resolution model for prediction after training a reduced order model (ROM) using high- and low-resolution solutions. On the other hand, the POD-GPR method constructs a statistical ROM that directly maps the input parameters to the high-resolution solutions. The approximation error can be quantified either through an error estimator (POD Mapping method) or a variance estimate (POD-GPR method). Initial results indicate that the POD Mapping method is more accurate than the POD-GPR method when the same set of training data is used.

While it is widely recognized that CO2 injection can generate damage-causing stresses, there is little information on the hydrologic consequences of the resulting fractures in terms of the magnitude of potential CO2 leakage. In this study, we perform experiments at reservoir conditions designed to fracture caprock and cement while simultaneously observing changes in permeability coupled with direct observation of fracture growth using x-ray video radiography and fracture geometry by x-ray tomography. Triaxial coreflood experiments using a direct-shear configuration were performed at confining pressures ranging from 3-22 MPa at 20 oC. Permeability was strongly dependent on confining pressure but also on the orientation of the fractures in relation to bedding. Samples fractured at high confining pressures had low permeability (typically <0.1 mD). Samples fractured at low confining pressures had permeabilities that ranged from 10s of mD across bedding to as high as 1 D parallel to bedding.\nVideo radiography was collected through observations parallel to the direct shear plane. These captured the rate of fracture growth (on the order of seconds) and were used in relation to the onset of elevated permeability to investigate fracture-permeability dynamics. X-ray tomography was conducted at pressure but under static conditions and showed that fracture apertures at high confining pressures were significantly smaller than fracture apertures recovered at atmospheric conditions. Preliminary results suggest that increasing material plasticity accompanying high confining pressures resulted in decreased permeability, smaller apertures, and more poorly connected fracture networks. Typical sequestration conditions correspond to the higher confining pressures used in this study, suggesting that the failure characteristics of caprock and cement may be capable of limiting fracture transmissivity in response to mechanical damage.",

These waves carry momentum and energy fluxes as they propagate, and can deposit momentum and energy when waves dissipate due to either instability or background diffusion. The global budgets of gravity wave momentum fluxes have previously been estimated by using ground-based observations, and more recently deduced from satellite observations. There have been less reports on the global energy flux budget. In this study, we analyze the momentum and energy fluxes calculated from mesoscale-resolving Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), including their global distribution, altitude dependence, and seasonal variation. The momentum fluxes and their spatial and seasonal variation are found to be in general agreement with satellite observations. With this verification of the momentum flux, the energy flux budget, in particular the altitude dependence of the total energy flux, is examined.",

Riverine systems where groundwater mixes with surface water (the hyporheic zone) are spatially complex and temporally dynamic, making development of predictive models challenging. Spatial and temporal variations in hyporheic zone microbial communities are a key, but understudied, component of riverine biogeochemical function. To investigate the coupling among groundwater-surface water mixing, microbial communities, and biogeochemistry we applied ecological theory, aqueous biogeochemistry, DNA sequencing, and ultra-high resolution organic carbon profiling to field samples collected across times and locations representing a broad range of mixing conditions. Our results indicate that groundwater-surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone simultaneously (i) stimulated heterotrophic respiration, (ii) altered organic carbon composition, (iii) caused ecological processes to shift from stochastic to deterministic, and (iv) selected for microbial taxa capable of degrading a broad suite of organic compounds.",

Most raw weather data is collected from satellites that are past their intended decommission date, and the likelihood of a catastrophic failure and diminishing reliability increases with each passing day. A United States government report released this year recognized the potential risk that this creates, citing a few alternatives to our aging satellite technology to at least maintain the level of raw weather data we currently have available. This report also highlighted nanosatellites as one of the most promising solutions, due in no small part to their standard form factor, translating into increased launch capabilities and better resiliency with fewer points of failure, rapidly advancing technology and low capital expenditure. Taking advantage of rapid advancements in sensor technology, these nanosatellites are replaced every two years or less and de-orbit quickly. Each new generation carries an improved payload and offers more network-wide resiliency. A constellation of just ten GPS-RO enabled nanosatellites taking measurements from every point on Earth, coupled with a globally distributed network of ground stations, can provide five times more radio occultation data than the combined efforts of current weather satellites. By the end of this year, Spire Global, Inc. will launch the world’s first network of commercial weather satellites using GPS-RO for raw data collection.",

            "abstract": "We present the first global mapping and analysis of CO2 on the surface of Enceladus, and we report the largest concentrations of free CO2 on the southern polar region using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on Cassini. Free CO2 ice and complexed CO2 were already reported near the South Pole (Brown et al., Science, 2006; Hansen, LPSC, 2010). Our work focuses on determining the amount, location and molecular state of CO2 on Enceladus, which could help identify and model geophysical processes that currently occur in the interior. One hypothesis for bringing heat and chemicals to the surface is a warm subsurface ocean containing dissolved gases, mostly CO2 (Postberg F. et al., Nature, 2009). Therefore, our observations are consistent with erupted and condensed materials onto Enceladus’ surface (Matson et al., Icarus, 2012; Matson et al. AGU Fall meeting 2015). Free CO2 ice absorbs at 4.268 µm (Sandford and Allamandola, 1990) and CO2 complexed with other molecules absorbs at 4.247 µm (Chaban et al., Icarus, 2007). The Enceladus case is complicated because both free and complexed CO2 are present, and the absorption band of interest is shallow and close to the instrument detection limit. Many of the few Enceladus VIMS data sets have significant and sometimes unusual noise, which we attempted to avoid or remove. We utilized all VIMS data sets available that were collected over ten years of the Cassini mission as a way to improve the detection statistics and signal to noise. We also used wavelengths near 2.7 µm where CO2 has a narrow absorption as a filter to help identify CO2-rich areas. Finally, we selected observations that have spatial resolution better than 100 km in order to create a map that can be compared with the largest fractures, known as Tiger Stripes, in the southern polar region.",

In this paper, we have investigated statistical properties of solar facula and sunspot area (and their ratio) covering entire solar cycle 23 and the ascending phase of cycle 24. The facular area has been considered from the K-line composite at the San Fernando Observatory and is a direct measurement of the strength of solar cycle activity. It is found that solar facular area decreased during minimum phase of cycle 23/24 compared to maximum phase and also during rising phase of cycle 24. However, the ratio of facula to sunspot area increased during minimum epoch of cycle 23. Power spectrum analysis shows that along with other periods, the solar rotational periods 22 -31 days and Rieger type periods are both prominent during maxima, minima of cycle 23 and ascending branch of cycle 24. During the decline phase of cycle 23, the period ~ 27 days is more prominent whereas ~ 14 days and ~ 31 days periods are dominant during activity maxima. During maximum phase of cycle 23 and 24, there was no phase lag between sunspot and facular area, but a phase lag ~ 3 months has been detected during activity minima of cycle 23. These results indicate that the distribution of active regions during the activity maximum years is quite different from that in the minimum years.

It can be applied to aggregate demand over a geographical region, or for disaggregated demand related to a specific crop or use. Consequently, it is more directly related than existing indices, to potential drought impacts on different segments of society, and is also suitable to use as an index for drought insurance programs targeted at farmers growing specific crops. An application of the index is presented for the drought characterization at the county level for the aggregate demand of eight major field crops in the conterminous United States. Two resiliency metrics are developed and applied with the drought index time series. In addition, a clustering algorithm is applied to the onset times and severity of the worst historical droughts in each county, to identify the spatial structure of drought, relative to the cropping patterns in each county. The geographic relationship of drought severity, drought recovery relative to duration, and resilience to drought is identified, and related to attributes of precipitation and also cropping intensity, thus distinguishing the relative importance of water supply and demand in determining potential drought outcomes.",

Without a stabilizing climate feedback, however, habitability would be accidental and likely brief. We propose a stabilizing climate feedback for such a planet that requires only biological production of H2 to balance net loss to space that has some optimal temperature, and operates less efficiently at higher temperatures. A stable feedback is possible on such a planet through which a perturbation increasing temperature decreases H2 production, which decreases H2 greenhouse warming and therefore temperature. The potential of such a feedback makes H2-warmed planets more attractive astrobiological targets.",

            "abstract": "Over 75% of all historically documented tsunamis have been generated by earthquakes. As the result, all existing Tsunami Warning and Forecast systems focus almost exclusively on detecting, warning and forecasting earthquake-generated tsunamis.The sequence of devastating tsunamis across the globe over the past 10 years has significantly heightened awareness and preparation activities associated with these high-impact events. Since the catastrophic 2004 Sumatra tsunami, NOAA has invested significant efforts in modernizing the U.S. tsunami warning system. Recent developments in tsunami modeling capability, inundation forecasting, sensing networks, dissemination capability and local preparation and mitigation activities have gone a long way toward enhancing tsunami resilience within the United States.\nThe remaining quarter of the tsunami hazard problem is related to other mechanisms of tsunami generation, that may not have received adequate attention. Among those tsunami sources, the asteroid impact may be the most exotic, but possible one of the most devastating tsunami generation mechanisms. Tsunami forecast capabilities that have been developed for the tsunami warning system can be used to explore both, hazard assessment and the forecast of a tsunami generated by the asteroid impact. Existing tsunami flooding forecast technology allows for forecast for non-seismically generated tsunamis (asteroid impact, meteo-generated tsunamis, landslides, etc.), given an adequate data for the tsunami source parameters. Problems and opportunities for forecast of tsunamis from asteroid impact will be discussed. Preliminary results of impact-generated tsunami analysis for forecast and hazard assessment will be presented.",

This multi-institution effort funded by both governmental and non-governmental agencies has provided a case study for identification and verification of emissions using a multi-scale, top-down approach. This approach leverages a combination of remote sensing to identify areas that need specific focus and airborne in-situ measurements to quantify both regional and large- to mid-size single-point emitters. Ground-based networks of mobile and stationary measurements provide the bottom tier of measurements from which process-level information can be gathered to better understand the specific sources and temporal distribution of the emitters. The motivation for this type of approach is largely driven by recent work in the Barnett Shale region in Texas as well as the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado; these studies suggest that relatively few single-point emitters dominate the regional emissions of CH4.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is motivating much of the science research in the Arctic. Natural hazards, which have always been with us and can be influenced by climate, also pose a serious threat to sustainability of Arctic communities, the Native cultures they support, and the health and wellbeing of their residents. These are themes of the US Chairship of the Arctic Council. For example, repetitive floods, often associated with spring ice jams, are a particularly severe problem for river communities. People live near rivers because access to food, water and river transportation support an indigenous subsistence lifestyle. Some settlement sites for Indigenous Peoples were mandated by distant authorities without regard to natural hazards, in Alaska no less than in other countries. Thus bad policy of the past casts a long shadow into the future. Remote communities are subject to multiple challenges, including natural hazards, access to education, and limited job opportunities. These intersect to reproduce structural vulnerability and have over time created a need for substantial support from government. In the past 40 years, the themes of “sustainability” and “self reliance” have become prominent strategies for governance at both state and local levels. Communities now struggle to demonstrate their sustainability while grappling with natural hazards and chronic poverty. In the extreme, the shifting of responsibility to resource-poor communities can be called “structural violence”. Accepting the status quo can mean living without sanitation and reliable water supply, leading to the high observed rates of disease not normally encountered in developed countries. Many of the efforts to address climate change and natural hazards are complementary: monitoring the environment; forecasting extreme events; and community-based participatory research and planning. Natural disaster response is complementary to the Arctic Council’s Search and Rescue (SAR) initiative, differing in that those in need of assistance need not be searched for and are not from elsewhere. Despite the obstacles to broad engagement imposed by an absence of roads and primitive telecommunications, an investment needs to be made in getting all stakeholders together for serious planning of disaster prevention, preparedness, and response.",

It plays an important role of the energy transfer and the meteorological phenomena such as evaporation, vapor transport, cloud formation, and rainfall in the troposphere. Ozone is an important air pollutant that at high concentrations impacts on human health and ecosystem including crops and also a greenhouse gas that plays an important role in climate change. Aerosol is an important climate parameter and also one of the largest error sources (causes) in retrieval from solar reflected short wavelength infrared radiances observed with greenhouse gases observing satellites such as the GOSAT and OCO-2. Therefore, we have been developing ground-based differential absorption lidars (DIALs) for measuring the tropospheric water vapor, ozone and aerosols.\nThe water vapor DIAL employs two distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers operating at 829.054 nm for the online wavelength and 829.124 nm for the offline wavelength with tapered semiconductor optical amplifier (TSOA) in a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration, and utilizes pseudorandom coded pulse modulation technique.\nIt has started to measure the vertical distribution of lower tropospheric water vapor in order to improve accuracy and lead time of numerical weather prediction of local heavy rainfalls. Well-organized and regularly spaced convective cells of which vertical thickness were 200 m and the periods were 10 minutes were observed in the top of planetary boundary layer at 2.5 km altitude over Tokyo (35.66°N, 139.37°E) on 22 June 2015.\nThe ozone DIAL employs a Nd:YAG laser and a 2 m long Raman cell filled with CO2 gas which generates four Stokes lines (276.2, 287.2, 299.1, and 312.0 nm) of stimulated Raman scattering, and two receiving telescopes with diameters of 49 and 10 cm.\nIt has started to measure the vertical distributions of the tropospheric ozone as well as aerosols and thin cirrus cloud in order to validate GOSAT product. High concentrations of ozone and aerosols were observed below 2 km altitude on 22 March 2015 over Saga (33.24°N, 130.29°E), which could be transported with spherical aerosols and dust particles from Northeast Asia. The observational result of ozone will be compared with a chemistry-climate model.",

            "abstract": "In the Archean, deep mantle upwelling resulted in the formation of thick, buoyant, hot and therefore weak continental plates, as well as thicker oceanic crusts and plateaux that may have impeded and perhaps prevented modern style subduction. Continents were easy to deform and too weak to support high mountain belts and orogenic plateaux which characterize modern collisional orogens. Overall, it would be very surprising if Archean tectonics processes were similar than those observable today.\nOver the past decade, numerical experiments have shown that the style of subduction depends on i/ the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plate which controls whether subduction zones are double sided or single sided; ii/ the buoyancy of the subducting plate which controls whether subduction is spontaneous or requires a push and whether slabs retreat or not; iii/ the yield stress of the subducting plate which controls whether recurrent slab breakoff occurs or not.\nStudies focused on the behaviour of continental plates show that only minor thickening (tectonic or volcanic via the emplacement of continental flood basalts) is required for the crust to reach its solidus, which would have promoted the foundering of greenstone covers into the crust (sagduction).\nIn a convergence setting, weak continents would have deformed easily and convergence mainly accommodated by lateral expulsion and lateral flow under a regional transcurrent tectonic regime.\nNumerical experiments suggest that thick and buoyant continents would have imparted significant horizontal stresses on adjacent oceanic plates, the slow spreading of thick and buoyant continents leading to the initiation of subduction.\nProvided that continental lithospheric mantle could spontaneously subduct, numerical experiments suggest that in a convergent setting accretionary orogeny rather than continental collision was a dominant tectonic style with implications for crustal growth and differentiation.",

Such flows may arise when water is injected into reservoirs, to displace oil, or during the injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers as part of a geosequestration scheme. Tracers, which can be used to help identify the flow pattern and flow speed, can exhibit unusual trajectories within a porous layer when controlled by buoyancy driven flow, and may be hostage to the mixing effects of buoyancy driven shear dispersion. The effects of capillarity on such dispersion will also be discussed. A series of idealised models of the flow will be presented to illustrate some of the key phenomena through a combination of analogue bead pack experiments and theoretical calculations of the associated flow processes.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate modeling using convection-permitting models (CPMs; horizontal grid spacing <4 km) emerges as a promising framework to provide more reliable climate information on regional to local scales compared to traditionally used large-scale models (LSMs; horizontal grid spacing >10 km). CPMs no longer rely on convection parameterization schemes, which had been identified as a major source of errors and uncertainties in LSMs. Moreover, CPMs allow for a more accurate representation of surface and orography fields. The drawback of CPMs is the high demand on computational resources. For this reason, first CPM climate simulations only appeared a decade ago. We aim to provide a common basis for CPM climate simulations by giving a holistic review of the topic. The most important components in CPMs such as physical parameterizations and dynamical formulations are discussed critically. An overview of weaknesses and an outlook on required future developments is provided. Most importantly, this review presents the consolidated outcome of studies that addressed the added value of CPM climate simulations compared to LSMs. Improvements are evident mostly for climate statistics related to deep convection, mountainous regions, or extreme events. The climate change signals of CPM simulations suggest an increase in flash floods, changes in hail storm characteristics, and reductions in the snowpack over mountains. In conclusion, CPMs are a very promising tool for future climate research. However, coordinated modeling programs are crucially needed to advance parameterizations of unresolved physics and to assess the full potential of CPMs.",

            "abstract": "Sawajiriwan and Sanukayama rhyolite lavas are distributed along west and east coasts of Kozushima Island, Japan, respectively (Taniguchi, 1977). They were erupted in about 40,000-50,000 years ago (Yokoyama et al., 2004). The both lavas are characterized by alignment of spherulites as well as previous works (Seaman et al., 2009; Clay et al., 2013). Seaman et al. (2009) attributed the spherulite alignment to the contrasting water concentration and concluded that the heterogeneity of water contents has already achieved within the magma chamber. In this study, we propose that development of the spherulite alignment is significantly related to the fracturing within the lavas.\n In Sawajiriwan lava, the distal part is well exposed and shows ramp structure and reverse faults with ductile-deformed fault planes. The both structures were formed within consistent compressional stress deduced from their geometry. Discrepancy of the structure would be attributed to the strain rate variation within the advancing lava. The spherulite alignment is characteristically developed along the planes. This indicates that the fractures acted as degassing pathway, and the part achieved large undercooling. The fault planes would be healed and deformed after decreasing strain rate, and spherulites were eventually grown along the planes.\n In Sanukayama lava, the ductile-deformed cataclastic faults are often developed as well as Sawajiriwan lava. The cataclasite is composed of porphyroclasts and nano- and micro-scale fine particles such as microlite and crystalline fragments. Microscopic observation clearly showed that the fine particles are released from the fault margin into the surrounding melt and are aligned along the flow line. Spherulites typically nucleated on the aligned fine particles, and consequently spherulite alignment was developed. We concluded from the lavas that development of the spherulite alignment is significantly related to the fracturing within the lavas.",

            "abstract": "During Summer 2014 we deployed ~900 cable-free seismographs within ~12 km of Mount St. Helens. Each seismograph contained a 10-Hz geophone and recorded continuously for two weeks with a sample rate of 250 Hz. The array temporarily provides a major increase in spatial coverage compared to the 10-station long-term monitoring array, but each of the geophone has a high noise floor compared to the force-feedback sensors of the long-term array that is part of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN). We are investigating the utility of the geophone array for source and structural analyses using ambient noise, high-frequency microseismicity, deep long-period seismicity, and 23 controlled sources from the concurrent iMUSH active source project. Surface waves extracted from ambient noise cross-correlation have adequate signal to noise ratios for upper crustal tomography using frequencies ~0.2-0.5 Hz. Efforts to extract higher frequency body waves with interferometry are ongoing and include focusing on time periods with stronger high frequency noise or coda from controlled sources and earthquakes. Continuous back-projection of the array data into the 3-D subsurface was used to automatically detect and locate high-frequency (>5 Hz) microseismicity extending down to ~M-2, with a completeness magnitude of ~0.3. Two deep crustal low frequency earthquakes (<5 Hz) detected by PNSN occurred during our survey. We relocated these events and are using them to optimize back-projection parameters and create matched filters to search for additional deep low frequency seismicity. One of the deep low frequency events locates at approximately Moho depth using back-projection of S-wave energy and S-P times from dense geophone sub-arrays. This event occurs just southeast of Mount St. Helens in an area where controlled source refraction tomography images anomalously slow lower crust and common midpoint stacking images a bright Moho indicative of a locally high impedance contrast between the lower crust and upper mantle.",

Some annually repeated lines indicate changes in the aquifer extent and depth below the surface. Loss of ice/bedrock interface returns in archival radar depth sounding data from the early 1990’s implies the aquifer was in place at that time. Ground-based measurements from field campaigns in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015 verify the radar detection and supply additional information on water thickness, volume, and flow.",

The SMILE mission is jointly supported by ESA and CSA, and the launch date is expected to be in 2021.\nSMILE will address several key outstanding questions concerning how the solar wind interacts with the magnetospheres on a global level. Quantitatively estimating the energy input from the solar wind into the magnetosphere on a global scale is still an observational challenge. Using global MHD simulations, we derive a new solar wind – magnetosphere energy coupling function. The X-ray images of the magnetosphere from the SMILE mission will help estimate the energy transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere. A second aspect SMILE can address is the open magnetic flux, which is closely related to magnetic reconnections in the dayside magnetopause and magnetotail. In a similar way, we find that the open magnetic flux can be estimated through a combined parameter f, which is a function of the solar wind velocity, number density, the southern interplanetary magnetic field strength, and the ionospheric Pederson conductance. The UV auroral images from SMILE will be used to determine the open magnetic flux, which may serve as a key space weather forecast element in the future.",

            "abstract": "This presentation looks back over ten years of experience advancing data curation education at two Information Schools, highlighting the vital role of earth science case studies, expertise, and collaborations in development of curriculum and internships. We also consider current data curation practices and workforce demand in data centers in the geosciences, drawing on studies conducted in the Data Curation Education in Research Centers (DCERC) initiative and the Site-Based Data Curation project. Outcomes from this decade of data curation research and education has reinforced the importance of key areas of information science in preparing data professionals to respond to the needs of user communities, provide services across disciplines, invest in standards and interoperability, and promote open data practices. However, a serious void remains in principles to guide education and practice that are distinct to the development of data systems and services that meet both local and global aims. We identify principles emerging from recent empirical studies on the reuse value of data in the earth sciences and propose an approach for advancing data curation education that depends on systematic coordination with data intensive research and propagation of current best practices from data centers into curriculum. This collaborative model can increase both domain-based and cross-disciplinary expertise among data professionals, ultimately improving data systems and services in our universities and data centers while building the new base of knowledge needed for a foundational science of data.",

            "abstract": "Longitudinal river profiles respond to changes in tectonic uplift rates through climate-modulated erosion. Therefore, rock uplift rate information should be recorded in fluvial topography and extracting this information provides crucial constraints on tectonic processes. In addition to the shape of the modern river profile, paleo-river profiles can often be mapped in the field by connecting strath terraces. These strath terraces act as markers that record complex incision histories in response to rock uplift rates that vary in space and time. We exploit an analytical linear solution to the linear version (n=1) of the stream-power equation to efficiently extract uplift histories from river networks and strath terraces. The analytical solution is based on the transient solution to the linear version (n=1) of the stream-power equation. The general solution to this problem states that the elevation of a point in a river channel is equal to the time integral of its uplift history, where integration is carried out over the time required for an uplift signal to propagate from the baselevel of the river network to the point of interest. A similar expression can be written for each strath terrace in the dataset. Through discretization of these expressions into discrete timesteps and spatial nodes, a linear system of equations can be solved using linear inverse methods. In this way, strath terraces and river profiles can be interpreted in an internally consistent framework, without the requirement that the river profile is in a steady state. We apply our approach to the Northern Apennines where strath terraces have been extensively mapped and dated. Comparison of our inferred rock uplift rate history with modern rock uplift rates enables us to distinguish short-term deformation on a buried thrust fault with long-term mountain building processes.",

            "abstract": "Catchment-wide cosmogenic nuclide concentration (CNCs) measurements of erosion rates have revolutionized the interpretation of processes responsible for generating mountainous landscapes. However, surface processes can vary within a single catchment, leading to spatial and temporal variations in erosion rates. This is particularly apparent for landscapes that have transient topographic features due to changes in tectonics or inherited glacial topography. Detrital thermochronometry provides a means to assess where modern sediment is derived as a function of elevation, and constrains the relative erosion rates across a catchment. To solve the corresponding inverse problem, we build on the Bayesian interpretation of probability of observing a detrital age (Avdeev et al., 2011) and use a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample both the parameter space and also the model complexity. Rivers within the Codera watershed of the Bergell Intrusion (Central European Alps) have incised into a glacial valley. We integrate constraints from detrital apatite fission track ages and detrital 10Be concentrations to interrogate the primary erosion processes shaping this Alpine landscape and constrain rates of erosion across the catchment. We find that modern erosion rates within most downstream portions of the landscape are too low to permit the inferred ∼500 m of incision during the most recent interglacial. Based on the spatial pattern of modern erosion rates, we predict that if the incised fluvial valley was formed solely during interglacial periods, incision is likely to have initiated almost 400,000 years BP. We explore the potential for this type of analysis to study inaccessible landscapes currently covered by ice.\nAvdeev, B., Niemi, N.A., Clark, M.K., 2011.

            "abstract": "Conditions favoring peat accumulation have been particularly prevalent in boreal and subarctic regions. The large pool of organic carbon accumulated in Northern peatlands has been an important component in the global carbon cycle throughout the Holocene. All northern peatlands store an estimated 440 Pg organic carbon while a separate study estimates that permafrost region peatlands store ca. 300 Pg organic carbon. However, the degree of overlap between these studies remains unclear and there are differences in methodologies and definitions which prevent direct harmonization of estimates. Here we address this problems by (1) compiling several different databases of field observation data and by (2) comparing previously estimated northern peatland areal extents to the extents of organic soils estimated from compiled harmonized regional and national soil maps from the northern mid and high latitudes. Organic soils are by definition peatlands with >40 cm of near surface peat. The combined estimated extent of organic soils in these maps is 3.44 million km2. This is very similar to the spatial extents of Northern peatlands derived from various national peat resource inventories as reported by previous studies. Our results show that roughly one third of this organic soil area is in permafrost. Based on newly compiled databases we provide spatially distributed estimates of peatland depth and stocks of peat carbon across different biomes. These analyses reveal significant differences in peat depth and carbon stocks between peatland regions and between non-permafrost and permafrost peatlands.",

            "abstract": "The longitudinal distributions of post-sunset quiettime equatorial ionospheric irregularity occurrences in two solstices are examined to understand the irregularity occurrences with respect to the vertical drift velocity and density variations. It is found that high irregularity occurrences are clustered at longitudes where background mean vertical drift velocities are positive and densities are high. Conversely, longitudes of practically nil irregularity occurrences are located in the longitude sectors where mean vertical drift velocities are downward and densities are low. The results further confirm the fact that high post-sunset ionosphere with positive vertical drift velocities are keys to the irregularity occurrences. However, high positive vertical drift velocities and densities are not necessarily located at longitudes of good sunset terminator alignment with the magnetic flux tube, or vice versa during solstices. Scatters found in the vertical drift velocities around the dip equator seem to indicate the existence of large variations in the vertical drift velocities that are sufficient to provide perturbations for the irregularity occurrences. The need of outside agitation from direct gravity wave seeding for the irregularity occurrences seems unnecessary.\n ",

            "abstract": "The Critical Zone Observatories add value to earth system science and society by addressing research gaps to understand the critical zone, the surface skin of the earth that extends from the top of the tree canopy to the lower limits of the groundwater. The Critical Zone (CZ) sustains life on earth and provides food, shelter, forage, and fuel and other services to human well-being. This Zone is also where most of human activities take place and thus subject to change and degradation. Managing the critical zone to obtain and sustain these services will require initiatives, policies and incentives that maintain and enhance this zone.\nThe Critical Zone Observatories are seeking to address major gaps in understanding how earth surface evolves over time and how it will respond to future changes. Many of these gaps in our understanding occur at the interface between disciplines, across space and deep time scales, and multiple dimensions. For example, the Reynolds Creek CZO seeks to understand the role of soil environmental variables such as soil moisture and depth that vary across complex terrain in governing soil carbon storage and turnover in a semi-arid environment. For this reason, soil samples are being collected to depth of bedrock. Other networks and agencies such as the new LTAR and NEON are quantifying soil carbon at more shallow depths that will likely capture the variability in near surface soil carbon that is more sensitive to management and climate changes but may underestimate the total stores of carbon on the landscape. The CZOs also provide a platform to conduct interdisciplinary to transdisciplinary science by integrating across geological, soil, hydrologic, ecological, and social sciences to understand the critical zone. The emergence of the CZO Network and the LTAR network brings the opportunity to standardize methods and test hypotheses and ask questions across broad environmental conditions and gradients that could not be achieved with single principle investigator funding efforts. Partnerships such as these will increase the ability of the earth system science community to understand how to manage for the critical zone to sustain social, economic and environmental benefits derived from the CZ.",

In this study, the typical transport paths of East Asia dust, which affect regional and global climates, are demonstrated and numerous effects of dust aerosols on clouds and precipitation primarily over East Asian arid and semi-arid regions are discussed. Compared with the dust aerosols of Saharan, those of East Asian are more absorptive of solar radiation, and can influence the cloud properties not only by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei but also through changing the relative humidity and stability of the atmosphere (via semi-direct effect). Converting visible light to thermal energy, dust aerosols can burn clouds to produce a warming effect on climate, which is opposite to the first and second indirect effects of aerosols. Over Asia arid and semi-arid regions, the positive feedback in the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction may aggravate drought in its inner land. Impact of Asia dust on regional environment, especially on haze weather, are also presented in this talk.",

            "abstract": "The global distribution of planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, which was estimated from the attenuated back-scatter observations of Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), is presented. In general, the PBL is capped by a temperature inversion that tends to trap moisture and aerosols. The gradient of back-scatter observed by lidar is almost always associated with this temperature inversion and the simultaneous decrease of moisture content. Thus, the PBL top is defined as the location of the maximum aerosol scattering gradient, which is analogous to the more conventional thermodynamic definition. The maximum standard deviation method, developed by Jordan et al. (2010), is modified and used to derive the global PBL heights. The derived PBL heights are not only consistent with the results of McGrath-Spangler and Denning (2012) but also agree well with the ground-based lidar measurements. It is found that the correlation between CALIPSO and the ground-based lidar was 0.73. The seasonal mean patterns from 4-year mid-day PBL heights over global are demonstrated. Also it is found that the largest PBL heights occur over the Tibetan Plateau and the coastal areas. The smallest PBL heights appear in the Tarim Basin and the northeast of China during the local winter. The comparison of PBL heights from CALIPSO and ECMWF under different land-cover conditions showed that, over ocean and forest surface, the PBL height estimated from the CALIPSO back-scatter climatology is larger than the ones estimated from ECMWF data. However, the PBL heights from ECMWF, over grass land and bare land surface in spring and summer are larger than the ones from CALIPSO. ",

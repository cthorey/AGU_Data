            "abstract": "A new method for the determination of the Alfvén wave energy generated during magnetic reconnection is introduced and used to analyze the results from two-dimensional MHD and Hall MHD simulations. It is found that the regions with strong Alfvén wave perturbations almost coincide with that where both magnetic-field lines and flow-stream lines are bent, suggesting that this method is reliable for identifying Alfvén waves. The magnetic energy during magnetic reconnection is mainly transformed into the thermal energy. The conversion rate to Alfvén wave energy from the magnetic energy is strongly correlated to the magnetic reconnection rate. The maximum conversion rate at the time with the peak reconnection rate is found to be only about 4% for the cases with different plasma beta.",

            "abstract": "Detrital provenance analyses in orogenic settings, in which sediments are collected at the outlet of a catchment, have become an important tool to estimate how erosion varies in space and time. Here we present how Raman Spectroscopy on Carbonaceous Material (RSCM) can be used for provenance analysis. RSCM provides an estimate of the peak temperature (RSCM-T) experienced during metamorphism. We show that we can infer modern erosion patterns in a catchment by combining new measurements on detrital sands with previously acquired bedrock data. We focus on the Whataroa catchment in the Southern Alps of New Zealand and exploit the metamorphic gradient that runs parallel to the main drainage direction. To account for potential sampling biases, we also quantify abrasion properties using flume experiments and measure the total organic carbon content in the bedrock that produced the collected sands. Finally, we integrate these parameters into a mass-conservative model. Our results first demonstrate that RSCM-T can be used for detrital studies. Second, we find that spatial variations in tracer concentration and erosion have a first-order control on the RSCM-T distributions, even though our flume experiments reveal that weak lithologies produce substantially more fine particles than do more durable lithologies. This result implies that sand specimens are good proxies for mapping spatial variations in erosion when the bedrock concentration of the target mineral is quantified. The modeling suggests highest present-day erosion rates (in Whataroa catchment) are not situated at the range front, as might be expected from the long-term metamorphic rock exhumation pattern, but about 10 km into the mountain belt near the location of maximum rain fall and highest short-term (contemporary) inter-seismic uplift.",

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) materialize as a complex of tropical waves. It is controversial whether the waves are principally passive responses to the latent heat released by the massive convective envelope, or the wave-dynamics are the essential pillars of the mechanics of the MJO. Either way, it is of interest to identify the respective contributions from various waves in a MJO convective envelope. The combined-Fourier-wavelet-transform technique introduced by Kikuchi (2014) enables us to dissolve the MJO convective envelope into different tropical-wave components and quantify their contributions, at any given time and location. We applied this technique to the outward longwave radiation data observed during the CINDY2011 campaign, as well as to those simulated (Miyakawa et al. 2014) by the global cloud-system resolving model NICAM on the K computer. The MJOs in the model were able to propagate eastward at a similar speed with observation although they underestimated the strong Kelvin-wave signals embedded in the observed MJO, supporting that the waves are principally passive responses to the MJO-scale environment. On the other hand, the MJO eastward propagation was delayed in a simulation that overestimated westward cyclonic disturbances and associated surface latent heat flux near the equator, suggesting that the disturbances embedded in the MJO convective envelope can feedback to the MJO-scale features under certain conditions.\nKikuchi, K., 2014: An introduction to combined Fourier-wavelet transform and its application to convectively coupled equatorial waves.

            "abstract": "We present a composite analysis (H+ and O+) of energetic ion spectra and kappa distribution fits, using combined ion measurements from Charge Energy Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS, 3 to 236 keV/e), Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurements System (LEMMS, 0.024 < E < 18 MeV), and the Ion Neutral Camera (INCA, ~5.2 to >220 keV for H+). The modeled expressions of these energetic ion distributions are then used to obtain the four integral particle moments (from zeroth to 3rd moment: n, In, P, IE, i.e. Density, Integral number intensity, Pressure, Integral energy intensity) as well as the characteristic energy (EC=IE/In) of these ions as a function of Local Time and L-Shell. We find that a) protons dominate the energetic ion (>30 keV) integral number and energy intensity at all radial distances (L>5 Rs) and local times, while the H+ and O+ partial pressures and densities are comparable; b) the 12<L<20 Rs region corresponds to a local equatorial acceleration region, where quasi-adiabatic transport of H+ and non-adiabatic acceleration of O+, dominate the ion energetics (compared to the contribution of charge exchange with the Saturnian neutral cloud); c) energetic ion bundles in the 12<L<17 Rs, that -possibly- result from rotating energetic particle blobs shown in previous studies, produce durable signatures (enhancements) in the H+ and O+ pressure, density and temperature; d) energetic ions are depleted inside the orbit of Rhea (~8 Rs), i.e. the energetic ion lifetimes due to charge exchange decrease significantly with decreasing distance in the innermost parts of Saturn’s magnetosphere, so that pressure and density drop to minimum inside ~8 Rs.\nWe then utilize a technique to retrieve the equatorial H+ and O+ pressure, density and temperature in Saturn's magnetosphere, using a modified version of the Roelof and Skinner [2000] model in both local time and L-shell.\nRoelof, E.

            "abstract": "Natural fractures have an effect on the fluid flow and heat transfer in the naturally fractured geothermal reservoir. However, most of the previous works in this area assumed that reservoir systems are continuum model whether it is single continuum or dual continuum. Moreover, some people have studied without continuum model but, it was just pipeline model. In this paper, we developed a generalized discrete fracture network (DFN) geothermal reservoir simulator. In the model, 2D flow is possible within a rectangular fracture, which is important in thick naturally fractured reservoirs. The DFN model developed in this study was validated for two synthetic fracture systems using a commercial thermal model, TETRAD. Comparison results showed an excellent matching between both models. However, this model is only fracture model and it can’t calculate simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer in matrix. Therefore, matrix flow model will be added to this model.",

It is found that STD is changeable with time, and a century-scale variation is revealed, which further indicates a century-scale intensity modulation of the large-scale temperature variability. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) can cause significant impacts in standard deviation. During the periods of 1870–1910 and 1950–80, increasing standard deviation corresponds to increasing AMO index, while the periods of 1920-50 and 1980-2000 decreasing standard deviation corresponds to decreasing AMO index.

            "abstract": "Isotopic measurements on junipers growing in southern California during the last glacial, when the ambient atmospheric [CO2] (ca) was ~180 ppm, show the leaf- internal [CO2] (ci) was close to the modern CO2 compensation point for C3 plants. Despite this, stem growth rates were similar to today. Using a coupled light-use efficiency and tree growth model, we show that the ci/ca ratio was stable because both vapor pressure deficit and temperature were decreased with compensating effects. Reduced photorespiration at lower temperatures partly mitigated the effect of low ci on gross primary production, but maintenance of present-day radial growth also required changes in carbon allocation, including a ~25% reduction in below-ground carbon allocation and a ~7% in allocation to leaves. Such a shift was possible due to reduced drought stress. Our findings are consistent with the observed increase in below-ground allocation in FACE experiments and the apparent homoeostasis of measured radial growth as ca increases today; results which our model can also reproduce.",

            "abstract": "The overstory and understory vegetation in forest ecosystems need to be treated differently in carbon cycle modeling, because carbon fixed through net primary productivity has different residence times for different components. Satellite remote sensing is currently the only feasible technique to monitor the vegetation status as a continental and/or global scale over a long periods of multiple years. However, there are no existing satellite products that provide simultaneous estimate of overstory and understory leaf area index (LAIo and LAIu) at present. Consequently, we proposed an integrating look-up table (LUT) method to remotely estimate the LAIo and LAIu for boreal forests, where are encountering rapider temperature change than other areas. In the newly proposed method, the understory normalized vegetation difference index (NDVIu) is first retrieved from multiple satellite observations by using a semi-empirical method. Then the LAIu is estimated from the retrieved NDVIu through searching a LUT generated by radiative transfer simulation for understory vegetation. In order to estimate the LAIo, a new land-cover map of forest types, which classifies the boreal forests as low, medium and high types, is generated by using a wall-to-wall canopy height product to replace the conventional global land-cover maps. The LUTs containing angles, LAIu, LAIo, and corresponding reflectance at red and near-infrared bands are generated for each forest type by running a radiative transfer model. Specifically, the forest landscape parameters are determined by an empirical forest structure model. Moreover, the retrieved NDVIu is used as an ancillary information to constrain the relationship between LAIo and canopy reflectance. The validation results showed acceptable accuracy based on our filed measurement at interior Alaska, America.",

            "abstract": "Integrated hydrological models (IHMs) consider surface water and subsurface water as a unified system, and have been widely adopted in basin-scale water resources studies. However, due to IHMs’ mathematical complexity and high computational cost, it is difficult to implement them in an iterative model evaluation process (e.g., Monte Carlo Simulation, simulation-optimization analysis, etc.), which diminishes their applicability for supporting decision-making in real-world situations. Our studies investigated how to effectively use complex IHMs to address real-world water issues via surrogate modeling. Three surrogate modeling approaches were considered, including 1) DYCORS (DYnamic COordinate search using Response Surface models), a well-established response surface-based optimization algorithm; 2) SOIM (Surrogate-based Optimization for Integrated surface water-groundwater Modeling), a response surface-based optimization algorithm that we developed specifically for IHMs; and 3) Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM), a stochastic response surface approach. Our investigation was based on a modeling case study in the Heihe River Basin (HRB), China’s second largest endorheic river basin. The GSFLOW (Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model) model was employed. Two decision problems were discussed. One is to optimize, both in time and in space, the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater for agricultural irrigation in the middle HRB region; and the other is to cost-effectively collect hydrological data based on a data-worth evaluation. Overall, our study results highlight the value of incorporating an IHM in making decisions of water resources management and hydrological data collection. An IHM like GSFLOW can provide great flexibility to formulating proper objective functions and constraints for various optimization problems. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that surrogate modeling approaches can pave the path for such incorporation in real-world situations, since they can dramatically reduce the computational cost of using IHMs in an iterative model evaluation process. In addition, our studies generated insights into the human-nature water conflicts in the specific study area and suggested potential solutions to address them.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that national average surface solar radiation (Rs) decreased by -8.0 W m-2 per decade from 1960 to 1990 and sharply increased from 1990 to 1993. However, none of the state-of-the-art climate models can reproduce such decrease/increase of Rs. This study shows that Rs observations over China have significant inhomogeneity. Before 1989, Rs was calculated as a sum of direct (Rsdir) and diffuse (Rsdif) solar radiation observations measured by pyrheliometers and shaded pyranometers separately. Due to technical limitations and irregular calibration, pyranometers before 1990 had a strong sensitivity drift problem, which introduced crucial spurious decreasing trends into Rsdif and Rs data. From 1990 to 1993, instruments and measurement methods were replaced and measuring stations were restructured in China, which resulted in an abrupt increase in the observed Rs.\nRs calculated from Sunshine duration (SunDu) provide a reliable reference in assessing decadal variability of Rs. SunDu derived Rs have no sensitivity drift problem because of its daily changed recording material. SunDu-derived Rs averaged over China decreased by -2.9 W m-2 per decade from 1961 to 1990, and had a negligible trend afterward. During the period of 1994-2012 when Rs observations were free of inhomogeneity mentioned above, the observed and SunDu-derived Rs consistently show a negligible trend, being less than 0.1 W m-2 per decade. These trends can be reproduced by high-quality CMIP5 Earth System Models (ESM). This level of agreement is due to the incorporation of a near real emission inventory of atmospheric aerosols by CMIP5 ESMs.\nRs from ERA-Interim has a good agreement with SunDu-derived Rs. However, ERA-interim does not allow aerosol loading to change annually. ERA-Interim Rs shows an unreliable increasing trend of 1.9 W m-2 per decade from 1990 to 2013 because it does not include the impact of recent increased atmospheric aerosols over China. GEWEX Rs calculated from ISCCP cloud products show a significant but erratic decreasing trend of -3.1 W m-2 per decade from 1983 to 2007 over China. The ISCCP cloud products aggregate cloud observations from polar orbit and geostationary satellites directly, which introduced to inhomogeneity to ISCCP cloud and GEWEX Rs products.",

            "abstract": "A significant portion of the oil released from the Macondo well after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DwH) explosion reached the seafloor (1,2). The transfer of buoyant hydrocarbons from the sea surface and subsurface plumes to depths >1500 m, however, is not well understood. A prominent role for sinking marine snow––small, composite particles composed largely of extracellular polymeric substances exuded by algae and bacteria––has been proposed. Snow particles, rich in carbohydrates, may have sorbed and physically entrained oil from the water column as they sank. Several lines of evidence support this scenario: abundant snow was observed 3-4 weeks after the oil spill (3); oil and dispersants can induce marine snow formation (4); and flocculent material covering deep-sea corals near the DwH site contained biomarkers consistent with Macondo oil (5).\nTo investigate whether the chemically complex marine oil snow leaves a direct sedimentary record, we analyzed carbohydrates at high resolution (2 mm intervals) in sediment cores collected at 4 sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico in 2013 using a modified phenol-sulfuric acid spectrophotometric method. We detected a sharp subsurface peak in carbohydrate concentrations near the Macondo well; we interpret this peak as post-DwH marine snow. Coeval carbohydrate, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and hopane profiles suggest a clear link between marine snow and Macondo oil components, as documented in a 3-year time-series at one site, and enable preliminary conclusions about the delivery and fate of marine snow components in sediments.\nWe also characterized carbohydrates near the wellhead using fluorescent lectin-binding analyses developed for applications in cell biology. Particle morphologies include collapse structures suggestive of a water column origin. Finally, we explore the extent to which polysaccharide residues detected with selective lectins can be used to determine the provenance of marine snow (e.g., bacterial v. algal).\n(1) Valentine et al., 2014.

            "abstract": "Wildfire is a major disturbance across the North American boreal forests. Canopy ecophysiology is important to understand recovery of carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes after wildfires.\nWe developed a big-leaf model coupled photosynthesis (Farquhar et al., 1980) and stomatal conductance (Ball et al., 1987) models. We inputted eddy covariance data from fire chronosequence across the North American boreal forests into the big-leaf model for optimizing parameters: maximum carboxylation rate at 25℃ (Vcmax25) and stomatal conductance parameters. The model was optimized with a global optimization technique: SCE-UA method (Duan et al., 1994). The estimated canopy-scale parameters were then downscaled into a leaf scale (vcmax25; values per sun leaf area) using a two-leaf radiation transfer model (de Pury and Farquhar, 1997) and leaf area index. We used 6 sites from two fire chronosequence in Alaska (1~, 3~, 5~, 15~ and 80~ years after fire; Liu et al., 2005; Iwata et al., 2011) and 6 sites from a Canadian chronosequence study (6~, 15~, 23~, 40~ and 74~ years after fire; Goulden et al., 2010).\nPreliminary results showed clear seasonal variations in canopy-scale Vcmax25 with the maximum during the summer. In Alaska, the downscaled vcmax25 for four years after fire exceeded those of mature forests, indicating that the photosynthetic capacity recovered quickly in the early successional stage. This quick recovery was not seen in gross primary productivity. We will show the variations of the ecophysiological parameters in terms of environment conditions and stand age.\n  ",

            "abstract": "The analysis of land-atmosphere feedbacks requires detailed representation of land processes in atmospheric models. Our focus here is on runoff-infiltration partitioning and resolved overland flow. In the standard version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, coupled with the Noah Land Surface Model, runoff-infiltration partitioning is described as a purely vertical process. In the WRF-Hydro coupled modeling system, runoff is enhanced with lateral water flows. The study region is the Sissili catchment (12800 km2) in West Africa, and the period of investigation is March 2003 - February 2004. Our WRF setup includes an outer and inner domain at 10 and 2 km resolution, respectively. In our WRF-Hydro setup the inner domain is coupled with a sub-grid at 500 m resolution to compute overland and river flow. Model results are compared with TRMM precipitation, MTE evapotranspiration, CCI soil moisture, CRU temperature, and streamflow observation. In the outer domain, a sensitivity analysis to runoff-infiltration partitioning gives a range of simulated annual precipitation of one sixth of the annual amount. In the inner domain, where precipitation patterns are mainly prescribed by lateral boundary conditions, sensitivity is small, but additionally resolved overland flow here clearly increases infiltration and evapotranspiration at the beginning of the wet season when soils are still dry. Our WRF-Hydro setup shows the potential of this fully coupled modeling system for joint atmospheric and terrestrial water balance studies, and reproduces observed daily discharge with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.43.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges pertaining to extreme geomagnetic storms is to understand the basic processes associated with the development of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere currents, which generate large induced surface geoelectric fields. Previous studies point out the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements during extreme storms. We examined induced global geoelectric fields derived from ground-based magnetometer recordings for 12 extreme geomagnetic storms between the years 1982--2005. However for the present study, an in-depth analysis was performed for two important extreme storms, October 29, 2003 and March 13, 1989. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide further evidence on the existence of localized peak geoelectric field enhancements, and to show that the structure of the geoelectric field during these localized extremes at single sites can differ greatly from globally and regionally averaged fields. Although the physical processes that govern the development of these localized extremes are still not clear, we discuss some possible causes.",

We explore the hypothesis that mud flats and vegetation as a self-formed lateral confinement have effects analogous to that of river floodplain on braided versus meandering river patterns. Here we use the Delft3D numerical model and a novel tidal flume setup, the Metronome, to create estuaries from idealized initial conditions, with and without mud supply at the fluvial boundary. Experimental mud was simulated by crushed nutshell. Both the numerical and experimental estuaries were narrower with increasing mud, and had a lower degree of channel braiding. The experimental estuaries developed meanders at the river boundary with floodplain developing on the pointbar whereas cohesionless cases were more dynamic.",

The equatorial zone of Central Africa is almost free of them with the exception of the CZO of the Upper Nyong river basin (organic-rich river on the lateritic plateau of South Cameroon; SO BVET,\nhttp://bvet.omp.obs-mip.fr/\n). On both sides of the Equator line, the Ogooué River Basin (215,000 km2) stretches on about 80% of the total area of Gabon and drains various geological and morpho-pedological contexts and feeds the sedimentation areas of the Central African passive margin (Guillochaux et al., 2014). The Upper Ogooué (up to Lambaréné) drains the stepped planation surface of the Congo craton while the Lower Ogooué drains Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary terrains. The climate is equatorial (Pmean = 2500 mm/yr; Tmean = 26 °; %humidity > 80%). Continuous hydro-climatic chronicles exist for the period 1953-1974 (managed by ORSTOM, now IRD). The runoff at Lambaréné (92% of the basin area) is very high (714 mm/yr). With a rural density of 1 inhabitant/km2, it is one of the last largely pristine tropical forested ecosystems on the Planet. In addition, the basin will be, in the coming decades, the theatre of important anthropogenic changes (dams, agriculture, mining, urbanisation, …). However, a conservation plan with an ambitious sustainable development policy is set up. This plan articulates the environmental issues related to the emergence of the country. Because of these characteristics, the basin offers ideal conditions for studying the changes in equatorial region of hydro-climate, weathering/erosion regimes and regolith production based on morpho-pedological contexts and associated physical, chemical and biological processes. It is thus germane to launch an integrated CZO initiative at both regional scale and local scale. At the regional scale, we plan to reactivate some of the hydro-climatic stations located on the planation surface (Franceville, Ayem, and Lambaréné). At the local scale, we plan to set up a small experimental watershed on the Lopé stream draining the northern part of the Lopé National Park, which is covered by a mosaic of forest and savannah. The Ogooué CZO will be highly complementary to the Nyong CZO, Cameroon, and a major asset for the international community.",

            "abstract": "We determined glass and vesicle CO2 contents, plus trace element contents for fifty-one ultradepleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses distributed globally. Sixteen had no vesicles and were volatile undersaturated. Thirty-five had vesicles and were slightly oversaturated. If this latter group lost bubbles during emplacement, then CO2/Ba calculated for the undersaturated group alone is the most reliable and uniform ratio at 98±10, and CO2/Nb is 283±32. If they did not lose bubbles, then CO2/Nb is the most uniform ratio for the entire suite of ultradepleted MORBs at 291±132, while CO2/Ba decreases with incompatible element enrichment.\nFor a wider range of compositions, we used published estimates of CO2 in enriched basalts that retained vesicles e.g., “popping rocks”, and from melt inclusions in normal MORBs. As incompatible element enrichment increases, CO2/Nb increases from 283±32 in ultradepleted MORBs to 603±69 in depleted melt inclusions to 936±132 in enriched basalts. In contrast, CO2/Ba is nearly constant at 98±10, 106±24 and 111±11 respectively. This suggests that Ba is the best proxy for estimating CO2 contents of MORBs, with an overall average CO2/Ba = 105±9. Atlantic, Pacific and Indian basalts have similar values. Gakkel ridge has anomalously high Ba and low CO2/Ba.\nUsing the CO2/Ba ratio and an average MORB composition, the CO2 concentration of a primary, average MORB is 2085+473/-427 ppm while primary NMORB has 1840ppm CO2. The annual flux of CO2 from mid-ocean ridges is 1.25±0.16 x 1014 g/yr (0.93 - 1.61 x 1014 g/yr is possible): higher than published estimates that use CO2/3He in MORB and the abyssal ocean 3He flux. This may be accounted for by a CO2/3He ratio that is higher than the commonly accepted MORB ratio of 2x109 due to leverage by more enriched basalts. NMORB mantle has 183 ppm CO2 based on simple melting models. More realistic estimates of depleted mantle composition yield lower estimates of ~60-130ppm, with large uncertainties that depend more on melting models than on CO2/Ba.

            "abstract": "Three dimensional inversion of transient electromagnetic (TEM) data is still challenging. The inversion speed mostly depends on the forward modeling. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is one of the popular forward modeling scheme. In an explicit type, which is based on the Du Fort-Frankel scheme, the time step is under the constraint of quasi-static approximation. Often an upward-continuation boundary condition (UCBC) is applied on the earth-air surface to avoid time stepping in the model air. However, UCBC is not suitable for models with topography and has a low parallel efficiency. Modeling without UCBC may cause a much smaller time step because of the resistive attribute of the air and the quasi-static constraint, which may also low the efficiency greatly. Our recent research shows that the time step in the model air is not needed to be constrained by the quasi-static approximation, which can let the time step without UCBC much closer to that with UCBC. The parallel performance of FDTD is then largely released. On a computer with a 4-core CPU, this newly developed method is obviously faster than the method using UCBC. Besides, without UCBC, this method can be easily accelerated by Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). On a computer with a CPU of\n4790k@4.4GHz\nand a GPU of GTX 970, the speed accelerated by CUDA is almost 10 times of that using CPU only. For a model with a grid size of 140×140×130, if the conductivity of the model earth is 0.02S/m, and the minimal space interval is 15m, it takes only 80 seconds to evolve the field from excitation to 0.032s.",

            "abstract": "Push-Pull test is a mature tracer test that could be used to estimate aquifer transport properties at the scale of meters by injection and then extraction at the same well. However, current mathematical model for Push-Pull test cannot capture the characteristics of a heterogeneous aquifer and does not consider the stage of tracer incubation in aquifer. A novel mobile-immobile model is proposed to explain the effect of tracer incubation in a confined heterogeneous aquifer. This model takes into account three stages, including tracer injection, incubation and extraction. Advection and dispersion both exist in the mobile zone. For the immobile zone, only dispersion is taken into consideration to interpret the effect of heterogeneity that impedes solute transport. The experimental data of three wells at a potential CO2 sequestration site with slightly fractured and heterogeneous aquifer were given to calibrate the model parameters. It is found that the decreasing rate of concentration is controlled by mass transfer rate between the mobile and immobile zones. The initial concentration of extraction decreases with longer incubation time and increases with higher injection concentration. The concentration decreasing rates of those three wells are almost the same before extraction volume/injection volume of 6, which implies that dilution dominates in this period. After that, the decreasing rate deviates with each other. A possible reason is that degradation plays more important role with longer reaction time.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is one key parameter for hydrocarbon generation and preservation, also playing important role in geothermal energy assessment;however, accurate regional temperature pattern is still challenging, owing to a lack of data coverage and data quality as well. The Yangtze area, located in the South China, is considered as the most favorable target for shale gas resource exploration in China, and attracts more and more attention recently. Here we used the newly acquired steady-state temperature loggings, reliable Drilling Stem Test temperature data available and thermal properties, estimated the subsurface temperature-at-depth for the Yangtze area. Results show that the geothermal gradient ranges between 17 K/m and 74K/m, mainly falling into 20~30K/m, with a mean of 24 K/m; heat flow varies from 25 mW/m2 to 92 mW/m2, with a mean of 65 mW/m2. For the estimated temperature-at-depth, it is about 20~50 ℃ at the depth of 1000m, 50~80℃ for that at 2000m; while the highest temperature can be up to 110℃ at 3000m depth. Generally, the present-day geothermal regime of the Yangtze area is characterized by high in the northeast, low in the middle and localized high again in the southwest, and this pattern is well consistent with the tectono-thermal processes occurred in the area. Due to Cenozoic crustal extension in the northeastern Yangtze area, magmatism is prevailed, accounting for the high heat flow observed. Precambrian basement exists in the middle Yangtze area, such as the Xuefeng and Wuling Mountains, heat flow and subsurface temperature accordingly show relatively low as well. While for the southwestern Yangtze area, especially Yunnan and western Sichuan provinces, localized Cenozoic magmatism and tectonic activities are available, which is attributed to the high geothermal regime there. Considering the Paleozoic intensive tectonic deformation in the Yangtze area, tectonically stable area is prerequisite for shale gas preservation. Geothermal regime analysis presented here, indicates that the middle and northwestern Yangtze areas are favorable for shale gas preservation. In addition, the localized high temperature within the generally low geothermal background is also suggested here as a possible beneficial condition for shale gas generation.",

The Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) in Taiwan was chosen as our study site. The horizontal S-wave seismograms of the TCU017 strong-motion station, which locates at the center of the HSP, were convoluted by the difference of the microtremor H/V ratio between various sites to synthesize the seismograms of several strong-motion stations around the HSP. The comparisons between synthetic and observed seismograms show that this method of ground motion prediction for the vicinity is feasible for far-field earthquakes. However, the seismic source and attenuation effects make this method ineffectual for near-field earthquakes. Because the microtremor H/V ratios at about 200 sites, which are densely distributed in the HSP, were conducted, the seismic ground motion distributions of some historical earthquakes were synthesized by this study. The synthetic ground motion distributions ignore the seismic source and attenuation effects but still show notable variations in the HSP because of the seismic site effects.",

It can handle the complexity of the 3-D earth model, such as heterogeneity of velocity and density, anisotropy, anelasticity, sharp velocity and density contrasts, topography. And with water column approximation, it can also deal with oceans. Because of its powerful ability, there are a wide range of application of SEM in studies of PP waves and Rayleigh waves. PP wave and its precursors have been used in measuring topography of 410 km or 660 km. Rayleigh waves are the most recognizable part of the seismograms and have been broadly applied in crustal and uppermost mantle tomography. In global SEM simulation, oceans are usually assumed to be incompressible, which means that the entire water column moves as a whole as a result of the normal displacement of the seafloor. It is necessary to investigate the accuracy of water column approximation when thickness of ocean approaches wavelength of the wave in the ocean water.\nIn this paper, based on plane wave assumption, we study both the accurate form and water column approximate form of effective boundary condition. The reflection coefficient equation of PP waves with effective boundary of water was derived. Accurate and approximate PP reflection coefficient with oceans in different depth is demonstrated. The formula of Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion with effective water boundary is also investigated. It is shown that water column approximation in global SEM simulation is not sufficient for some parts of the ocean.",

We change horizontal resolution of topography from 60-km mesh (TL319) to 560-km mesh (TL31). It is found that JJA precipitation over South India, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal between 10°N and 20°N becomes larger as the horizontal resolution of topography becomes coarser. In response to precipitation changes, vertically integrated water vapor flux also increases. Moreover, upper tropospheric temperatures over northwestern Tibetan Plateau become warmer. In addition to changes of the mean state, the timing of northward rain belt shift from Equatorial region becomes earlier as horizontal resolution of topography becomes coarser. It is also found that the time when Meridional Thermal Gradient, defined as the difference of temperature at 300hPa between 20°N-40°N and Eq.-20°N, changes from negative to positive becomes earlier. These changes seem to be related to different snow accumulation and meting process in different topography realizations, thus implying an importance of resolution and topography in the Asian monsoon simulations.",

Similar to Global Positioning System (GPS), InSAR phase measurements are affected by the Earth’s ionospheric and tropospheric layers as the electromagnetic signals significantly refract while propagating through the different layers. While electromagnetic signals propagating through the neutral atmosphere are affected primarily by the pressure, temperature, and water vapor content of atmospheric gases, the propagation through the ionosphere is mainly affected by the number of free electrons along the signal path. Here, we present the use of dense regional GPS networks for extracting tropospheric zenith delays and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) maps in order to reduce the noise levels in the phase measurement of the InSAR images. The results show significant reduction in the RMS values when simultaneously combining the two corrections, both at short time periods where no surface deformation is expected, and at longer periods, where imaging of crustal deformation, such as the ground subsidence and aseismic fault creep, is enhanced.",

This large igneous province [LIP] is exposed in multiple volcanic sections from Vancouver Island, B.C., to southern Oregon [~700 km]. We estimate Siletzia magmatism at ~2.3 x 106 km3 west of the Cascades and may reach 4.6 x 106 km3 if correlative with Alaskan Yakutat terrane and significant portions of the LIP filled the Oregon Embayment. 40Ar-39Ar ages show the bulk of Siletzia erupted over a 6-7 Myr interval beginning at 56 Ma, implying eruption rates of 0.3-0.7 km3/yr. In Oregon, Siletz River volcanism began in the south [56-53 Ma] and migrated northward [54-50 Ma]. Concurrent eruptions of Metchosin and Crescent basalts do not show a southerly age progression. Therefore, Siletzia likely erupted south of the Kula-Farallon spreading center with ridge collision at or north of the Metchosin igneous complex.\nIsotopic data for 29 Siletzia lavas have initial 7/6Sr 0.7030-0.7037, ΕNd +4.9 - +7.7, 6/4Pb 18.70-19.94, 7/4Pb 15.49-15.63 and 8/4Pb 38.27-39.53. Olivine yield 3He/4He from 9.4 to 13.7 (R/Ra) and high MgO lavas display a narrow 187Os/188Os range (0.131-0.134) when age corrected. Both He and Os tracers are elevated above typical depleted MORB mantle and indicate plume involvement. Pb-Pb and Pb-Nd arrays suggest 3 mantle components for Siletzia volcanism: a depleted source with isotopic and trace element characteristics expected for spreading center lavas (i.e., Ku-Fa) influenced by a plume, a HIMU contaminant (i.e., high 6/4Pb; low 7/6Sr) confined to southern Siletzia, and a plume source (6/4Pb 19.00; 7/4Pb 15.55; 8/4Pb 38.60; 7/6Sr; 0.7033; ΕNd +6.4; γOs +5.0). Siletzia plume mantle is a close match to recent Yellowstone plume estimates based on early CRBG lavas. Mounting geophysical and geochemical evidence supports the contention that Siletzia is an early product of the Yellowstone hot spot in a sub-oceanic setting.",

Kopp, M.-A. Gutscher; R/V Meteor cruise 112, 2014 PI - G. Bohrmann). This new compilation of mostly unpublished bathymetric data is presented as a 2 arc-sec (60m) grid and reveals fine-scale structures on the seafloor in unprecedented detail. These include the deeply incised Malta-Hyblean Escarpment, numerous submarine canyons, broad regions of relatively flat seafloor dominated by fields of sediment waves, the gently undulating anticlinal fold-and-thrust belts of two accretionary wedge complexes related to the Hellenic subduction (W Mediterranean ridge) and to the Calabrian arc. These accretionary wedges intersect and overlap and define two of the three sides of the triangular Ionian abyssal plain. The internal structure of these morpho-tectonic provinces as well as the transition zones between them is also imaged by high-resolution 72-channel seismic reflection profiles. Together these data offer new insights into the interaction and competition between active sedimentary and tectonic processes shaping this part of the Central Mediterranean.\nAcknowledgment: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe).",

This is particularly occurring at cities such as Los Angeles, where water availability is limited during dry summers. This study applied 10-m SPOT 5 satellite imagery and a database of monthly water use records for residential water customers in Los Angeles in order to examine the interactions between vegetation water demand and residential water consumption. Here, we identify the spatial distribution of vegetation greenness and the extent of irrigation rates through water year 2005-2007, including normal, dry, and wet extremes of annual rainfall. Additionally, the water conservation ratio, which is between rates of irrigation and vegetation water demand, is used to assess over-irrigation. Although residential outdoor water usage was found as highest in the dry year, landscape vegetation under water stress that cannot maintain greenness condition as well as in wetter years. However, the decreasing trend of over-irrigation occurred from wet to drier years, since vegetation water demand increased significantly but irrigation rates changed little, implying over-irrigation in urbanized areas. This over watering issue can be implemented by water resource management, and urban planning, especially in current severe California drought.",

            "abstract": "Systematic variations of plant traits along environmental gradients have been observed for decades. For example, the tendencies of leaf nitrogen per unit area to increase, and of the leaf-internal to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (ci:ca) to decrease, with aridity are well established. But ecosystem models typically represent trait variation based purely on empirical relationships, or on untested conjectures, or not at all. Neglect of quantitative trait variation and its adapative significance probably contributes to the persistent large uncertainties among models in predicting the response of the carbon cycle to environmental change. However, advances in ecological theory and the accumulation of extensive data sets during recent decades suggest that theoretically based and testable predictions of trait variation could be achieved.\nBased on well-established ecophysiological principles and consideration of the adaptive significance of traits, we propose universal relationships between photosynthetic traits (ci:ca, carbon fixation capacity, and the ratio of electron transport capacity to carbon fixation capacity) and primary environmental variables, which capture observed trait variations both within and between plant functional types. Moreover, incorporating these traits into the standard model of C3photosynthesis allows gross primary production (GPP) of natural vegetation to be predicted by a single equation with just two free parameters, which can be estimated from independent observations. The resulting model performs as well as much more complex models.\nOur results provide a fresh perspective with potentially high reward: the possibility of a deeper understanding of the relationships between plant traits and environment, simpler and more robust and reliable representation of land processes in Earth system models, and thus improved predictability for biosphere-atmosphere interactions and climate feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Due to its geological and climatic conditions, landslides are very common and widespread phenomena in the Principality of Asturias (NW of Spain), causing economic losses and, sometimes, human victims. In this scenario, temporal prediction of instabilities becomes particularly important. Although previous knowledge indicates that rainfall is the main trigger, the lack of data hinders the proper temporal forecast of landslides in the region. To resolve this deficiency, a new landslide inventory is being developed: the BAPA (Base de datos de Argayos del Principado de Asturias-Principality of Asturias Landslide Database). Data collection is mainly performed through the gathering of local newspaper archives, with special emphasis on the registration of spatial and temporal information. Moreover, a BAPA App and a BAPA website (\nhttp://geol.uniovi.es/BAPA\n) have been developed to easily obtain additional information from authorities and private individuals. Presently, dataset covers the period 1980-2015, registering more than 2000 individual landslide events. Fifty-two per cent of the records provide accurate dates, showing the usefulness of press archives as temporal records. The use of free cartographic servers, such as Google Maps, Google Street View and Iberpix (Government of Spain), combined with the spatial descriptions and photographs contained in the press releases, makes it possible to determine the exact location in fifty-eight per cent of the records. Field work performed to date has allowed the validation of the methodology proposed to obtain spatial data. In addition, BAPA database contain information about: source, typology of landslides, triggers, damages and costs.",

For these unobserved areas, the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) can greatly contribute to air temperature estimation. In our research we utilized the MODIS LST production from both TERRA and AQUA to estimate daily mean air temperature over the TP using multiple statistical models. Other variables used in the models include longitudes, latitudes, Julian day, solar zenith, NDVI and elevation. To select a relatively optimal model, we chose six popular and representative statistical models as candidate models including the multiple linear regression (MLR), the partial least squares regression (PLS), back propagate neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forests (RF) and Cubist regression (CR). The performances of the six models were compared for each possible combination of LSTs at four satellite pass times and two quality situations. Eventually a ranking table consisting of optimal models for each LST combination and quality situation was built up based on the validation results. By this means, the final production is generated providing daily mean air temperature with the least cloud blockage and acceptable accuracy. The average RMSEs of cross validation are mostly around 2℃. Stratified validations were also performed to test the expansibility to unobserved and high-altitude areas of the final models selected.",

            "abstract": "The apatite (U–Th)/He (AHe) system has rapidly become a very popular thermochronometer, however, interpretation of AHe age depends on a precise knowledge of He diffusion. Several studies suggest that He retention is function of the amount of damage that is controlled by U–Th concentration, grain chemistry and thermal history. Still, the models are not well constrained and do not fully explain the mechanism of He retention.\nIn order to have a deeper insight into this issue, a multidisciplinary study on apatite combining physical methods such as multi-scale theoretical diffusion calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) with diffusion experiments by ion beam Elastic Recoil Diffusion Analysis (ERDA) were performed. Quantum calculations permit to quantify He diffusivity base level for damage-free crystal and to estimate the additional energy cost to extract He atoms trapped in point defects (i.e. vacancies). On the other hand ion beam ERDA experiments allow to measure He diffusivity in artificially damaged crystals.\nWe show that damage-free apatite crystals are characterized by low retention behavior and closure temperature of ~35°C for pure F-apatite to higher value for Cl rich apatite (up to 12°C higher), for typical grain size and cooling rate (Mbongo-Djimbi et al., 2015). Our computed closure temperature is slightly lower than previously reported experimental values (~50°C). Using ERDA and DFT modeling of damage, we show how He diffusivity is influenced by damage. Finally, we are able to propose a new modeling of He diffusion incorporating mechanisms not included in classical damage models, and taking into account the level of damage and apatite chemistry. We show that it could affect significantly AHe age interpretation.\nMbongo-Djimbi D. et al. 2015. Apatite composition effect on (U-Th)/He thermochronometer: an atomistic point of view.

            "abstract": "To reduce the effect of strong geomagnetic activities, the TEC data of 2 days after Dst index exceed -60 nT were excluded in previous statistical studies of earthquake related TEC anomalies. Actually, the influences of a magnetic storm on TEC variations depend on the intensity and onset time of the storm. In this study, to clarify such dependences, we applied classification analysis to the storm data (Dst) and discussed the response of TEC variation to each type of storm.\nWe picked out all the 294 geomagnetic storms during 1998-2013, and classified them into 3 types in magnitude and 4 types in onset time (local time). We checked the TEC data from 2 days before till 5 days after the onset of each geomagnetic storm. A bootstrap method is used to calculate the average variation of the TEC for each type of storm. The average variation can be regarded as an average response of TEC to the related type of storm. If the average value of TEC exceeds the mean±2σ threshold, we consider it being affected by the storm. By this mean, we could find the accurate period affected by each type of storm.\nWe employed the results obtained above to remove the TEC data associated with geomagnetic storms. Next we performed statistical analysis of the TEC anomalies possibly associated with large earthquakes in Japan area during 1998/05-2013/12. There are statistical significance of TEC anomalies 1-5 days before and 16-20 days after M>=6.0 earthquakes. The significance of pre-earthquake anomalies is consistent with the results reported by Kon et al., 2011. The significance of 16-20 days after earthquakes may be due to aftershock effects of the Tohoku earthquake. To remove the influences of any per- and after- shock effects, we proposed a new method which considers ‘isolate EQs’ only. ‘Isolate EQs’ are earthquakes which is unique in a 61 days window centered by the day of the EQ. The result shows there are clear high possibilities of TEC anomalies 1-5 days prior to M>=6 earthquakes.\nFinally, we used the Molchan’s error diagram to evaluate the efficiency of TEC anomalies for short-term earthquake forecasts. The results indicates that the predictions based on TEC anomalies are better than random guess (Poisson model), which suggests that the TEC anomalies contain certain precursory information of M>=6.0 earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the ocean’s role in Earth's energy budget is fundamental to evaluate climate variability and change, including the rate of global warming and the recent 18-years’ so-called Global Surface Warming Hiatus (GSWH). Previous studies have shown that basin-wide warming in the Atlantic Ocean triggers the intensification of trade wind and wind-driven circulation since late 1990s, resulting in Global Surface Warming Hiatus (GSWH). A recent work revealed that missing heat in the Pacific during the GSWH was transported to the Indian Ocean by the Indonesia throughflow. It brings the Indian Ocean to the platform of the GSWH study and suggests that the global ocean is at play in the GSWH and in the ocean heat content (OHC) westwards shifting. The westwards shifting of the OHC was detected from in-situ data and model/in-situ reanalysis data. The shifting has a period of about 30 years, and takes about 60 years to travel from the eastern Pacific to the western Atlantic. Heat was distributed to deeper layers after the warm OHC passed the southern tip of the Africa continent. This may shed light on the understanding of the physical mechanisms for the multi-decadal climate variability.",

In the current study, gravity effect is well taken into account in the coupled diffusion equations derived by Lo et al. (2014) for describing one-dimensional consolidation in unsaturated soils, thus leading to additional first-order time-derivative terms. Finite-difference approach is used to solve those equations. Numerical calculations are then conducted with respect to various initial water saturations and soil heights for unsaturated clays as illustrative examples.

            "abstract": "The diurnal evolution of shortwave solar radiance at the surface has been investigated from Kipp and Zonen CNR4 net radiometer measurements in a humid sub-tropical location Dibrugarh in the North Eastern region of India. Data for a total of 345 clear days within a span of two years during March 2013- January 2015 are analyzed which are further utilized to validate the Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SBDART) simulated flux. The diurnal evolution of solar radiation maximizes in its amplitude in monsoon months (JJAS) and is minimum during the winter months (DJF) prescribed by the Northern Hemisphere routine. The net shortwave radiation increases from the minimum value of ~100 Wm-2 at the beginning of the year and attains maximum ~300 Wm-2 during monsoon. Both the measured and model simulated diurnal and seasonal solar flux exhibit similar behaviour at the surface with good correlation with R2~ 0.98-0.99. The present study also focuses on the validation of the surface albedo and the albedo retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements by the CNR4 net Radiometer measurements, which again shows a good agreement. This validation is essential for the reliability of satellite retrieved surface reflectance that are being utilised in the radiative transfer models. In order to study the influence of the aerosols upon the incoming solar irradiances the aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) is estimated. The ARFEsurface during the Winter is the highest (-75.02 ± 8.03 W m-2 τ-1) and minimum during Retreating Monsoon (ON) (-58.40 ±25.03 W m-2 τ-1). For both the modeled and the field based estimation, the aerosol radiative forcing obtained during the study period ranged from -39 ±6 Wm-2 to -10 ±4 Wm-2 at the surface and 10±3 Wm-2 to 28±7 Wm-2 at the atmosphere and -7±4 Wm-2 to -10 ±3 Wm-2 at the TOA. The measured and the model ARF values differ by 5 - 8 % in winter and premonsoon and almost ~6% in monsoon. The average atmospheric heating rate is maximum in pre-monsoon for both the estimations. The observation of ARF is further compared with the ICTP’s RegCM4 model in order to acquire the model utility in the location where measurements are not feasible. ",

            "abstract": "The FastScape landscape evolution model is a powerful and user-friendly tool that can be used in concert with catchment-wide cosmogenic 10Be erosion rates to assess states of dynamic equilibrium in landscapes with respect to their tectonic and climatic settings. FastScape was used to compute chi (χ), a proxy for steady-state river channel elevation (Willet et al., 2014), for model domains in Namibia (e.g., desert climate and passive continental margin) and the central Himalaya (e.g., active mountain building and a wet, monsoonal climate). Namibian and central Himalayan landscapes are eroding at widely different rates (e.g., 101 mm/ka and 103 mm/ka, respectively). Chi values are sensitive to both DEM domain size and base level, cell resolution, and time, thus, chi values can only be evaluated and directly compared within a given domain. Chi values indicate areas or regions of equilibrium or disequilibrium within a given model domain, and not between domains in different geographic study areas. Chi can be used to ascertain if anomalously high 10Be erosion rates are affected by the addition of youthful sediment from landslides, debris flows, or glaciation of river catchments or tributary basins. In this study, glacial settings with high erosion rates show no relationship to chi values. For unglaciated tributary basins in a given catchment, chi values are related to cosmogenic 10Be erosion rates in the following ways: (1) basins in equilibrium have chi values that remain constant with increasing cosmogenic erosion rates; (2) basins in disequilibrium have an inverse relationship between chi values and erosion rates in a setting where erosion is driven predominantly by precipitation; and (3) basins in disequilibrium have a positive correlation between chi values and erosion rates in a setting where tectonic uplift is the dominant force driving erosion.",

            "abstract": "In the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2 - Atmosphere-Ocean (HadGEM2-AO), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is estimated according to the empirically determined relationship between aerosol and cloud droplet number concentrations. However, the observational dataset used for establishing the relationship was obtained from limited regions of the earth; as such, it may not be representative of the entire Earth. In this study, we have re-established the relationship between aerosol and cloud droplet number concentrations, based on a composite of the observational dataset obtained from many different regions around the world, including the original dataset. The new relationship tends to provide a lower CDNC when the aerosol number concentration is < 680 cm-3 and the opposite when it is > 680 cm-3, compared to those from the original relationship. Experiments are performed under the same conditions as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). The results from the complete historical run with the new relationship are expected to show a number of significant differences from the original historical run. Significant change of total cloud amount by the new relationship was shown mainly in the ITCZ due to the change of wind circulation pattern over North Pacific. The surface temperature became closer to the results retrieved from observational data especially over the northern hemisphere. In this study, despite of the little change in CDNC, the results showed significant differences, thus parameterization of CDNC is very important in climate model. The change in CDNC can affects to temperature and dynamics as well as variables directly associated with the cloud and those effects interact with each other, therefore the climate changes is not simply predictable by the changes in CDNC. It implies that accurate estimation of climate change in climate modeling is highly challenging. More detail will be discussed at the conference.",

            "abstract": "The 2015 hydrologic year has been posited in terms of temperature as an analog for the future for the Pacific Northwest (PNW), with record warm air temperatures, warm stream temperatures and low summer streamflow. The high stream temperatures and low flows are both threats to salmon in the watershed and are offset in part by glacier runoff. Freezing levels were the highest relative to the median in the key winter months of January through May, 2015. The snowline on glaciers across the region in early July is typically at levels observed 1-2 months later in the melt season. This increases ablation since glacier ice melts faster than glacier snowcover. Very high 2015 ablation rates are occurring because glacier runoff in the PNW is primarily controlled by ablation season temperatures. In July, 2015 streamflow in the North Fork Nooksack River has been at a record low for the 77 years of record, which would increase the role of glacier runoff in stream discharge. We have measured both glacier runoff and ablation on glaciers in the North Fork Nooksack River basin during the summers of 2013-15 that allows determination of the percent of total stream discharge contributed by glaciers. In 2014 the glacier contribution exceeded 40% of total streamflow on 21 days all occurring in Aug. and Sept. Here we will present the results of 2013-2015 glacier runoff observations and the 1984-2015 mass balance observations to put in context 2015 results from our ongoing field work this summer. ",

To explore the association between wild bird migration and avian influenza virus transmission, we monitored potential geographical distribution of four wild bird species that might carry the avian influenza viruses in China. They are Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) and Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus). They served as major reservoir of the avian influenza viruses. We used bird watching records with the precise latitude/longitude coordinates from January 2002 to August 2014, and environmental variables with a pixel resolution of 5 km × 5 km from 2002 to 2014. The study utilized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model based on ecological niche model approaches, and got the following results: 1) MaxEnt model have good discriminatory ability with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) of 0.86-0.97; 2) The four wild bird species were estimated to concentrate in the North China Plain, the middle and lower region of the Yangtze River, Qinghai Lake, Tianshan Mountain and Tarim Basin, part of Tibet Plateau, and Hengduan Mountains; 3) Radiation and the minimum temperature were found to provide the most significant information. Our findings will help to understand the spread of avian influenza viruses by wild bird migration in China, which benefits for effective monitoring strategies and prevention measures.",

Specifically, BIOMASS will measure forest carbon stock, as well as forest height, from data provided by a single satellite giving a biomass map covering tropical, temperate and boreal forests at a resolution of around 200 m every 6 months throughout the five years of the mission.\nBIOMASS will use a long wavelength SAR (P-band) providing three mutually supporting measurement techniques, namely polarimetric SAR (PolSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) and tomographic SAR (TomoSAR). The combination of these techniques will significantly reduce the uncertainties in biomass retrievals by yielding complementary information on biomass properties.\nHorizontal mapping: For a forest canopy, the P-band radar waves penetrate deep into the canopy, and their interaction with the structure of the forest will be exploited to map above ground biomass (AGB), as demonstrated from airborne data for temperate, boreal forests and tropical forest.\nHeight mapping: By repeat revisits to the same location, the PolInSAR measurements will be used to estimate the height of scattering in the forest canopy. The long wavelength used by BIOMASS is crucial for the temporal coherence to be preserved over much longer timescales than at L-band, for example.\n3D mapping: The P-band frequency used by BIOMASS is low enough to ensure penetration through the entire canopy, even in dense tropical forests. As a consequence, resolution of the vertical structure of the forest will be possible using tomographic methods from the multi-baseline acquisitions. This is the concept of SAR tomography, which will be implemented in the BIOMASS mission.\nThe improvement in the quantification of the vegetation structure, will have an important impact in many aspects of ecosystem function, such as carbon cycling and biodiversity. For example, areas of forest loss or degradation and areas of growth or recovery, can be determined by the vegetation structure and its temporal change.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of fault mechanics is of first order importance to unravel earthquake triggering. Among the parameters influencing fault reactivation and earthquake triggering, the influence of pore-fluid pressure and friction on stability of fault zones have been a focus of recent work based on geological, geophysical and experimental analyses. Here, the effects of dehydration reactions on hydraulic and mechanical properties of rock are analysed to better understand the conditions required to trigger earthquakes. Triaxial experiments are conducted using gypsum and a direct shear sample assembly that allows a constant normal stress to be applied and permeability to be measured during sliding. The evolutions of shear stress, pore-fluid pressure and permeability are continuously measured throughout the experiment until dehydration reaction reached completion. Tests are conducted with a temperature ramp from 70 to 150 °C and with different effective confining pressures (50, 100 and 150 MPa) and velocities (0.1 and 0.4 µm.s-1). Results show that gypsum dehydration induces transient stable slip weakening that is controlled by pore-fluid pressure and permeability evolutions followed by unstable slip on fully dehydrated product.\nThe evolution of microstructures and mineralogy during the experiment are inferred from SEM and XRD analyses of deformed samples collected at different key stages during repeated tests. The microstructural analysis shows clear evidence of dehydration reactions related to the development of S-C-C' structures where dehydration product is preferentially localized along shear and schistosity planes. A conceptual model is then proposed to explain transient slip weakening during dehydration reactions incorporating the key role played by permeability, and to provide a framework to define the conditions required to trigger unstable events during dehydration reactions.",

Our new, high resolution, continent-scale crustal model is based solely on seismic profiles and RF models published since 1960, which makes it applicable to potential field modelling. The database represents a major improvement in coverage and resolution with a sample interval of 50 km or less. It includes information on the depth to Moho, thickness and average P-wave velocity of five crustal layers (sediments, and upper, middle, lower, and lowermost crust) and Pn velocity. For each of the crustal parameters included in the compilation, we discuss uncertainties associated with theoretical limitations, regional data quality, and arising from interpolation.\nWe provide an extensive summary of the tectonic and geodynamic evolution of the region and discuss the origin of crustal heterogeneity and processes of crustal evolution in the Precambrian cratons of Europe and Siberia, and major Phanerozoic basins, orogens, and rift zones. We conclude that for all tectonic settings there are significant variations in depth to Moho and crustal structure, essentially controlled by the age of the last major tectono-thermal event. We demonstrate that generally-adopted global averages of crustal parameters are incorrect for any particular tectonic setting in Europe and in Siberia, and conclude that we cannot define a “typical cratonic” crust. We show that relative thickness of the upper-middle crystalline crust (Vp<6.8 km/s) and the lower (Vp>6.8 km/s) crust is indicative of the crustal origin, i.e. oceanic, transitional, platform, or extended crust. Continental rifting generally thins the upper-middle crust without changing the average Vp. Thinning of the lower crust during rifting is less significant and generally occurs without significant change in lower crustal average Vp, suggesting a complex interplay of magmatic underplating, gabbro-eclogite phase transition and delamination. The Barents Sea shelf differs from rifted continental crust in structure of the crystalline crust and average Vp velocities, indicating that processes other than rifting have also been involved in its evolution.",

            "abstract": "Meandering channels are ubiquitous features of tidal landscapes. However, despite their fundamental role on the eco-morphodynamic evolution of these landscapes, tidal meanders have received less attention when compared to their fluvial counterparts. Improving current understanding of tidal meander migration, a largely-examined topic in fluvial landscapes, is a key step to highlight analogies and differences between tidal and fluvial cases. The migration of about 400 meander bends, belonging to 40 salt-marsh channels in the Northern Venice Lagoon (Italy), from 1968 to nowadays, has been investigated by means of both a classical method in fluvial frameworks and new procedure. Similarities with fluvial meanders occur, although important difference also emerge. Meanders cutting through the San Felice marsh follow the relationship between cartesian length and channel width, typical of meanders developed within different settings. However, meander migration rates proved to be smaller than those characterizing fluvial meanders. Indeed, the analysis of meander migration suggests a mean migration rate of about 0.10 m/year, consistent with the few data available in the literature. As for the fluvial case, the maximum-potential migration rate (i.e. the envelope curve of the relationship between migration rate and bend radius, both divided by channel width) reaches a maximum for radius-over-width ratio included between 2 and 3, regardless of the considered method. Nevertheless, the new-proposed method allows us to provide a more objective and continuous characterization. By using this new procedure, the channel curvature has finally been Fourier-analyzed, confirming the importance of even harmonics along the curvature spectrum. A correlation between migration rates and dominant harmonics seems to drive the evolution of tidal meanders and might represent a key-feature to distinguish them from their fluvial counterparts.",

While many CSIA methods for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen isotopes are known, CSIA methods for the analysis of oxygen isotopes (δ18O) are still not widely established. Especially, reliable and precise methods for the δ18O analyses of individual carbohydrates are scarce, which is caused by the highly sensitive nature of the sugars. However, carbohydrates are important components of living organisms, source for many biochemical reactions, and can be found in all organisms, in soils, sediments, and in air. Thus, a method, allowing the investigation of the 18O/16O ratio in carbohydrates will enhance the scope of research using isotopes. We developed a new and easy to handle derivatization method to determine δ18O in carbohydrates with GC-Pyr-IRMS that consists of a catalyzed one-pot reaction in acetonitrile, resulting in complete methylation of all sugar hydroxyl groups within 24 hours, with silver oxide as the proton acceptor and methyl iodide as the methyl group carrier. Results derived from standard material show unrivalled δ18O precision ranging from about 0.2 to 1.1 ‰ for different individual carbohydrates of different classes and a generally very good accuracy, with a narrow range of 0.2 ‰ around the reference value, despite of high area variations. We applied this method on real samples, demonstrating that the method can commonly be used for analyzing honey samples, and for the analyses of more complex carbohydrate mixtures from plant leaves, including glucose, fructose, pinitol, and sucrose. Our new method may be used for food, beverage, and medical applications, as well as for biogeochemical and paleoclimatic sciences.",

            "abstract": "The separation of Britain from mainland Europe in the late Quaternary is widely considered to be a consequence of spillover of a proglacial lake that occupied the present-day southern North Sea basin. This event had significant palaeogeographic, biological and archaeological implications. Lake spillover is inferred to have caused breaching of a Chalk rock dam to form the Dover Strait, thus releasing a significant flood into a subaerial English Channel. Whilst evidence for catastrophic flooding derived from sonar imaging of the seabed in the central Channel is strong, the breaching model is controversial through lack of data at the inferred spillpoint in the Dover Strait. We combine high-resolution sonar-derived bathymetry and seismic reflection data from the eastern English Channel to test the breaching hypothesis. We find a set of isolated, sediment-infilled depressions that are deeply incised into bedrock. Sub-circular to elliptical in planform, <4 kilometres in diameter and ~100 m in depth, these features are clustered along the projected trend of the Chalk dam and best interpreted as giant plunge pools formed by vertical drilling into bedrock by waterfalls. Bathymetric data show evidence of second opening event of the Strait. The floor of a prominent bedrock channel is eroded into cataracts and extensive longitudinal ridge-and-groove bedforms, features characteristic of erosion by catastrophic flood flows. This evidence strongly supports initial erosion of the Dover Strait by lake overspill, plunge pool erosion by waterfalls and subsequent dam breaching. Subsequent modification of the Strait by flood erosion of the Lobourg Channel may have been a consequence of spillover of younger ice-marginal lake systems.",

            "abstract": "The CalWater 2015 field experiment was conducted between January and March and consisted of more than fifty science flights, a major research cruise, and continuous ground-based observations coordinated to study phenomena driving the incidence of extreme precipitation events and the variability of water supply along the West Coast of the United States. CalWater 2015 examined key processes linked to (1) atmospheric rivers (ARs) in delivering much of the precipitation associated with major winter storms, and (2) aerosols, originating from local sources as well as from remote continents, within and between storms and their modulating effects on precipitation on the U.S. West Coast. As part of a large interagency field effort including NOAA, DOE, NASA, NSF, and the Naval Research Laboratory, four research aircraft from three government agencies were deployed in coordination with the oceangoing NOAA Ronald H. Brown and were equipped with meteorological and chemical observing systems in near-shore regions of California and the eastern Pacific. At the same time, ground-based measurements from NOAA’s HydroMeteorological Testbed (HMT) network on the U.S. West Coast and a major NSF-supported observing site for aerosols and microphysics at Bodega Bay, California provided continuous near surface-level meteorological and chemical observations, respectively, during CalWater 2015. The DOE-sponsored ARM Cloud Aerosol and Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) was executed in close coordination with NOAA and NASA facilities and deployed airborne and ship-based observing systems. This presentation summarizes the objectives, implementation strategy, data acquisitions, and some preliminary results from CalWater 2015 addressing science gaps associated with (1) the evolution and structure of ARs including cloud and precipitation processes and air-sea interaction, and (2) aerosol interaction with ARs and the impact on precipitation, including locally-generated aerosol effects on orographic precipitation along the U.S. West Coast. CalWater 2015 is part of a broad, five-year interagency vision called CalWater 2 (\nhttp://esrl.noaa.gov/psd/calwater\n) that includes proposed West Coast observations for multiple winter seasons to address these science gaps.",

            "abstract": "Baseline CO and O3 were studied at seven rural sites in the Northeast U.S. during varying periods over 2001 – 2010. Baseline CO decreased significantly at rates ranging from -4.3 to -2.3 ppbv yr-1 at most sites, except at Castle Spring (CS). Baseline O3 did not display a significant long term trend at any of the sites, resulting probably from relatively constant mixing ratios of CH4 in the 2000s and opposite trends in NOx emissions worldwide. On a seasonal basis, there were no trends in springtime and wintertime baseline CO at Mt. Washington (MWO) (1917 km asl) and Whiteface Mountain (WFM) (1484 km asl), the highest sites, probably due to decreasing CO emissions in the U.S. and increasing emissions in Asia. Springtime and wintertime baseline O3 at Thompson Farm (TF) increased significantly at a rate of 2.4 and 2.7 ppbv yr-1, respectively, most likely linked to nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions reductions over urban and industrial areas. During the positive North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) years, lower springtime baseline O3 was found in the study region, which was linked to less solar flux, weakened stratospheric intrusion, and intensified continental export. The lowest baseline CO at Appledore Island (AI), Pack Monadnock (PM), TF, Pinnacle State Park (PSP), WFM and the lowest baseline O3 at AI, PM, and PSP in summer 2009 were linked to the negative phase of the Arctic oscillation (AO), when more frequent cyclone activity brought more clean air masses from the Arctic region to midlatitudes. It was also found that ~38% of summertime baseline CO variability in the study region, could be explained by CO emissions from forest fires in Russia and ~22% by emissions from forest fires in Canada. The findings of this study suggested impacts of increasing Asian emissions, NOx emissions from the urban corridor, biomass burning emissions, and meteorological conditions (e.g. cyclone activity, AO, and NAO) should be considered when evaluating the air quality in the Northeast U.S.",

            "abstract": "The Longmen-Shan fault zone, at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is one of the most extensively studied areas in the world, yet the deformation model and earthquake-generating mechanism remain subjects of vigorous debate. We present the three-dimensional (3-D) velocity models determined using a large volume of seismic data, together with the crustal stress and GPS data analysis, to investigate the nuclei of crustal deformation and earthquake generation along the reverse-thrust and strike-slip fault zone. It has been observed that anomalously low velocity, with low resistivity related to the Sichuan foreland basin, is in sharp contrast to high-velocity and high-resistivity anomalies in the Songpan-Ganze block in the upper crust. The tomographic models presented here reveal two crustal bodies with anomalously low velocity and high conductivity in the fault zone, separated into three contrasting segments by the two crustal bodies. The two low-velocity and low-resistivity bodies have been interpreted as being associated with extrusion of either fluids or products of partial melting from the lower crust and/or the upper mantle from Tibet. Our seismic imaging, crustal stress and GPS data analysis indicates that the 2008 Wenchuan and 2013 Lushan earthquakes occurred in the distinct areas with high-velocity, low-Poisson’s ratio and high crustal stress. The high velocity seismogenic layer that enables the accumulation of high crustal stress for large zone at the hypocenter sources may reflect the earthquake generation. We consider that the slow velocity gap zone is associated with fluid-bearing ductile flow from the lower crustal materials of Tibet being pushed into the weakened segment of the Longmen-Shan fault zone, which suggests strong variations in the rheological strength of the rock in the eastern margin of Tibet. This finding implies that coupling between these presumably fluid-bearing bodies and earthquake generation could be extremely complex.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, time series environmental flow analysis is becoming one of the most important tasks in ecohydrology in order to design process based system solutions. Thus, the purpose of this research paper was to understand temporal and spatial variability of stream flows, rainfall, and inflows and outflows to and from the Lake Tana basin. Autocorrelation and cross correlation tests were applied for the long years’ daily stream flows and rainfall using R languages. These methods were used to see how the stream flow or rainfall data were serially correlated and rainfall, stream flow and lake level time series data were cross correlated with each other. Autocorrelation tests of daily rainfall were carried out for many rainfall stations and the outputs indicate that there are no spikes showing significant seasonal signals. The annual rainfall map was produced for the whole catchment based on long years’ records at different stations inside the catchment using inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) method in the GIS environment. Based on this map there is high spatial variability of annual rainfall in the catchment. The average maximum, minimum and mean annual rainfall values are 1506.4, 798.7, and 1238.1 mm respectively. According to the cross correlation tests done for stream flow & rainfall, better correlations were observed after 15 to 30 days lag time due to late response of the catchment for runoff generation. The study also prevailed that the Lake Tana water level and Blue Nile discharge at Bahir Dar station have positive cross correlation with maximum value at time lag of zero. There is a dramatic drop in the lake level and stream flow volume at the same location since 2000 due to human induced local climate forcing. In general, this research indicates that there is high temporal and spatial variability in rainfall, Lake water level and stream flows.",

It is also predicted to be one of the most susceptible areas for climate change in the coming decade. The Acre River Basin, one of the few trinational basins in Amazonia, lies at the center of the Madre de Dios Region (Peru), Acre State (Brazil) and Pando Department (Bolivia) or MAP Region. It covers approximately 7,500 km2 and its inhabitants range from indigenous groups avoiding contact with industrial society to more than 60,000 dwellers of a binational urban center. The basin incorporates most the challenges facing the region and this paper discusses steps underway to address the basin’s vulnerability to climate-related threats. A trinational group of professionals used GIS databases and local knowledge to classify these threats and possible societal responses. To prioritize threats and to propose responses, this group adapted a method proposed by the Queensland Climate Change Centre of Excellence of Australia to develop climate risk matrices for assessing impacts, adaptation, risk and vulnerability. The three priority climate variables were prolonged and more frequent droughts, more intense flooding, and more days with temperatures > 35oC. The final matrix proposed two areas of concentration – 1) Reduce the vulnerability of communities to hydro-meteorological extreme events and 2) Protect and restore ecosystems that maintain critical water-related resources with actions in public policy, capacity-building, and immediate activities. These results are being incorporated into the Amazon Project of the Global Environment Fund of the United Nations Environment Program, administered by the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO).",

            "abstract": "Recent studies using active remote sensing have revealed significant occurrence of multi-layer cloud. Detection of multi-layer cloud is important in passive remote sensing for quality assessment of cloud property retrieval and identification of uncertain retrievals. An algorithm using several thermal infrared (TIR) bands at 6–13.5 micron wavelengths to detect multilayer cloud and retrieve cloud physical and optical properties including cloud thermodynamic phase is developed. This significantly extends applicability of passive remote sensing and improves accuracy of cloud property retrieval. The method uses the split window bands as well as the carbon dioxide and water vapor absorption bands. The forward model uses the two-stream approximation to solve radiative transfer with gaseous absorption treated by the correlated-k distribution method. Brightness temperature errors are evaluated by model-to-model and model-to-measurement comparisons. Top pressure of lower cloud in multi-layer cloud column can be retrieved if the upper cloud optical thickness is less than 6. The optimal estimation method is used to simultaneously infer several cloud properties including water path, effective particle radius and cloud-top pressure. The method is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using 10 TIR bands and compared to MODIS operational product and active remote sensing measurements, showing promising results. The TIR method well detects optically thin clouds and retrieve their properties with relatively high accuracy. Particularly, cloud-top of optically thin cloud is estimated well. Multi-layer cloud detection works usually, while the TIR measurements miss very thin cloud that appears near the tropopause. The algorithm will be applied to frequent observation data from a new Japanese geostationary satellite, Himawari-8.",

            "abstract": "We systematically performed a series of high-resolution two-dimensional fully kinetic simulations to investigate spatial dimensions of the electron diffusion region of anti-parallel magnetic reconnection. In the electron diffusion region, electrons are demagnetized with the electron inertial and non-gyrotropic pressure effects. In the inflow direction, we found a clear two-scale structure of the diffusion region produced by the two effects. Both dimensions of the two-scale structure are proportional to the electron inertial length, but the dependence of the electron temperature is different between the two scales. In the outflow direction, we found no clear two-scale structure. The dimension in the outflow direction is proportional to the hybrid scale of ion and electron inertial lengths. The results allow us to predict the dimensions in realistic situations such as at the Earth's magentotail. The obtained predictions are indeed in reasonable agreement with past in-situ spacecraft observations at the magnetotail, and would have important implications for future in-situ observations with higher resolutions such as the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.",

            "abstract": "Absolute paleointensity data are essential for understanding Earth’s deep interior, climatic modeling, and geochronology applications, among others. Paleointensity data are derived from experiments in which the ancient TRM is replaced by a laboratory controlled TRM. This procedure is built on the assumption that the process of ancient TRM acquisition is entirely reproducible in the lab. Here we show experimental results violating this assumption in a manner not expected from standard theory.\nWe prepared 118 pairs of nearly identical specimens. One specimen from each pair was given laboratory TRM and allowed to “age” in a controlled fixed field, identical and parallel to the laboratory TRM field, for two years. After two years the second specimen was given a “fresh” TRM. Thus, the two specimens in each pair differ in only one significant respect: the time elapsed from the TRM acquisition. We carried out IZZI-type absolute paleointensity experiments on the two groups. Under the assumption of TRM stability we expect that the behavior of the twin specimens in the experiment would be exactly the same. Yet, we found a small but systematic difference between the “aged” and the “fresh” TRM. The “aged” TRM yield more curved and zigzaggy Arai plots, and exhibit a shift in the blocking/unblocking spectra.

The data covered various ecosystems of arctic tundra, boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, grasslands, and croplands. We applied a global optimization method; shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method (Duan et al., 1993). First stomatal conductance parameters (m and b in the Ball-Berry model) were optimized for evapotranspiration, and then photosynthetic parameters (maximum carboxylation rate at 25oC; Vcmax25) were optimized for gross primarily productivity (GPP). The canopy-scale parameters were then downscaled into the leaf-scale using a two-leaf radiative transfer models and leaf area index (LAI) by MODIS. In the presentation, we will show the spatial variability of the ecophysiological parameters in terms of environmental gradients, and ecosystem types. Implications and limitations of the synthesis will be discussed.\n",

            "abstract": "Indonesia currently experiences rapid and large-scale land-use changes resulting in forest loss and the expansion of cash crop plantations such as oil palm and rubber. Such land transformations are associated with changes in surface properties that affect biophysical processes influencing the atmosphere. Yet, the overall effect of such land transformations on the atmosphere at local and regional scale remains unclear.\nIn our study, we combine measurements of microclimate, transpiration via sap-flux, surface energy fluxes via eddy covariance, surface temperature via remote sensing, land surface (CLM) and regional climate modeling (WRF) for Jambi Province in Indonesia.\nOur microclimatic measurements showed that air temperature within the canopy was on average 0.7-0.8°C higher in monoculture plantations (oil palm and rubber) compared to forest. Remote sensing analysis using MODIS and Landsat revealed a higher canopy surface temperature for oil palm plantations (+1.5°C) compared to forest, but only little differences for rubber plantations. Transpiration (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) as well as the contribution of T to ET of oil palm showed a strong age-dependent increase. The sensible to latent heat flux ratio decreased with age. Overall, rubber plantations showed the lowest transpirations rates (320 mm year-1), oil palm intermediate rates (414 mm year-1), and forest the highest rates (558 mm year-1) indicating substantial differences in water use.\nDespite the differences in water use and the higher within-canopy and surface temperatures of the plantations compared to the forest, there was only a minor effect of land transformation on the atmosphere at the regional scale (<0.2 °C), irrespectively of the large spatial extend of the transformation. In conclusion, our study shows a strong local scale biophysical impact affecting the conditions at the stand level, which is however mitigated in the atmosphere at the regional level.",

            "abstract": "Apart from the loss of lives, injuries and homeless resulting from an earthquake, not only the economy and physical landscape are altered, but also the lives of citizens and their places of work are dramatically altered. If critical services and functions are disrupted for more than a reasonable time period, consequences can be severe. All communities are at risk and face potential disaster, if unprepared.\nThe Disruption Index (DI) is a tool that allows the representation of a complex, multidimensional, situation in a concise and easier way, providing institutions and communities with a way to identify the global earthquake impact in a geographical area, the elements at risk, and the means to reduce it. Understanding how the loss and cascading effects across a number of areas might be correlated during a single earthquake is critical to evaluate risk. The application of this tool, prior-to a catastrophe, assumes a huge importance for earthquake risk professionals and planners to understand their impacts and to start building earthquake resilient cities. Post-to an event, this tool provides an assessment of its extent and impact considering the propagation effects, developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The DI was already tested, calibrated after several earthquakes and applied in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Iceland.\n The next step in this research is to implement this tool directly into web portals or websites as well as PAGER or GDACS platforms to:\n- Rapidly assess an earthquake impact in a region following significant events. Nowadays the institutions used the shake maps; it’s an important tool but cannot reflect the impact on livelihoods and the cascade effects. The DI maps can be used by state and local organizations, both public and private, for post-earthquake response and recovery, public and scientific information.",

            "abstract": "Largest earthquakes occur along subduction zones, where normal and tangential stress coupling drives the earthquake rupture due to the geometry of the subduction interface between dissimilar materials and the interaction with waves reflected from free surface as the rupture propagates toward the trench. We numerically investigate these effects in the context of dynamic rupture simulations.\nWe revisit the problem of in-plane interface rupture propagation between dissimilar elastic media, in the case of slip-weakening friction, by performing a numerical study using the Spectral Element Method with a non-smooth contact formulation. For classical slip-weakening friction, the problem is ill posed due to a missing length or time scale in the response of the frictional shear stress to dynamic normal stress perturbations. We first perform a parametric study of the regularization formulation proposed by Rubin and Ampuero (2007). We show that the dynamic regularization, driven by local slip rate does not allow for a proper modeling of the asymptotic rupture propagation. We propose a new regularization approach based on the non-local length scale, associated to the actual size of the process zone. Numerical results are shown to be consistent with mathematical modeling of dynamic interface rupture propagation with a process zone ahead of the rupture front.\nThe numerical study is extended to inclined ruptures intersecting a free surface at different angles. We investigate interaction between rupture propagation and stress changes induced by waves reflected from the free surface, in the generation of large interface slip, transient healing and opening effects. Finally, preliminary in-plane dynamic simulations of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, incorporating the along-dip structure and geometry of the subduction interface, are presented enlightening the role of the geometry of the bi-material interface and of the free surface in the rupture propagation and radiation.",

The HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observation (HIPPO) program from 2009 to 2011 is the most comprehensive data source available and it reveals a 2 to 10 times overestimates of BC by current global models. Incorporation and assimilation of more data sources is needed to increase our understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of black carbon aerosol and its corresponding climate effects. Based on measurements from aircraft campaigns and satellites, a robust association is observed between BC concentrations and satellite retrieved CO, tropospheric NO2, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) (R2 > 0.7). Such robust relationships indicate that BC aerosols share a similar emission sources, evolution processes and transport characteristics with other pollutants measured by satellite observations. It also establishes a basis to derive a satellite-based proxy (BC*) over remote oceans. The inferred satellite-based BC* shows that Asian export events in spring bring much more BC aerosols to the mid-Pacific than occurs in other seasons. In addition, inter-annual variability of BC* is seen over the Northern Pacific, with abundances correlated to the springtime Pacific/North American (PNA) index. The inferred BC* dataset also indicates a widespread overestimation of BC loadings by models over most remote oceans beyond the Pacific. Our method presents a novel approach to infer BC concentrations by combining satellite and aircraft observations.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural drought monitoring significantly influences food security in recent decades. Soil moisture shortages adversely affecting agriculture is one important indicator for agricultural drought monitoring. Because of limited soil moisture observations, characterizing soil moisture using climate-based drought indices has great practical meaning. The agricultural area in China was identified by crop identification from remotely sensed data. Drought indices of multiple timescale or from two-layer bucket model were analyzed. In most agricultural areas of China, surface soil moisture is more affected by drought indices having shorter time scales while deep-layer soil moisture is more related on longer time scales. In general, multiscalar drought indices work better than drought indices from two-layer bucket models. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) works similarly or better than the standardized precipitation index (SPI) in characterizing soil moisture at different soil layers. In most stations in China, the Z index has a higher correlation with soil moisture at 0–5 cm than the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), which in turn has a higher correlation with soil moisture at 90–100-cm depth than the Z index. Soil moisture–drought indices relationship was significantly affected by soil organic carbon density. Effective agriculture drought monitoring can be conducted with climate-based drought indices from widely available climatic data and crop area identification from remote sensing.\nAuthors:Hongshuo wang1, Chao Zhang1, Jeffery C Rogers2\n1 China agricultural university\n2 Ohio state University\nKey words: Agricultural drought, SPI, SPEI, PDSI, Z index, crop identification",

Most slide scars result presumably from retrogressive failure related to weak layers in contourites or ash. The most likely trigger mechanism is seismicity related to tectonic activity within the nearby mid-ocean fracture zone. Gully/channel formation is suggested to result from cascading water masses and/or from sediment gravity flows originating from failure at the slope break after winnowing on the plateau of the ridge.",

The former includes well logging data, acquired results of actual drilling and biostratigraphic study, to give an integrated picture for the considered area in a true attempt to visualize the geological and geophysical data given from both wells and seismic reflection surveys, and hence introduce an updated sequence stratigraphic framework for the Messinian sequence at the offshore Nile Delta area.\nThe 3D geological model, based on all the available well data (faunal contents, litho-facies, log signatures…...etc.) and the seismic expressions (facies and geometry), has been constructed for the study area. This model shows that, the study area was changed from shelf (considered as erosional), to delta channels and then directed to the north. It changed to delta front mouth bars on the shoreface and affected by the main Rosetta fault to collect deposits as sand bars in the southern part on the downthrown side of the fault. Most deposits on this face were highstand system tracts. This deduced from the sequence stratigraphy study. The area was then sloped to the north, as shelf slope with the deposition of slumps, which was formed during erosions and mass flows. Some mud diapers also formed upon this slope. After dropping the sea level with the activity of some syn-sedimentary faults, some channels with sediment supply started their activities to dig their ways to the north.",

Accordingly, potential of rain-induced rockslides increases. Examples of recent rain-induced rock avalanches with tens or more than a hundred of fatalities are a rockslide in Shiaolin village, Taiwan by 2009 Typhoon Morakot, and rockslides induced by 2011 typhoon Talas in Japan. However, the method to predict potential sites of rockslides is not established. Geological causes of rockslides are site specific and they must be clarified for each case.\n2011　Typhoon Talas induced more than 50 rockslides in the outer belt of the Southwest Japan, where is underlain by Cretaceous - lower Miocene accretionary complexes. We performed thorough geological mapping in the Akatani area, where two huge rockslides occurred with volumes of 2 million and 8 million m3 respectively.\nAs a result, we found that these two rockslides had their sliding surfaces along a low-angle-thrust with a dip of 29°～40° extending more than 5 km, which fault we name Kawarabi-thrust. This thrust has a fracture zone of 6.0 m in the maximum width, composed of clayey fault breccia with a few layers of black gouges. These fault materials are very weak and impermeable, so the fracture zone is expected to prevent the groundwater filtration and build up the pore pressure. This thrust had been exposed along the riversides at the foot of the two rockslides, which suggests that the slopes on the thrust had been destabilized by the undercutting of long-term river incision. The destabilization induced gravitational slope deformation with small scarps before the catastrophic failure. Our finding suggests that locating a large-scale low-angle-thrust is essentially important to predict potential sites of catastrophic rockslides as well as interpreting the internal structure of gravitationally deformed slopes.",

The first stations to detect events are 50 to 150 km away from the rupturing faults but there are large urban and industrial areas 200 to 400 km away. EEWS can be very effective and produce 15 to 25 seconds alarms. Coastal areas in the nearby region can also benefit from tsunami warnings of 15 to 45 min.\nSeveral techniques have been tried in feasibility studies, leading to very different reliability estimates. This work makes an overall analysis of the different strategies that can be implemented and makes proposal for further enhanced results. ",

            "abstract": "In the Earth’s crust, stress can be subdivided into tectonic background stress, overburden pressure, and pore-fluid pressure. The superposition of the first two and the variation of the third part are key factors in controlling movement along faults. Furthermore, stresses due to sedimentation and erosion contribute to the total stress field. In deglaciated regions, an additional stress must be considered: the rebound stress, which is related to rebounding of the crust and mantle after deglaciation. During the growth of a continental ice sheet, the lithosphere under the iceload is deformed and the removal of the ice load during deglaciation initiates a rebound process. The uplift is well known in formerly glaciated areas, e.g.North America and Scandinavia, and in currently deglaciating areas, e.g.Alaska, Antarctica, and Greenland. The whole process of subsiding and uplifting during the growth and melting of an iceload and all related phenomena is known as glacial isostatic adjustment. During the process of glaciation, the surface of the lithosphere is depressed underneath the ice load and compressional flexural stresses are induced in the upper lithosphere, whereas the bottom of the lithosphere experiences extensional flexural stresses; an additional vertical stress due to the ice load is present and it decreases to zero during deglaciation. During rebound, flexural stresses relax slowly. These stresses are able to change the original stress directions and regime.\nIn this work we aim to study the effect of the GIA process in the context of petroleum engineering. The main aspect we will focus on is the mathematical and numerical modeling of the GIA including thermal effects. We plan also to include a preliminary study of the effect of the glacial erosion. All these phenomena are of paramount importance in petroleum engineering: for example some reservoir have been depleted due to tilting caused by both GIA, erosion and thermal effects.",

            "abstract": "Although a subordinate component of the Paraná-Etendeka (PE) CFB Province (~3% of the volcanic package), silicic volcanics make up an appreciable preserved volume of 15,000 km3, among the largest of such rocks in a CFB. Moreover, they have wide compositional variation, and are positioned at different stratigraphic levels in the lava pile, constituting important markers of timing and magma generation processes in mantle and crust, and bringing information on the composition of the crust hidden beneath the Paraná Basin. Two main types are recognized. The Palmas-type (134.6-134.2 Ma; Ar-Ar dating) occurs at the upper portion of the first PE volcanic cycle dominated by low-Ti basalts, evolving from dacite to rhyolite. High 87Sr/86Sr(i) (0.713-0.726) and moderately negative εNd(i) (-8) can be modeled by AFC involving contamination of low-Ti basalt with relatively young, non-depleted, high-Rb/Sr crust; a predominant role for a cratonic crust of >2.0 Ga age can be discarded. The younger Chapecó-type (134.3 Ma, baddeleyite U-Pb dating) corresponds to the lower portion of the second PE volcanic cycle, dominated by high-Ti basalts which became progressively more primitive (implying higher melting temperatures in the mantle) over a ~3 Ma time span. Chapecó-type volcanics are exclusively trachydacites, thought to be produced by remelting of high-Ti basalt underplates with minor crustal contamination, as indicated by 87Sr/86Sr(i) (0.705) and εNd(i) (-5) just slightly more evolved than associated basalts. Detailed structural investigations supported by ASM allow identify that both types of PE silicic rocks, characterized by high-temperature (liquidus T~1000oC) and low H2O (1-2 wt%), erupted predominantly as lavas and lava-domes, and more restrictly as rheoignimbrites, from local linear feeder systems as conduits and dikes. Shallow-level evolutive processes seem restricted to contamination with host crystalline rocks in dikes and mixing/mingling in conduits. Evidence for shallow magma chambers is scant; high-silica rhyolites are remarkably absent, and in most cases these magmas seem to have raised directly from sources at lower to middle crust carrying a small phenocryst cargo (An-rich plagioclase, clinopyroxene and apatite) that occasionally shows signs of Sr isotope disequilibrium.\nFinancing: Fapesp",

            "abstract": "The 2D phase unwrapping problem is long standing in interferometric SAR. Solutions fall in two broad classes: local (region growing) and global (eg. network methods) which attempt to unwrap the whole scene as one problem.\nLarge scenes are often split into tiles with overlap. Each tile is unwrapped by itself and the overlap is used to create a solution for the whole scene. Challenging topography, complex coastline, and vegetated or snow covered landscapes can cause problems with disconnected regions in a tiled approach, both for local and global methods. We have implemented a local/global method for unwrapping large interferograms on a sparse domain. The fundamental idea is to\nuse a local, quality-driven method to identify well-connected segments;\nuse global methods (e.g. MCF) to unwrap each segment in isolation;\nuse a global method to balance the segments to arrive at the global solution.\nThe first two stages have been described previously. The number of segments in a scene varies with scene size and quality, but there will typically be several thousand pixels in the larger segments. Segment size is limited to 20-50 thousand to keep segment unwrapping tractable. The crucial final stage is performed using segment balancing with a novel method which does not rely on direct pixel-neighbour contact.\nSince each segment is itself unwrapped, the remaining problem is to determine a small integer (the difference in absolute wrapping number) for every relevant pair of segments. Each segment tends to have less than ten neighbours, so the number of neighbour relations to be determined is in the low thousands for typical scenes. Good guesses can be made for each of these small integers using boundary or vicinity pixels. Balancing segments for the entire scene is therefore computationally tractable.\nThe quality-guided segmentation always leaves some pixels unsegmented. After balancing, a novel wrapping interval interpolation method is used to extend the solution to the remainder of the scene. This gives a smooth and pleasing impression, while preserving the property that the unwrapped scene will wrap back to the original phase field.",

            "abstract": "Constructed wetland (CW) is one of the commonly used technologies in wastewater treatment. By means of the biochemical interactions among water, microscopic organism, aquatic plant and sediments in natural environment CW can remove biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammoniacal nitrogen, suspended solid (SS) and heavy metals. In this study, rare earth elements (REEs) were used as a natural tracer for the study of SS in the CW.\nThe studied CW, Hebao Island free water surface CW, is located in Chiayi County, south Taiwan. The CW is designed for removing SS and BOD due to the pollution from livestock farms in the upstream area. However, the removal of SS was not effective. In some cases, the SS concentration of inflow is even higher than that of outflow. That the sediments on the slope were flushed into the CW was considered as the main problem. After all the refinement, the issue has not improved yet. In the study, the water samples were filtered with 1.0µm filter paper. Then, part of water samples were digested by ultrapure nitric acid to obtain the water representing the total of dissolved and suspended matters. The others were filtered by 0.1µm filter, which represent the matters in dissolved form. REEs and most of metals were subsequently measured with ICP-MS.\nREEs generally have a unique source and would fractionate in certain regular patterns during biochemical reactions due to lanthanide contraction. They can be an excellent natural tracer in the environmental researches. After normalized by North American Shale Composite, the REEs pattern for the samples with the total of dissolved and suspended matters is characterized by a middle REE (MREE) enrichment and light REE (LREE) depletion. According to the previous theoretical studies, the MREE enrichment could be achieved by a selected adsorption of MREEs by organic matters, which is generally humic substance in natural surface water. It is suggested that the refinement of removal efficiency of SS should focus on organic matters but not sediments. On the contrary, the REEs pattern of dissolved matters is flat and shows no MREE enrichment, which means the major source of dissolved REEs is possibly sediments. In addition, a distinct europium positive anomaly can be observed. It reconfirms that the dissolution of feldspar in sediments was strongly involved.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is a key environmental factor in determining ecosystem structure and function. Knowledge of how soil respiration responds to climate change (precipitation etc.) and human activities (grazing, clipping etc.) is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and for improving model simulations and predictions of future global C cycling in response to human activities. In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of soil respiration along a precipitation gradient from 176.7 mm to 398.1 mm. Our results showed that soil respiration increased linearly with increasing mean annual precipitation. The increasing trend was similar to the trends of shoot biomass, litter biomass and soil total C content along the precipitation gradient. Root biomass was described by quadratic curves along the increasing precipitation gradient and may result from the tradeoff of environmental regulation and carbon allocation. Our results indicated that precipitation was the primary controlling factor in determining the spatial pattern of soil respiration. The linear/nonlinear relationships in this study describing the variations of the ecosystem carbon process with precipitation could be useful for model development, parameterization and validation at the regional scale to improve predictions of how the carbon process in grasslands responds to climate change, land use and grassland management.",

            "abstract": "Until present, seismic surveys in Greenland have mainly been carried out offshore and near the coasts, where the crustal structure is affected by oceanic break-up. We present models of the seismic structure of the upper mantle and crust in the interior of Greenland, based on new seismological data from the TopoGreenland programme, including the only existing seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profile in the interior of Greenland. The seismic data was acquired in central-eastern Greenland by 24 broadband (BB) onshore stations, partly on the ice cap, over a period of 3 years and as a refraction seismic profile on the ice cap by a team of six people during a two-month long experiment in summer of 2011.\nOur two-dimensional velocity model of the crust is constrained by tomographic inversion and forward ray tracing modelling. It shows a decrease of crustal thickness from 47 km below the centre of Greenland in the western part of the profile to 40 km in its eastern part. High lower crustal velocities (Vp 6.8 – 7.3 km/s) in the western part of the profile may result from past collision tectonics or it may be related to the passage of the Iceland mantle plume. Crustal receiver functions based on data from the BB stations, indicates pronounced, relatively sharp variation in crustal thickness around the mountains at the edge of the ice cap. The variation is from thick crust at the low topography below the ice cap, and the high mountains at its edge, to very thin crust below elevated topography close to the coast.\nThe origin of the pronounced circum-Atlantic mountain ranges in Norway and eastern Greenland, which have average elevation above 1500 m with peak elevations of more than 3.5 km near Scoresby Sund in Eastern Greenland, is unknown. Our new results on the crustal structure demonstrate that crustal isostasy alone cannot explain the topographic variation in central-eastern Greenland, and other phenomena, including possible dynamic processes must be active in the area.",

During recent 50 years, ecotone of northern China experienced a significant warming(0.41℃/10a) compared to the warming over china(0.39℃/10a) and the warming around the world(0.15℃/10a), which is mainly contributed by minimum temperature increasing and cold season warming.

Besides, the annual precipitation dropped about 13mm during 1964-2013 overall, of which the north region has declined the most (21mm). Seasonal differences also exist in individual regions. The decline of precipitation in southern section of northeast region was mainly occurred in summer, while the decrease of precipitation in northwest region was mainly resulted from the decrease of spring precipitation. As for the increase of precipitation in northern section of northeast region, spring precipitation contributed the most.",

            "abstract": "The assessment of hydrological responses to the change in climate at river basin scale is very essential for the proper planning and management of water resources. For studying the changes in land surface hydrology with climate, various hydrological models coupled with climate models were developed. However, modeling of the regional hydroclimate involves uncertainty at multiple levels. Generally, GCMs, downscaling methods and parameterization are the main sources of uncertainty. The major challenge in hydrological modeling is the calibration of parameters which demands very accurate observed data. The inter comparison of various uncertainties can be done by modeling the uncertainties. If the major source of uncertainty in modeling is identified, the level of accuracy required in the model calibration can be studied. Our objective is to assess future hydrological scenario in the Ganges basin considering multiple GCMs, scenarios and parameter uncertainty model and to identify and compare different sources of uncertainties in assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model which is a semi-distributed macro scale hydrological model is used for the present study. The model is run for a historic period 1979-2005 using the observed and reanalysis data and is evaluated using soil moisture data. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is carried out for the four calibration parameters and vegetation parameters in VIC and the model is run for future scenario using different GCMs and downscaling methods. The probability distribution of the output is used for modeling the uncertainties. The present analysis shows that accuracy in climate change simulations can be achieved by modeling the uncertainty, which will certainly improve the future regional hydroclimate projection.\nKeywords: uncertainty, Variable Infiltration Capacity model, Monte Carlo simulation",

            "abstract": "In 2011 the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) applied for a license to start construction of a final repository for spent nuclear fuel at Forsmark in Northern Uppland, Sweden. The repository is to be built at approximately 500 m depth in crystalline rock. A stochastic, discrete fracture network (DFN) concept was chosen for interpreting the surface-based (incl. boreholes) data, and for assessing the safety of the repository in terms of groundwater flow and flow pathways to and from the repository.\nOnce repository construction starts, also underground data such as tunnel pilot borehole and tunnel trace data will become available. It is deemed crucial that DFN models developed at this stage honors the mapped structures both in terms of location and geometry, and in terms of flow characteristics. The originally fully stochastic models will thus increase determinism towards the repository. Applying the adopted probabilistic framework, predictive modeling to support acceptance criteria for layout and disposal can be performed with the goal of minimizing risks associated with the repository.  \nThis presentation describes and illustrates various methodologies that have been developed to condition stochastic realizations of fracture networks around underground openings using borehole and tunnel trace data, as well as using hydraulic measurements of inflows or hydraulic interference tests. The methodologies, implemented in the numerical simulators ConnectFlow and FracMan/MAFIC, are described in some detail, and verification tests and realistic example cases are shown. Specifically, geometric and hydraulic data are obtained from numerical synthetic realities approximating Forsmark conditions, and are used to test the constraining power of the developed methodologies by conditioning unconditional DFN simulations following the same underlying fracture network statistics. Various metrics are developed to assess how well the conditional simulations compare to the synthetic realities.",

            "abstract": "Intact crystalline rocks of low porosity possess lower water storage. Conversely, fractured crystalline rocks contain higher groundwater resources. Therefore, knowledge of distribution and characteristics of fractures is essential to the exploitation of groundwater resources in crystalline rocks. This research makes crystalline rocks in Hoping and Kinmen areas of Taiwan as examples to integrates previous studies of distribution and attitude of fractures and in-situ stress from surface survey and underground study for estimating the tendencies of slip and dilation of fractures in terms of geomechanics, understanding the characteristics of potential fluid conduits, and benefiting the exploitation and development of groundwater resources.\nThe formations in downstream area of Hoping River contain late Paleozoic to Mesoic meta-granites and marbles, and few alluvium strata. Kinmen island closed to SE Chain is located in Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt of Late Yanshan orogeny. The formations contain Mesozoic granite, gneiss, various dikes, and some alluviums.\nPrevious studies had conducted experiments of anelastic strain recovery on retrieved cores in Hoping. The results show that the maximum principal stress is vertical and the horizontal minimum stress is in NE-SW orientation, indicating a normal faulting stress regime with NE-SW extension. Most fractures are in E-W and N-S orientations. Results of hydraulic fracturing experiments in Kinmen display the maximum and intermediate stress is in NW-SE orientation and vertical, respectively, suggesting strike-slip faulting regime with NE-SW extension. Most fractures are in E-W and NE-SW orientations and some are in other orientations. Because of various attitudes and distributions of fractures, origin of fluid conduits is not easy to investigate and predict. Based on in-situ stress data, strikes of predicted fluid conduits in Hoping area is N-S and NW-SE while in Kinmen area is in N-S. Analysis of well logging data and tracer experiments will provide further insights into evaluating the existence as well as the distribution and attitude of fluid conduits. The outcomes will establish the basis for exploitation and utilization of groundwater resources in Hoping and Kinmen areas, Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Previous work at run-of-river (ROR) dams in northern Delaware has shown that bedload supplied to ROR impoundments can be transported over the dam when impoundments remain unfilled. Transport is facilitated by high levels of sand in the impoundment that lowers the critical shear stresses for particle entrainment, and an inversely sloping sediment ramp connecting the impoundment bed (where the water depth is typically equal to the dam height) with the top of the dam (Pearson and Pizzuto, in press). We demonstrate with one-dimensional bed material transport modeling that bed material can move through impoundments and that equilibrium transport (i.e., a balance between supply to and export from the impoundment, with a constant bed elevation) is possible even when the bed elevation is below the top of the dam. Based on our field work and previous HEC-RAS modeling, we assess bed material transport capacity at the base of the sediment ramp (and ignore detailed processes carrying sediment up and ramp and over the dam). The hydraulics at the base of the ramp are computed using a weir equation, providing estimates of water depth, velocity, and friction, based on the discharge and sediment grain size distribution of the impoundment. Bedload transport rates are computed using the Wilcock-Crowe equation, and changes in the impoundment’s bed elevation are determined by sediment continuity. Our results indicate that impoundments pass the gravel supplied from upstream with deep pools when gravel supply rate is low, gravel grain sizes are relatively small, sand supply is high, and discharge is high. Conversely, impoundments will tend to fill their pools when gravel supply rate is high, gravel grain sizes are relatively large, sand supply is low, and discharge is low. The rate of bedload supplied to an impoundment is the primary control on how fast equilibrium transport is reached, with discharge having almost no influence on the timing of equilibrium.",

            "abstract": "The 30 May 2015 Mw 7.9 Bonin Island earthquake is the largest instrument-recorded deep-focus earthquake in the Izu-Bonin arc. It occurred approximately 100 km deeper than the previous seismicity, in the region unlikely to be within the core of the subducting Izu-Bonin slab. The earthquake provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the unexpected occurrence of such isolated deep earthquakes. Multiple source inversion of the P, SH, pP and sSH phases and a novel fully three-dimensional back-projection of P and pP phases are applied to study the coseismic source process. The subevents locations and short-period energy radiations both show a L-shape bilateral rupture propagating initially in the SW direction then in the NW direction with an average rupture speed of 2.0 km/s. The decrease of focal depth on the NW branch suggests that the rupture is consistent with a single sub-horizontal plane inferred from the GCMT solution. The multiple source inversion further indicates slight variation of the focal strikes of the sub-events with the curvature of the subducting Izu-Bonin slab. The rupture is confined within an area of 20 km x 35 km, rather compact compared with the shallow earthquake of similar magnitude. The earthquake is of high stress drop on the order of 100 MPa and a low seismic efficiency of 0.19, indicating large frictional heat dissipation. The only aftershock is 11 km to the east of the mainshock hypocenter and 3 km away from the centroid of the first sub-event. Analysis of the regional tomography and nearby seismicity suggests that the earthquake may occur at the edge/periphery of the bending slab and is unlikely to be within the “cold” metastable olivine wedge. Our results suggest the spontaneous nucleation of the thermally induced shear instability is a possible mechanism for such isolated deep earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The 1963 closure of Glen Canyon Dam drastically reduced the downstream sediment supply and altered daily flow regimes of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon, resulting in significant sandbar erosion downstream of the dam. Dam-release floods, known as High Flow Experiments (HFEs), have occurred six times since 1996 and are intended to rebuild Grand Canyon sandbars using tributary-supplied sediment. In Marble Canyon (first 100 km of Grand Canyon) the targeted tributary is the Paria River which supplies approximately 90% of the annual suspended sediment flux through Marble Canyon; the same input contributed less than 6% prior to the dam. Annual topographic surveys have established that HFEs are effective at rebuilding sandbars. However, the long-term viability of using HFEs for sandbar maintenance is dependent on a sustainable source of sediments comprising HFE deposits. Significant use of non-tributary, main-stem sediments (i.e. pre-dam sand stored in eddies or the channel bed) in HFE deposits would indicate reliance on a limited resource, and diminishing returns in the ability of HFEs to rebuild sandbars. In this study, we sampled vertically throughout 12 bars in Marble Canyon to document temporal and downstream changes in the proportion of sediment sourced from the Paria River during the 2013 and 2014 HFEs. Preliminary data suggest that heavy mineral compositions and concentrations of Ti, S, Cr and Rb, all of which are influenced by grainsize, could be sufficiently capable of differentiating Paria-derived and main-stem sediments when combined into a composite fingerprint (CF). A multivariate mixing model using these CFs quantitatively determines the contribution of Paria-derived sediment in each HFE deposit sample. Mixing model endmembers for non-Paria sand include pre-dam flood deposits in Glen and Marble Canyons, and Marble Canyon dredge samples. These results elucidate the role of contemporary versus legacy sediment in long-term sandbar maintenance.",

            "abstract": "Recurrent drought and associated heatwave as well as flood episodes are important features of the Southern Plains regional climate, such as the 2011 Texas drought and the 2015 Texas flood. Many studies have examined the remote connection between sea surface temperature (SST) changes and conterminous U.S. droughts and flood. However, less attention has been devoted to effects of large-scale land surface temperature changes, over shorter but still considerable distances, on droughts and flood. The present study combines two types of evidence: climate observations and model simulations. Our analysis of observational data shows that springtime land temperature in the U.S. Northwest is significantly correlated with rainfall anomalies and heat in the Southern Plains. Our model simulations of the 2011 Southern Plains drought and 2015 flood confirm the observed relationship between land temperature anomaly and extreme and suggest that the remote effect of land temperature changes in the U.S. Northwest on Southern Plains extreme is probably as large as the more familiar effects of SSTs and atmospheric internal variability. We conclude that the cool 2011 springtime climate conditions in the U.S. Northwest increased the probability of summer drought and abnormal heat in the Southern Plains. The preliminary results for the 2015 flood will also be presented. The present study suggests that catastrophic consequences likely occur in a region when forcing from ocean and land combine synergistically to favor an extreme and that there is a potential for skillful seasonal predictions of U.S. Southern Plains extreme when such facts as ones presented here are considered.",

These platforms often oversimplify or present heavily interpreted or personalized perspectives. Data interactives are an extremely effective way to explore complex geoscience topics like climate, opening windows of understanding for the user that have previously been closed.\nLayering data onto maps through programs like GeoMapApp and the Earth Observer App has allowed users to dig directly into science data, but with only limited scaffolding. The interactive ‘Polar Explorer: Sea Level Explorer App’ provides a richly layered introduction to a range of topics connected to sea level rise. Each map is supported with a pop up and a short audio file of supplementary material, and an information page that includes the data source and links for further reading. This type of learning platform works well for both the formal and informal learning environment.\nThrough science data displayed as map visualizations the user is invited into topics through an introductory question, such as “Why does sea level change?” After clicking on that question the user moves to a second layer of questions exploring the role of the ocean, the atmosphere, the contribution from the world’s glaciers, world’s ice sheets and other less obvious considerations such as the role of post-glacial rebound, or the mining of groundwater. Each question ends in a data map, or series of maps, that offer opportunities to interact with the topic. Under the role of the ocean ‘Internal Ocean Temperature’ offers the user a chance to touch to see temperature values spatially over the world’s ocean, or to click through a data series starting at the ocean surface and diving to 5000 meters of depth showing how temperature changes with depth. Other sections, like the role of deglaciation of North America, allow the user to click and see change through time as the Laurentide ice sheet retreated, from 18,000 to 5,000 years ago, changing sea level as it melted.\nInteracting with the range of topics and the different data layers allows the user to see first hand how climate and sea level have changed through time and how it has, and does, vary around the world.",

            "abstract": "One of primary uncertainties in satellite overland quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) from passive sensors such as radiometers is the impact on the brightness temperatures by the surface land emissivity. The complexity of surface land emissivity is linked to its temporal variations (diurnal and seasonal) and spatial variations (subsurface vertical profiles of soil moisture, vegetation structure and surface temperature) translating into sub-pixel heterogeneity within the satellite field of view (FOV). To better extract the useful signal from hydrometeors, surface land emissivity needs to be determined and filtered from the satellite-measured brightness temperatures. Based on the dielectric properties of surface land cover constitutes, Microwave Polarization Differential index (MPDI) is expected to carry the composite effect of surface land properties on land surface emissivity, with a higher MPDI indicating a lower emissivity. This study analyses the dependence of MPDI to soil moisture, vegetation and surface skin temperature over 9 different land surface types. Such analysis is performed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS, the near surface air temperature from the RAP model and ante-precedent precipitation accumulation from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor as surrogates for the vegetation, surface skin temperature and shallow layer soil moisture, respectively. This paper provides 1) evaluations of brightness temperature-based MPDI from the TRMM and GPM Microwave Imagers in both raining and non-raining conditions to test the dependence of MPDI to precipitation; 2) comparisons of MPDI categorized into instantly before, during and immediately after selected precipitation events to examine the impact of modest-to-heavy precipitation on the spatial pattern of MPDI; 3) inspections of relationship between MPDI versus rain fraction and rain rate within the satellite sensors FOV to investigate the behaviors of MPDI in varying precipitation conditions; 4) analysis of discrepancies of MPDI over 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.8 GHz to identify the sensitivity of MPDS to microwave wavelengths.",

            "abstract": "Meandering rivers are extremely ubiquitous on Earth, yet it is only recently that single-thread experimental channels with low sinuosity have been created. In these recent experiments, as well as in natural rivers, vegetation plays a crucial role in maintaining a meandering pattern by adding cohesion to the bank and inhibiting erosion. The ancient, highly sinuous channels found on Mars are enigmatic because presumably vegetation did not exist on ancient Mars. Under the hypothesis that Martian meandering rivers formed by chemical precipitation on levees and flood plain deposits, we conducted carbonate flume experiments to investigate the formation and evolution of a single-thread meander pattern without vegetation. The flow recirculating in the flume is designed to accelerate chemical reactions – dissolution of limestone using CO2 gas to produce artificial spring water and precipitation of carbonates to increase cohesion– with precise control of water discharge, sediment discharge, and temperature. Preliminary experiments successfully created a single-thread meandering pattern through chemical processes. Carbonate deposits focused along the channel sides improved the bank stability and made them resistant to erosion, which led to a stream confined in a narrow path. The experimental channels showed lateral migration of the bend through cut bank and point bar deposits; intermittent floods created overbank flow and encouraged cut bank erosion, which enhanced lateral migration of the channel, while increase in sediment supply improved lateral point bar deposition, which balanced erosion and deposition rates. This mechanism may be applied to terrestrial single-thread and/or meandering rivers with little to no vegetation or before its introduction to Earth and also provide the link between meandering river records on Mars to changes in Martian surface conditions.",

            "abstract": "Reservoir construction cause many changes in lotic ecosystems and can favor the aquatic macrophyte growth. Nova Avanhandava Reservoir (São Paulo, Brazil), is fully inhabited by submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) which may cause serious problems to hydropower and irrigation systems. The goal of this study was to assess the radiation availability in the water column in Nova Avanhandava and analyze its influence on SAV development and growth. The measurements were carried out between 28th and 30th June, 2013, at 19 sampling stations. Water samples for analytical determination of the suspended solids and chlorophyll-a concentration were collected. Hyperspectral downwelling irradiance (Ed) data, at several depths, were measured using the TriOS/RAMSES optical sensor. Depths and SAV heights were collected through hydroacoustic measurements by transects using the scientific digital sonar BioSonics DT-X (Echosounder). The Ed data were normalized, than calculated the Kd PAR – downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation, and the euphotic zone depth (ZEZ). Results showed that SAV height values were lower at upstream (around P01) with highest TSS (Total Suspended Solids) and Kd, compared to areas downstream (around P19) (Figure). The maximum depth of SAV development, average SAV height, maximum SAV height, variability, and depth of occurrence of SAV were primarily influenced by Kd. A linear inverse relationship between the average SAV height and the Kd PAR (R2 = 0.56, p<0.001), and between maximum SAV height and Kd PAR (R²=0.5, p<0.001) demonstrated that the SAV heigth can be estimated by Kd PAR with significant accuracy. Therefore, studies on subaquatic radiation availability measured by the vertical attenuation of Ed PAR in the water column and the optically active components can be effiectivly linked to SAV growth and occurrence and aid in understanding SAV in tropical reservoirs, contributing to its management.",

Space feature models are widely used in estimating ET nowadays. The locations of dry line and wet line are important to the retrieving results, especially for the dry lines, which are more difficult to determine than wet lines since dry lines do not exist in wet period. In this paper, simplified thermal inertia values of sandy soil samples and full vegetation covered samples measured in laboratory are used in the middle reaches of Heihe River to determine the locations of dry line in wet periods and dry periods. Six Aster images form 1st June to 12th September of Year 2012 are used in the study. The results shows that the ET results from our approach shows a high agreement (R > 0.85) with the observed ET in Heihe and the method can be used in Heihe area to estimate regional ET.",

            "abstract": "We find that dilatant till facilitates rapid ice flow in central Greenland, and regions of dryer till limit the expansion of ice flow. The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) is the largest ice stream in Greenland, draining 8.4% of the ice sheet’s area. Fast ice flow initiates near the ice sheet summit in a region of high geothermal heat flow and extends some 700km downstream to three outlet glaciers along the NE Coast. The flow pattern and stability mechanism of this ice stream are unique to others in Greenland and Antarctica, and merit further study to ascertain the sensitivity of this ice stream to future climate change.\nIn this study, we present the results of the first-ever ground-based geophysical survey of the initiation zone of NEGIS. Based on radar and preliminary seismic data, Christianson et al. (2014, EPSL) propose a flow mechanism for the ice stream based on topographically driven hydropotential lows which generate ‘sticky’ regions of the bed under the ice stream margins. We further test this hypothesis using a 40km reflection seismic survey across both ice stream margins. We find that regions of ‘sticky’ bed as observed by the radar survey are coincident with regions of the bed with seismic returns indicating drier subglacial sediments. These findings are further supported by five amplitude-verses-offset seismic surveys indicating dilatant till within the ice stream and consolidated sediments within its margins.",

In this context, an accurate delineation through remote sensing is a valuable tool. Here we focused on Lake Poopó located in the Bolivian Andean plateau at an elevation of about 3686 m. With an extent from 500 to 3000 km2 and a mean depth ranging from few cm to 2 m between dry and wet season, respectively, this lake is very sensitive to water use and climatic change.\nField spectral-radiometric measurements were collected on both Lake shore and shallow regions in 2014. A total of 84 measurements matching with a Landsat-OLI 8 overpass were made available for our study. The database was used to test FLASSH atmospheric correction module of ENVI software under different parametrization. It shows the usefulness and necessity of such correction before using Landsat imagery. Then, five commonly used indexes for separating inland water (NDWI, MNDWI, WRI, NDVI and AWEI) were computed from Atmospheric corrected Landsat image and compared with field spectral-radiometric measurement. WRI was found the most suitable indexes to delineate Lake Poopó extent according to spectral-radiometric measurements. Using FLAASH atmospheric correction and WRI index, Landsat imagery was used to estimate Lake Poopó extent for a 17 years period from 1998 to 2015. Fluctuations are compared with rainfall measurement from TRMM TMPA-3B42 v7 and In Situ evaporation to highlights climatic or water use changes during this period.\nFinally, 130 water depth measurements collected in 2005 were used to establish a logarithmic correlation between WRI and water depth. The relation was applied for 2014 and computed water depths are in agreement with In Situ measurement with an overall RMSE value of 5 cm.",

            "abstract": "Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) can be regarded as a useful tool for understanding the variation of finite strain pattern for regional deformation. In order to evaluate the interrelationship between maximum metamorphic temperature and deformation during mountain building, oriented samples of low-grade metamorphic rocks across the northern Taiwan were collected. In addition to the study of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, experiments of natural remanent magnetization, hysteresis loop, and temperature-function magnetic susceptibility were also conducted.\nResults show that K1 orientation of magnetic ellipsoids suggested NW-SE compression, which is consistent with plate convergence direction. Both deformation intensity and anisotropy increase from the west to east with abnormally strong intensity and oblate strain near major faults. Magnetic fabrics have grouped six-stage from Type I to VI upon increasing strain. Study area can be divided into four domain A to D by geological characteristics and distribution of magnetic fabric. Rocks in Domain A begin to be influenced by horizontal tectonic strain. Ellipsoid is oblate and K1 is in northeast-southwest orientation, indicating NW-SW compression. Magnetic fabric belongs to Type II. K3 orientation in Domain B started to be affected by cleavage. The shape of ellipsoid is mainly oblate. Magnetic fabric is classified as Type II-III. The shape of ellipsoid in Domain C gradually converts to prolate. Distribution of K3, influenced by cleavage development, becomes a girdle in NW-SE orientation. It is treated as Type III-IV. In Domain D, though both anisotropy and deformation intensity are increased, the direction of K3 is still concentrated in vertical, not in horizontal. Results might be the reflective of discontinuous strain response to different kinematic mechanisms between the Backbone Range and the Hsueshan Range.\nThermopaleogeomagnetic records of pyrrhotite remanence on both limbs of the Chungling Anticline failed the fold test, indicating the post-fold exhumation. It means while the metamorphic temperature was cooled down below the Curie temperature 320℃ of pyrrhotite, there was no remarkable folding deformation anymore. Later the Hsueshan Range was uplifted passively and eroded.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activity increasing the amount of radiatively active gases, or Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in the earth’s atmosphere has led to shifts in weather patterns. Climate models predict the occurrence of large storms may increase in frequency and intensity in the mid-Atlantic region. Knowing that extreme precipitation events are rare, testing the influence of large water pulses across different soil types within an ecosystem is challenging. Large additions of water could promote or inhibit microbial activity, and change soil chemistry within a few days. Rapid changes in soil moisture lead to shifts in the behavior of soils as either sinks or sources of several GHGs (i.e., CO2, CH4 and N2O). Unfortunately, it is still unclear how rewetting events could impact the magnitude of GHG fluxes and how changing soil chemical parameters influence these responses. An experiment was designed to test the influence of extreme repeated water pulses on GHG fluxes from four different soils, representing key topographic locations within a watershed in the Piedmont region (i.e., forested upland, forested lowland, creek, wetland). Intact soil cores from these four soil types were kept under constant temperature (22oC) and we measured their responses to extreme water pulses. We continuously (hourly resolution) measured CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes using a LI-8100A (Licor, Lincoln, NE) multiplexed system coupled to a Picarro G2508 (Picarro, Santa Clara, CA). Furthermore, we used a rhizolysimeter for porewater extraction to measure pH, redox, and water chemistry throughout the experiment. We hypothesized that repeated extreme water pulses would result in non-linear responses of GHG flux magnitudes and dynamics, and these dynamics would relate to changes in soil chemistry. We found that soil moisture alone could not explain the dynamics of GHG fluxes, but these extreme water pulses influenced the overall temporal patterns of all GHGs across all soil types. We also examined the 100 year global warming potential for each GHG, using IPCC values accounting for carbon-climate feedback. Upland and lowland soil samples contributed 40.93% and 55.21% of GHGs in CO2 equivalent over the entire experiment respectively, while the creek and wetland soil samples contributed 2.31% and 1.55% of gas fluxes in CO2 equivalent, respectively.",

This study encompasses the 6 years of the satellite operations, from 2005 to 2010, including years of moderate magnetic activity of solar cycles 23 and 24 and the deep solar minimum in 2009-2010. We report in this poster a statistical analysis of MSTID events characterized by quasi-periodic variations of the O+ density observed below ~ 40° geomagnetic latitudes with wavelengths ranging from 350 to 700 km. Although detected in both hemispheres they occur predominantly at southern latitudes with a rather strong peak over the Pacific ocean. A detailed analysis has shown that these events may be sorted in 4 categories according to their latitudinal extent. Most of them are restricted to a latitude band between ~ 15° and 40° geomagnetic in North or South but some of them extend from mid latitudes in one hemisphere to low latitude in the other hemisphere, thus spanning equatorial regions up to 5-10°. The apparent negative correlation with magnetic activity seems to indicate that most of these events are driven by AGW originating from low altitude atmospheric levels and not triggered by auroral phenomena. We shall present the seasonal and inter-annual variations showing significant changes associated with solar activity. Our results will be compared to other ground-based or satellite observations and our investigation pointed out a strong effect of these MSTID and their parent AGW on the electrodynamics of the low latitude ionosphere.",

The aftershocks, distributed mostly between the main shock and the main aftershock, are indicative of the structure of the main frontal thrust and associated fault system. Shortly after the Mw7.3 main aftershock, we conducted a field deployment of a 100-km-long array of 31 TEXAN miniature seismometers in southern Tibet, north of the Nepal-China boarder, from 5/20/2015 to 6/17/2015. This roughly north-south array with around 3 km in station spacing have recorded many aftershocks of the 2015 Nepal Earthquake series, including 22 aftershocks greater than M4.0, as well as over one hundred teleseismic events greater than M5.0, including the M7.8 deep earthquake in Chichi-shima, Japan and a sequence of M6.0 earthquakes in Solomon Islands. The purposes of deploying this mobile 2D array are: (1) Assessing the feasibility of deploying TEXAN seismometers in southern Tibet and the data quality; (2) Monitoring further aftershocks of the Nepal earthquake series and other events; and (3) Mapping the crustal structure beneath the array using regional and teleseismic data. It is encouraging that our first deployment has resulted in good data quality, and we are making a seismic profile beneath the 2D transect.

It is significant to study the microbial community especially related to organic contaminant biodegradation and their variation with groundwater environment parameters, so as to evaluate the biodegradability of the organic contaminants and then make a right decision for bioremediation. One of good ways for this study is to build a microcosm in groundwater containing target contaminant, where microbes especially relating to biodegradation will grow in the microcosm and be collected for analysis. This research aims to prepare a novel material for in situ microbe sampler and microcosm experiment in groundwater environment.\nThe novel material, namely, the activated carbon-nylon (AC-N) beads, was prepared using activated carbon and nylon as main raw materials. The material consists of 3-4mm diameter spherical beads (Fig.1A and Fig.2 A) which have an internal surface area greater than 500 m2 g-1. FT-IR spectra (Fig.3) indicated the composition of activated carbon and nylon due to the variation of the peaks at the near 1627 cm-1and 1558 -1538 cm−1 before and after complex reaction. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of benzene on the beads was 16.76 mg/g at the initial concentration of 100 mg/L. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (Fig.4). The mechanism of the adsorption process was determined from the intraparticle diffusion model. Camera and SEM images (Fig.1 B and Fig.2 A and B) showed that the beads had an open and channel pore structures, the microbes might enter into and grow up in the beads (Fig.1 C and Fig.2 C). All these results showed that the AC-N beads could form the in situ microcosm of organic pollutants and microbes, which provided a promising prospect for assessing the biodegradability of the organic pollutants by intrinsic microbes in the groundwater.",

            "abstract": "African ecosystems are at great risk due to climate and land-use change. Paleo-records illustrate that changes in precipitation and temperature have led to dramatic alterations of African vegetation distribution over the Quaternary; however, despite the fact that the link between mankind and the environment has a longer history in the African tropics than anywhere else on earth, very little is known about pre-colonial land-use. Disentangling the influence of each is particularly critical in areas of exceptional biodiversity and endemism, such as the Afromontane forest region. This region is generally considered to be highly sensitive to temperature and thus at risk to future climate change. However, new evidence suggests that some high elevation species may have occupied warmer areas in the past and thus are not strongly limited by temperature and may be at greater risk from intensifying land-use.\nFirst, we use species distribution models constructed from modern and paleo-distributions of high elevation forests in order to evaluate differences in the climatic space occupied today compared to the past. We find that although modern Afromontane species ranges occupy very narrow climate conditions, and in particular that most species occur only in cold areas, in the past most species have tolerated warmer conditions. This suggests that many montane tree species are not currently limited by warm temperatures, and that the region has already seen significant reduction in the climate space occupied, possibly from Holocene land-use.\nSecond, to evaluate human impacts on montane populations, we examine paleoecological records from lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa that capture ecological processes at difference time scales to reconstruct Afromontane forest range changes. Over long time scales, we observe phases of forest expansion in the lowlands associated with climate variability alone where composition varies little from phase to phase but include both modern low and high altitude taxa. We then examine changes in biodiversity and species composition within the Afromontane region related to evidence different types of historical land-use, suggesting significant alteration of montane forest range and lowland forest composition.",

            "abstract": "The calculated residual topography (RT) and residual mantle Bouguer anomaly (RMBA) reveal distinctive asymmetric crustal structure on conjugate flanks of the Mohns Ridge during the last 35 Ma. During Period I (35 Ma to 17 Ma), large regions of the western flank are associated with relatively negative RMBA and higher RT (i.e., shallower seafloor) in comparison to the conjugate eastern flank. The average differences in RMBA and RT between both flanks are about 35 mGal and 400 m, respectively, indicating possible off-axis crustal accretion on the western flank associated with the Iceland hotspot. Furthermore, the RMBA on both flanks are associated with relative negative values, suggesting overall enhanced magma supply at the axis of the Mohns Ridge during this period. During Period II (17 Ma to 6 Ma), the average asymmetry of RT and RMBA between the two flanks gradually reduced to zero. During Period III (6 Ma to present), the western flank are associated with higher RT and more positive RMBA values relative to the eastern conjugate; the overall magma supply is the least robust since 35 Ma. We infer the following interpretations from the above analyses: (1) The gradual decrease in magma supply of the Mohns Ridge from 35 Ma to present could be caused by the Mohns Ridge moving farther away from the Iceland hotspot. The separation distance between the Mohns Ridge and Iceland hotspot reached a minimum value (~300 km) at about 35 Ma, but gradually increases to the present-day value of ~630 km. (2) The observed significant asymmetric crustal structure in crustal ages of 35 Ma to 17 Ma (Period I) might be related to the intensive off-axis volcanism of the Iceland hotspot on the western flank. (3) The observed asymmetric crustal structure in crustal ages of 6 Ma to present (Period III), however, might be best explained by a model of relatively low overall ridge-axis magma supply and greater degree of tectonic deformation. Furthermore, the higher RT and relative positive RMBA values on the western flank might be associated with thinner crust and uplifted footwalls of large normal faults on the western flank. Together the systematic variations along the Mohns Ridge reveal the important role of interactions among hotspot influence, local magma supply, and tectonic deformation, in controlling the asymmetric crustal structure of slow-spreading ridges.",

The whole idea that the entire Earth's surface comprises of a dozen or so tectonic plates with no deformation in between them (as most textbooks will tell you) is embarrassingly outdated. The advent of high-precision GNSS measurements of crustal motion has led to the direct observation of plate motion, the confirmation of plate rigidity, and the refinement of crustal kinematics in diffuse plate boundary zones. With the rapidly growing number of continuous GPS (cGPS) stations (as well as campaign-style measurements) some of the earlier results can now be reassessed while at the same time we can continue to quantify the motion and deformation of a large part of the Earth's surface.\nWe present the latest version (v. 2.2) of the Global Strain Rate Model (GSRM), which is almost entirely constrained by horizontal GPS velocities. The model contains the rigid-body rotations of 50 plates as well as strain rate and vorticity estimates at a high spatial resolution for the ~14% of the Earth's surface that is caught up in between the plates. Resulting global or regional maps of dilatation, vorticity, and strain tensor amplitude and style, are poised to augment standard textbook images of plate motions, and we anticipate that they will foster further scientific and educational inquiry.\nGSRM v2.2 is constrained by >24,000 velocities. Of those ~7900 were determined by us from time-series that we obtained through a routine processing of all globally available RINEX data. Many of these stations were not installed with the intention to track crustal motions, but often are very usable. This station category is currently the biggest contributor to the data explosion; our solution has >1100 more stations compared with the previous solution of just 18 months ago. We transform to our solution GPS velocities from >250 published studies, >30 more than in the previous solution.",

            "abstract": "The top of the low seismic velocity zone (LVZ) is frequently used to localize the lithosphere –asthenosphere boundary (LAB) which separates rigid oceanic plates from the underlying ductile asthenosphere. The seismic and electric properties of the LVZ are generally explained by the presence of low degree melts located at the base of the lithosphere, but the composition of these melts (silicate or carbonated melts) is still in debate. If most models for the LAB are based on geophysical or experimental studies, the discovery of petit-spot volcanoes on the top of the down-going Pacific plate (1) provides unique opportunities to obtain direct information on the LAB. Petit-spot volcanoes are interpreted as small-scale seamounts formed by the extraction of low-degree melts from the base of the lithosphere in response of plate flexure and/or crack propagation (2). The petrology of petit-spot lavas from Japan and Costa Rica demonstrates, first, that melts from the LVZ correspond to volatiles rich low degree silicate melts rather then to carbonatitic melts. Second, the discovery of lithospheric metasomatized mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts in the petit-spot lavas suggest that plate bending in front of subduction zones does not only produce petit-spot lavas at the surface, but allowed low degree melts from the LVZ to percolate and differentiate across the base of the oceanic lithosphere. This observation has important implication for the LAB because it demonstrates that deformed LAB does not represent a impermeable barrier for melt percolation as communally assumed, but deformation allows melts from the asthenosphere to percolate through peridotite matrix for significant distance (~10-20 km) modifying the rheology and the seismic properties of the base of the lithospheric mantle. This aspect needs to be taking into account in any model trying to simulate lithosphere asthenosphere deformation.\n(1) Hirano et al., 2006, Science 313, 1426-1428; (2) Valentine & Hirano, 2010, Geology 38, 55-58.",

            "abstract": "Field studies in tectonics and structural geology involve many kinds of data, such as foliation-lineation pairs, folded and boudinaged veins, deformed clasts, and lattice preferred orientations. Each data type can inform a model of deformation, for example by excluding certain geometries or constraining model parameters. In past work we have demonstrated how to systematically integrate a wide variety of data types into the computation of best-fit deformations. However, because even the simplest deformation models tend to be highly non-linear in their parameters, evaluating the uncertainty in the best fit has been difficult.\nIn this presentation we describe an approach to rigorously assessing the uncertainty in models of naturally deformed rock. Rather than finding a single vector of parameter values that fits the data best, we use Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to generate a large set of vectors of varying fitness. Taken together, these vectors approximate the probability distribution of the parameters given the data. From this distribution, various auxiliary statistical quantities and conclusions can be derived. Further, the relative probability of differing models can be quantified.\nWe apply this approach to two example data sets, from the Gem Lake shear zone and western Idaho shear zone. Our findings address shear zone geometry, magnitude of deformation, strength of field fabric, and relative viscosity of clasts. We compare our model predictions to those of earlier studies.",

Between November 2016 and March 2017, six MicroWave Radiometers will collect information on Jupiter's atmosphere and electron belt. Here we present simulations of MWR observations of the electron belt synchrotron emission, and discuss the features and dynamical behavior of this emission when observations are carried out from inside the radiation zone. We first present our computation method. We combine a three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction method of Earth-based observations and a theoretical model of Jupiter's electron belt to constrain the calculations of the volume emissivity of the synchrotron radiation for any frequency, location in the Jovian inner magnetosphere (radial distance < 4 Rj), and observational direction. Values of the computed emissivity are incorporated into a synchrotron simulator to predict Juno MWR measurements (full sky maps and temperatures) at any time of the mission. Samples of simulated MWR observations are presented and examined for different segments of Juno trajectory. We also present results of our ongoing investigation of the radiation zone distribution around the planet and the sources of variation on different time-scales. We show that a better understanding of the spatial distribution and variability of the electron belt is key to realistically forecast Juno MWR measurements.",

We use plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides subsp. monilifera) tree rings collected from four rivers to reconstruct flow history of the Yellowstone River near its confluence with the Missouri River. Upland trees in dry regions are typically used in flow reconstruction because their annual growth is controlled by the same precipitation that drives downstream flow, but our study improves flow reconstruction by including floodplain trees that are directly affected by the river. Cores from over 1000 cottonwoods along the Yellowstone, Powder, Little Missouri, and Redwater Rivers were collected from within a 170 km radius to reconstruct flows using the Age Curve Standardization technique in a multiple regression analysis. The large sample from trees spanning many age classes allows us to use only the rings that were produced when each tree was less than 50 years old and growth was most strongly correlated to river discharge. Using trees from a range of rivers improves our ability to differentiate between growth resulting from local precipitation and river flow, and we show that cottonwood growth differs across these neighboring rivers having different watersheds. Using the program Seascorr, tree growth is found to better correlated to seasonal river discharge (R = 0.69) than to local precipitation (R = 0.45). Our flow reconstruction reveals that the most extreme multi-year or multi-decade drought periods of the last 250 years on either the Yellowstone (1817-1821) or Powder (1846-1865) Rivers are missed by the gauged discharge record. Across all sites, we document increased growth in the 20th century compared to the 19th, a finding unattainable with conventional methods but having important implications for flow management.",

            "abstract": "In California the accumulated winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada, reservoirs and groundwater water storage in the Central Valley follow an annual periodic cycle and each contribute to the resulting surface deformation, which can be observed using GPS time series. The ongoing drought conditions in the western U.S. amplify the observed uplift signal as the Earth’s crust responds to the mass changes associated with the water loss. The near surface hydrological mass loss can result in annual stress changes of ~1kPa at seismogenic depths. Similarly, small static stress perturbations have previously been associated with changes in earthquake activity. Periodicity analysis of earthquake catalog time series suggest that periods of 4-, 6-, 12-, and 14.24-months are statistically significant in regions of California, and provide documentation for the modulation of earthquake populations at periods of natural loading cycles. Knowledge of what governs the timing of earthquakes is essential to understanding the nature of the earthquake cycle. If small static stress changes influence the timing of earthquakes, then one could expect that events will occur more rapidly during periods of greater external load increases. To test this hypothesis we develop a loading model using GPS derived surface water storage for California and calculate the stress change at seismogenic depths for different faulting geometries. We then evaluate the degree of correlation between the stress models and the seismicity taking into consideration the variable amplitude of stress cycles, the orientation of transient load stress with respect to the background stress field, and the geometry of active faults revealed by focal mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The economy of Morocco is highly dependent on fluctuations in wheat yield. Since very little of the Moroccan wheat harvest is irrigated, this leaves the annual wheat yield dependent on precipitation fluctuations and large scale weather patterns over the north Atlantic. Here we suggest two predictors of the annual change in Moroccan wheat yield based on these relationships. The first, pre-planting indicator relies on the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of the north Atlantic in September through November and are reinforced by a mid-season predictor based on the weighted precipitation from October through February. Partial least squares regression is used to determine the three most relevant patterns of Atlantic SST which offer an early indication of the upcoming wheat yield. The prediction is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of the cumulative monthly precipitation weighted by the wheat cultivation areas, from October through the wheat harvest. It is not surprising that the total precipitation in Morocco influences the annual wheat yield, however it is remarkable the degree to which early season precipitation sums are able to forecast the national wheat yield. Higher resolution precipitation reanalysis products from AgMERRA and NOAA have coefficients of determination greater than 0.5 by February (r2=0.78 and 0.57, respectively). The more frequently updated NOAA 0.5° resolution precipitation product has a slightly lower but still significant correlation (r2=0.48).",

            "abstract": "Recent research has shown a tendency for severe convective storms to vary intraseasonally, including by phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJO is the leading mode of atmospheric intraseasonal variability and is characterized by large regions (1000-5000 km) of anomalous convective activity that generally propagate eastward along the equator. Anomalous upper-troposphere heating associated with this convection generates poleward-propagating Rossby waves that interact with the preexisting extratropical circulation. The projection of this interaction onto the synoptic scale – via the favoring of troughs and ridges at certain positions - is the hypothesized mechanism by which the MJO modulates severe convection. However, one unexplored aspect of this modulation is the extent to which severe convection in winter and early-spring months, especially Jan-Mar, may be influenced by different phases of the MJO. While climatologically rarer than events later in spring, severe thunderstorms in winter and early spring still have potential to be high-impact weather events, especially as they often occur in populated areas of the southeast U.S. that have shown more vulnerability than other regions such as the southern or central plains. Results from other studies (not necessarily focused on the question of severe convective storms) have indicated statistically significant modulation of upper- and mid-tropospheric circulation (from 200 hPa to 700 hPa), surface temperature, and sea level pressure. Thus, it is possible that the MJO’s influence also extends to severe storms, as these are ingredients known to affect the likelihood of convective activity in the U.S. Using a methodology similar to other recent MJO studies, the impacts of the MJO on tornado, hail, and wind activity from Jan-Mar will be tested as part of this larger project to understand intraseasonal variability of severe storms.",

Among them, aluminous clay-sulfate assemblages have been observed, which suggest alteration by acidic fluids.\nThe Riotinto mining district (SW Spain) provides an Earth analogue site for such Martian processes. The parent rocks belong to an Upper Palaeozoic (Late Famennian-Tournaisian) volcano-sedimentary complex including siliciclastic sediments and mafic and felsic volcanics, all of which underwent hydrothermal alteration. The oxidation of an extensive pyrite-rich orebody provided mild to extreme acidic fluxes that leached the surrounding rocks for over 20 million years. The mineral assemblages are strongly dependent on their acidic alteration intensity.\nThe observed mineralogical parageneses and leaching conditions for our sites at Riotinto are consistent with three alteration sequences: i) Mild: containing a range of clay minerals from vermiculite to kaolinite, with a wide variety of crystal order and mixed-layering; ii) Intermediate: containing smectite to kaolinite with jarosite-group phases; iii) Advanced: containing kaolinite, jarosite-group phases, and iron oxides. Our findings suggest that, even within this general scheme, the specific alteration pathways can be different.",

            "abstract": "Excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) emissions to surface waters are a high priority environmental problem worldwide for protection of water resources in times of population growth and climate change. As clean water is a scarce resource the struggle for reducing nutrient emissions are an ongoing issue for many countries and regions. Since the mid1980s a wide range of national regulatory general measures have been implemented to reduce land based nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings of the Danish aquatic environment. These measures have addressed both point source emissions and emissions from diffuse sources especially from agricultural production. Following nearly 4 decades of combating nutrient pollution our surface waters such as lakes and estuaries are only slowly responding on the 50% reduction in N and 56% reduction in P. Therefore, the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in Danish surface waters still call for further reductions of N and P loadings. Therefore, a new era of targeted implemented measures was the outcome of a Commission on Nature and Agriculture established by the Danish Government in 2013. Their White Book points to the need of increased growth and better environment through more targeted and efficient regulation using advanced technological mitigation methods that are implemented intelligently according to the local natural attenuation capacity for nutrients in the landscape. As a follow up a national consensus model for N was established chaining existing leaching, 3D groundwater and surface water models that enable a calculation of the N dynamics and attenuation capacity within a scale of 15 km2. Moreover, several research projects have been conducted to investigate the effect of a suite of targeted mitigation measures such as restored natural wetlands, constructed wetlands, controlled drainage, buffer strips and constructed buffer strips. The results of these studies will be shared in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "The Queen Charlotte-Fairweather Fault (QCFF) of southeastern Alaska and British Columbia is the dominant fault along the 1200 km-long transform boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. More than 900 km of the QCFF lies offshore where the style and rates of deformation are poorly constrained due to a lack of high-resolution marine geophysical data. In May 2015, the USGS acquired ~900 km2 of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry data and >2000 line-km of high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles between Cross Sound, Yakobi Sea Valley, and Icy Point (the northernmost offshore section of the QCFF) using a 24-ch streamer and 500 Joule minisparker source. During a second cruise in August 2015 we conducted targeted multichannel seismic and subbottom CHIRP profiling in the same region. The new data reveal a single trace of the QCFF expressed as a clear and remarkably straight seafloor lineation for >60 km. Subtle jogs in the fault (<3 degrees) are associated with pop-up structures and en echelon pull-apart basins. The near surface deformation along the fault never exceeds a width of 1.2 km. Northward, as the fault approaches Icy Point and a restraining bend, it splays into multiple strands and displays evidence for uplift and transpression. The fault appears to transition from almost purely strike-slip in the south to oblique-convergence as it steps onshore to the north. The QCFF cuts through the Yakobi Sea Valley and Cross Sound, two elongate bathymetric troughs that were filled with glaciers as recently as 17–19 ka. The southern wall of the Yakobi Sea Valley is offset 890±30 m by the QCFF, providing a late Pleistocene–present slip-rate estimate of 45–54 mm/yr. This suggests that nearly the entire plate boundary slip budget is confined to a single, narrow, strike-slip fault zone, which may have implications for models of plate boundary strain localization.",

            "abstract": "On 25 April 2015, the Gorkha Earthquake (Mw 7.8) struck Nepal, generating thousands of landslides in Nepal, Tibet (China), and India. While the majority of these hazards were triggered co-seismically, many are considered secondary effects occurring during the weeks following the main shock, based on high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery. Here we report on a series of shallow, post-seismic landslides into the upper Marsyangdi River in the Annapurna region of the central Nepal Himalayas. These landslides constricted and blocked the river, causing impoundments that presented acute flood risks to communities downstream. On April 27, two days following the main shock, ~4.7 x 104 m3 of water was impounded behind a series of small constrictions. By May 28, the total volume of impounded water had increased to ~6.4 x 105 m3. The downstream flood risk was especially significant in the event of a domino-like cascade of dam breaches. We examine the timing, distribution and evolution of the landslide-dammed lakes and quantify the risk of inundation-scenarios to downstream communities with a hydrological model. The model uses a fully kinematic wave simulation at a 30 m-spatial and 2 sec-temporal resolution to resolve the height, timing and volume of a possible outburst flood wave. Our modeling shows that a rapid dam burst involving only the lowest, largest lake would increase water levels at the nearest village of Lower Pisang ~2 km downstream by >7m in a matter of minutes. Approximately 70 km downstream, the flood wave would be mostly attenuated, raising water levels only tens of centimeters. Fortunately, at the time of writing, no flood had occurred.",

            "abstract": "Compiled argon ages reveal inception, eruptive episodes, ages, and durations of Cascade stratovolcanoes and their ancestral predecessors. Geologic mapping and geochronology show that most Cascade volcanoes grew episodically on multiple scales with periods of elevated behavior lasting hundreds of years to ca. 100 kyr. Notable examples include the paleomag-constrained, few-hundred-year-long building of the entire 15-20 km3 Shastina edifice at Mt. Shasta, the 100 kyr-long episode that produced half of Mt. Rainier’s output, and the 30 kyr-long episode responsible for all of South and Middle Sister. Despite significant differences in timing and rates of construction, total durations of active and ancestral volcanoes at discrete central-vent locations are similar. Glacier Peak, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, and Mt. Mazama all have inception ages of 400-600 ka. Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Jefferson, Newberry Volcano, Mt. Shasta and Lassen Domefield have more recent inception ages of 200-300 ka. Only the Sisters cluster and Mt. Baker have established eruptive histories spanning less than 50 kyr. Ancestral volcanoes centered 5-20 km from active stratocones appear to have similar total durations (200-600 kyr), but are less well exposed and dated. The underlying mechanisms governing volcano lifecycles are cryptic, presumably involving tectonic and plumbing changes and perhaps circulation cycles in the mantle wedge, but are remarkably consistent along the arc.",

Upward propagation and the resulting dissipation of gravity waves produce a substantial amount of momentum deposition and heating/cooling rates in the middle atmosphere (50-100 km) and above the mesopause (~100 km). These waves have horizontal wavelengths usually smaller than the conventional resolution of general circulation models (GCMs), and, thus, their effects have to be parameterized. Simulations with the Max Planck Institute Mars GCM using the interactively implemented nonlinear spectral parameterization have revealed a very important role of gravity waves in the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere of Mars. They close, and even reverse, the zonal jets, enhance the meridional circulation and middle atmosphere polar warmings, facilitate the formation of CO2 ice clouds, and modulate the upper atmospheric response to dust storms. Gravity wave-induced cooling is as strong in the mesosphere and thermosphere as the major radiative cooling mechanism - the radiative transfer in the IR bands of CO2 molecules, and can explain the observed temperatures in the lower thermosphere.",

To effectively prevent the above environmental contamination issue, it is an essential prerequisite of exploring the spatio-temporal variability (stV) of the groundwater quality. In this study, a large observation program was deployed to observe ammonium-N (NH4N), nitrate-N (NO3N) and total N (TN) concentrations in 194 groundwater observation wells (1.5 m deep from soil surface) from April 2010 to November 2012 in the Jinjing river catchment in Hunan Province of China. A logit function was applied to transform NH4N, NO3N and TN data for normality; the resultant variables were thus named as NH4Nt, NO3Nt and TNt, respectively. A spatio-temporal semivariogram model in a sum-metric form was used to quantify the stV of NH4Nt, NO3Nt and TNt. The results indicated that the 33-month means ± standard deviations of the NH4N, NO3N and TN concentrations were 0.75±0.10, 1.60±0.19 and 2.99±0.29 mg N L-1, respectively. NH4Nt and NO3Nt exhibited a strong spatio-temporal dependence, while TNt only presented a strong temporal structure. Spatio-temporal ordinary kriging (stOK) was applied to predict the spatio-temporal distributions of NH4N, NO3N and TN over the catchment. The cross-validation results indicated that the stOK predictions for NH4N (r=0.48, RMSE=1.11 mg N L-1), NO3N (r=0.46, RMSE=1.21 mg N L-1) outperformed that for TN (r=0.29, RMSE=2.11 mg N L-1). ",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional textural analysis of garnet porphyroblasts and electron microprobe analyses can, in concert, be used to pose novel tests that challenge and ultimately increase our understanding of metamorphic crystallization mechanisms. Statistical analysis of high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) data of garnet porphyroblasts tells us the degree of ordering or randomness of garnets, which can be used to distinguish the rate-limiting factors behind their nucleation and growth. Electron microprobe data for cores, rims, and core-to-rim traverses are used as proxies to ascertain porphyroblast nucleation and growth rates, and the evolution of sample composition during crystallization. MnO concentrations in garnet cores serve as a proxy for the relative timing of nucleation, and rim concentrations test the hypothesis that MnO is in equilibrium sample-wide during the final stages of crystallization, and that concentrations have not been greatly altered by intracrystalline diffusion. Crystal size distributions combined with compositional data can be used to quantify the evolution of nucleation rates and sample composition during crystallization.\nThis study focuses on quartzite schists from the Picuris Mountains with heterogeneous garnet distributions consisting of dense and sparse layers. 3D data shows that the sparse layers have smaller, less euhedral garnets, and petrographic observations show that sparse layers have more quartz and less mica than dense layers. Previous studies on rocks with homogeneously distributed garnet have shown that crystallization rates are diffusion-controlled, meaning that they are limited by diffusion of nutrients to growth and nucleation sites. This research extends this analysis to heterogeneous rocks to determine nucleation and growth rates, and test the assumption of rock-wide equilibrium for some major elements, among a set of compositionally distinct domains evolving in mm- to cm-scale proximity under identical P-T conditions.",

In the simulations presented here and described in [Innocenti2015*], a mixed scenario develops. At earlier time, plasmoids are emitted, disrupting the formation of Petschek-like structures. Later, an almost stationary monster plasmoid forms, preventing the emission of other plasmoids. A situation reminding of Petschek’s switch-off then ensues. Switch-off is obtained through a slow shock / rotational discontinuity (SS/RD) compound structure, with the rotation discontinuity downstreamthe slow shock. Two external slow shocks located in correspondence of the separatrices reduce the in plane tangential component of the magnetic field, but not to zero. Two transitions reminding of rotational discontinuities in the internal part of the exhausts then perform the final switch-off. Both the slow shocks and the rotational discontinuities are characterized as such through the analysis of their Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. A moderate guide field is used to suppress the development of the firehose instability in the exhaust that prevented switch off in [Liu2012].\nCompound SS/RD structures, with the RD located downstream the SS, have been observed in both the solar wind and the magnetosphere in Wind and Geotail data respectively [Whang1998, Whang2004].\nIon trajectiories across the SS/RD structure are followed and the kinetic origin of the SS/RD structure is investigated.\n* Innocenti, Goldman, Newman, Markidis, Lapenta, Evidence of magnetic field switch-off in collisionless magnetic reconnection, accepted in Astrophysical Journal Letters, 2015\nAcknowledgements: NERSC, a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy, Contract N.

            "abstract": "Daylight observations of the upper atmosphere have long been a goal of the ground-based optical community. Fabry-Perot Interferometer observations of the airglow emission of atomic oxygen at 630.0 nm are used as a measure of thermospheric winds and temperatures at an altitude of around 240 km. However, airglow is only about 10 times the intensity of starlight. Adding extra etalons (up to a triple etalon FPI) to filter out sunlight has been attempted by a few groups, including ours, over the decades. However, the alignment of multiple etalons is extremely tricky, and long exposures (several minutes) are required, which reduces the capacity to observe the dynamic behaviour of the upper thermosphere.\nIn this paper we show FPI observations made during the solar eclipse on the 20th March 2015. A total eclipse occurred over Svalbard for 2 minutes 27 seconds from 10:10 – 10:13 UT. This is within the time window when Svalbard passes under the magnetic cusp. There are 24 hours of darkness at Svalbard during the period November to January, which allows continuous FPI observations, including cusp measurements. However, the standard nighttime observing period is 18:55-10:16 UT for March equinox. During this tiny window of time we measured the vertical winds at very high time resolution using a 15 second exposure with our narrow angle FPI; and were able to make a single exposure for 104 seconds with our Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI). The SCANDI provided an all-sky observation, divided into 61 sectors, of horizontal winds and temperatures as a context for the high time resolution vertical winds. The observations are compared with FPI-SCANDI December cusp measurements and the UCL Coupled Middle Atmosphere Thermosphere (CMAT2) global circulation model simulations for December 2014 and March 2015. This is an opportunity to test the model daylight winds with direct observations.",

This site was cored as part of the IODP Mediterranean Outflow Expedition to address paleoceanographic questions about the evolution of the North Atlantic Mediterranean and climate system over the past 6 million years. The recovered section at Site U1389 consists of a thick, rapidly accumulated (~40 cm/kyr), and very uniform series of contouritic sediment. Ages were obtained by tuning the planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotope data to the NGRIP ice core record. We collected rock magnetic and paleomagnetic measurements at 1-cm resolution on 71-m of U-channel samples (representing ~145 k.yr.), with the goal of extracting a high-resolution record of paleoenvironmental variability, relative geomagnetic paleointensity, and paleosecular variation. Stepwise demagnetization of the natural remanence (NRM) demonstrates the successful removal of a secondary, predominantly drill-string induced, magnetization and identification of a stable and strong primary magnetization carried by the sediment samples (average MAD calculated by principal component analysis: ~1º). Excellent behavior of the samples during alternating field demagnetization and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition suggest magnetite as the main carrier of magnetic remanence. Relative paleointensity estimates were determined by normalizing the NRM by the ARM, IRM, and magnetic susceptibility. Time-frequency analyses of high-resolution concentration and grain-size dependent paleomagnetic proxy data for the entire 107-m (200 k.yr.) long APC section of Site U1389 will be presented with the goal of identifying the driver of cyclic changes in the sedimentary section.",

            "abstract": "The complex soil systems approach is needed fundamentally for the development of integrated, interdisciplinary methods to measure and quantify the physical, chemical and biological processes taking place in soil, and to determine the role of fine-scale heterogeneities. This presentation is aimed at a review of the concepts and observations concerning complexity and complex systems theory, including terminology, emergent complexity and simplicity, self-organization and a general approach to the study of complex systems using the Weaver (1948) concept of “organized complexity.” These concepts are used to provide understanding of complex soil systems, and to develop experimental and mathematical approaches to soil microbiological processes. The results of numerical simulations, observations and experiments are presented that indicate the presence of deterministic chaotic dynamics in soil microbial systems. So what are the implications for the scientists who wish to develop mathematical models in the area of organized complexity or to perform experiments to help clarify an aspect of an organized complex system? The modelers have to deal with coupled systems having at least three dependent variables, and they have to forgo making linear approximations to nonlinear phenomena. The analogous rule for experimentalists is that they need to perform experiments that involve measurement of at least three interacting entities (variables depending on time, space, and each other). These entities could be microbes in soil penetrated by roots. If a process being studied in a soil affects the soil properties, like biofilm formation, then this effect has to be measured and included. The mathematical implications of this viewpoint are examined, and results of numerical solutions to a system of equations demonstrating deterministic chaotic behavior are also discussed using time series and the 3D strange attractors.

            "abstract": "Most weather data is produced, disseminated and consumed by expert users in large national operational centers or laboratories. Data ‘ages’ off their systems in days or weeks. While archives exist, would-be users often lack the credentials necessary to obtain an account to access or search its contents. Moreover, operational centers and many national archives lack the mandate and the resources to serve non-expert users.\nThe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Research Data Archive (RDA), rda.ucar.edu, was created over 40 years ago to collect data for NCAR’s internal Big Science projects such as the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project. Over time, the data holdings have grown to 1.8+ Petabytes spanning 600+ datasets. The user base has also grown; in 2014, we served 1.1 Petabytes of data to over 11,000 unique users.\nThe RDA works with national centers, such as NCEP, ECMWF and JMA to make their data available to worldwide audiences and mutually support data access at the production source. We have become not just an open-access data center, but also a data education center.\nEach dataset archived at the RDA is assigned to a data specialist (DS) who curates the data. If a user has a question not answered in the dataset information web pages prepared by the DS, they can call or email a skilled DS for further clarification. The RDA’s diverse staff—with academic training in meteorology, oceanography, engineering (electrical, civil, ocean and database), mathematics, physics, chemistry and information science—means we likely have someone who “speaks your language.”\nErroneous data assumptions are the Achilles heel of Big Data. It doesn’t matter how much data you crunch if the data is not what you think it is. Data discovery is another difficult Big Data problem; one can only solve problems with data if one can find the right data. Metadata, both machine and human-generated, underpin the RDA data search tools.\nThe RDA has stepped in to fill the gap between data producers and users.",

            "abstract": "The spatial and temporal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) at highly reactive aquatic interfaces, e.g. in the hyporheic zone (HZ), is a primary indicator of redox and interlinked biogeochemical zonations. However, continuous measuring of DO over time and depths is challenging due to the dynamic and potentially heterogenic nature of the HZ.\nWe further developed a novel technology for spatially continuous in situ vertical oxygen profiling based on optical sensing (Vieweg et al, 2013). Continuous vertical measurements to a depth of 50 cm are obtained by the motor-controlled insertion of a side-firing Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) into tubular DO probes. Our technology allows minimally invasive DO measurements without DO consumption at high spatial resolution in the mm range. The reduced size of the tubular probe (diameter 5 mm) substantially minimizes disturbance of flow conditions.\nWe tested our technology in situ in the HZ of an intermittent stream during the drying period. Repeated DO measurements were taken over a total duration of six weeks at two locations up- and downstream of a pool-cascade sequence. We were able to precisely map the spatial DO distribution which exhibited sharp gradients and rapid temporal changes as a function of changing hydrologic conditions. Our new vertical oxygen sensing technology will help to provide new insights to the coupling of transport of DO and biogeochemical reactions at aquatic interfaces.\nVieweg, M., Trauth, N., Fleckenstein, J.

Alteration was uniform and not intense over the upper part of the core and at the bottom, but differed markedly in an anomalous zone (AZ) from 1700 to 1800m.\nThe MHC core contains diatomite, basalt lava and minor hyaloclastite.

Plagioclase (Plag) has altered to smectite along cleavage planes and fractures except in the AZ, where it is intensely altered to corrensite. Clinopyroxene (CPX, pinkish in thin section) is little altered, as are apatite and opaque minerals (probably ilmenite with magnetite or pyrite in different samples). Interstitial material is converted to smectite or, in the AZ, to corrensite. Phyllosilicate lines vesicles, and calcite, zeolite and phyllosilicate fill them. Pore-lining phillipsite is common shallow in the core, with vesicle-filling analcime and heulandite at greater depth. A fibrous zeolite, probably stilbite, is also present. Hyaloclasts are altered to concentrically layered masses of smectite.\nMHC hyaloclastites do not display the microbial traces and palagonite (“gel-palagonite”) alteration common in Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project #2 (HSDP) samples. HSDP samples do contain pore-lining phillipsite, but pore fillings are chabazite. Calcite is absent in HSDP hyaloclastites. Neither Ol nor Plag were altered in HSDP hyaloclastites. HSPD glasses are less silicic and Ti-rich than MHC lavas, containing Ol rather than CPX as a dominant mafic. However the differences in alteration of hyaloclastites probably reflect either the fact that the HSDP core was collected at temperatures equivalent to those at the top of the MHC-2 core or HSDP samples were from beds that were in modified marine pore water, rather than continental waters.",

            "abstract": "The severe deterioration of water quality in rice agriculture catchments challenges ecologists and hydrologists in exploring how rice agriculture affects nutrient loadings and water quality. This research observed the nitrogen (N) concentrations in stream water and groundwater in one forest and five rice agriculture catchments in subtropical central China to quantify the relationships between rice agriculture intensification, water quality of water bodies, and catchment N loadings. Our results indicate that intensive rice agriculture deteriorated stream water quality. A non-linear fitting analysis using a Boltzmann sigmoid function suggests that the concentrations and mass fluxes of ammonium-N (NH4+-N), nitrate-N (NO3--N), and total N (TN) in stream water increase with the areal proportion of rice agriculture in the catchments; however, these increases can only be detected when the areal proportions of rice agriculture in the catchments are greater than 13-30%, highlighting the importance of reasonable land use planning for managing stream water quality as well as N loadings from catchments. The factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) also suggests that rice agriculture has a potential to impose groundwater NH4+-N pollution, particularly in the soil exhausting season of July - October. And, the great N fertilizer application rates for rice cropping can increase the groundwater NO3-N and TN concentrations due to large quantities of N leaching into groundwater system beneath the paddy fields. The high N concentrations in groundwater result in strong N loadings via the base flow process. The NO3--N loadings via the base flow reaches 0.12-0.27 kg N ha-1 month-1 in the rice agriculture catchments, contributing 27.3%-36.5% of the total NO3--N loadings by the stream discharge. Therefore, the best management practices for N reduction and the smart land use planning should be applied in the rice agriculture catchments to improve water quality and mitigate N loadings.",

            "abstract": "Direct observations of sub-surface flow parameters and processes at mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems are difficult to perform, which makes it challenging to estimate the associated flow parameters such as velocity or heat flux. Analog modeling of hydrothermal processes can act as a means to estimate these important hydrothermal parameters, as well as to explore the sensitivity and response of these systems to natural perturbations. In this study, we conduct analog experiments that focus on low-temperature hydrothermal outflow from linear cracks, which can account for a sizeable proportion of the total hydrothermal flux (up to 90% at certain hydrothermal fields). We approximate these cracks in the laboratory as an ideal heat source with a linear geometry, which release a continuous flow of hot material. So far, fluid dynamics studies have documented the linear and weakly non-linear convective regimes in this configuration, namely the rise of a laminar sheet of fluid above the linear heat source, and the eventual onset of oscillations. However, direct observations above cracks suggest the existence of 3D instabilities such as plumes. We therefore have undertaken a laboratory study to investigate the conditions of existence and the characteristics (velocity and temperature) of these 3D instabilities. The latter are indeed observed for all the experimental conditions we tested, but at different depths in the water column. Scaling laws relating the frequency and velocity of these 3D perturbations in the water column to the thermal characteristics of the crack (heat flux, temperature difference with the ambient fluid) were derived. Hence it become possible to infer the heat flux out of a linear hydrothermal crack from the observation of the instable flow above it by standard video-imagery from deep-sea vehicles.

            "abstract": "The free oscillations, or normal modes, of the Earth provide important constraints on the long-wavelength structure of our planet. Calculations using normal modes are also necessary if the effects of gravity are to be fully modeled in seismic waveforms, which becomes important at low frequencies. To implement these calculations, we typically initially compute the normal modes (eigenfunctions) of a spherically-symmetric model such as PREM. These form a complete set of basis functions, which may then be used to describe the seismic response of laterally heterogeneous models. This procedure is known as ‘mode coupling’.\nIn order to implement the calculation, it is necessary to select a finite subset of modes (invariably defined by a frequency range) to be considered. This truncation of the infinite-dimensional equations necessarily introduces an error into the results. Here, we consider the fundamental question: if we wish to calculate synthetic spectra in a given frequency range, how many modes must we couple for the resulting spectra to be sufficiently accurate?\nTo investigate this question, we compute spectra in the 3D model S20RTS up to 2mHz, but allowing coupling with all modes up to 5mHz. We then explore how the spectra change as we reduce the upper frequency used in the coupling. We compare this to the effects introduced by altering the 3D density structure of the model. Clearly, if we wish to image Earth’s density structure accurately, it is important that the truncation error is small compared to this signal.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystems have been estimated to absorb roughly 30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Past studies have identified myriad drivers of terrestrial carbon storage changes, such as fire, climate change, and land use changes. Those drivers influence the carbon storage change via diverse mechanisms, which have not been unified into a general theory so as to identify what control the direction and rate of terrestrial carbon storage dynamics. Here we propose a theoretical framework to quantitatively determine the response of terrestrial carbon storage to different exogenous drivers. With a combination of conceptual reasoning, mathematical analysis, and numeric experiments, we demonstrated that the maximal capacity of an ecosystem to store carbon is time-dependent and equals carbon input (i.e., net primary production, NPP) multiplying by residence time. The capacity is a moving target toward which carbon storage approaches (i.e., the direction of carbon storage change) but usually does not attain. The difference between the capacity and the carbon storage at a given time t is the unrealized carbon storage potential. The rate of the storage change is proportional to the magnitude of the unrealized potential. We also demonstrated that a parameter space of NPP, residence time, and carbon storage potential can well characterize carbon storage dynamics quantified at six sites ranging from tropical forests to tundra and simulated by two versions (carbon-only and coupled carbon-nitrogen) of the Australian Community Atmosphere-Biosphere Land Ecosystem (CABLE) Model under three climate change scenarios (CO2 rising only, climate warming only, and RCP8.5). Overall this study reveals the unified mechanism unerlying terrestrial carbon storage dynamics to guide transient traceability analysis of global land models and synthesis of empirical studies.",

Hence, the estimation of soil moisture is very valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. Extensive efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex variable are ongoing. This study aims at developing a new index, the Thermal Ground cover Moisture Index (TGMI), for estimating soil moisture content. This index is based on empirical parameterization of the relationship between raw image digital count (DC) data in the thermal infrared spectral band and ground cover (determined from raw image digital count data in the red and near-infrared spectral bands).The index uses satellite-derived information only, and the potential for its operational application is therefore great. This study was conducted in 18 commercial agricultural fields near Lubbock, TX (USA). Soil moisture was measured in these fields over two years and statistically compared to corresponding values of TGMI determined from Landsat image data. Results indicate statistically significant correlations between TGMI and field measurements of soil moisture (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.05, MBE = 0.17 and AAE = 0.049), suggesting that soil moisture can be estimated using this index. It was further demonstrated that maps of TGMI developed from Landsat imagery could be constructed to show the relative spatial distribution of soil moisture across a region.",

We have updated the Zhu et al. Icarus 228, 301, 2014) model for Pluto’s atmosphere by adopting Voigt line profiles in the radiation code with the latest spectral database and extended the model to Triton’s atmosphere by including additional parameterized heating due to the magnetospheric electron energy deposition. Various numerical experiments have been conducted to investigate parameter sensitivities on the atmospheric escape rate for an icy planetary body similar to Pluto or Triton. It is found that the escape rate is sensitive to the planetary surface gravity due to a cumulative effect of the density variation with the altitude that significantly changes the atmospheric scale height at the exobase together with the exobase altitude. The atmospheric thermal structure near the exobase is sensitive to the atmospheric escape rate only when it is significantly greater than 1.0e26 molecules per second above which an enhanced escape rate induced by various diabatic energy sources leads to a stronger radial velocity that adiabatically cools the atmosphere to a lower temperature.",

            "abstract": "Semi-arid shrublands of the Intermountain West have been identified as potential carbon (C) sinks, contingent on precipitation amount and timing. To date, there is a dearth of long-term, manipulative studies that have quantified the effects of altered precipitation amount and seasonality on aboveground C storage and turnover. We measured aboveground C pools and fluxes at leaf, soil, and ecosystem scales during the 2014 growing season, at a 21-year ecohydrological experiment site in Idaho, USA (a cold desert ecosystem). At this experiment, winter- and summer-only irrigations (200 mm for each treatment) have been applied to plots to supplement ambient precipitation, since 1993. We hypothesized that increases in winter precipitation would stimulate net aboveground C uptake and storage relative to ambient and increased summertime precipitation regimes. Our hypothesis was generally supported. Midday net ecosystem exchange in winter-irrigated and summer-irrigated plots was nearly 4X greater than in control plots, although the seasonal timing of peak fluxes was different between these treatments. Similarly, cumulative-seasonal net ecosystem exchange was about 4X greater in irrigated plots relative to control plots, although the seasonal patterns of net C uptake differed. We observed no differences in leaf-level photosynthesis among treatments. Midday and evening soil respiration were often 3X greater in summer-irrigated plots compared to control plots throughout much of the growing season. Soil respiration in winter-irrigated plots was only slightly greater than in control plots. Aboveground biomass in winter-irrigated plots was 2X that in control plots, and biomass in summer-irrigated plots was only modestly different from control plots. Most of the long-term increases in biomass were due to increased shrub cover and size, but not shrub density (# individuals/m2). Our findings suggest that expected increases in wintertime precipitation in western North America could result in increased aboveground C uptake and storage in shrubland communities in cold deserts ecosystems. Soil respiration appears to be the component of aboveground C flux most responsive to changes in precipitation seasonality. Environmental factors regulating soil respiration might be key to net C balance in semi-arid ecosystems.",

            "abstract": " With an automated cloud tracking algorithm, we have analysed the propagation of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over Indian region in the boreal summer monsoon season (June-September). We used half hourly infrared images of a geostationary satellite KALPANA-I for the study. The data covers four monsoon seasons (2010,12,13,and 14). \nMesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over the Indian land show a prominent westward propagation, which is opposite to the lower tropospheric monsoonal westerlies. The mechanism associated with these propagations seems robust, i.e. it appears in all the events. The propagation seems to be a result of internal dynamics of MCS, and not forced by any external agent. The mechanism is prevalent through out the monsoon season, but absent in pre- and post-monsoon season. The zonal convective streaks associated with the large MCSs have a spatial and temporal scales of 1000 km and 1 day respectively, with a westward speed of 18 m/s. These streaks resemble the westward propagating inertial-gravity (WIG) type of wave propagation. Thus, we speculate that, the MCSs over India in the summer monsoon season trigger WIG waves. And the subsequent propagation of MCS is coupled to this wave signal. Most of the large MCSs are associated with the synoptic scale monsoon depressions. \nMean propagation of MCSs over Bay of Bengal (BoB) is of more complex nature. There seems to be more than one propagation mechanism which are active over BoB in the summer monsoon season. The selection of propagation mechanism by the BoB MCSs might depend on the phase of diurnal cycle or intra-seasonal oscillation, MCS size, and its location over the bay. ",

Cellulosic biomarkers, and bulk tissue of leaf, litter, and soil organic matter have been analyzed for specific stable isotope ratios of oxygen and carbon to examine causal links between plant to ecosystem scale productivity and water balance. A series of latitudinal and altitudinal transects established across the California Sierra Nevada was used to study the effects of climatic and edaphic gradients on the formation and preservation of these plant isotopic signals. Changes in plant-soil-atmosphere relations are related to productivity and water use efficiency in an attempt to elucidate how plant material reflects ecosystem scale processes in response to variation in climate and soil properties. The use of a dual isotopic approach constrains the role of environmental variables on stable isotope values, allowing for nutritive vs hydrologic limitations over water use efficiency to be assessed.

The rate of SLR is accelerated in recent decades and is expected to increase based on current trajectories of anthropogenic activities and greenhouse gas emissions. Over the 20th century, an increase in the frequency of nuisance (minor) flooding has been reported due to the reduced gap between tidal datum and flood stage. Nuisance flooding (NF), however non-destructive, causes public inconvenience, business interruption, and substantial economic losses due to impacts such as road closures and degradation of infrastructure. It also portends an increased risk in severe floods. Here we report substantial increases in NF along the coasts of United States due to SLR over the past decades. We then take the projected SLR under the least and the most extreme representative concentration pathways (e.gRCP2.6 and RCP 8.5) to estimate the increase in NF in the near- (2030) and mid-term (2050) future. The results suggest that projected SLR will cause up to two-fold more frequent NF by 2050, compared with the 20th century. The projected increase in NF will have significant socio-economic impacts and pose public health risks especially in rapidly urbanized coastal regions.",

            "abstract": "The field of ecology has become a big-data science in the past decades due to development of new sensors used in numerous studies in the ecological community. Many sensor networks have been established to collect data. For example, satellites, such as Terra and OCO-2 among others, have collected data relevant on global carbon cycle. Thousands of field manipulative experiments have been conducted to examine feedback of terrestrial carbon cycle to global changes. Networks of observations, such as FLUXNET, have measured land processes. In particular, the implementation of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which is designed to network different kinds of sensors at many locations over the nation, will generate large volumes of ecological data every day. The raw data from sensors from those networks offer an unprecedented opportunity for accelerating advances in our knowledge of ecological processes, educating teachers and students, supporting decision-making, testing ecological theory, and forecasting changes in ecosystem services.\nCurrently, ecologists do not have the infrastructure in place to synthesize massive yet heterogeneous data into resources for decision support. It is urgent to develop an ecological forecasting system that can make the best use of multiple sources of data to assess long-term biosphere change and anticipate future states of ecosystem services at regional and continental scales.\nForecasting relies on big models that describe major processes that underlie complex system dynamics. Ecological system models, despite great simplification of the real systems, are still complex in order to address real-world problems. For example, Community Land Model (CLM) incorporates thousands of processes related to energy balance, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. Integration of massive data from multiple big data sources with complex models has to tackle Big Data-Big Model (BDBM) challenges. Those challenges include interoperability of multiple, heterogeneous data sets; intractability of structural complexity of big models; equifinality of model structure selection and parameter estimation; and computational demand of global optimization with Big Models.",

However, the impacts of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on meteorological droughts and precipitation patterns are not well understood. In this study, we used historical runs of CMIP5 simulations under pre-industrial and industrial forcings. The two forcings represent rainfall, excluding and including anthropogenic CO2 emissions, respectively. The pre-industrial and current climate simulations are analyzed and compared using a series of techniques including entropy and Wavelet transform.

The Xin’anjiang(XAJ) model is a conceptually-based model which was developed on the basis of conception of hillslope hydrology. As the key model parameter, the tension water capacity has rigid physical definitions which in principal can be estimated by watershed characteristics. Due to the limitation of previous knowledge and data, the tension water capacity was determined mainly by calibration with complete high-quality data, which hinders the application of XAJ model in the ungauged watershed and the development in the distributed direction, so it’s necessary to do some study on parameters estimation. In this study, we first investigated the three quantitative approaches to estimate the thickness of unsaturated zone based on topographic features, soil characteristics and vegetation cover, respectively. We employed derived unsaturated zone thickness together with other underlying surface characteristics to investigate the tension water capacity estimation. Our results shows that the overall performance of the XAJ model is more stable and robust than that of the calibration, and more suitable to be applied in the ungauged catchments.",

We primarily focus on Summer events in each hemisphere when the polar regions are sunlit. During northward IMF the magnetic reconnection regions can form tailward of the magnetic cusp. Using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F13, F15 and F16 spacecraft we looked for and found areas of strong Poynting flux over the magnetic polar cap regions. Values ranging from 20 mW/m^2 to 140 mW/m^2 were measured in narrow channels, showing that there can be significant energy transport to small concentrated regions at very high latitudes. An example of an event from 2001 is shown in the attached image. We also show where these events occur with respect to the dynamic polar cap boundary and discuss the implications of this extreme Poynting flux for other aspects of polar thermodynamics and electrodynamics.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are replete with mystery and rife with hazard. Along most of the Pacific Northwest margin, the traditional methods of monitoring offshore geophysical activity use onshore sensors or involve conducting infrequent oceanographic expeditions. This results in a limited capacity for detecting and monitoring subduction processes offshore. We propose that the next step in geophysical observations of Cascadia should include real-time data delivered by a seafloor cable with seismic, geodetic, and pressure-sensing instruments.\nAlong the Cascadia subduction zone, we need to monitor deformation, earthquakes, and fluid fluxes on short time scales. High-quality long-term time series are needed to establish baseline observations and evaluate secular changes in the subduction environment. Currently we lack a basic knowledge of the plate convergence rate, direction and its variations along strike and of how convergence is accommodated across the plate boundary. We also would like to seek cycles of microseismicity, how far locking extends up-dip, and the transient processes (i.e., fluid pulsing, tremor, and slow slip) that occur near the trench.\nFor reducing risk to society, real-time monitoring has great benefit for immediate and accurate assessment through earthquake early warning systems. Specifically, the improvement to early warning would be in assessing the location, geometry, and progression of ongoing faulting and obtaining an accurate tsunami warning, as well as simply speeding up the early warning. It would also be valuable to detect strain transients and map the locked portion of the megathrust, and detect changes in locking over the earthquake cycle.\nDevelopment of the US portion of a real-time cabled seismic and geodetic observatory should build upon the Ocean Observatories Initiative’s cabled array, which was recently completed and is currently delivering continuous seismic and pressure data from the seafloor. Its implementation would require substantial initial and ongoing investments from federal and state governments, private partners and the academic community but would constitute a critical resource in mitigating the hazard both through improved earthquake and tsunami warning and an enhanced scientific understanding of subduction processes in Cascadia.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 Mw7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake occurred southwest of the Pacific-North America plate boundary in north Baja California. It was preceded by an intensive foreshock sequence, and was followed by numerous aftershocks both on and off the mainshock rupture zone, hence providing us a great opportunity to study the physical mechanisms of foreshock and aftershock triggering. In our previously published work (Meng and Peng, GJI, 2014), we focused on the seismicity rate changes around the Salton Sea Geothermal Field (SSGF) and along the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) following the mainshock. Based on a recently developed matched filter technique, we were able to detect up to 20 times more events than listed in the SCSN catalog. We found that the seismicity rate near SSGF and SJF both experienced significant increase immediately following the mainshock. However, the seismicity rate near SSGF, where static Coulomb stress decreased, dropped below the pre-mainshock level after ~50 days. On the other hand, the seismicity rate near SJF, where static Coulomb stress increased, remained high till the end of our detecting time window. Such pattern indicates that both static and dynamic triggering may coexist, but dominate in different time scales. Motivated by this success, we shift our focus to the foreshock and aftershock sequence of the El Mayor-Cucapah event. We utilize available seismic stations immediately north to US-Mexico boarder and a few stations within Mexico to conduct a similar detection ~40 days before to 40 days after the mainshock. We aim to obtain a complete foreshock sequence and investigate its spatio-temporal evolutions before the mainshock. Moreover, we plan to study similar patterns for aftershocks and the corresponding triggering mechanisms. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The interfacial area between immiscible fluids in porous media has been demonstrated to be a critical entity for improved understanding, characterization, and simulation of multiphase flow and mass transport in the subsurface. Two general methods are available for measuring interfacial areas for 3-D porous-media systems, high-resolution microtomographic imaging and interfacial partitioning tracer tests (IPTT). Each method has their associated advantages and disadvantages. A few prior research efforts have conducted comparative analyses of the two methods, which have generally indicated disparities in measured values for natural geomedia. For these studies, however, interfacial areas were measured for separate samples with each method due to method restrictions. Thus, to date, there has been no comparative analysis conducted wherein the two measurement methods were applied to the exact same sample. To address this issue, trichloroethene-water interfacial areas were measured for a system comprising a well-sorted, natural sand (median grain diameter of 0.323 mm) using both X-ray microtomography and IPTTs. The microtomographic imaging was conducted on the same packed columns used to conduct the IPTTs. Columns were imaged before and after the IPTTs to evaluate potential impacts of the tracer tests on fluid configuration. The interfacial areas measured using IPTT were 4-6 times larger than the microtomography results, which is consistent with previous work. This disparity was attributed to the inability of the microtomography method to characterize interfacial area associated with microscopic surface roughness. The results indicate that both methods provide useful measures of interfacial area as long as their limitations are recognized.",

            "abstract": "Unpaved roads are a major hydrologic disturbance and source of sediment in forested watersheds. High- and moderate-severity wildfires should increase road sediment production due to the increased surface runoff from upslope, and increase road-stream connectivity due to the increased runoff and decrease in downslope surface roughness, but there has been no study of these interactions. Hence the goal of this study was to quantify how fire severity affects road surface erosion features and road-stream connectivity. Detailed data were collected one year after the High Park wildfire along 6.8 km of an unpaved road west of Fort Collins, Colorado. Road segments below areas burned at high and moderate severity had significantly more rills than segments below areas burned at low severity. Road segment slope was an increasingly important control on the proportion of segment length with rills with increasing burn severity, and this is consistent with the known increases in surface runoff. Flatter road segments acted as barriers that accumulated sediment eroded from the hillslopes above the road. All of the road segments in areas burned at high and moderate severity had drainage features that extended to a stream, and 78% of the segments in areas burned at low severity were connected. These exceptionally high rates of road-stream connectivity are attributed to the increased runoff from upslope, the concentration of that runoff by the road surface to a single drainage point, and the reduced infiltration and trapping capacity of the burned area below the road. The results show the need to either outslope the roads or increase the frequency of constructed drainage features after wildfires, particularly for the steeper road segments in areas burned at high or moderate severity.",

            "abstract": "The highest densities of the radioisotopes in fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP in March 2011 were measured at the north eastern part of Fukushima Prefecture. The post-accidental aquatic transfer of cesium -134/137 includes multiscale processes: wash-off from the watersheds in solute and with the eroded soil, long-range transport in the rivers, deposition and resuspension of contaminated sediments in reservoirs and floodplains. The models of EU decision support system RODOS are used for predicting dynamics of 137Cs in the Fukushima surface waters and for assessing efficiency of the remediation measures. The transfer of 137Cs through the watershed of Niida River was simulated by DHSVM –R model that includes the modified code of the distributed hydrological and sediment transport model DHSVM (Lettenmayer, Wigmosta et al.) and new module of radionuclide transport. DHSMV-R was tested by modelling the wash-off from the USLE experimental plots in Fukushima prefecture. The model helps to quantify the influence of the differentiators of Fukushima and Chernobyl watersheds, - intensity of extreme precipitation and steepness of watershed, on the much higher values of the ratio “particulated cesium /soluted cesium” in Fukushima rivers than in Chernobyl rivers. Two dimensional model COASTOX and three dimensional model THREETOX are used to simulate the fate of 137Cs in water and sediments of reservoirs in the Manogawa River, Otagawa River, Mizunashigawa River, which transport 137Cs from the heavy contaminated watersheds to the populated areas at the Pacific coast. The modeling of the extreme floods generated by typhoons shows the resuspension of the bottom sediments from the heavy contaminated areas in reservoirs at the mouths of inflowing rivers at the peaks of floods and then re-deposition of 137Cs downstream in the deeper areas. The forecasts of 137Cs dynamics in bottom sediments of the reservoirs were calculated for the set of the scenarios of the sequences of the high floods of the next years. MOIRA –LAKE model of long term radioisotopes transfer in water, bottom sediment and fish was used for the assessments of the efficiency of the bottom sediment dredging for the remediation of the irrigation ponds at Okuma town.",

            "abstract": "Geochronology and thermochronology using multiple mineral-isotopic chronometers reveals the thermo-tectonic history of the central Tianshan (NW China) from emplacement to exhumation. Granites from the central Tianshan, which are associated with the southward subduction of the northern Tianshan Ocean, have been dated at 362–354 Ma using the LA–ICP–MS Zircon U–Pb method. A younger diorite sample (282 ± 1 Ma, Zircon U–Pb method by LA–ICP–MS) from northern Tianshan formed during the final closure of the Northern Tianshan Ocean when the Junggar Block collided with the Yili–Central Tianshan Block. 40Ar/39Ar step–wise heating plateau dates (biotite Ar/Ar: 312–293 Ma; Plagioclase Ar/Ar: 270–229 Ma) from the Central Tianshan show rapid post-magmatic cooling during the Late Carboniferous–Early Permian followed by a more modest rate of cooling from the middle Permian to the middle Jurassic. The northern Tianshan diorite (biotite Ar/Ar: 240 ± 1 Ma) also reveals a middle Jurassic cooling. Apatite (U–Th )/He dates from the central Tianshan samples range from ca. 130 Ma to ca. 116 Ma. The Apatite (U–Th )/He date for the northern Tianshan sample is ca. 27 Ma. Previous studies also reported Apatite (U–Th)/He ages of ca. 44 Ma–11 Ma in the Baluntai area of the southern Central Tianshan[1]. Two episodes of cooling are distinguished by thermal history modelling: (1) Mesozoic cooling occurred as the result of the exhumation and tectonic reactivation of the central Tianshan; and (2) The Tianshan orogenic belt has been rapidly exhumed since the Middle Cenozoic.\n",

            "abstract": "The energy transported by the oceans to mid- and high latitudes is small compared to the atmosphere, yet exerts an outsized influence on the climate. A key reason is the strong interaction between ocean heat transport (OHT) and sea ice extent. I quantify this by comparing a realistic control climate simulation with a slab ocean simulation in which OHT is disabled. Using the state-of-the-art CESM with a realistic present-day continental configuration, I show that the absence of OHT leads to a 23 K global cooling and massive expansion of sea ice to near 30º latitude in both hemisphere. The ice expansion is asymmetric, with greatest extent in the South Pacific and South Indian ocean basins. I discuss implications of this enormous and asymmetric climate change for atmospheric circulation, heat transport, and tropical precipitation. Parameter sensitivity studies show that the simulated climate is far more sensitive to small changes in ice surface albedo in the absence of OHT, with some perturbations sufficient to cause a runaway Snowball Earth glaciation. I conclude that the oceans are responsible for an enormous global warming by mitigating an otherwise very potent sea ice albedo feedback, but that the magnitude of this effect is still rather uncertain. I will also present some ideas on adapting the simple energy balance model to account for the enhanced sensitivity of sea ice to heating from the ocean.",

            "abstract": "This research provided the first documented assessment of the dynamics of rock glaciers in Southern Carpathian Mountains over almost half a century (1968-2014). The dynamics of four representative rock glaciers were assessed using complementary satellite-based optical and radar remote sensing techniques.\nWe investigated the dynamics of the area using co-rectification of paired optical satellite datasets acquired by SPOT5, WV-1, Pléiades, and Corona to estimate short term (7 years) and longer term changes (44 years). Accurately rectifying and co-registering Corona KH-4B imagery allowed us to expand the time horizon over which changes in this alpine environment could be analyzed. The displacements revealed by this analysis correlate with variations in local slope of the rock glaciers, and presence or absence of permafrost. For radar analysis, nine ascending ALOS-1 PALSAR images were used based clear sky and absence of snow groundcover (i.e. June–October). Although decorrelation limits the ability to perform quantitative InSAR analyses, loss of coherence was useful in detecting subtle changes in active rock glacier environments, as well as other mass movements including rock falls, rock avalanches, debris flows, creep of permafrost, and solifluction. Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR analysis successfully quantified rates of change for unstable areas.\nThe results of this investigation, although based on limited archived imagery, demonstrate that correlation analysis, coherence analysis, and multitemporal InSAR techniques can yield useful information for detecting creeping permafrost in a complex mountain environment, such as Retezat Mountains. Our analyses showed that rock glaciers in the Southern Carpathian Mountains are experiencing very slow annual movement of only a few cm per year. Results of the remote sensing analyses are consistent with field observations of permafrost occurrence at these sites (for more, please see Abstract ID# 68413). The combined optical/radar approach can be widely applicable to other regions where information on glacier rock dynamics is scarce or completely absent, with wider implications for understanding the effects of climate change on rock glaciers around the world.",

            "abstract": "Pluvial flooding from highly localised extreme rainfall, commonly occurring over relatively short durations, causes significant damage across the UK annually. Our ability to simulate such events and provide robust flood predictions is hampered by a lack of reliable sub-daily rainfall products and effective techniques to quantify the non-stationary error within them. These issues could lead to type 1 and type 2 errors when trying to identify useful model simulation tools within a rejectionist framework. Uncertainties will then propagate non-linearly through rainfall-runoff simulations to inundation predictions. Therefore it is vital to understand where the uncertainties are greatest in such a model simulation cascade and how they impact flood predictions in order to direct future research.\nWe consider the impact of rainfall errors on flood predictions using a new gridded sub-daily (hourly) rainfall record for the UK from 1993 to 2011 from a network of tipping bucket data. We improve upon currently available daily gridded datasets, in order to provide a more suitable rainfall record with which to model flooding from intense storm events. We attempt to quantify the most influential sources of uncertainty within the gridded product in order to provide an ensemble of rain-field realisations with which to force a coupled hydrological – hydrodynamic model for the representation of flash flooding at regional scales.\nHere we present the results from a test case in order to demonstrate the degree to which uncertainty in the sub-daily gridded rainfall product propagates through the modelling framework to influence the prediction of flooding over a variety of events. The results will provide an insight into the uncertainty in estimating catchment area rainfall, and its influence on our ability to predict flooding from intense storm events and avoid type 1 and type 2 errors.",

            "abstract": "Lowland boreal forest ecosystems in Alaska are dominated by wetlands comprised of a complex mosaic of fens, collapse scar-bogs, low shrub/scrub, and forests growing on elevated ice rich permafrost soils. Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within ~0.5o C of thawing. Increases in the collapse of lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60 years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998 and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30x30 m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, respectively. Gradient boosting and regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950-2009 landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of ~15 km² of birch forest area to wetlands on the Tanana Flats, where the greatest change followed warm periods. This work highlights the vulnerability of lowland ice-rich permafrost ecosystems to recent and ongoing climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Chinese Loess Plateau contains red clay sequence which has continuous alternation of sedimentary cycles with recurrent paleoclimatic fluctuations. Absence of abundant fossils and inability of radiometric dating method made magnetostratigraphy a leading method to build age model for the red clay. Here magnetostratigraphic age model in red clay sequence is tested using cyclostratigraphy as orbital parameters of Earth are known. Milankovitch periodicities recorded in magnetic susceptibility and grain size in the Shilou red clay section are investigated and previously found age of 11 Ma for this section is re-evaluated. Magnetostratigraphy dating based on only visual correlation could potentially lead to erroneous age model. In this study the correlation is executed through the iteration procedure until it is supported by cyclostratigraphy; i.e. Milankovitch cycles are resolved in the best possible manner. Our new approach provides an age of 5.2 Ma for the Shilou profile. Wavelet analysis reveals that a 400 kyr eccentricity cycle is well preserved and the existence of a 100 kyr eccentricity in the red clay sequence on the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau suggests that eccentricity plays a vital role in Pliocene climate evolution. Paleomonsoon evolution is reconstructed and divided into three intervals (5.2-4.5 Ma, 4.5-3.6 Ma and 3.6-2.58 Ma). The earliest stage indicates that summer and winter monsoon cycles may rapidly alter, whereas the middle stage reflects an intensification of winter monsoon and aridification in Asia, and the youngest stage is characterized by relatively intensified summer monsoon. This study demonstrates that cyclostratigraphy can greatly assist magnetostratigraphy in dating the red clay sequences, and implies that many published age models for the red clay sequences should likely be re-assessed where possible. An evaluation of the monsoon system and climate change in eastern Asia might prominently benefit from this approach.",

            "abstract": "The Asian monsoon region is the most prominent moist center of lower stratospheric (LS) water vapor during boreal summer. However, the origin of such moist air is still unclear. Using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite observations and a domain-filling forward trajectory model, we show that moist air originates mostly from the western Asian Monsoon region where dehydration temperatures are warmer than those on the eastside of the Asian monsoon region. On seasonal scale, a shift of convective and dehydration center from the eastern to western monsoon region from early to late summer may contribute to the increase of LS water vapor over the Asian monsoon region. An increasing convection over the west side of the monsoon region can significantly moisten the LS. Air detrained from convection ascends with enhanced large-scale rising motion and dehydrate mostly within this region under warmer temperature, thus anomalously higher water vapor concentration. After final dehydration, water vapor anomalies show an upper-eastward propagation across the Asian monsoon region. This is primarily due to that air parcels tend to arise across the tropopause layer over the western region (eastern Iranian Plateau and northwestern India) after final dehydration as simulated by the trajectory model. This work highlights the importance of transport pathway shift, induced by the convective regime shift, on both seasonal and intraseasonal variations of water vapor in the Asian monsoon LS.",

            "abstract": "Eutrophication is a widespread problem affecting the structure and function of estuaries and is often linked to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment, since N is the primary nutrient limiting algal production. Watershed management actions typically have ignored dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) loading because of its perceived refractory nature and instead focused on inorganic N as targets for loading reductions. A fluorescence-based model indicated that anthropogenic sources of DON near the head of the microtidal Neuse River Estuary (NRE), NC were dominated by septic systems and poultry waste. A series of bioassays were used to determine the bioavailability of river DON and DON-rich sources to primary producers and whether those additions promoted the growth of certain phytoplankton taxa, particularly harmful species. Overall, at time scales up to two to three weeks, estuarine phytoplankton and bacteria only showed limited responses to additions of high molecular weight (HMW, >1 kDa) river DON. When increases in productivity and biomass did occur, they were quite small compared with the response to inorganic N. Low molecular weight (LMW) river DON, waste water treatment plant effluent, and poultry litter extract did have a positive effect on phytoplankton and bacterial production, indicating a bioavailable fraction. High variability of bulk DON concentration suggested that bioavailable compounds added in the experimental treatments were low in concentration and turned over quite rapidly. Some phytoplankton taxa, as measured by diagnostic photopigments, appeared to be selectively enhanced by the HMW and specific source DON additions, although the taxa could not be positively identified as harmful species. Preliminary tests show that labile autochthonous organic matter may act as a primer for the mineralization of the HMW DON. These and other, longer-term bioavailability studies will be needed to adequately address the fate of watershed DON in estuarine ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf of Mexico is home to many species of deep diving marine mammals. In recent years several ecological studies have collected large volumes of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data to investigate the effects of anthropogenic activities on protected and endangered marine mammal species. To utilize these data to their fullest potential for abundance estimates and habitat preference studies, automated detection and classification algorithms are needed to extract species acoustic encounters from a continuous stream of data. The species which phonate in overlapping frequency bands represent a particular challenge. This paper analyzes the performance of a newly developed automated detector for the classification of beaked whale clicks in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Current used beaked whale classification algorithms rely heavily on experienced human operator involvement in manually associating potential events with a particular species of beaked whales. Our detection algorithm is two-stage: the detector is triggered when the species-representative phonation band energy exceeds the baseline detection threshold. Then multiple event attributes (temporal click duration, central frequency, frequency band, frequency sweep rate, Choi-Williams distribution shape indices) are measured. An attribute vector is then used to discriminate among different species of beaked whales present in the Gulf of Mexico and Risso’s dolphins which were recognized to mask the detections of beaked whales in the case of widely used energy-band detectors. The detector is applied to the PAM data collected by the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center to estimate abundance trends of beaked whales in the vicinity of the 2010 oil spill before and after the disaster. This algorithm will allow automated processing with minimal operator involvement for new and archival PAM data. [The research is supported by a BP/GOMRI 2015-2017 consortium grant.]",

            "abstract": "Southernmost South America is unique in its position immediately north of the present-day Antarctic Convergence, making it ideally suited for the evaluation of Antarctic influences on terrestrial paleoclimate. Here we present a glacial geomorphic interpretation of the paleoglacial history of Glaciar Dalla Vedova in Bahía Blanca, Cordillera Darwin, Chile (53°S). This interpretation is further constrained by radiocarbon dating, cosmogenic dating, dendrochronology, and historical photogrammetry. Preliminary field work suggests that Holocene glacier fluctuations have been constrained to within 3 km of the present glacier boundary, punctuated by rapid recent glacier retreat over the past century. By comparing the observed chronology with the record contained further north in Patagonia, we will evaluate possible mechanisms of regional climate variability over the Holocene across southernmost South America.",

            "abstract": "Snowpack dynamics and runoff generation in coastal mountain regions are complicated by rain-on-snow (ROS) events. During major ROS events associated with warm, moist air and strong winds, turbulent heat fluxes can produce substantial melt to supplement rainfall, but previous studies suggest this may not be true for smaller, more frequent events. The internal temperature and water content of the snowpack are also expected to influence runoff generation during ROS events: a cold snowpack with no liquid water content will have the ability to store significant amounts of rainfall, whereas a ‘ripe’ snowpack may begin to melt and generate outflow with little rain input. However, it is not well understood how antecedent snowpack conditions and energy fluxes differ between ROS events that cause large runoff events and those that do not, in large part because major flood-producing ROS events occur infrequently, and thus are often not sampled during short-term research projects. To generate greater understanding of runoff generation over the spectrum of ROS magnitudes and frequencies, we analyzed data from Automated Snow Pillow (ASP) sites, which record hourly air temperature, precipitation and snowpack water equivalent and offer up to several decades of data at each site. We supplemented the ASP data with output from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) product to support point scale snow modeling for 335 ROS event records from six ASP sites in southwestern BC from 2003 to 2013. Our analysis reconstructed the weather conditions, surface energy exchanges, internal mass and energy states of the snowpack, and generation of snow melt and water available for runoff (WAR) for each ROS event. Results indicate that WAR generation during large events is largely independent of the snowpack conditions, but for smaller events, the antecedent snow conditions play a significant role in either damping or enhancing WAR generation.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we assess seismic hazards in the 57 administration districts of Chianan area, Taiwan in the form of ShakeMaps as well as to estimate potential human fatalities from scenario earthquakes on the three Type I active faults in this area. As a result, it is noted that two regions with high MMI intensity greater than IX in the map of maximum ground motion. One is in the Chiayi area around Minsyong, Dalin and Meishan due to presence of the Meishan fault and large site amplification factors which can reach as high as 2.38 and 2.09 for PGA and PGV, respectively, in Minsyong. The other is in the Tainan area around Jiali, Madou, Siaying, Syuejia, Jiangjyun and Yanshuei due to a disastrous earthquake occurred near the border between Jiali and Madou with a magnitude of Mw 6.83 in 1862 and large site amplification factors which can reach as high as 2.89 and 2.97 for PGA and PGV, respectively, in Madou. In addition, the probabilities in 10, 30, and 50-year periods with seismic intensity exceeding MMII VIII in above areas are greater than 45%, 80％ and 95%, respectively. Moreover, from the distribution of probabilities, high values of greater than 95% over a 10 year period with seismic intensity corresponding to CWBI V and MMI VI are found in central and northern Chiayi and northern Tainan. At last, from estimation of human fatalities for scenario earthquakes on three active faults in Chianan area, it is noted that the numbers of fatalities increase rapidly for people above age 45. Compared to the 1946 Hsinhua earthquake, the number of fatality estimated from the scenario earthquake on the Hsinhua active fault is significantly high. However, the higher number of fatality in this case is reasonable after considering the probably reasons. Hence, we urge local and the central governments to pay special attention on seismic hazard mitigation in this highly urbanized area with large number of old buildings.",

            "abstract": "Among the many difficulties of tsunami forecast, wave runup on sloped beaches remains a major obstacle in numerical simulations. Traditional Eulerian models must adjust the fluid flow domain continuously due to the moving shorelines, which can significantly affect the computational cost and results accuracy. An efficient though uncommon alternative for accurate runup predictions still exists, consisting in using a Lagrangian model as recently shown by e.g. Couston et al. (2015) who studied the runup of landslide tsunamis in lakes with a non-dispersive Lagrangian model.\nHere we introduce a fully-nonlinear Boussinesq-type model derived in the Lagrangian framework to investigate various cases of long-wave runup on curved beaches and meandering channels. The governing equations are expressed in terms of curvilinear Lagrangian coordinates, making the model suitable for accurate runup computations at shorelines of arbitrary geometry while retaining the inherent simplicity of a physical model discretized on a fixed and structured grid. We implement an elliptic grid generation algorithm to map the physical space to the computational space, and a high-order finite-difference scheme for time integration. The numerical model has a linear complexity in the number of unknowns when neglecting dispersive effects. We show that the formation of edge waves due to the sloped banks of a wide channel has a significant influence on the capability of a meander or constriction in reflecting the intruding tsunami, and we investigate the effect of dispersion.\n",

In order to statistically determine the frequency of secondary islands at the magnetopause, crossings near reconnection sites at the dayside magnetopause by Cluster (Cluster 1, 3, and 4) from 2001 – 2009 are examined in search of these magnetic islands. Using the maximum magnetic shear model as a guide for the distance to the reconnection site, 29 magnetopause crossings within 1.5 RE of the predicted reconnection site are examined. The occurrence of encountering an island structure in the reconnection exhaust is analyzed as a function of magnetic shear angles and local plasma conditions to determine how the type of reconnection, anti-parallel or component, affects their formation.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography is a widely used geophysical method to remotely monitor water saturation and the migration of contaminant plumes. This is achieved by driving a known electrical current between an electrode pair while measuring the resulting voltage between another electrode pair. The electrical resistivity structure of the subsurface can be estimated by inversion of multiple current injection and voltage pairs. The effects of heterogeneous solute concentrations (i.e., fingering of a saline tracer) below the resolution limits of the tomogram are commonly ignored (i.e, the solution is assumed to be perfectly mixed below this scale). We have adapted an experimental set-up to study the effects of sub-resolution solute heterogeneities on the effective bulk electrical resistivity. We used a 2D analogous porous medium consisting of a Hele-Shaw cell containing a single layer of 4500 cylindrical solid grains built by soft lithography. We monitored the bulk electrical resistivity at a temporal resolution of 2 s. At the same time, we monitored the spatial distribution of the water/air phases and the saline solute concentration field in the water phase using a fluorescent tracer injected together with the saline solute and a high-resolution camera (27 pixels per mm, 12 bit images). We performed saline tracer tests under full and partial water saturations. The unsaturated flow was imposed by jointly injecting air and water. The bulk resistivities measured at the scale of the medium were confronted to resistivities computed numerically from the measured spatial distributions of the fluid phases and the salinity field. We find that the air distribution, saline tracer channeling and fingering, and mixing phenomena all result in large changes in the measured and simulated bulk resistivities by creating preferential flow paths or barriers for electric current at the pore scale. Based on these findings, we postulate that sub-resolution effects contribute to one of the most important inconsistencies in conventional time-lapse ERT imaging, namely the apparent loss of tracer mass.",

In this presentation we will examine the emissions and impact of black carbon and co-pollutants on the South American glacial region and describe some recent measurements associated with the PISAC (Pollution and its Impacts on the South American Cryosphere) Initiative. The Andes is the longest continental mountain range in the world, extending about 7000 km along western South America through seven countries with complex topography and covering several climate zones, diversity of ecosystems and communities. Air pollution associated with biomass burning and urban emissions affects extensive areas in the region and is a serious public health concern. Scientific evidence indicates that the Andean cryosphere is changing rapidly as snow fields and glaciers generally recede, leading to changes in stream flow and water quality along the Andes. The challenge is to identify the principal causes of the observed changes so that action can be taken to mitigate this negative trend. Despite the paucity of systematic observations along the Andes, a few modeling and observational studies have indicated the presence of black carbon in the high Andes, with potentially significant impact on the Andean cryosphere.",

            "abstract": "Permeability heterogeneity has been found to significantly affect the volume and speed with which water flows through the hyporheic zone. In this study we investigated how characteristics of spatial permeability distributions within a simple Tóthian system affected hyporheic flow both in physical and simulated domains. Our setup consisted of a 13x7x1 grid of two sediments with a divide bisecting the surface water and top middle cell creating two regions of constant head, which induced flow through the grid. Cells were filled with sand and sandy-gravel in a 2:1 ratio and positioned according to TProGS outputs. We ran a blue dye and salt solution through the system, recorded dye location using time-lapse photography, and measured the electrolytic conductivity as the water exited the system. We also calculated a grid of head values using MODFLOW and simulated flow through the system, yielding simulated dye-fronts, residence times, and exiting salt concentrations for the modeled system. We found strong agreement between the simulation and experimental procedure. We generated an additional 100 grids with the 2:1 sediment ratio for each of the transition probabilities 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0. We simulated these with 1, 2, and 3 order of magnitude differences in permeability values and used moving averages with varying window sizes to investigate the effect of the abruptness of transitions between sediment types. For these cases we compared cumulative residence time distributions, volumetric flux, and deviation from the normalized velocity field for homogenous sediment. We found that smoothing the transition between grid cells increased the volumetric flux, decreased the median residence times, and increased the deviation from a normalized homogenous velocity field. These effects were generally greater on grids created with larger transition probabilities and greater differences in K values.",

            "abstract": "Here we consider how mentoring, both traditional and peer based, contributes to successful student outcomes in undergraduate research programs and we present several approaches to encourage positive mentor-mentee relationships. From several different research mentoring programs with undergraduates in Maryland and in Puerto Rico, we find that some mentoring techniques are universally useful, while others need to be tailored to a specific program and mentee population. Our programs differ in length, student composition, and student expectations, we find that success occurs across-the-board when mentors quickly establish rapport with their students and reach an early joint understanding of the program’s requirements and the students’ capabilities and needs through immersive orientations early in the program. Alternatively, mentors have to customize their approaches (e.g. simplify presentations of concepts, increase time for questions) when they encounter differences in student knowledge levels and cultural disconnects (e.g. language barriers, unfamiliarity with research labs and academia). Our current approach to improving and evaluating mentoring includes using a system of multiple mentor tiers (peer, near-peer, faculty, and program leaders), multiple qualitative and quantitative evaluations during the program, and post-research experience student outreach, all of which we believe improve student outcomes. Although we have measures of mentee success (e.g., presenting at national meetings, pursuing additional research experiences, applying to graduate school in marine science-related fields, etc.), we continue to look for additional short and long-term evaluation techniques that may help us to distinguish between the influence of mentoring and that of other program attributes (e.g. lab and field experiences, professional development seminars, ethics training, etc.) on student achievement.",

            "abstract": "Depth profiles of Δ14C found in peat bogs are similar across latitudes. Solid peat radiocarbon ages increase with depth, young or modern DOC is found in porewater at all depths, and dissolved methane has an intermediate age. Using traditional mixing models, this pattern has been explained as methane produced from roughly half peat and half DOC. However, these models do not account for the advection and diffusion of dissolved gases, which plays an important role in peatlands. We develop a model that includes these transport pathways and individually models 12C, 13C and 14C during the transformation and transport of DOC, DIC, and methane. We test the model against existing data from several field sites, in bogs as disparate as the Glacial Lake Aggasiz Peatlands and Brunei Darussalam. Our model suggests that in bogs with typical Δ14C profiles, where the methane age is intermediate between that of peat and DOC, DOC advected from the surface does not contribute significantly to methane production. Instead, peat decomposition is the primary carbon source. The younger apparent ages of methane compared to peat at the same depth result from vertical advection of the dissolved gases, rather than consumption of DOC for methanogenesis. This is consistent with the finding that DOC found in these bogs is recalcitrant. The model reproduces vertical patterns of DOC, DIC and methane found in both tropical peatlands and northern bogs, emphasizing the similarities in hydrological and geochemical processes across latitudes.",

Furthermore, recent investigations show that ENSO-related changes in tropospheric water vapor and rainfall drive extraordinary changes in the temperature and wind structure in the middle atmosphere, through the modification of the spectrum of atmospheric tides.

            "abstract": "The Great Basin, USA, contains hundreds of small to large mountain ranges. Many reach alpine elevations, which are separated from each other by low-elevation basins currently inhospitable to conifer growth. Many of these ranges support montane and subalpine conifer species that have affinities to the Sierra Nevada or Rocky Mountains, and from which these conifers migrated during cool periods of the Pleistocene. Under Holocene climates, the Great Basin geography became a terrestrial island-archipelago, wherein conifer populations are isolated among ranges, and inter-range migration is highly limited. During warm intervals of the Holocene, conifers would be expected to have migrated upslope following favorable conditions, and extirpation would be assumed to result from continued warming. Independent patterns, repeating across multiple species’ distributions, however, suggest that refugia were present in these ranges during warm periods, and that low elevation environments below the current main distributions acted as climatic refugia. We hypothesize that cool, narrow, and north-aspect ravines, which during cool climates support persistent or seasonal creeks and deciduous riparian communities, become available as conifer habitat when warming climates desiccate creeks and deplete riparian species. We further speculate that cold-air drainage, reduced solar insolation, lower wind exposure, and higher water tables in these topographic positions support populations of montane and subalpine conifers even during warm climate intervals when high elevations are unfavorable for conifer persistence. On return to cool climates, low elevation refugia become sources for recolonizing higher slopes, and/or continue to persist as relictual populations. We present several lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis, and speculate that low-elevation, extramarginal riparian environments might act as climate refugia for Great Basin conifers in the future as well.",

In this presentation, we discuss the challenges associated with automating the analysis of converted waves and the potential of the resulting data products to be used in novel imaging approaches. With regards to automation, we address in particular the search for an optimal deconvolution method in receiver function analysis. To do so, we carry out a systematic comparison of various commonly used deconvolution methods and find that all methods produce equally robust receiver functions provided that a suitable regularization parameter is found. We further note that a suitable regularization can be found objectively for most approaches, thus challenging the belief that only time-domain deconvolution is a viable option for receiver function automation. With regards to imaging applications, we investigate how the resulting global database of receiver functions will be amenable to existing processing approaches as well as new approaches adapted from seismic exploration, including industry-based interpretation tools.",

            "abstract": "The development of remote sensing techniques in the last several decades now permits surveying areas that are difficult to access and allows capturing geomorphological processes that operate at low deformation rates. In marginal periglacial environments, where the kinematics of the rock glaciers are defined by slow flow, specific remote sensing techniques (e.g., optical image cross-correlation techniques or multitemporal interferometry) are preferred because they are capable of providing ground displacement accuracies on the order of a few mm.\nRecent multi-temporal image analysis of high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery of the Retezat Mountains (in the southern Carpathian Mountains of Romania) rock glaciers revealed very low rates of deformation and confirmed that active rock glaciers still exist here. These findings were supported by geophysical investigations (electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar) and thermal monitoring, which confirmed the patchy distribution of permafrost within the investigated rock glaciers. Given the high depth of the active layer (between 5 and 10 m) and the limited thickness of the ground ice bodies, the permafrost in the Retezat Mountains was assumed to exist in marginal conditions. The sporadic permafrost from the alpine zone of the southern Carpathians is extremely sensitive to environmental changes and responds directly to air temperature fluctuations. As an example, geophysical investigations between 2007 and 2014 revealed significant ground ice disappearance from one of the studied rock glaciers (i.e., Pietrele) as a result of rising air temperature. Optical satellite data revealed that the disappearance of ground ice led to accelerated movement of this rock glacier after 2007. The variability of horizontal movement is strongly controlled by the ground thermal regime. The results confirm the hypothesis that permafrost is not in equilibrium with the present-day climate in the Romanian Carpathians and will probably disappear completely in the next few decades.",

The ~140 km long SMF is separated into four segments, we focus on the multi-stranded, ~60 km long Central Sierra Madre fault (CSMF; W118.3-W117.7) as it lacks a well-characterized long-term geologic slip rate. We combine 1-m lidar DEM with geologic and geomorphic mapping to correlate alluvial fan surfaces along strike and across the fault strands in order to derive fault slip rates that cross the CSMF. We have refined mapping on two sets of terraces described by Crook et al. (1987) and references therein: a flight of Q3 surfaces (after nomenclature of Crook et al., 1987; McFadden, 1982) in Arroyo Seco with distinct terraces ~30 m, ~40 m, ~50 m, and ~55 m above the modern stream and in Pickens Canyon divided a Q3 and Q2 surface, with heights that are ~35 m and ~25 m above the modern stream respectively. Relative degree of clast weathering and soil development is consistent with geomorphic relationships; for example, hues of 7.5 YR to 10 YR are typical of Q3, while hues of 10 YR to 2.5 Y are typical of Q2. A scarp in the Q3 surface at Arroyo Seco has a vertical offset of ~16 m and a scarp in the Q3 at Pickens Canyon has a vertical offset of ~14 m, while the Q2 surface is not faulted. Our Quaternary dating strategy is focused on dating suites of terraces offset along CSMF scarps in order to provide broader stratigraphic context for the cosmogenic radionuclide and luminescence dating. We will present (pending) cosmogenic radionuclide depth profiles from the Q3 surfaces. A better-constrained slip rate for the CSMF will improve earthquake hazard assessment for the Los Angeles area and help clarify the tectonic role of the SMF in the broader plate boundary system. Additionally, the fan chronology will provide information about the timing of alluvial fan aggradation and incision in the western Transverse Ranges.",

Our analysis shows that ozone builds up with the length of stagnation events over all regions of the U.S., but the length of time between cyclones is only associated with a buildup of high ozone over the Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S. Ozone does not build up with the length of high temperature events over any region of the U.S. The correlation between high temperature and high ozone is the largest over the Northeastern U.S.",

The geobarometer utilizes rhyolite-MELTS to determine crystallization conditions utilizing the glass compositions coexisting with the POC assemblage in natural samples.\nPOC stability is strongly affected by water content and oxygen fugacity (fO2). We tested fO2 values ranging from +1 to +4 delta-QFM, which spans the fO2 range of intermediate magmas. Water content was tested from water-saturated to 4 wt% below saturation.\nThe geobarometer was applied to two intermediate POC-bearing systems – Mount Ruapehu in the southern Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, and the Palmas unit of the Serra Geral Formation in the Paraná Volcanics, Brazil. Both systems were tested from 25 MPa to 400 MPa and from 700 ºC to 1200 ºC.\nRuapehu is an active, structurally well-understood volcano in the Taupo Volcanic Zone; it serves as a methodological testing ground for the geobarometer. POC-bearing pumice clasts show a bimodal distribution of crystallization pressures for different eruptions, with modes of ~90 MPa and 130 MPa, consistent with field interpretations of different eruptive styles based on juvenile clast textures and previous knowledge of the magma plumbing system. The bimodal distribution indicates that the magma batches were tapped at different pressures (and depths). Ruapehu magmas are water saturated and have fO2 of delta-QFM equal to ~+1. The model substantiates these conditions, as rhyolite-MELTS calculations with lower water contents and different fO2 values do not produce the observed POC mineral assemblage.\nPreliminary results from the Paraná Volcanics suggest juvenile, fiamme-like blob structures equilibrated at ~50 MPa, were water saturated, and had an fO2 between delta-QFM +1 and +1.5. The geobarometer has potential to unravel crystallization conditions of shallow, glass-bearing andesites to dacites.",

Hands-on experience and freedom to tinker with climate models (whether simple or complex) is invaluable for building physical understanding. CLIMLAB is an open-ended software engine for interactive, process-oriented climate modeling. With CLIMLAB you can interactively mix and match model components, or combine simpler process models together into a more comprehensive model. It was created primarily to support classroom activities, using hands-on modeling to teach fundamentals of climate science at both undergraduate and graduate levels. CLIMLAB is written in Python and ties in with the rich ecosystem of open-source scientific Python tools for numerics and graphics. The IPython notebook format provides an elegant medium for distributing interactive example code. I will give an overview of the current capabilities of CLIMLAB, the curriculum we have developed thus far, and plans for the future. Using CLIMLAB requires some basic Python coding skills. We consider this an educational asset, as we are targeting upper-level undergraduates and Python is an increasingly important language in STEM fields.

Hydrologic well log data can provide valuable information on aquifer capacity, but is often proprietarily inaccessible or economically unfeasible to obtain in sufficient quantity. In the case of basin-fill aquifers, it is possible to make estimates of aquifer geometry and volume using geophysical surveys of gravity, constrained by additional geophysical and geological observations. We use terrestrial gravity data to model depth-to-basement about the Bridgeport, CA basin for application in preserving the Walker Lake biome. In constructing the model, we assess several hundred gravity observations, existing and newly collected. We regard these datasets as “bulk,” as the data are compiled from multiple sources. Inconsistencies among datasets can result in “static offsets,” or artificial bull’s-eye contours, within the gradient. Amending suspect offsets requires the attention of the modeler; picking these offsets by hand can be a time-consuming process when modeling large-scale basin features. We develop a MATLAB script for interpolating the residual Bouguer anomaly about the basin using sparse observation points, and leveling offset points with a user-defined sensitivity. The script is also capable of plotting gravity profiles between any two endpoints within the map extent. The resulting anomaly map provides an efficient means of locating and removing static offsets in the data, while also providing a fast visual representation of a bulk dataset. Additionally, we obtain gridded basin gravity models with an open-source alternative to proprietary modeling tools.",

Based on the long-term Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V2.2 precipitation datasets, our recent study [Li et al., 2011; Trammell et al., 2015] revealed that the precipitation increased over the wet area (i.e., monthly precipitation > 200 mm) and decreased over the dry area (i.e., monthly precipitation < 50 mm) during the past two decades. To better understand the temporal variations of precipitation and water vapor, we studied the recycling rate of atmospheric moisture, a ratio between precipitation and column water vapor, from 13 CMIP5 models and two observational datasets (SSM/I and GPCP). The comparison between observations and model simulations suggests that most CMIP5 models can capture the two main characteristics of recycling rate: (1) long-term decreasing trend of global-average oceanic recycling rate and (2) dominant spatial patterns of the temporal variations of recycling rate (i.e., increasing in Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and decreasing in sub-tropical region). All models except one successfully simulate not only the long-term trend but also inter-annual variability of the water vapor column. The agreement between simulations of precipitation in different models is relatively poor, which lead to the discrepancy in the recycling rate between the observations and CMIP5 models. Comparison of spatial patterns also suggests that the CMIP5 models simulate column water vapor better than precipitation. Our comparative studies indicate scope for improvements in the simulations of precipitation, especially for the relatively short time-scale variations, to better simulate the recycling rate of atmospheric moisture, an important indicator of climate change.

            "abstract": "Despite the geological mercury anomaly in the Mediterranean Basin, the concentrations of Hg Hg and its compounds are generally lower than those found in the Atlantic and Pacific waters. Temporal and spatial trends of total mercury and its species in surface and deep waters (dissolved gaseous mercury – DGM, mono and di-methylmercuy - MMHg, and DMHg) obtained during last 20 years will be presented. Total mercury Hg levels in open waters are generally very low (0.81–2.33 pM, av. 1.46 pM) and remain constant over the years. Hg speciation data showed that DGM accounts for up to 50% while MMHg accounted to up to 15% of total Hg in water. Significant spatial and temporal differences were observed for mercury speciation. The relatively high concentrations and fractions of DGM and MMHg indicate the high reactivity of Hg in open marine waters. DGM was present in surface waters mainly as Hg0 as no DMHg was detected at the surface, while towards the bottom a noticeable, but relatively small fraction of DMHg was present. It was found that DGM species were lower in surface with an increasing trend towards the bottom, especially in the tectonically active areas, indicating its geotectonic origin. In surface waters, DGM exhibited higher values in summer. MMHg profiles are mostly related to Chl-a and oxygen concentrations. This underlines the role of planktonic production and regeneration in methylation/ demethylation processes. The low MMHg concentrations found in shelf edge or coastal sediments and water over sediment indicate that coastal or shelf sediments are not a significant MMHg source for adjacent open sea waters. Anthropogenic and natural point sources show local enrichments, while natural diffusive sources influence Hg speciation over larger areas. The results allowed estimation of temporal mass balances to be evaluated for the Mediterranean Sea. Comparability of the measured results was secured by strict quality control measures over the 20 years.",

            "abstract": "A number of solutes have been found to be “chemostatic” in US watersheds, meaning the concentration of these solutes only change slightly while stream discharge varies by up to more than three orders of magnitude. To understand complex hydrogeochemical processes at watershed scale, here we use RT-Flux-PIHM, a newly developed code that adds a multi-component reactive transport (RT) module to Flux-PIHM, a hydrological land-surface model. The model was calibrated using hydrological and water chemistry data at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) and was used to understand the watershed dynamics for chloride (Cl) and magnesium (Mg). Shale Hills is a V-shaped watershed with a first order stream underlain by Rose Hill shale in central Pennsylvania. Both Cl and Mg are found to be “chemostatic” in the stream water in SSHCZO. The use of RT-Flux-PIHM helps us validate and visualize this solute watershed dynamic. We found that the watershed is hydrologically more connected (between hillslope and stream) during wet spring and winter seasons, which leads to quicker release of Cl. In the dry summer, however, the watershed is much less connected and high concentration of Cl is trapped along planar hillslopes. The stream mostly drains from swales and valley flows with relatively low Cl concentrations. Large rainfall events right after summer flush out and dilute the “old water” with high Cl concentration ([Cl]). Thus, this seasonal hydrologic connectivity controls the relative stable stream [Cl] despite of changes in stream discharge. Mg is originated from clay dissolution and groundwater influx and is also buffered by cation exchange reaction, which maintains relatively uniform Mg concentration across the watershed. In the wet season, higher discharge and therefore more diluted groundwater influx is compensated by faster dissolution and quick release of Mg from cation exchange sites. The opposite occurs in the dry summer. The balance of these multiple processes maintains relatively stable [Mg] concentration explaining its chemostatic behavior. This work demonstrates the potential of RT-Flux-PIHM as an integration tool for resolving long-standing puzzles at the interface of hydrology and geochemistry: e.g., the “double paradox”.",

            "abstract": "Systematic spatial variations of mantle azimuthal anisotropy are revealed by over 3000 pairs of high-quality shear-wave splitting parameters (fast polarization orientations and splitting times) recorded at ~400 USArray and other network stations in the SE United States (75˚-90 ˚ W, and 24˚ -40˚ N). The fast polarization orientations observed in the continental interior are subparallel to the absolute plate motion (APM) direction of the North American plate with apparent larger-than-normal splitting times, indicating a significant asthenospheric contribution. Fast orientations parallel to the edge of the North American craton are revealed along the southern and eastern margins of the continent. A portion of the eastern coastal area shows weak anisotropy, probably indicating the existence of vertical mantle flow. The majority of the splitting measurements can be satisfactorily explained by a model involving simple shear in the boundary layer between the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The model includes three flow systems. The first is related to the continental scale APM-parallel relative movement between the lithosphere and asthenosphere which creates the APM-parallel fast orientations observed in the continental interior. The second flow system is associated with the deflection of asthenospheric flow around the edges of the craton and is responsible for the edge-parallel fast orientations observed along the southern and eastern margins of the study area. The third system is sub-vertical, possibly caused by vertically deflected flow along the eastern root of the craton, similar to the mechanism proposed by Refayee et al. (2014, doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.01.031) for the western edge. It could also be related to previously proposed upwelling or down-welling flow. This study demonstrates the essential role that shear-wave splitting measurements played in the investigation of mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Solar radiation management (SRM) has been proposed as a form of geoengineering to reduce the warming effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Modeling studies have concluded that SRM roughly compensates for global mean temperature changes induced by greenhouse gas forcing, while large-scale hydrologic cycle changes persist. This is driven by both the sensitivity of surface energy fluxes to changes in shortwave versus longwave radiation, and the physiological effect of carbon dioxide on vegetation. We explore the impact of SRM on the hydrologic cycle that may contribute to local and regional temperature and temperature variability. Regional and seasonal changes are examined under simulations using the Community Land Model, version 4, with reductions in solar radiation relative to simulations with present-day and elevated CO2 concentrations. There are significant regional impacts due to vegetation-climate interactions that are not compensated under SRM, including changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff. In the tropics, evapotranspiration decreases due to increased vegetation water use efficiency, increasing soil moisture. In northern mid-latitudes, decreases in evapotranspiration do not always translate to increases in soil moisture due in part to the precipitation response. These results imply that SRM does not compensate for higher greenhouse gas concentrations when one considers land-atmosphere interactions.",

            "abstract": "This study measured greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by Facultative Ponds on Wastewater Treatment Plants. The most studied GHGs include CO2, CH4and N2O. The level of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions by WWTPs in Australian-type stabilization ponds was measured in the city of Lins (22º21’S, 49º50’W), state of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. GHG collection was carried outusing a collection chamber installed at the center of the facultative pond’s final third. The effluent’s pH and temperature (ET) were registered by probes, and meteorological information regarding air temperature (AT) and solar radiation (SR) were obtained from INMET, Brazil. GHG collection was carried out for 72 consecutive hours in June 2014, on an hourly basis, once every 5 minutes, for the first 30 minutes, and once every 10 minutes from 30 to 50 minutesand subsequently analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC).After three days of data collection, the average AT, SR, ET and pH values were, respectively, 18oC, 2583kJm-2, 23oC and 8.2. Average values for GHG emission levels (CH4, CO2 and N2O) were 79.01; 100.65 and 0.0 mg m-2 h-1, respectively. GHG emission levels were divided into light periods (morning, afternoon and evening)in order to verify the periods with the highest GHG emissions.The highest CH4 emission levels were measured between morning and early afternoon. The maximum CO2 emissions were observed from evening to early morning. N2O emissions were constant and values were close to the ones found in the atmosphere, which shows the emission of N2O by facultative ponds does not contribute to greenhouse gases emissions.The results enabled us to characterize and quantify GHG emission levels per Facultative Pond on Wastewater Treatment Plant.

This method relies on the similar media concept of Miller and Miller (1955) and coalesces a set of functional relationships into a single reference curve using so-called scaling factors that relate the hydraulic properties at a given location to the mean properties at an arbitrary reference point. In this talk, we will adapt the scaling method to surface hydrology and characterize the spatial variability of the flow duration curve (FDC) across the contiguous United States. Scaling factors are derived numerically by fitting closed-form parametric expressions of the FDC (Vrugt and Sadegh, 2013; Sadegh et al., 2015) to multi-year discharge data of the MOPEX data set. Results show that the FDC scaling factor exhibits a strong geographic trend with spatial patterns similar to those observed in the US soil and precipitation maps. Spatio-temporal kriging of the scaling factor can be used to predict the FDC of an ungauged watershed.",

            "abstract": "Modern metadata systems strive to help scientists locate data relevant to their research and then retrieve them quickly. Success of this mission depends on the organization and completeness of metadata. Each relevant data resource has to be registered; each content has to be described; each data file has to be accessible. Ultimately, data discoverability is about the practical ability to describe data content and location. Correspondingly, data registration has a “Parameter” level, at which content is specified by listing available observed properties (parameters), and a “Granule” level, at which download links are given to data records (granules). Until recently, both parameter- and granule-level data registrations were accomplished at NASA Virtual System Observatory easily by listing provided parameters and building Granule documents with URLs to the datafile locations, usually those at NASA CDAWeb data warehouse. With the introduction of the Virtual Wave Observatory (VWO), however, the parameter/granule concept faced a scalability challenge. The wave phenomenon content is rich with descriptors of the wave generation, propagation, interaction with propagation media, and observation processes. Additionally, the wave phenomenon content varies from record to record, reflecting changes in the constituent processes, making it necessary to generate granule documents at sub-minute resolution. We will present the first success story of registering 234,178 records of IMAGE Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) plasmagram data and Level 2 derived data products in ESPAS (near-Earth Space Data Infrastructure for e-Science), using the VWO-inspired wave ontology. The granules are arranged in overlapping display and numerical data collections. Display data include (a) auto-prospected plasmagrams of potential interest, (b) interesting plasmagrams annotated by human analysts or software, and (c) spectacular plasmagrams annotated by analysts as publication-quality examples of the RPI science. Numerical data products include plasmagram-derived records containing signatures of local and remote signal propagation, as well as field-aligned profiles of electron density in the plasmasphere. Registered granules of RPI observations are available in ESPAS for their content-targeted search and retrieval.",

The website was developed by the USGS to provide public access to the images and to support environmental analysis of global climate-related science.

            "abstract": "Ice cores collected from high elevation alpine glaciers in the Alaska Range provide a unique opportunity to investigate changes in the regional climate of southern Alaska and the north Pacific over the past millennium. In this study, we seek to investigate changes in sea surface temperature (SST) in the north-central Pacific Ocean using the deuterium excess (d-excess) record from the Mt. Hunter ice cores collected in Denali National Park, Alaska. A collaborative research team from Dartmouth College and the Universities of Maine and New Hampshire collected two parallel ice cores to bedrock (208 m long) in May-June 2013 from the Mt. Hunter summit plateau (63º N, 151º W, 4,000 m above sea level). The cores were melted on a continuous melter system in the Dartmouth ice core lab and then analyzed for concentrations of major ions and trace elements, as well as stable water isotope ratios. The depth-age scale of the cores was determined using annual layer counting of δ18O and the concentrations of Mg, NH4, and Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) obtained by ion chromatography. The depth-age scale was validated using large, well-dated volcanic eruptions and the spike in 137Cs concentrations associated with nuclear weapons testing in 1963. Preliminary analyses indicate that the full record spans the past millennium. Analysis of the isotope data set extending back to 1938 using reanalysis data shows a positive correlation (p<0.05) between d-excess at the core site and the north-central Pacific SST. The north-central Pacific region of positive SST-d-excess correlation occurs at one node of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and thus the Denali cores are sensitive to PDO variability with low (high) d-excess associated with positive (negative) PDO index values. We also note a significant (p<0.05) declining trend in d-excess from 1938-2012, which we hypothesize to represent a rising proportion of Arctic moisture sources influencing Denali as Arctic temperatures and evaporation rates have increased.",

At the same time, even as summers become drier, the incidence of severe precipitation events could increase. What is the influence such changes to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of Karst groundwater systems?\nA factor to be considered in conjunction with groundwater quality is the vulnerability of the resource, which is defined as the sensitivity of a groundwater system to pollution. Intrinsic vulnerability refers to the sensitivity to pollution when considering only natural, geogenic conditions without the effects of human activities such as contaminant release. Intrinsic vulnerability depends on the recharge conditions, which are dependent on the surface and subsurface structure and on precipitation and evaporation patterns. The latter are highly time dependent. Therefore, our groundwater vulnerability concept also includes dynamic aspects of the system, the variations of spatial and temporal components.\nWe present results of combined monitoring and modelling experiments of several types of Karst systems in the Tabular and the Folded Jura of NW Switzerland.\nThe recharge, conduit flow, diffuse flow(RCD) rainfall-discharge model “RCD-seasonal” was used to simulate the discharge and substance concentration of several spring. This lumped parameter model include: the recharge system (soil and epikarst system), the conduit flow system, and the diffuse flow system.\nThe numerically derived Dynamic Vulnerability Index (DVI) can indicate qualitative changes of spring water with sufficient accuracy to be used for drinking water management. In addition, the results obtained from the test sites indicate a decrease in short-lived contaminants in spring water as a result of climate change. The impact of persistent contaminants, however, can only be determined if future climatic conditions at the site can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, because predicted summer heat waves and severe rainfall events will have opposite effects on the groundwater vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "Constitutive rules exist in various forms for glacier slip over a deformable substrate. Although experiments have generally shown that till behaves as a Coulomb material, in models deformable beds are often treated as viscous or viscoplastic fluids. Processes at the ice-bed interface, which cannot be studied with experiments on till alone, may result in rate-dependent slip resistance that deviates from Coulomb models.\nWe have conducted a series of experiments using a ring-shear apparatus designed to study glacier sliding. Ice is slid over a 6 cm thick layer of deformable till containing either no clasts larger than 6 mm, or six evenly spaced larger clasts (~5 cm in length) placed at the deformable bed's surface. The device rotates a ring of ice (20 cm wide, 20 cm thick, with outer diameter of 90 cm) across the till bed. Sliding speed or shear stress is set, while the other of these parameters is allowed to attain a steady state. Data are collected at sliding speeds of 29-465 m/yr and shear stresses of 36-91 kPa, while a vertical (normal) stress of 150 kPa is applied to the ice ring. The temperature of the ice is held at the pressure melting point. Water is allowed to drain from the bed, so effective stress is equal to the total vertical stress.\nResults indicate that a bed with clasts exhibits rate dependence over a small range of shear stress values less than the yield strength of the till. At shear stresses equal to the yield strength, the bed shears in a thin layer near the ice-bed interface with resistance independent of slip velocity. Clasts are displaced down-flow from their original location but less than the ice displacement. At stresses below the yield strength, the rate dependence is likely the result of classical sliding mechanisms allowing flow of ice around clasts partially lodged in the bed. These results provide the first experimental guidance for flow models that seek to include the combined effects of ice and till mechanics in a constitutive rule for basal slip.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal snowpacks accumulate impurities derived from atmospheric aerosols and trace gases throughout the winter and can release them quickly during a melt period, thus having an impact on the surrounding environment. The timing of the melt and the amount of impurities within the snowpack will affect how receiving ecosystems can manage the rapid release of these materials during a melt event. Previous field and laboratory studies have shown that a snowpack can lose up to 80% of its ions in the first 20% of the runoff, an event commonly known as an ionic pulse. On the other hand, some studies have found that particulate impurities (e.g. dust and black carbon (BC)) can be concentrated in surface layers during melt, darkening the snowpack. To characterize snow chemistry and quantify the rate of release of impurities during melt, we collected and analyzed near daily chemical profiles in the snowpack at three sites during three winters in New Hampshire, USA. Using the same datasets, we are also investigating the spatial variability of snow chemistry and the movement of impurities within the snowpack throughout the winter, with plans to use additional stream and soil datasets to investigate how any ionic pulse spreads into soils and nearby streams. Preliminary results suggest that an ionic pulse is occurring when New Hampshire’s snowpack melts, with at least 50% of some chemical inventories leaving in the first 21% of the melt. BC also tends to flush out of the snowpack more quickly than snow water equivalent decreases during melt, but slower than most ions. We also found that sodium and chloride ratios suggest that a large portion of these ions may be derived from nearby road salt application rather than sea salt, even at two sample sites located in New Hampshire’s coastal region where a signal from sea salt aerosol may be expected to dominate.",

Despite the importance of successional vegetation in tropical regions for global climate, how inter-annual climate variability influences successional trajectories and biomass accumulation remains poorly understood. Lagged effects of climate extremes on tropical tree demography and successional trajectories represent one key uncertainty. We couple 15 years of climate records and tree growth and survival data with functional trait information for 172 tree species to parameterize Stochastic Antecedent Models (SAMs) of lagged effects of drought on tree demography in second-growth tropical forests in Costa Rica. We also quantify how these legacies influence successional trajectories and biomass accumulation. Drought legacies on tree growth were particularly marked for species with high Specific Leaf Area and low wood density. These legacies led to elevated rates of tree mortality, particularly for large (>10 cm in diameter) up to 4 years after the occurrence of extreme droughts. Simulations of successional trajectories using immediate and lagged drought effects demonstrate that lagged effects lead to shifts in successional trajectories and substantial losses in biomass accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Two major characteristics define the mean climate of the tropics – pronounced zonal (east-west) and meridional (equator to mid-latitudes) gradients in sea surface temperature (SST). These gradients control the atmospheric zonal and meridional circulations and thus Earth’s climate. Previous studies have shown that global cooling, which started in the late Miocene and accelerated since the early Pliocene, was accompanied by the gradual strengthening of these gradients. Here, we carefully analyze temperature trends over the past 5 million years, including a newly generated SST record from the Southern Pacific Ocean (ODP site 1125), and show that changes in these gradients followed each other very closely, reflecting a tight relationship between these two climatic variables. To investigate this relationship we conduct simulations with a comprehensive climate model (CESM) wherein we systematically reduce the meridional temperature gradient by modifying the latitudinal distribution of cloud albedo or atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that the zonal SST gradient in the Pacific adjusts accordingly, such that changes along the equator match the imposed changes in the meridional gradient, with the two variables linked by upper-ocean circulation. The meridional temperature distribution is mapped onto the ocean vertical thermal stratification and then onto the east-west SST distribution along the equator. These findings are accounted for by a simple model of tropical climate informed by our simulations. Consequently, the tight relationship between the two SST gradients posits a fundamental constraint on past climates that can help resolve current debates on the state of the tropics during the early Pliocene, including the prevalence of permanent El Nino-like conditions (El Padre).",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of wildfires, whether natural or anthropogenic, is an important disturbance of the terrestrial ecosystems as it plays an essential role in shaping global and regional vegetation. This study presents an investigation of the impact of burned areas on the surface energy balance and precipitation in northern and southern Africa as simulated by a state-of-the-art regional modeling system. Mean burned area fraction derived from MODIS date-of-burning product was implemented in a set of WRF/SSiB2 simulations. Vegetation cover and LAI were degraded based on mean burned area fraction and survival rate for each vegetation land cover type. Additionally, ground darkening associated with ash and charcoal deposition was imposed by temporarily lowering the ground albedo after burning.\nWildfire-induced vegetation and ground degradation increased the surface albedo by exposing the brighter bare ground of the region, which in turn caused a decrease in surface net radiation and evapotranspiration. Overall, post-fire land condition resulted in a decrease in precipitation over sub-Saharan Africa, associated with the weakening of the West African monsoon progression through the region. A decrease in atmospheric moisture flux convergence was observed in the burned areas, which played a dominant role in reducing precipitation.\nThe areas with the largest precipitation impact were those covered by savannas and rainforests, where annual precipitation decreased by 3.8% and 3.3%, respectively. The resulting precipitation decrease and vegetation deterioration caused a drop in gross primary productivity in the region, which was strongest in late winter and early spring.\nThis study suggests that the cooling and drying of atmosphere induced by the burned areas led to strengthening of subsidence during pre-onset and weakening of upward motion during onset and mature stages of the monsoon leading to a waning of convective instability and precipitation. Vertical air movement over the area showed a strengthening of downward motion in winter and spring, and weakening of upward movement during the rainy months. Results from on-going similar simulations over southern Africa will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "At subduction zones, thermal modeling predict that the shallow part of the downgoing oceanic crust (< 80 - 100 km depth to the slab) is usually too cold to cross the water-rich solidus and melts beneath the forearc. Yet, the occasional occurrence of adakites, commonly considered as slab melts, in the forearc region challenges our understanding of the shallow subduction processes. Adakites are unusual felsic rocks commonly associated with asthenospheric slab window opening or fast subduction of young (< 25 Ma) oceanic plate that enable slab melting at shallow depths; but their genesis has remained controversial. Here, we present a new approach that provides new constraints on adakite petrogenesis in hot subduction zones (the Philippines) and above an asthenospheric window (Baja California, Mexico). We use amphibole compositions to estimate the magma storage depths and the composition of the parental melts to test the hypothesis that adakites are pristine slab melts. We find that adakites from Baja California and Philippines formed by two distinct petrogenetic scenarios. In Baja California, hydrous mantle melts mixed/mingled with high-pressure (HP) adakite-type, slab melts within a lower crustal (~30 km depth) magma storage region before stalling into the upper arc crust (~7-15 km depth). In contrast, in the Philippines, primitive mantle melts stalled and crystallized within lower and upper crustal magma storage regions to produce silica-rich melts with an adakitic signature. Thereby, slab melting is not required to produce an adakitic geochemical fingerprint in hot subduction zones. However, our results also suggest that the downgoing crust potentially melted beneath Baja California.",

Besides the spectral information of waves, an accurate investigation of hiss induced radiation belt electron loss timescales requires the details of wave normal angle distribution during propagation along the field line, which however is difficult to obtain directly from in situ measurements but can be reasonably evaluated from ray tracing of hiss propagation on basis of reasonable setups of background field and plasma density. By assuming a nominal and suitable plasmapause location at L = 4.5, we report the ray tracing results of hiss wave propagation angles for various hiss wave frequencies at various L-shells in the plasmasphere. Subsequently, we construct the improved model of hiss wave normal angle distribution with dependence on both wave frequency, magnetic latitude and L-shell, which is used to compute the quasi-linear bounce-averaged rates of electron scattering due to plasmaspheric hiss and perform the pure pitch angle diffusion simulations. Hiss induced radiation belt electron loss timescales are then determined from the simulated temporal evolution of electron fluxes after reaching the equilibrium state, as a function of electron kinetic energy and L-shell, which is of importance for incorporation into future simulations of the radiation belt electron dynamics under various geomagnetic conditions to comprehend the exact contribution of plasmaspheric hiss.",

            "abstract": "We have created a planetary accretion and differentiation model that self-consistently builds and evolves Earth’s core. From this model, we show that the core grows stably stratified as the result of rising metal-silicate equilibration temperatures and pressures, which increases the concentrations of light element impurities into each newer core addition. This stable stratification would naturally resist convection and frustrate the onset of a geodynamo, however, late giant impacts could mechanically mix the distinct accreted core layers creating large homogenous regions. Within these regions, a geodynamo may operate. From this model, we interpret the difference between the planetary magnetic fields of Earth and Venus as a difference in giant impact histories.\nOur planetary accretion model is a numerical N-body integration of the Grand Tack scenario [1]—the most successful terrestrial planet formation model to date [2,3]. Then, we take the accretion histories of Earth-like and Venus-like planets from this model and post-process the growth of each terrestrial planet according to a well-tested planetary differentiation model [4,5]. This model fits Earth’s mantle by modifying the oxygen content of the pre-cursor planetesimals and embryos as well as the conditions of metal-silicate equilibration. Other non-volatile major, minor and trace elements included in the model are assumed to be in CI chondrite proportions.\nThe results from this model across many simulated terrestrial planet growth histories are robust. If the kinetic energy delivered by larger impacts is neglected, the core of each planet grows with a strong stable stratification that would significantly impede convection. However, if giant impact mixing is very efficient or if the impact history delivers large impacts late, than the stable stratification can be removed.\n[1] Walsh et al.

The Middle Triassic to Early Cretaceous stratigraphy of the metamorphic pendants shows alternating volcanic and sedimentary beds. The latter varies from rocks formed in high-energy terrestrial to low-energy shallow marine environments. Sedimentary textures also vary from poorly sorted volcanic-clast/breccia-rich to well-sorted fine-grained rocks and carbonates. We interpret these variations in stratigraphic records to reflect the waning and waxing of arc volcanism and tectonism, which controls erosion of source rocks, as well as elevation changes through isostastic balance. These in turn control the paleo-geography and depositional environments. Detrital zircon geochronology confirms our hypothesis. Detrital zircon ages of sedimentary rocks closely track the ages of volcanic/plutonic rocks formed immediately earlier and also include age signals of older igneous rocks and pre-arc basement, suggesting the erosion of igneous rocks of higher elevation during the magmatic flare-ups and deposition of these clasts afterwards. We conclude that episodic arc volcanism and tectonism play important roles on processes of surface erosion and sedimentation.",

WRF Chem is capable of simulating the diurnal variability in surface O3 in all the seasons with a good correlation (R2>0.57) between the simulated and observed O3. The model is found to capture the observed seasonal variations in O3 concentrations with maximum during the spring and minimum in monsoon. However, the model overestimates both the minimum and maximum levels by >10ppb in monsoon season and > 20ppb in all other three seasons. Simulated NO is underestimated, mostly during the nighttime in all three seasons (5-20 ppb) except the monsoon (~5ppb) season, when it is overestimated. Simulated NO2 and CO on the other hand, is underestimated in all the seasons. The observed difference may be contributed by the bias in the estimation of the O3 precursors, NOx and CO in the emission inventories or the error in the simulation of the meteorological variables which influences O3 concentration. For example, in the pre-monsoon and winter season, the model simulated shortwave flux overestimates the observation by ~500 Wm-2. While in the monsoon and post monsoon season, simulated shortwave flux is equivalent to the observation. The model predicts high wind speed in all the seasons especially during night-time as against observation. In the post-monsoon and winter season, the simulated wind pattern is reverse to observation with daytime low and night-time high values. Rainfall is overestimated in all the seasons. The night-time overestimation of O3 over this location may also be due to inadequacy of the model's chemistry to properly simulate the night-time level over this location.",

            "abstract": "Rivers have no regard for human demarcated boundaries. Besides, ever increasing demand-supply gap & vested riparian interests, fuel transboundary water conflicts. For resolving such disputes, appropriation doctrines advocating equity & fairness have received endorsement in the Helsinki Rules-1966 & UN Convention-1997. Thus, current study proposes the principle of equitable apportionment for sharing Ganges waters as it balances the interests & deservedness of all stakeholders, namely, India & its 11 states, Bangladesh, Nepal, & China. The study endeavors to derive a reasonable share of each co-basin state by operationalizing the vague concepts of fairness & equity through an objective & quantitative framework encompassing proportionality & egalitarianism for distributive & procedural justice. Equal weightage factors reflecting hydrology, geography & water use potential are chosen for fair share computation, wherein each contender ranks these factors to maximize his entitlement. If cumulative claims exceed the water availability, each claimant puts forth next ranked factor & this process continues till the claims match availability. Due to inter-annual variability in few factors, scenarios for Rabi & Kharif seasons are considered apart from cases for maximum, upper quartile, median, lower quartile & minimum. Possibility of spatial homogeneity & heterogeneity in factors is also recognized. Sometimes lack of technical information hinders transboundary dispute resolution via legal mechanisms. Hence, the study also attempts to bridge this gap between law & technology through GIS-based SWAT hydrologic model by estimating the Ganges water yield, & consequent share of each riparian for range of flows incorporating e-flows as well, under present & future climate & landuse scenarios. 82% of India’s territory lies within interstate rivers, & therefore this research is very pertinent as it can facilitate the decision makers in effective interstate water conflict resolution.",

            "abstract": "The temporal evolution of hydrothermal fluids from back-arc systems is poorly constrained, despite growing evidence for dynamic magmatic–hydrothermal activity, and imminent commercial mining. Here we discuss surveys of diverse vent fluids from multiple hydrothermal fields in the Manus back-arc basin, Papua New Guinea, sampled in 2006 and 2011. Effects of host rock composition, and dynamic magmatic volatile inputs on fluid chemistry are evaluated to understand changes in these systems. Highly acidic and SO4-rich moderate temperature fluids (~48–215°C), as well as SO4-poor black smoker fluids (up to 358°C), were collected at the PACMANUS, SuSu Knolls and DESMOS areas in 2006 and 2011. Acidic, milky white SuSu and DESMOS fluids, rich in elemental S and SO4, exit the seafloor with Na, K, Mg, and Ca diluted conservatively up to 30% relative to seawater, implying subsurface mixing of seawater with SO2-rich aqueous fluids exsolved from magma, analogous to subaerial fumarole discharge. SO2 disproportionation during cooling and mixing of magmatic fluids contributes acidity, SO4, H2S and S(0)(s), as well as widespread S outcrops on the seafloor. Nearby black smoker fluids indicate entrainment and reaction of magmatic fluid into convecting fluids at depth, and additional hybrid-type fluids appear to consist of evolved seawater and unreacted magmatic fluid SO2 derivatives. Fluids at DESMOS in 2006 indicate increased magmatic SO2 relative to 1995, despite constant low venting temperatures (~120°C). In contrast, dramatic changes in bathymetry and seafloor morphology point to substantial continuous eruption of volcaniclastic material between 2006 and 2011 at SuSu Knolls, burying fumarolic vents from 2006. Compositions of new 2011 acidic, sulfate-rich fluids there suggest reaction with less altered, fresher rock. At the PACMANUS area, farther from the arc, direct magmatic degassing to the seafloor is not occurring presently, but entrainment and reaction of similar acid-sulfate fluids deep within the reaction zone has persisted from 2006-2011 based on black smoker compositions. Overall, these results help to elucidate temporal trends in processes responsible for the formation of hot-spring fluids in magmatically active back-arc environments, and resulting chemical exchange between the crust and water column.",

The responses and feedbacks of biogeochemical cycles to these changes play an important role in determining ecosystem responses to possible future trajectories for land stewardship through effects on rates of secondary forest regrowth, soil emissions of greenhouse gases, inputs of nutrients to groundwater and streamwater, and nutrient management in agroecosystems. The Terrestrial Ecology program at NASA supported numerous studies on these topics in the Amazon and Cerrado regions, both before and during the LBA-ECO project. Here we present analyses of data from this body of work on nutrient cycling in cattle pastures, secondary forests, and mature forests of the Paragominas area, where we are developing a stoichiometric model relating C-N-P interactions during land use change, constrained by multiple observations of ecosystem stocks and fluxes in each land use. Whereas P is conservatively cycled in all land uses, we demonstrate how pyrolyzation of N during pasture formation and management depletes available-N pools, consistent with observations of lower rates of N leaching and trace gas emission and consistent with secondary forest growth responses to experimental N amendments. Although the soils store large stocks of N and P, our parameterization of available forms of these nutrients for steady-state dynamics in the mature forest yield reasonable estimates of net N and P mineralization available for grasses and secondary forest species at rates consistent with observed biomass accumulation and productivity in these modified ecosystems. The multiple data constraints from measurements made by the type of integrated studies supported by the NASA TE program provide an important legacy that continues to support exploration of the functions, vulnerabilities, and resiliencies of these ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The clumped isotope system in carbonates (Δ47) relies on the extraction of CO2 from the carbonate minerals using phosphoric acid. Despite the fact that this method dates back to the original stable isotopic work in the 1950s, there are significant aspects of the fractionation of the 18O/16O (and by inference the ratio of mass 47 to 44) which are not understood. We believe that subtle variations in the isotopic fractionation as a function of temperature, acid density (and acid preparation method), and extraction line design cause variation between the clumped isotope data produced by different laboratories. One of the most obvious of these is difference in reaction temperatures. While most laboratories employ temperatures of between 75 and 90oC, the original method employed a temperature of 25oC. Although various estimate of the difference in fractionation of Δ47 between 25 and 90oC have been made, we have measured significantly different values for dolomites compared to published data. In order to understand this we have performed experiments in sealed Pyrex vessels to measure the exchange between CO2 and 103% phosphoric acid. We have determined there to be significant and measurable changes in the Δ47 of CO2 when exposed to phosphoric acid. This exchange is a function of temperature, time, acid strength, and the surface area of the acid exposed to the CO2. We postulate that, perhaps as a result of the lower reaction rate of dolomite, compared to calcite, that there is greater opportunity for CO2 to exchange with the phosphoric acid as bubbles of CO2 are retained within the acid for longer periods of time. Such a mechanism would predict that well-ordered dolomites will have different fractionation compared to protodolomite. Similar differences might account for different fractionation for other carbonate minerals.",

            "abstract": "The observed and predicted Climate-Carbon-Cryosphere interactions in the Arctic Ocean are likely to alter productivity and carbon fluxes of the Siberian continental margin and adjacent basins. Here, we compare field observations and samples obtained in the nineties, and recently in 2012 during the sea ice minimum, to assess decadal changes in the productivity, export and recycling of organic matter at the outer East Siberian margin. In the 90s, the Laptev Sea margin was still largely ice-covered throughout the year, and the samples and measurements obtained represent an ecological baseline against which current and future ecosystem shifts can be assessed. The POLARSTERN expedition IceArc (ARK-XXVII/3) returned in September 2012 to resample the same transects between 60 and 3400 m water depth as well as stations in the adjacent deep basins. Our results suggest that environmental changes in the past two decades, foremost sea ice thinning and retreat, have led to a substantial increase in phytodetritus sedimentation to the seafloor, especially at the lower margin and adjacent basins. This is reflected in increased benthic microbial activities, leading to higher carbon remineralization rates, especially deeper than 3000 m. Besides a relative increase in typical particle degrading bacterial types in surface sediments, bacterial community composition showed little variation between the two years, suggesting that local microbial communities can cope with changing food input. First assessments of faunal abundances suggest an increase in polychaetes,holothurians and bivalves at depth, which fits the prediction of higher productivity and particle deposition rates upon sea ice retreat. The presentation also discusses the controversial issue whether there is evidence for an Arctic-wide increase in carbon flux, or whether we are looking at a spatial shift of the productive marginal ice zone as the main factor to enhance carbon flux to the deep Siberian margin.",

            "abstract": "Black Carbon (BC) has been shown to significantly impact snow melt through lowering the albedo of snow and increasing the absorption rate of short wave radiation. Yet few studies have investigated the effect of the enhanced melt on hydrological variability. BC sources for Norway are rather remote and deposition rates low. However, once deposited on snow even low concentrations of BC can have a detectable effect on the snow melt. Variations in snow melt have a direct impact on the snow cover duration and the timing and magnitude of peak outflow. In this study, we use two different atmospheric transport models (the Lagrangian transport and dispersion model FELXPART and the regional aerosol-climate model REMO-HAM) and GAINS emissions to simulate deposition rates over Norway and Statkraft’s Hydrologic Forecasting Toolbox (ShyFT) to simulate the impact of BC deposition on the seasonal snow melt. The Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model coupled to the snow routine of the hydrological model is used to determine the albedo of the snow as a function of the BC concentration in two snow layers. To investigate the impact range of BC on the seasonal snow melt, we simulate the catchment hydrology of catchments in south-east, south-west and northern Norway under the impact of deposition rates from both transport models, respectively. Comparing the deposition rates from the two transport models, we observe large differences in the seasonal cycle which in turn results in a significantly different response in the snow melt. Furthermore, we investigate the overall impact of BC deposition on the snow melt and duration on a catchment scale for both transport models.",

Published analyses of these samples provide the approximate ages for those events that appear consistent with this sequence; however, within current 2 sigma error limits, these ages overlap. Strong evidence exists that the Sculptured Hills physiographic unit consists of Imbrium ejecta made up of a layered, Mg-suite pluton. Rim boulders at Camelot Crater constitute wall rocks of the crater rather than ejecta and provide a potential opportunity for investigations of remnant magnetic field orientation at the time of the eruption of late mare basalt lavas in the valley. A second and older light mantle avalanche deposit has been identified, and the origin, potential fluidized flow mechanisms, and geology of the two avalanches from the South Massif have been clarified, including the probability of significant agitation heating during flow. The structure, potential effects, and timing of the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault, and of an ancillary fault revealed by radar, have been defined and raise doubts about the association of the light mantle avalanche with secondary impacts related to the Tycho event.",

Source mechanism and triggering stress of these induced earthquakes are of great importance for understanding their causes and the physics of the seismic processes in reservoirs. Previous research on the analysis of induced seismic events in conventional oil/gas fields assumed a double couple (DC) source mechanism.\nThe induced seismic data in this study are from both Oman and Kuwait. For the Oman data, the induced seismicity is monitored by both surface network (0<M<3) and downhole network (M<0) in an oil/gas field. The data used in the study consist of 800 events located by the surface network and 2000 events from the downhole network. For the Kuwait data a surface network is used to collect the local seismic data (0<M<5). The good signal noise ratio of the data makes it possible to obtain the source mechanisms and triggering stress. We determine the full moment tensor of the induced seismicity data, based on a full-waveform inversion method (Song and Toksöz, 2011). With the full moment tensor inversion results, Coulomb stress is calculated to investigate the triggering features of the induced seismicity data. Our results show a detailed evolution of 3D triggering stress in oil/gas fields from year 1999 to 2007 for Oman, and from year 2006 to 2015 for Kuwait. In addition, the local hazard corresponding to the induced seismicity in these oil/gas fields is assessed and compared to ground motion prediction due to large (M>5.0) regional tectonic earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Appalachian-Caledonide orogen was the first to be interpreted as a zone of plate-tectonic collision. However, Wilson's original question 'Did the Atlantic close and then reopen?' addresses only part of the supercontinent cycle, spanning the transition from closing oceans, through supercontinent assembly, to breakup and ocean spreading. The transition from separation to convergence was not addressed by Wilson, but the initiation of subduction in new oceans remains a poorly understood part of the supercontinent cycle.\nIn the Appalachian-Caledonide system, rifting apparently continued to at least ~550 Ma, producing an ocean with numerous hyperextended margins and microcontinental blocks. These include both peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan terranes; the latter have been grouped into domains characterized by platformal Cambrian environments (east and west Avalonia) and deeper-water successions (Ganderia and Megumia). Isotopic work has shown that west Avalonia represents relatively juvenile continental crust, whereas Ganderia is more evolved; east Avalonia may represent continental basement of intermediate isotopic character.\nArcs were present in the developing ocean by 505 Ma, as recorded in parts of the orogen from Maine and Newfoundland, through the British Isles to Scandinavia. Many show juvenile isotopic signatures suggesting that they did not originate on older margins. Some arcs underwent late Cambrian to Early Ordovician interaction with the Laurentian margin, while others were emplaced on peri-Gondwanan crust. Their subsequent histories were complex, involving the opening of back-arc basins within a closing ocean. Paleomagnetic data suggest substantial vertical-axis rotations during closure.\nThese observations, and Wilson's original comparison with the Atlantic, suggest that spontaneous inversion of passive margins is unlikely to have initiated subduction. Instead arc systems entered the newly formed oceans formed by breakup of Rodinia and initiated ocean closure.",

            "abstract": "The UCERF3 model predicts that most San Jacinto fault (SJF) earthquakes are larger than M7.5. In contrast, both the historical record of moderate earthquakes, along with the rich paleoseismic record, argues that most of the moment release on the SJF is accommodated by earthquakes in the Mw6.5-7.3 range. Over the past 4000 years at Hog Lake, large ruptures are exemplified by the M7.3 event in November 1800, with 1918-type earthquakes filling in the section of low slip to the NW. Limits on the range of rupture sizes can also be inferred by comparing the Hog Lake record to the Mystic Lake site to the NW. Less than half of Hog Lake events have plausible matches at Mystic Lake, implying that the mode in earthquake magnitude is unlikely to be in the M>7.5 range as reported in the UCERF3 model. In addition, moderate earthquakes occurred along the northern SJF in 1899 (2 events), 1918, and 1923, and ~M6.5 events with surface rupture occurred on the southern San Jacinto fault in 1968 and 1987. Several M6-sized earthquakes (1937, 1954, 1890?, 1892?) have also occurred along the southern SJF. Paleoseismic observations to the south, although less extensive, also argue that M7.3 events that rupture the entire Superstition Mountain-Coyote Creek fault are less frequent than ruptures with smaller magnitudes.\nThe CoV at Hog Lake is resolved to be about 0.63 for the entire record, decreasing for the subset of largest interpreted events. The complete record thus suggests quasi-periodic behavior of large earthquakes with superposed more randomly occurring moderate events. The shorter southern SJF record can be interpreted in the same way, with occasional larger earthquakes superposed with moderate, 1968-type events. Both records lend geological support to the recent model-based UCERF3 conclusion that the CoV for ground rupturing earthquakes must depend on magnitude in order to match site-specific observations of CoV in the range of 0.6. A picture emerges of more regular large events filled in with moderate-sized earthquakes along the sections of lower slip or along weaker elements of the fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Alpine landscapes are likely to be particularly sensitive to climate change, because of: (1) the vulnerability of permafrost and glacial and nival processes to changes in atmospheric temperature and precipitation; (2) their history, which may have led to high rates of sediment production, and hence high rates of sediment supply; and (3) the steep slopes that may sustain sediment transport. Assessing the effects of climate change upon these processes over the timescale of recent rapid warming (i.e. decades) is difficult because of the lack of available data. Here, we use two unique data sources to assess the relative importance of these three processes for two high mountain basins (altitude range 2’000 to 3’500 m asl): (1) histories of surface change from the late 1950s, based upon construction of digital elevation models from archival imagery; and (2) a long term record, beginning in the early 1960s, of sediment export based upon the flushing of sediment from hydropower intakes. The two basins contain glaciers, rock glaciers, permafrost and the legacy of past glacial activity. These data show that the level of geomorphic activity within both basins is orders of magnitude higher than the volume of sediment exported from the basins. Decadal scale changes in elevation and surface displacement velocities suggest an acceleration of landscape dynamics from the 1980s. Changes in atmospheric temperature remain a key control of this process, but precipitation and snow cover prove critical in controlling rock glacier behaviour and can induce acceleration of surface displacements even under cold atmospheric conditions. However, the analysis of the sediment export data show that despite generally greater within basin dynamics, the rate of export of sediment remains orders of magnitude lower than rates of sediment production. Calculations of sediment transport capacity suggest that this is because the fundamental limit upon sediment yield is the capacity of the stream to evacuate sediment that, in turn, is highly dependent upon annual winter snow cover. There is no clear trend in the latter suggesting that warming enhanced sediment production does not translate into sediment export from the basins studied.",

The TCIS has been running a near-real time (NRT) data portal during North Atlantic hurricane season that typically runs from June through October each year, since 2010.\nData collected by the TCIS varies by type, format, contents, and frequency and is served to the user in two ways: (1) as image overlays on a virtual globe and (2) as derived output from a suite of analysis tools. In order to support these two functions, the data must be collected and then made searchable by criteria such as date, mission, product, pressure level, and geospatial region. Creating a database architecture that is flexible enough to manage, intelligently interrogate, and ultimately present this disparate data to the user in a meaningful way has been the primary challenge.\nThe database solution for the TCIS has been to use a hybrid MySQL + Solr implementation. After testing other relational database and NoSQL solutions, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB respectively, this solution has given the TCIS the best offerings in terms of query speed and result reliability. This database solution also supports the challenging (and memory overwhelming) geospatial queries that are necessary to support analysis tools requested by users. Though hardly new technologies on their own, our implementation of MySQL + Solr had to be customized and tuned to be able to accurately store, index, and search the TCIS data holdings.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how we arrived on our MySQL + Solr database architecture, why it offers us the most consistent fast and reliable results, and how it supports our front end so that we can offer users a look into our “big data” holdings.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative, value-enhancing procedure for effective planning and design of long-lived flood management infrastructure given uncertain future flooding threats due to climate change. Designing infrastructure that can be adapted over time is a method to safeguard the efficacy of current design decisions given uncertainty about rates and future impacts of climate change. This paper explores the value of embedding “options” in a physical structure, where an option is the right but not the obligation to do something at a later date (e.g. over-dimensioning a floodwall foundation now facilitates a future height addition in response to observed increases in sea level; building of extra pump bays in a pumping station now enables the addition of pumping capacity whenever increased precipitation warrants an expansion.) The proposed procedure couples a simulation model that captures future climate induced changes to the hydrologic operating environment of a structure, with an economic model that estimates the lifetime economic performance of alternative investments. The economic model uses Real “In” Options analysis, a type of cash flow analysis that quantifies the implicit value of options and the flexibility they provide. This procedure is demonstrated using replacement planning for the multi-functional pumping station IJmuiden on the North Sea Canal in the Netherlands. Flexibility in design decisions is modelled, varying the size and specific options included in the new structure. Results indicate that the incorporation of options within the structural design has the potential to improve its economic performance, as compared to more traditional, “build it once and build it big” designs where flexibility is not an explicit design criterion. The added value resulting from the incorporation of flexibility varies with the range of future conditions considered, as well as the options examined. This procedure could be applied more broadly to explore investment strategies for the design of other flood management structures.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone, the region underneath/surrounding a stream where surface and subsurface waters – and subsequently solutes – are exchanged and interact, is important for many biogeochemical, hydrological, and ecological processes. However, it has remained difficult for researchers to sufficiently describe solute transport within the hyporheic zone, due, in part, to the great degree of heterogeneity of the subsurface. Thus, more direct and invasive sampling techniques are limited in their usefulness. We used an indirect approach for measuring the hyporheic zone, employing 3D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), with a pole-dipole configuration, downstream of a constant-rate addition of an electrically conductive salt tracer (Cl-) as a solution via a high-precision peristaltic pump. This method allowed us to measure the extent of subsurface dynamics of streams in Wyoming’s Laramie and Snowy Range mountains, as it yields a three-dimensional view of solute transport and exchange within the hyporheic zone. We found that the physical size of the hyporheic zone and the rate of exchange between the hyporheic and surface waters, as estimated from 3D ERT, are largely related to sediment properties (i.e. grain size distribution) and the extent of tailing of the solute’s breakthrough curve (length of time for the solute to flush from the subsurface post cessation of the pump upstream). Coarser sediments with a relatively large porosity, such as gravels and sands, allowed for more subsurface exchange, and larger flow paths, than finer sediments with tighter packing structures, such as clays. Stream reaches that showed a higher degree of tailing in the breakthrough curve, traditionally implying a large transient storage zone, had larger and more active hyporheic zones as measured by 3D ERT. We therefore believe further investigations with 3D ERT will better our understanding of hyporheic exchange and stream solute transport.",

            "abstract": "Historical observations of deep ocean temperatures (>700 m water depth) show apparently unprecedented rates of warming over the past half century that parallel observed surface warming, on the order of 0.1°C/decade (Purkey and Johnson 2010). Most water masses below 700 m depth, however, have not been at the sea surface where they exchange heat and carbon with the atmosphere since well before industrialization (Gebbie and Huybers 2012). How then has the heat content of isolated deep water masses responded to climate change over the last century? In models, wave mechanisms propagate thermocline anomalies quickly (Masuda et al. 2010), but these dynamics are not fully understood. We therefore turn to the sedimentary record to constrain the bounds of earlier variability from Holocene anomalies.\nThe oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O) of individual benthic foraminifera provide approximately month-long snapshots of the temperature and salinity of ambient deep water during calcification. We exploit the short lifespan of these organisms to reconstruct variability in δ18Oshell, and thus the variability in deep water temperature and salinity, during five 200-yr Holocene intervals at 1000 m water depth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP). Modern variability in benthic foraminifer δ18O was too weak to detect but variability at 1000 m water depth in the EEP exceeded our detection limit during two Holocene intervals at high confidence (p<0.01), with δ18O anomalies up to ~0.6 ± 0.15‰ that persist for a month or longer. Although the source of these anomalies remains speculative, rapid communication between the surface and deep ocean that operates on human timescales, faster than previously recognized, or intrinsic variability that has not been active during the history of ocean observations are potential explanations. Further work combining models and high-resolution proxy data is needed to identify the mechanism and global extent of this type of subsurface variability in the global oceans.",

            "abstract": "Rapid slip on the Mai’iu low-angle normal fault (LANF) has exhumed a smooth, corrugated fault surface contiguous for >24 km up-dip, rising from near sea level to ~2900 m. The fault emerges from the ground dipping ~21° N and flattens over the crest of the dome to dip south. Geomorphic analysis reveals a progressive back-tilting of the surface during exhumation accompanied by cross-cutting antithetic-sense high-angle faults—features that we attribute to “rolling-hinge” deformation of a once more steeply-dipping fault. Near the scarp base, the footwall exposes mafic mylonites that deformed at ~400-450°C. The younger Mai’iu fault cross-cuts this ductile mylonite zone, with most brittle slip being localized into a ~20 cm-thick, gouge-filled core. Near the range front, active faults bite across both the hangingwall and footwall of the Mai’iu fault and record overprinting across a dying, shallow (<~1 km deep) part of the fault by more optimally oriented, steeper faults. Such depth-dependent locking up of the fault suggests it weakens primarily by friction reduction rather than cohesion loss. Outcrop-scale fractures in the exhumed footwall reflect formation in an Andersonian stress regime. Previous campaign GPS data suggest the fault slips at up to ~1 cm/yr. To improve resolution and test for aseismic creep, we installed 12 GPS sites across the fault trace in 2015. Quantitative XRD indicates the gouges were derived primarily from mafic footwall, containing up to 65% corrensite and saponite. Hydrothermal friction experiments on two gouges from a relict LANF strand were done at varying normal stresses (30-120 MPa), temperatures (50-200oC), and sliding velocities (0.3-100 μm/s). Results reveal very weak frictional strength (μ=0.13-0.15 and 0.20-0.28) and velocity-strengthening behavior conducive to fault creep. At the highest temperatures (T≥150oC) and lowest sliding velocities (<3 μm/s), a transition to velocity-weakening behavior indicates the potential for unstable slip.",

            "abstract": "Water resources in the California Central Valley face challenges due to recurring drought, aging levee systems, and nitrate contamination. As decisions are made to restore floodplain connectivity, soil microbial metabolic pathways such as denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) transform nitrate under saturated soil conditions and may each affect downstream water quality. However, few studies have quantified the contribution of all three pathways to nitrate retention in freshwater systems, and specifically in restored floodplains. Additionally, no former studies quantify the rates of these microbial nitrate transformations during floods after prolonged periods of drought. To test how flood duration impacts nitrogen cycling we added 15N-enriched tracer to soil mesocosms to measure denitrification, anammox, and DNRA transformation rates. In July 2015, we extracted seven soil mesocosms from the floodplain and riverbed of the Lower Cosumnes River in the San Joaquin Basin of California. Cosumnes River water enriched with 15N-NO3- tracer was pumped into each mesocosm at a constant rate simulating flood durations of 20 h, 30 h, and 96 h. Samples were collected from the surface water, soil pore water, drain water, and sediment for measurements of NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, gas isotopes, and DNA extraction. This study aims to demonstrate the relevance of anammox and DNRA to total nitrate retention and characterize the hydrologic conditions most favorable to each pathway.",

            "abstract": "Leaf respiration (R) represents a massive flux of carbon to the atmosphere. Currently, neither physiological models nor terrestrial biosphere models are able to disentangle sources of variation in leaf R among different plant species and contrasting environments. Similarly, such models do not adequately describe the short-term temperature (T) response of R, which can lead to inaccurate representation of leaf R in simulation models of regional and global terrestrial carbon cyling. Even minor differences in the underlying basal rate of leaf R and/or shape of the T-response curve can significantly impact estimates of carbon released and stored in ecosystems. Given this, we recently assembled and analyzed two new global databases (arctic-to-tropics) of leaf R and its short-term T-dependence. The results highlight variation in basal leaf R among species and across global gradients in T and aridity, with leaf R at a standard T (e.g. 25°C) being greatest in plants growing in the cold, dry Arctic and lowest in the warm, moist tropics. Arctic plants also exhibit higher rates of leaf R at a given photosynthetic capacity or leaf N concentration than their tropical counterparts. The results also point to convergence in the short-term temperature response of respiration across biomes and plant functional types. The applicability and significance of the short-term T-response of R for simulation models of plant and ecosystem carbon fluxes will be discussed.",

In the window between the angular resolution achievable with 8-10 meter class telescopes, and the 23-to-40 meter giants of the future, LBT provides a glimpse of what the next generation of instruments providing higher angular resolution will provide. We present first ever resolved images of an Io eruption site taken from the ground, images of Io's Loki Patera taken with Fizeau imaging at the 22.8 meter LBT [Conrad, et al., AJ, 2015]. We will also present preliminary analysis of two data sets acquired during the 2015 opposition: L-band fringes at Kurdalagon and an occultation of Loki and Pele by Europa (see figure). The light curves from this occultation will yield an order of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution along the path of ingress and egress. We will conclude by providing an overview of the overall benefit of recent and future advances in angular resolution for planetary science.",

            "abstract": "The Grand Bay estuary, situated along the border of Alabama and Mississippi, is a marine dominant estuary. Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora cover approximately 49% of the estuary (\nEleuterius and Criss, 1991\n); However, this marsh system is prone to erosion more than other marsh systems in the state (\nMississippi Department of Marine Resources 1999\n). Water level and wind-driven waves are critical factors that cause erosion in the Grand Bay estuary. Sediment transport induced by wave forces from the Gulf of Mexico and sea level rise force salt marshes to migrate landward (\nSchmid 2000\n). Understanding projected variations in vegetation can aid in productive restoration planning and coastal management decisions.\nAn integrated hydro-marsh model was developed to incorporate the dynamic interaction between tidal hydrodynamics and salt marsh system. This model projects salt marsh productivity by coupling a two-dimensional, depth-integrated ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) finite element model and a parametric marsh model (Morris et al., 2002). The model calculates marsh productivity as a function of mean low water (MLW), mean high water (MHW), and the elevation of the marsh platform. The coupling exchange process is divided into several time intervals that capture the rate of sea level rise, and update the elevation and bottom friction from the computed marsh productivity.\nAccurate description of salt marsh platform is necessary for calculating accurate biomass results (Hagen et al. 2013). Lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEM) over-estimate marsh platform elevations, but can be corrected with Real Time Kinematic (RTK) survey data (Medeiros et al., 2015). Using RTK data, the salt marsh platform was updated and included in a high resolution hydrodynamic model.\nFour projections of sea level rise (Parris et al., 2012) were used to project salt marsh productivity for the year 2100 for the Grand Bay, MS estuary. The results showed a higher productivity under low sea level rise scenario. However, lower productivity and an increase in inundated area or marsh migration was projected under the higher sea level rise scenarios. The maps and projections of hydrodynamics and marsh productivity can be used to improve restoration and management purposes for this estuary.",

            "abstract": "Phytoplankton bloom dynamics depends on the interactions of favorable physical, chemical, and biotic conditions, particularly on the available nutrients that enhance phytoplankton growth, like nitrogen. Costal and estuarine environments are heavily influenced by exogenous sources of nitrogen; the anthropogenic inputs include urban and rural wastewater coming from agricultural activities (i.e., fertilizers and animal waste). In response, new production is often enhanced, leading eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms, including harmful taxa. These events have become more frequent, and with it the interest to evaluate their effects on marine ecosystems and the impact on human health. In the Gulf of California the harmful algal blooms (HABs) had affected aquaculture, fisheries, and even tourism, thereby it is important to generate information about biological and physical factors that can influence their appearance. A numerical model is a tool that may bring key information about the origin and distribution of phytoplankton blooms. Herein the analysis is based on a three-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical model, coupled to a Nitrogen-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) model. Several numerical simulations using different forcing and scenarios are carried out in order to evaluate the processes that influence the phytoplankton growth. These numerical results are compared to available observations. Thus, the main environmental factors triggering the generation of HABs can be identified.",

Man-made sources typically have high frequency, low intensity, and propagate as surface waves. As a result attenuation restricts their measurable footprint to a small subset of sensors. Medium heterogeneities can further introduce wave front perturbations that limit processing based on travel time. We demonstrate a non-parametric technique that can reliably identify very local events within the array as a function of frequency and time without using travel-times. The approach estimates the non-zero support of the array covariance matrix and then uses network analysis tools to identify clusters of sensors that are sensing a common source. We verify the method on simulated data and then apply it to the Long Beach (CA) geophone array. The method exposes a helicopter traversing the array, oil production facilities with different characteristics, and the fact that noise sources near roads tend to be around 10-20 Hz.",

            "abstract": "Increased fire severity within boreal forests of the Siberian Arctic has the potential to alter forest stand development thereby altering carbon (C) accumulation rates and storage during the post-fire successional interval. One potential change is increased stand density, which may result from fire consumption of the soil organic layer and changes to the seedbed that favor germination and establishment of larch trees during early succession. In this study, we evaluated above- and belowground C pools across 12 stands of varying tree density within a single 75-year old fire scar located near Cherskii, Sakha Republic, Russia. In each stand, we inventoried the size and density of larch trees and large shrubs (Salix and Betula spp.), and in combination with with allometric equations, estimated aboveground contribution to C pools. We quantified woody debris C pools using the line intercept method. We sampled belowground C pools in the soil organic layer + upper (0-10 cm) mineral soil and coarse roots (> 2 mm diameter) using sediment cores and 0.25 x 0.25-m trenches, respectively. We found that high density stands store ~ 20% more C (~7,500 g C m-2) than low density stands (~5,800 g C m-2). In high density stands, about 35% more C is stored aboveground within live larch trees (1650 g C m-2) compared to low density stands (940 g C m-2), and about 15% more C is stored in the soil organic layer and upper mineral soil. Coarse root C was 20% higher in high density stands (~475 g C m-2) compared to those with low density (~350 g C m-2). Less C was stored in large shrubs in high density stands, both in aboveground portions and coarse roots, but these amounts were relatively small (< 10% of total C pools). A fire-driven shift to denser larch stands could increase C storage, leading to a negative feedback to climate, but the combined effects of density on C dynamics, summer and winter albedo, and future fire regimes will interact to determine the magnitude of any vegetation-climate feedbacks.",

There are numerous Laurentian paleomagnetic poles with ages 1150-1050 Ma. However, Siberian paleomagnetic poles for this period are virtually absent, that hampers further paleomagnetic testing of the hypothesis of Siberian- Laurentian Mesoproterosoic connection within the Rodinia. In order to develop the Late Mesoproterosoic Siberian APWP we have undertaken paleomagnetic study of red siltstone of the Totta Formation from the Belaya River valley (northern part of the Uchur-Maya region, eastern disturbed margin of the Siberian platform). The Totta Fm contain detrital zircons with younger ages ~1100 Ma and underlies the Malgina Fm with a reported Pb-Pb age is 1043+-14 Ma. Thus age of the Totta Fm can be estimated to be between 1050 and 1100 Ma. At the same time in order to estimate possible vertical axes rotations of the study area relatively to the Siberian platform we have studied limestones of the Malgina Fm, which paleomagnetic pole for the platform part of the Uchur-Maya region is well known. In our report we present new obtained data and discuss their significance for verification of the Laurentia-Siberia mesoproterosoic connection hypothesis.",

Using the three-dimensional model, the effect of pores on bulk effective elastic properties were systematically analyzed by changing the degree of porosity, the aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal pore, and the elasticity of the material. The present results in 3D space was compared with the previous ones in 2D space. Derivatives of normalized elastic stiffness constants with respect to needle-type porosity are integers, if the Poisson ratio of a matrix material is zero; those derivatives of normalized stiffness elastic constants for C33, C44, C11, and C66 converge to –1, –2, –3, and –4, respectively, at the corresponding condition. We proposed a criterion of R <~1/3, where the mutual interaction between pores becomes negligible for macroscopic composite elasticity. These derivatives are nearly constant below 5% porosity in the case of spherical pore, suggesting that the interaction between neighboring pores is insignificant if the representative size of the pore is less than one-third of the mean distance between neighboring pores. The relations we obtained in this work were successfully applied to invert bulk modulus and rigidity of Cmcm-CaIrO3 as a case study; the performance of the inverting scheme was confirmed through this assessment. Thus the present scheme is applicable to predict macroscopic elasticity of porous object as well.",

In the future, increasing concentration of human populations in areas vulnerable to ice storms such as the northeastern US will only exacerbate the impacts of these extreme events on infrastructure and society.\nQuantifying the potential impacts of global climate change on ice storm prevalence and frequency is challenging, as ice storm climatology is driven by complex and incompletely defined atmospheric processes, processes that are in turn influenced by a changing climate. This makes the underlying atmospheric and computational modeling of ice storm climatology a formidable task.\nWe propose a novel computational framework that uses sophisticated stochastic classification and feature selection algorithms to model ice storm climatology and quantify storm occurrences from both reanalysis and global climate model outputs. The framework is based on an objective identification of ice storm events by key variables derived from vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and geopotential height. Historical ice storm records are used to identify days with synoptic-scale upper air and surface conditions associated with ice storms. Evaluation using NARR reanalysis and historical ice storm records corresponding to the northeastern US demonstrates that an objective computational model with standard performance measures, with a relatively high degree of accuracy, identify ice storm events based on upper-air circulation patterns and provide insights into the relationships between key climate variables associated with ice storms.",

            "abstract": "Interplanetary shocks and solar wind dynamic pressure variations can excite intense ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves in the inner magnetosphere. An analysis of two interplanetary shocks observed by Cluster on 7 November 2004 and 30 August 2001 shows that the poloidal waves excited in these events are damped away rapidly in tens of minutes. This damping is the result of wave-particle interactions involving H+ and O+ ions with energies in the range of several to a few tens of keV [Wang et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2015]. Damping is found to be more effective in the plasmasphere boundary layer due to the relatively higher proportion of Landau resonant ions that exists in that region. In the November 2004 shock event it has been suggested that energy-dispersed ions observed travelling parallel and anti-parallel direction to the geomagnetic field immediately after the shockare locally accelerated rather than originating from Earth’s ionosphere. We use test-particle simulations to show that adiabatic advection of the particle differential flux caused bydrift-bounce-resonance with ULF waves is responsible for the energy-dispersed ions observed in these events. In the simulations,Liouville’s theorem is used to reconstruct the iondistribution function and differential flux in a model dipole magnetosphere.It is shown that flux modulations of H and O ions can be reproduced when test-particle ions are advanced in the electric fields of the 3D ULF wave model we have developed.",

            "abstract": "Plant physiology exerts a key control on the exchange of carbon and water between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere at different spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, accurate and reliable detection of variations in plant physiological functioning is critical for modeling and monitoring terrestrial carbon and water cycle. Using data from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Mission (GOME), recent studies have shown that remotely sensed solar induced fluorescence (SIF) can provide reliable information of plant physiological functioning at a large spatial scale. SIF from GOSAT and GOME, however, have coarse spatial resolution, which restricts their application in understanding spatially heterogeneous variation in gross primary productivity. Launched in 2014, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has enabled fine scale retrievals of SIF, a standard product from OCO-2. Because of the fine spatial resolution of OCO-2 SIF, it can be directly compared with eddy covariance measurement. Using field measurements, eddy covariance data, and several different complementary remotely sensed data such as land surface temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation indices we will validate and investigate spatiotemporal variations in SIF from OCO-2. Combined use of eddy covariance and meteorological measurements will help understand the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis. The focus will be on understanding the relationship between SIF and gross primary productivity at diurnal and seasonal time scale, and across different sites and ecosystems.",

Here the coupled plate interface is 20-30 km deep beneath land and can be sampled with onshore/offshore data from 3 sides. We have previously published a 2D Vp model [Henrys et al., 2013] incorporating coast-to-coast onshore-offshore transect of 50 stations and utilising first arrivals from offshore multichannel seismic (MCS) sources on either side. The transect velocity model also combined first arrivals from 800 stations with 100 m spacing recorded from 12 in-line, 500 kg onshore dynamite explosions. We have expanded the transect data to include first arrivals from the dense temporary array of 50 seismometers augmented with 25 regional GeoNet instruments together with offshore airgun sources from MCS lines crisscrossing two sides of the array.

            "abstract": "Although new records of Pleistocene climate variability have begun to emerge from speleothems in Western and Eastern Asia, much remains unknown about climate variability on centennial to millennial timescales during the last glacial and interglacial periods across the interior of West Asia. The regional climate of West Asia is governed by interactions between the Northern Hemisphere Westerly Jet, the Siberian Anticyclone and the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon, making this region highly sensitive to abrupt climate variability. Here we present the first high-resolution oxygen isotope record of two stalagmites from a cave in the semi-arid region of NW Iran. The records from Qaleh Kord Cave (QKC, 35°47'50”N, 48°51'25\"E) span between 73 kya to 127 kya and cover marine isotope stages MIS4 and MIS5. The absolute chronology of both stalagmites was established using a novel high-precision U-Th geochronometry technique with multi-collection ICP-MS. The δ18O composition of QKC stalagmites closely agree with changes in δ18O composition of the NGRIP ice core from Greenland, indicating a close atmospheric teleconnection between the climate of the North Atlantic and the interior of West Asia during this period. Because the chronology of NGRIP beyond 60 kya is calculated via numerical flow models and not directly measured, data from our stalagmites provide absolute age tie points to improve the accuracy of the deepest portion of the ice record. Furthermore, agreement between our records and those from the Soreq (Israel) and Sanbao (China) caves in West and East Asia point to a pan-Eurasian climate signal. In order to investigate the mechanisms that drive changes in climate in Western Asia on millennial timescales and examine the role of orbital characteristics and changes in insolation on atmospheric circulation and precipitation during MIS5, we present results from fully-coupled general circulation simulation CESM1 at three time slices of 80, 95, and 115 kya.",

Interpretation of sedimentary isotopic information requires a thorough understating of the environmental controls on isotopic fractionation in modern anoxic environments before being applied to the paleo-record. In this study, the relationship between ocean anoxia and the isotopic fractionation of U was investigated in the water column and sediments of the Black Sea. The Black Sea is the world’s largest anoxic basin and significant removal of U from the water column and high U accumulation rates in modern underlying sediments have been documented. Removal of U from the water column occurs during the redox transition of soluble U(VI) to relatively insoluble U(IV). The primary results of this study are two-fold. First, significant 238U/235U fractionation was observed in the water column of the Black Sea, suggesting the reduction of U induces 238U/235U fractionation with the preferential removal of 238U from the aqueous phase. Second, the 238U/235U of underlying sediments is related to the water column through the isotope fractionation factor of the reduction reaction but is influenced by mass transport processes. These results provide important constraints on the use of 238U/235U as a proxy of the redox state of ancient oceans.",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution of pore-filling authigenic minerals (cements) is highly variable and controlled in large part by the mineralogy of the cements and host sediment grains. Two end-member distributions of cements that commonly occur in sedimentary material are: (1) concretionary, in which precipitation occurred in specific zones throughout the sediment, with intervening areas largely uncemented; and (2) grain-rimming, in which precipitation occurred on grain-surfaces relatively uniformly throughout the rock. Concretions form in rocks in which sediment grains have a different composition from the cement, whereas rim cements form in those that have the same composition. Both the mechanical attributes and permeability of a given volume of rock are affected to a much greater extent by grain rimming cements, which have a significant impact on properties at even low abundances. Concretionary cements have little impact on bulk properties until relatively large volumes have precipitated (~80% cemented) and concretions begin to link up.\nPrecipitation of cement in fault zones also impacts both mechanical and hydrologic properties. Cementation will stiffen and strengthen unlithified sediment, thereby controlling the locus of fracturing in protolith or damage zones. Where fracture networks form in fault damage zones, they are initially high permeability elements. However, progressive cementation greatly diminishes fracture permeability, resulting in cyclical permeability variation linked to fault slip.\nTo quantitatively describe the interactions of groundwater flow, permeability, and patterns and abundance of cements, we use pore-scale modeling of coupled fluid flow, reactive transport, and heterogeneous mineral-surface reactions. By exploring the effects of varying distributions of porosity and mineralogy, which impact patterns of cementation, we provide mechanistic explanations of the interactions of coupled processes under various flow and chemistry conditions.",

In the solar wind near Mars, MAVEN often observes energetic quasi-sunward O+ ion jets. In the magnetosheath near the O+ ion jets event, a partial ring distribution is sometimes seen in the O+ ion VDFs. The partial ring distribution is not on a ring distribution corresponding to newly-born pickup ions but on another ring distribution corresponding to pickup ions with an initial velocity (i.e. not newly-born pickup ions). We interpret that the partial ring distribution is produced by the reflection of the precipitating O+ ions below the bow shock. After being injected into the magnetosheath and sometimes subsequently into the induced magnetosphere from the solar wind, the precipitating O+ ions are subject to the deflection by fields in these regions, and consequently, a part of precipitating O+ ions are reflected back to the solar wind with the incident energy. We find that the ion reflection preferably occurs near the subsolar region where the velocity of the shocked solar wind becomes slow (~100 km/s) and the magnetic field becomes strong (~20 nT), making the gyro radius of the precipitating O+ ions (> 10 keV) comparable to the spatial scale of the magnetosheath and the induced magnetosphere (~2000 km on the dayside). We discuss the importance of the O+ ion jets in terms of understanding the oxygen escape processes at Mars.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are often classified by deposit mass and eruption column height. How well are these eruption parameters determined in older deposits, and how well can we reduce uncertainty using robust numerical and statistical methods? We describe an efficient and effective inversion and uncertainty quantification approach for estimating eruption parameters given a dataset of tephra deposit thickness and granulometry. The inversion and uncertainty quantification is implemented using the open-source PEST++ code. Inversion with PEST++ can be used with a variety of forward models and here is applied using Tephra2, a code that simulates advective and dispersive tephra transport and deposition. The Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm is combined with formal Tikhonov and subspace regularization to invert eruption parameters; a linear equation for conditional uncertainty propagation is used to estimate posterior parameter uncertainty. Both the inversion and uncertainty analysis support simultaneous analysis of the full eruption and wind-field parameterization. The combined inversion/uncertainty-quantification approach is applied to the 1992 eruption of Cerro Negro (Nicaragua), the 2011 Kirishima-Shinmoedake (Japan), and the 1913 Colima (Mexico) eruptions. These examples show that although eruption mass uncertainty is reduced by inversion against tephra isomass data, considerable uncertainty remains for many eruption and wind-field parameters, such as eruption column height. Supplementing the inversion dataset with tephra granulometry data is shown to further reduce the uncertainty of most eruption and wind-field parameters. We think the use of such robust models provides a better understanding of uncertainty in eruption parameters, and hence eruption classification, than is possible with more qualitative methods that are widely used.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing of ocean color is a critical tool for assessing the productivity of marine ecosystems and monitoring changes resulting from climatic or environmental influences. Yet water-leaving radiance comprises less than 10% of the signal measured from space, making correction for absorption and scattering by the intervening atmosphere imperative. Traditional ocean color retrieval algorithms utilize a standard set of aerosol models and the assumption of negligible water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared. Modern improvements have been developed to handle absorbing aerosols such as urban particulates in coastal areas and transported desert dust over the open ocean, where ocean fertilization can impact biological productivity at the base of the marine food chain. Even so, imperfect knowledge of the absorbing aerosol optical properties or their height distribution results in well-documented sources of error. In the UV, the problem of UV-enhanced absorption and nonsphericity of certain aerosol types are amplified due to the increased Rayleigh and aerosol optical depth, especially at off-nadir view angles. Multi-angle spectro-polarimetric measurements have been advocated as an additional tool to better understand and retrieve the aerosol properties needed for atmospheric correction for ocean color retrievals. The central concern of the work to be described is the assessment of the effects of absorbing aerosol properties on water leaving radiance measurement uncertainty by neglecting UV-enhanced absorption of carbonaceous particles and by not accounting for dust nonsphericity. In addition, we evaluate the polarimetric sensitivity of absorbing aerosol properties in light of measurement uncertainties achievable for the next generation of multi-angle polarimetric imaging instruments, and demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of wavelength selection in the UV/VNIR range. The phase matrices for the spherical smoke particles were calculated using a standard Mie code, while those for non-spherical dust particles were calculated using the numerical approach described by Dubovik et al., 2006. A vector Markov Chain radiative transfer code including bio-optical models was used to evaluate TOA and water leaving radiances.",

            "abstract": "Multiple sources of uncertainty need to be taken into account in predicting the response of vegetation to projected future climate changes. Differences between climate models are the largest source of uncertainty in climate projections the first part of the 21st century; differences between scenarios the major source of uncertainty in the last half of the century. While these uncertainties are relatively easy to deal with, the use of ensemble averages is not appropriate because not all models are equally good. Evaluation against palaeoclimate data show that while the large-scale features of projected climates are reliable, estimates of regional climate changes may be seriously underestimated, or even of the wrong sign. Very few efforts have been made to incorporate this uncertainty into projections of future vegetation responses. Further uncertainty results from the failure of current vegetation models to account for adaptive responses of traits and allocation strategies to environment, which can result in arbitrary thresholds in simulated vegetation behavior. While there may be solutions to dealing with these sources of uncertainty, there are irreducible sources of uncertainty related to the chaotic nature of the climate system and its influence on extremes which have a disproportionate influence on vegetation responses to climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Pennsylvania Earth Science Teachers Association (PAESTA) recently initiated a podcasting series “You Asked, We Answered!” for K-12 teachers to increase their science content knowledge through short audio podcasts, supplemented with relevant resources. The 2015-2016 PAESTA President Kathy Tait generated the idea of tapping in to the content expertise of higher education faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students to assist K-12 teachers with increasing their own Earth and space content knowledge. As time and resources for professional development are decreasing for K-12 teachers, PAESTA is committed to not only providing curricular resources through our online database of inquiry-based exercises in the PAESTA Classroom, but providing an opportunity to learn science content from professionals in an audio format.\nOur goal at PAESTA has been to release at least one new podcast per month that answers the questions asked by PAESTA members. Each podcast is recorded by an Earth/space science professional with content expertise and placed online with supporting images, links, and relevant exercises found in the PAESTA Classroom. Each podcast is available through the PAESTA website (http://www.paesta.psu.edu/podcasts) and PAESTA iTunes channel (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/paesta-podcasts/id1017828453). For ADA compliance, the PAESTA website has a transcript for each audio file.\nIn order to provide these podcasts, we need the participation of both K-12 teachers and science professionals. On the PAESTA Podcast website, K-12 teachers can submit discipline questions for us to pass along to our content experts, questions relating to the “what” and “how” of the Earth and space sciences, as well as questions about Earth and space science careers. We ask science professionals for help in answering the questions posed by teachers. We include online instructions and tips to help scientists generate their podcast and supporting materials.",

            "abstract": "The active Alpine fault self-exhumes its own ductile shear zone roots and has known kinematics. Within ~1 km of the fault, the foliation is subparallel to the shear zone boundary in which it formed at amphibolite-facies conditions. Using EBSD, we analysed quartz Lattice Preferred Orientations (LPOs) of mylonites along a central part of the fault. The samples were mostly taken from naturally outcropping rocks, complemented by a few sections from core from the DFDP-2B hole—rocks that accommodated a range of finite strains and that have diverse quartz contents. All the LPOs feature a single (or strongest) girdle of c-axes hat is inclined ~28 ±4° away from the pole to the shear zone boundary (SZB) in a sense that is synthetic to the bulk shear. A point maximum of a-axes is inclined at the same angle relative to the shearing direction. This girdle is perpendicular to C’ extensional shear bands in the rock, not to the bulk shear zone boundary, whereas the <a> maximum is parallel to the slip direction of the shear bands. These relationships prevail across large variations in quartz content and finite shear strain magnitude. We infer that quartz LPOs are not always reliable indicators of SZB attitude, and they do not necessarily undergo an obvious rotation relative to the SZB as a function of increasing finite strain. Both the C’ shears and the LPOs formed as late-incremental features at orientations controlled by the instantaneous geometry of a non-simple shear flow. We suggest that that the C’ planes were aligned to planes of maximum shear-strain-rate. The data can be explained by flow in a thinning and stretching shear zone that deforms in plane strain at a Wk of ~0.7 to ~0.85. In support of this, inversions of seismic focal mechanism data yield an orientation of σ1 for the brittle crust of the central Southern Alps “natural laboratory” that approximately coincides with the predicted orientation of the contractional instantaneous stretching axis for the above-cited type of shear zone.",

            "abstract": "Given the ubiquity of nutrient constraints on primary production, an optimal carbon allocation strategy is expected to increase total below-ground allocation (fine root production and turnover, allocation to mycorrhizae and carbon exudation to the rhizophere) as CO2 concentration increases. Conversely, below-ground allocation should be reduced under low CO2 concentrations, as occurred during glacial times. Using a coupled generic primary production and tree-growth model, we quantify the changes in carbon allocation that are required to explain the apparent homoeostasis of tree radial growth during recent decades and between glacial and interglacial conditions. These results suggest a resolution of the apparent paradox of continuing terrestrial CO2 uptake (a consequence of CO2 fertilization) and the widespread lack of observed radial growth enhancement in trees. Adaptive shifts in carbon allocation are thus a key feature that needs to be accounted for in models to predict, for example, future timber yields as well as in large-scale ecosystem and carbon cycle models.",

            "abstract": "Ice-penetrating radar sounding is a powerful geophysical technique for directly imaging the near-subsurface structure of icy satellites. Scattering losses from subsurface features such as regolith, faults, or crevasses constrains the performance of radar sounders and can limit their ability to detect radar returns from subsurface features such as a global ocean. We present a systematic assessment of potential scattering loss mechanisms for radar sounding observations of Europa’s ice shell. We use a volume scattering model to evaluate losses from the Europan regolith, which is expected to be either impact-generated or tidal. While impact regolith does not extend deep enough to affect the radar signal, tidal regolith (if it exists) may be quite deep, based on thermal conductivity models. However, tidal regolith would only significantly attenuate the radar signal if it contained abundant pores at the decameter to meter scale. We also use a 1-D full-wave multi-layer scattering model to show that faults – regardless of their abundance and orientation– are unlikely to provide sufficient dielectric contrast to attenuate the radar signal. Finally, we use a rough-surface propagation model to show that vacuum-filled crevasses are not expected to have sufficient abundance to introduce significant losses. We conclude that, for the range of physical processes and material properties observed or hypothesized for Europa, scattering losses are unlikely to play a significant role in determining radar signal penetration and performance.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the contribution of rivers and streams to global freshwater methane emissions may be underestimated by at least an order of magnitude. These systems are ubiquitous features of high latitude landscapes but emissions estimates are notably lacking and poorly constrained for this region. We quantified diffusive and ebullitive methane emissions from a range of streams and rivers (upland and floodplain; headwater to main stem) of the Kolyma River Lowlands, Northeastern Siberia, using floating chambers and submerged bubble traps. The highest magnitude emissions were observed in upland headwater streams (14 mmol m-2 d-1) with 96% of the flux via diffusion. Fluxes from larger floodplain rivers were smaller (1-2 mmol m-2 d-1) with approximately 50% of the flux via ebullition. Ebullition events in these rivers were triggered by falling barometric pressure and water depth, suggesting that ebullition may be predictable and that emissions from rivers may be significantly underestimated if ebullition is not explicitly considered. Scaling our fluxes to their corresponding stream size classes in a 1900 km2 region of the Kolyma Lowlands, we estimate a total annual flux of 0.5 Gg CH4-C per year from streams and rivers alone, which, when compared to 11 Gg CO2-C emissions from streams and rivers in the same region, accounts for more than 50% of the combined radiative forcing. Our study highlights the regional importance of riverine methane emissions and the pressing need to quantify both high latitude stream area and open-water duration to facilitate broader scaling and the incorporation of field-based riverine methane fluxes into pan-arctic/subarctic and global methane budgets.",

Suomi NPP VIIRS surface type environmental data record (EDR) product, which inherited the development of MODIS land cover products from the NASA’s EOS mission, provides consistent global land cover classification information in 1-km resolution. Although the S-NPP VIIRS sensor has different specification with those from MODIS, the development of the new NPP surface type EDR basically followed the same processes used in the creation of the MODIS collection 5 land cover products. NPP VIIRS daily surface reflectance data were composited into monthly data, and then annual metrics, and a C5.0 decision tree classifier was used to generate the global gridded surface type classification map in the 17 classes IGBP scheme. Besides the static surface type classification map, the surface type EDR also included the dynamic snow/ice, active fire, and vegetation fraction data for every VIIRS observation, which is a major difference to the MODIS land cover products. The validation of the new VIIRS surface type product also followed the same protocol that was used by the MODIS collection 5 land cover product. Stratified random sampling was used to collect validation sites, and high resolution imagery from Google Earth/Map was used as the major reference in visual interpretations. Preliminary validation results showed that 73.92% classification accuracy has been achieved, which exceeds the product’s required 70% threshold.",

            "abstract": "The application of stable isotopes in conjunction with detailed mapping of the dextral Steelhead Lake shear zone (SLSZ) in the central Sierra Nevada reveals a complex fluid history as the system transitioned from ductile-to-brittle behavior at shallow crustal depth in response to cooling of the adjacent Tuolumne Batholith (TB) at ~85 Ma. This system has a multi-stage alteration history that includes: (1) ductiley deformed tourmaline-bearing leucogranite dikes, (2) ductile-to-brittle quartz+tourmaline veins, (3) brittle calc-silicate-rich leach zones, and (4) 1-10-m-thick quartz veins with crack-seal textures. High and variable quartz δ18O values (> +13‰) from metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Saddlebag pendant outside the SLSZ indicate metamorphic fluids at low water/rock ratio. Leucogranite dikes associated with the TB have δ18O (plagioclase = +9.5±0.3‰) and δD (~ –80‰) values consistent with magmatic fluids. Quartz+tourmaline veins that record the ductile-to-brittle transition display a range of δ18O values (quartz: +3.4 to +16.4‰; tourmaline: +8.0‰) that indicate a complex fluid system involving magmatic, metamorphic, and meteoric-hydrothermal fluids. Variable mineral δ18O (–1.5 to +11.3‰) and δD (–140 to –77‰) values from the Sawmill Sequence calc-silicates and Koip Sequence metavolcanics are the product of a fluid system with magmatic (TB) and meteoric-hydrothermal end-member sources, with lowest values found within a pull-apart zone and the highest values are outside this zone. Quartz δ18O (–3.2 to +14.5‰) and fluid inclusion δD values (–137 to –79‰) define a mixing line with magmatic (TB) and meteoric-hydrothermal water end members for the crack-seal veins. Detailed studies of one 10-m-thick vein reveal a trend of decreasing isotope values from the margin to the median plane. Most mineral pairs failed to reach isotopic equilibrium, indicating a very complex and short-lived fluid evolution for this system. This study documents the opening up of a strike-slip fault system to surface-derived fluids as the SLSZ evolved through the ductile-to-brittle transition, providing insight into the role of such fluids in the earthquake process.",

Decisions are currently being made regarding how to best configure both the specific model to be used, as well as the overall workflow that will be established. The initial focus of the routine modeling will be shallow convection at the ARM megasite in Oklahoma with a vision toward expanding the modeling to include other meteorological conditions once the routine modeling has been established. This presentation outlines the modeling portion of the workflow that includes generation of multiple forcing datasets and ensemble LES runs. The goal of the ensembles is to gauge the uncertainty of the forcings from event-to-event and to help derive a best estimate representation of the atmosphere over the megasite. This will then be used to construct “data cubes” that combine observations with the model output. A companion presentation by Vogelmann et al. presents the data cube concept that optimizes usage of observations with the LES.",

            "abstract": "Constraining seismic properties of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities is crucial for understanding the mantle composition and dynamics. One approach to study the transition zone is to use the “triplicated” arrivals of seismic data. When a wavefield encounters an abrupt increase in wave speed with depth, three different phases, direct, reflected, and transmitted phases, result, and they can arrive at the same distance, producing the triplicated arrivals. Properties of the triplication pattern provide constraints on the depth and velocity jump of the discontinuities.\nOne of the challenging aspects of using the triplication data, however, is to identify the three individual phases, since they arrive close in time and the waveforms often overlap. In order to separate the phases, we apply Radon transform to the data. Based on the transformed data, the caustics are identified, and the depth and the velocity jump of the discontinuities are obtained.\nThis method is applied to study the Kuril subduction zone, beneath a region northeast of Japan. We take advantage of the High-Sensitivity Seismograph Network in Japan that consists of more than 700 stations, to capture the triplication pattern with dense sampling in distance. Given the distribution of the stations, deep and intermediate earthquakes in the Sea of Okhotsk region that are located within the triplication distance range are considered. We constrain the percentage velocity jump and depth of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities. The discontinuity depth estimates show significant deviations from the global average, but are, in general, comparable to the SS precursors and tomographic studies of the region.",

            "abstract": "We present the first constraints on transient fluid flow using the novel application of apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry (AHe) in the geothermally active Dixie Valley area of central Nevada, western United States. The valley is bound to the west by a high angle normal fault, along which the adjacent Stillwater Range has been recently exhumed in the footwall. Zones of elevated shallow geothermal gradients (geothermal anomalies) occur in dilational corners along the range front and therefore make Dixie Valley an ideal site to test the sensitivity of the AHe thermochonometer to fluid flow in the shallow crust. Apatites yield (U-Th)/He ages ca. 0.2-16 Ma and three elevation transects record advective cooling of the footwall during exhumation commencing at 3-5 Ma. Many AHe ages are significantly younger (<4 Ma) and do not overlap exhumational cooling ages within error. Consequently, the younger AHe ages are distinguishable as hydrothermally reset and demonstrate the ability of this method to resolve conductive cooling ages from overprinted, fluid-reheated cooling ages. Interpolation of AHe ages shows that the youngest ages correspond with remarkable accuracy to the spatial extents of previously mapped geothermal anomalies. The capability of the AHe thermochronometer to constrain the timing and location of paleofluid flow recommends this technique as a powerful and cost-effective tool in geothermal exploration and petroleum systems evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Arctic Regions are experiencing an unprecedented rate of environmental and climate change. The active layer (the uppermost layer of soil between the atmosphere and permafrost that freezes in winter and thaws in summer) is sensitive to both climate and environmental changes and plays an important role in the functioning of Arctic ecosystems, planning, and economic activities. Knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of ALT is crucial for environmental and engineering applications.\nThe objective of this study is to provide the methodology to model and estimate spatio-temporal variation in the active layer thickness (ALT) at several sites located in the Circumpolar region spanning the Alaska North Slope, and to demonstrate its use in spatio-temporal interpolation as well as time-forward prediction.\nIn our data analysis we estimate a parametric trend and examine residuals for the presence of spatial and temporal dependence. We propose models that provide a description of residual space-time variability in ALT. Formulations that take into account interaction among spatial and temporal components are also developed. Moreover, we compare our models to naive models in which residual spatio-temporal and temporal correlations are not considered. The predicted root mean squared and absolute errors are significantly reduced when our approach is employed.\nWhile the methodology is developed in the context of ALT, it can also be applied to model and predict other environmental variables which use similar spatio-temporal sampling designs.",

            "abstract": "A common method to calculate the space plasma parameters is by fitting observed phase space densities using known distributions. In some cases the phase space density of the plasma is directly derived from the observations, while in other cases a forward modeling of the instrument’s response is used to fit the measured energy spectrograms. In both scenarios, the modeled plasma distribution fits the measurements to estimate the plasma parameters. The distribution function is often assumed to be Maxwellian even though the plasma is better described by a kappa distribution. In this work we show that if the plasma is described by a kappa distribution, the derived temperature assuming Maxwell distribution can be significantly off. More specifically, we derive plasma temperature by fitting Maxwell distribution to pseudo-data produced by kappa distribution and we examine the difference of the derived temperature as a function of the kappa index. We further consider the concept of using a forward model of a typical plasma instrument to fit its observations. We find that the error of the derived temperature is shown to be depended on the instrument’s field of view, the kappa index, and the temperature itself.",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage allows reductions of the rapidly rising CO2 from fossil fuel-based power generation, if large storage rates and capacities can be achieved. The injection of large fluid volumes at high rates leads to a build-up of pore-pressure in the storage formation that may induce seismicity and compromise the storage security. Many natural CO2 fields in midcontinent US, in contrast, are under-pressured rather than over-pressured suggesting that natural processes reduce initial over-pressures and generate significant under-pressures. The question is therefore to understand the sequence of process(es) that allow the initial over-pressure to be eliminated and the under-pressure to be maintained over geological periods of time.\nWe therefore look into pressure evolution in Bravo Dome, one of the largest natural CO2 accumulations in North America, which stores 1.3 Gt of CO2. Bravo Dome is only 580-900 m deep and is divided into several compartments with near gas-static pressure (see Figure). The pre-production gas pressures in the two main compartments that account for 70% of the mass of CO2 stored at Bravo Dome are more than 6 MPa below hydrostatic pressure.\nHere we show that the under-pressure in the Bravo Dome CO2 reservoir is maintained by hydrological compartmentalization over millennial timescales and generated by a combination of processes including cooling, erosional unloading, limited leakage into overlying formations, and CO2 dissolution into brine. Herein, we introduce CO2 dissolution into brine as a new process that reduce gas pressure in a compartmentalized reservoir and our results suggest that it may contribute significantly to reduce the initial pressure build-up due to injection.\nBravo Dome is the first documented case of pressure drop due to CO2 dissolution. To have an accurate prediction of pressure evolution in Bravo Dome, our models must include geomechanics and thermodynamics for the reservoir while they account for the pressure changes due to the CO2 dissolution.",

            "abstract": "Global food production crucially depends on phosphorus (P). In agricultural and urban landscapes, much P is anthropogenic, entering via trade, and then can be transported by a combination of fluvial and human processes. To date there have been few long-term, large-scale analyses combining both fluvial and human modes of P transport. Here we present reconstructed historical records of anthropogenic P entering and leaving soils and aquatic systems via a combination of trade, infrastructure, food waste, and fluvial fluxes. We then report the net annual P inputs, and the mass of P that has accumulated over the long-term, for entire river basins. Our analyses reveal rapid historical P accumulation for two mixed agricultural-urban landscapes (Thames Basin, UK, Yangtze Basin, China), and one rural agricultural landscape (Maumee Basin, USA). We also show that the human P fluxes massively dominate over the fluvial fluxes in these large basins. For Thames and Maumee Basins, recently there has been modest P depletion/drawdown of the massive P pool accumulated in prior decades, whereas the Yangtze Basin has consistently and rapidly accumulated P since 1980. These first estimates of the magnitude of historical P accumulation in contrasting settings illustrate the scope of management challenges surrounding the storage, fate, exploitation, and reactivation of legacy P that is currently present in the Earth’s critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Micro-brecciation, or pulverization, is recognized as a fundamental component of the architecture and damage products of many large faults, although the precise mechanisms to produce this damage are debated, with both compressive and tensile mechanisms proposed. We characterized several sites along the San Jacinto fault, southern California, where the total depth of exhumation for the life history of the fault can be determined, to study the confining stresses required for pulverization. In basement rock near Anza, where exhumation is less than 100 m, granitic dikes injected into schist of the Burnt Valley Complex are pulverized out to several meters from the fault core, whereas the schist is brecciated at the macro-scale and contains narrow centimeter-thick seams of black cataclasite. Similar relationships are observed in Horse Canyon, which is exhumed about 400 m below a regional Tertiary erosion surface, where granitic dikes emplaced into schist are pulverized out to distances of several tens of meters from the fault core. These observations imply that very low confining stress is required for micro-brecciation in granitic rock.\nUnconsolidated sandstones (alluvial fan deposits) along the SJF in Rock House Canyon are undeformed where the deposits are exhumed by about 70 m, but show incipient pulverization (high-density, sub-grain cracking) at 120 m depth of exhumation. Cracks oriented perpendicular to the fault formed in individual quartz and feldspar grains out to a few meters from the fault core. These observations suggest that the confining stress required for onset of pulverization in unconsolidated deposits is on the order of 2-2.5 MPa. As the tensile strength of quartz is an order of magnitude higher than these confining stresses, the most likely mechanism that is producing this damage is dynamic compressive stresses during passage of the rupture front.",

            "abstract": "Bottom deposits of oceans, seas and lakes are long term carbon sinks - particulate organic carbon falls to the bottom where it is covered by sediments and preserved by anoxic conditions. However, the upper horizons of these deep sediments (‘active layer’) interact with bottom waters through diffusion, bubbling of gasses and bioturbation and can thus also act as temporary carbon sources given favorable environment conditions.\nOxygen diffusion is the main factor that limits organic decomposition in bottom deposits.\nDepth of diffusion depends on porosity of sediments and rates of oxygen consumption in the upper horizons. Amplified organic rain leads to higher oxygen demand and, consequently, to a thinner oxic horizon in the bottom sediments. Declined ocean productivity, in contrast, allows oxygen to diffuse deeper into the bottom sediments and remobilizes previously preserved carbon. Therefore a substantial decline in ocean productivity during glacial periods could cause ocean sediments to shift abruptly from a carbon sink to a considerable carbon source.\nTo estimate the effects of the phenomena described above, we present a model of the dynamics and vertical distribution of organic carbon in ocean sediments that considers the input of organic rain, sediments porosity, oxygen availability, rates of sedimentation to the ocean floor and bioturbation. The model enables quantification of bulk carbon storage, carbon distribution within the ‘active layer’, and the flux of carbon from the upper sediment horizons to deeper deposits as sediments accumulate on the ocean floor.\nApplying our model, we find that during glacial periods, decreased ocean productivity led to the mobilization of old carbon previously stored within anoxic horizons. Under this scenario, carbon transfer from sediments to ocean waters would have exceeded 10 kg/m2. Our study therefore, suggests that the ocean floor is not merely a passive buffer in the global carbon cycle, but instead an active pool which played an important role in the past.",

            "abstract": "High-precision 3D imaging with lidar and structure-from-motion photogrammetry is revolutionizing the collection of post-earthquake displacement information. Massive point-cloud datasets, and their differences epoch to epoch, provide valuable information for scientific, engineering, and emergency response, and also pose challenges to process, handle, analyze, share, and visualize. In the physical world, earthquake surface ruptures and secondary deformation features are ephemeral, subject to natural degradation by erosion, or to repair of the built environment. Post-earthquake 3D imaging overcomes this limitation by virtually archiving the primary surface expression of deformation. This allows geologists make precise, repeatable measurements, and to assess subtle, distributed deformation often missed by traditional field methods. Generally, the more local and inexpensive the technique, the quicker that a response can be organized: ground and drone-based SfM (hours), terrestrial laser scanning (days), to airborne lidar (weeks). With the growth of high-resolution topography along fault zones and for other mapping purposes, it is increasingly likely that a large earthquake will coincide with an existing data set. Such an event beholds the exciting promise of point cloud differencing to develop a high-resolution, fully three dimensional displacement and rotation field. Existing paired airborne lidar data sets from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, and California reveal new and informative features of earthquake-induced near-field deformation, but also illustrate that significant challenges impede the separation a tectonic signal from noise and uncertainty within lidar data. In a future earthquakes, there will be great opportunities, and soon enough, an imperative, to measure deformation at sub-meter resolution over entire cities, and along faults hundreds of kilometers in length. As a community, we stand at a threshold, watching this oncoming deluge of repeat and ubiquitous high resolution topography.",

Earth System models include the source, emission, transport and deposition phases of the dust cycle.\nIn addition to direct radiative forcing contributions, mineral dust impacts include indirect radiative forcing, modification of the albedo and melting rates of snow and ice, kinetics of tropospheric photochemistry, formation and deposition of acidic aerosols, supply of nutrients to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and impact on human health and safety.\nWe demonstrate the ability to map mineral dust source composition in the Salton Sea dust source region with imaging spectroscopy measurements acquired as part of the NASA HyspIRI preparatory airborne campaign.

Units III and IV have inversely graded bases and massive tops and are composed of angular to spiny iridescent and mixed iridescent and oxidized angular clasts, respectively. Xenoliths are rare in all units (<0.1%): sedimentary xenoliths are consistent with the known shallow country rock (Moenkopi and Kaibab Fms); magmatic xenoliths are pumiceous rhyolite mingled with basalt. Unit II is less sideromelane rich (20%) than Units I, III, and IV (60–80%). Above these units are at least two more coarse tephra-fall units. Variably preserved ash and fine-lapilli laminae cap the tephra blanket. This deposit is highly susceptible to reworking, and likely experienced both syn- and post-eruptive aeolian redistribution. It appears as either well sorted, alternating planar-parallel beds of ash and fine lapilli with rare wavy beds, or as cross- or planar-bedded ash. The tephra blanket as a whole is stratigraphically underlain by a fissure-fed lava flow and lapilli-fall units are intercalated with two larger flows.\nMean grain size is coarsest in Unit I but coarsens in Units II–IV. Units I, III, and IV are moderately to poorly sorted with no skew. Unit II is better sorted and more coarse-skewed. Units I and III are slightly more platykurtic than II and IV. Without considering possible spatial effects introduced by dispersion patterns, bootstrap ANOVA confidence intervals suggest at least Unit II sorting and skewness are from distinct populations. Isopachs indicate Units I and II were associated with a 10-km-long fissure source. After or during Unit II’s deposition, activity localized to Sunset Crater. Units III and IV were emplaced with waxing to sustained activity, and followed by at least two more sustained episodes. Two lava flows began effusing from the cone during this period and remained active after explosive activity ceased. Primary tephra deposition ended with a period of small discrete explosions.",

Due to coastal upwelling and limited water flow, the Puget Sound ecosystem is naturally high in CO2 and seasonally low in DO, making it particularly susceptible to increased acidification and hypoxia. Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister) are both ecologically and economically important to the Puget Sound region. To investigate the threat of low pH and DO to C. magister behavior, megalopae and juveniles were exposed to current and predicted future levels of pH and DO. Juveniles were then placed in a dark container with a single bright light, and movement and phototaxis were studied during three-minute trials. We hypothesized that low pH and low DO conditions would alter phototactic behaviors of juvenile C. magister, through changes in neurotransmission and metabolism. C. magister reared in control (High pH-High DO) conditions spent a greater proportion of their time near the light, and were significantly more likely to touch the light during the three-minute trial, as compared to juveniles in the other treatment conditions. These results suggest that future predicted CO2 and DO conditions in Puget Sound could disrupt the behavioral and cognitive abilities of juvenile crabs, leading to decreased survival and recruitment in the C. magister population. Given the importance of C. magister to the Puget Sound, these population changes could have significant ecological and economic implications for the region.",

            "abstract": "Early studies of sediment transport, such as those of Gilbert (1914) and Shields (1936), laid the groundwork for countless other studies of bed load entrainment and transport. Gilbert and Shields emphasized somewhat different aspects of sediment transport in their writing, but they had similar objectives in experimenting with conditions that affect both incipient motion and bed load transport capacity. The problem of predicting incipient motion is thus inextricably linked to the problem of predicting bed load transport capacity. In this talk I will discuss field-based approaches for evaluating incipient motion at channel-length scales ranging from a few km to many 10s of km. In the best-case scenario, where time and equipment are available to sample the bed load, the most robust approach for determining incipient motion is to extrapolate from measurements taken over a range of flows, and find the shear stress corresponding to a low but measureable transport rate. Alternatively, if channel properties (width, depth, slope and grain size) can be measured at a sufficient number of locations (say, more than 20), the reference shear stress can be estimated by assuming it scales with the channel-forming (bankfull) shear stress. Another new approach, which makes use of repeat aerial LiDAR and records of daily discharge, is to develop a two-parameter sediment rating curve that produces the same sediment flux for a time series of daily flows as the sediment flux estimated from topographic differencing. Last, in situations where a qualitative (yes/no) assessment of sediment motion is sufficient (e.g. during a reservoir release), longitudinal variations in bed load transport intensity can be detected with acoustical sensors- hydrophones- mounted on a kayak or boat equipped with a global positioning system (GPS). Pros and cons of these different approaches will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that subglacial discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) may have the potential to be a significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere in a warming world (Ryu and Jacobson, 2011). To trace the flux, sources of, and controls on subglacial CO2, we sampled the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua River subglacial portal, which receives water from the Isunnguata and Russell Glaciers, west GrIS, six times throughout June – August, 2014. Additionally, we sampled two nearby supraglacial streams. We present preliminary data on pCO2 values, DIC and DOC concentrations, major cation and anion concentrations, δ13CDIC isotopes, as well as ∆14C-DIC and -DOCisotopes.\nWaters emerging from the subglacial portal are 2 – 2.5x supersaturated in CO2 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium. pCO2 values rise from ~700 to 1000ppm between June and July then return to ~700ppm in August. Although subglacial pCO2 and ∆14CDIC values vary, throughout the summer they exhibit similar trends as contemporaneous supraglacial stream values, suggesting that subglacial CO2 is at least partially derived from supraglacial meltwater which has accessed the ice sheet base through moulins and crevasses. δ13CDIC isotopes of supraglacial streams are highly depleted (-24‰), suggesting that CO2 is sourced from microbial respiration of surficial organic carbon. Subglacial portal δ13CDIC isotopes are also relatively depleted (-17‰) but are sufficiently different relative to supraglacial streams so as to require an additional δ13CDIC enriched source. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.89, n= 6) between subglacial Ca+Mg concentrations and alkalinity (≈ HCO3) suggests that the additional source of DIC to these waters is dissolution of carbonate. Finally, the correlation (R2 = 0.55, n = 6) between subglacial pCO2 and ∆14CDOC values suggest that one control on variable CO2 concentrations throughout the melt season is the age, and presumably, the lability, of organic carbon available to microbes.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is a rapid interval of global warming that occurred ~56 Ma. The PETM is characterized by an abrupt increase in mean annual temperature and decreased latitudinal temperature gradient. Resulting circulation changes likely modified the hydrologic cycle impacting spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, fluvial sedimentation, and continental runoff. The goal of this study is to evaluate PETM global warming as an allogenic forcing on fluvial systems in the Huerfano Basin in southern Colorado as a point of comparison to other Laramide basins.\nHuerfano Basin is a Laramide structural basin comprising the northernmost extension of the Raton Basin. Huerfano Basin is located to the south and east of previously identified PETM records in the Bighorn, Axehandle, and Piceance basins. Alluvial deposits of the Poison Canyon and Cuchara formations are exposed along the western basin margin and are of known Paleocene–Eocene age. Depauperate biostratigraphic data place the Paleocene–Eocene boundary near the contact between the two formations. Globally, the PETM is identifiable by a distinctive negative carbon isotope excursion in terrestrial and marine strata. In the Huerfano Basin, initial bulk organic carbon isotope analyses presented herein yield isotope ratios suggestive of other terrestrial records.\nA prominent basal conglomerate in the Cuchara Formation is approximately coeval with the isotope excursion values. These observations suggest sedimentation in Huerfano Basin responded similarly to Bighorn and Piceance basins as the PETM generated pulses of coarse-grained alluvial lithofacies. However, the grain-sizes mobilized in Huerfano Basin are significantly coarser. Potentially this reflects the proximity to the Mississippi Embayment, the primary moisture source at the time. Overall this southern locality will allow systematic geographic comparisons in the hydrologic cycle response to the PETM in North America.",

            "abstract": "Long-term changes in the water budget of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau due to climate change are of great interest not only for the importance of water management, but also for the critical challenge due to the lack of observations. There were no any meteorological observation stations or hydrological stations in many lake basins in the Tibetan Plateau. Some publications in the literature concerned about the climate, environment and hydrogeological factors. But the continuous long time series of lake level and water storage haven’t been acquired and the hydrological simulation with higher accuracy is lack. Multisensoral remote sensing is a valuable method to gather the necessary water budget components with appropriate spatial coverage and with high temporal resolutions.\nLong-term changes of lake water area and volume depend on the changes of lake water budget. Evaporation is an important item of water expenditure. And the lake evaporation is essential to analysis the water balance response to climate change. Quantification of hydrologic fluxes, including evaporation, also is required to address issues related to water quality, recreation, and ecological processes. Accurate measurements of evaporation were required as part of a long-term study of hydrological and ecological processes at lakes in TP.\nIn the present study the evaporations of eight lakes in TP were calculated using energy balance method during 1981 to 2010. And the mean annual evaporation during 1981 to 2010 for Nam Co, Dangre Yumco, Zhari Namco, Taro Co, Mapang Yumco, Peiku Co, Pumo Yumco, Chen Co is 1261.46mm, 1276.06mm, 1393.88mm, 1361.43mm, 1460.29mm, 1181.82mm and 1397.94mm, respectively.",

            "abstract": "In contrast to the canonical eastern Pacific (EP) event, a new type of El Niño, named as central Pacific (CP) event with the warming center locating at the central equatorial Pacific, has been identified in recent years. In this study, we examine the relationship between these two types of ENSOs. Negative correlations between them is found to be up to more than 0.5 with statistical significance at α=0.01 level when the EP index leads the CP one about 20~22 months during the last 35 years, which are also evident in the related atmospheric and oceanic fields. We argue the possible mechanism for the appearance of this relationship lies in the mean climate change in the north extra-tropical Pacific in the last three decades, during which period the mean zonal wind became stronger due to the strengthening of the Subtropical High. Meanwhile, the NPO-like sea level pressure pattern, which forms during the decaying of the cold EP event, induces extratropical SST warm anomalies via surface heat fluxes. Because of the enhancement of the so-called wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback associated with the stronger mean zonal wind, these extratropical warming anomalies can be transported to the equatorial band more effectively, which eventually leads to the trigger of a CP-like event. In addition, the eastward expansion of the west Pacific warm pool since 1985 makes the central equatorial Pacific more sensitive to induce deep convection over there, providing a favorable circumstance for the CP regime. Considering the CP and CP-like events only become prevalent in recent decades and its distinct dynamics from the EP events, we speculate that this kind of relationship is a tropical reflection of extratropical climate change under the warming background in the central Pacific. How these kinds of mean state change happened and their relationship with the global climate change and changes in the sea/land thermal gradient in the last three decades need further research.",

            "abstract": "Recent improvements in mapping human populations and development provide increasingly detailed perspectives on human settlement in proximity to potentially active volcanoes. Small and Naumann (2001) used a gridded compilation of census data circa 1990 to estimate that ~ 9% of the world’s population lived within 100 km of a historically active volcano and ~12% within a volcano believed to have been active during the Holocene. In this paper we update these estimates , using much more detailed census data circa 2010 from a preliminary release of the Gridded Population of the World version 4 (GPWv4) that will be distributed through NASA-SEDAC. Spatial analyses of these data in conjunction with the Holocene volcano database of Simkin and Siebert (1994) indicate that circa 2010 the estimated numbers of people living within 10 km (n=44,874,105), 50 km (n=443,637,182), and 100 km (n=853,108,062) of a volcano active within the Holocene period are larger than the estimates of Small and Naumann (2001). We attribute the higher recent estimates to improvements in the spatial resolution of GPWv4 compared to GPWv1 used in the earlier study. As we are not able to determine if the population in proximity to volcanoes has increased since 1990 using census data alone, we also use DMSP-OLS and VIIRS satellite observations of night light to quantify changes in lighted development in these areas. The new data provide considerably greater detail than those used by Small and Naumann (2001), though the global patterns do not differ significantly. While the quantified spatial relationships between global human population and recent volcanism can have both local and global utility, they may be most pertinent not as a global assessment of volcanic risk but as a comparative study of population distributions in volcanic environments.",

The thermal infrared (TIR) band of Thermal and Near-infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) on board the GOSAT has observed CO2 and CH4 profiles. We have analyzed the four-year data from 2010 through 2013 of the latest released version of the TIR Level 2 (L2) CO2 and CH4 products (V1.0). Comparisons of the TIR upper atmospheric CO2 product with CO2 data from Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace Gases by Airliner (CONTRAIL) aircraft measurements show that the growth rate estimated from the TIR CO2 data is slightly lower than that from the CONTRAIL data. Overall, the TIR V1.0 CO2 product has better quality in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere than the a priori judging from comparisons with the collocated aircraft data. In spring and summer, however, the quality of the TIR L2 CO2 products became slightly worse than in the other seasons, especially in the low and northern-mid latitudes. This is because the corresponding a priori had a larger bias and the TIR Level 1B (L1B) radiance spectra might have a larger bias in the spring-summer seasons. Here, we have tested several types of correction methods to modify the L1B spectral bias, and then compared CO2 and CH4 concentrations retrieved after applying spectral bias correction factors with coincident CONTRAIL and HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observation (HIPPO) aircraft data. The comparison results suggest that the L1B spectral bias correction factor should be changed depending on wavelength. In addition, it should be expressed as a function of on-board internal calibration blackbody temperatures. This is because they are weak season-dependent parameters; they were clearly lower in spring and summer.",

            "abstract": "In strike-slip systems, the orientation of bedding influences local fault zone architecture. New 1:5,000 and smaller scale mapping of a paleoseismic shear zone in the central eastern Sierra Nevada, California, provides insight into the behavior of strike-slip faults deforming like-oriented bedding at a dextral shearing, pseudotachylyte-bearing brittle-ductile transition (BDT) in the Sawmill Canyon/Saddlebag Lake segment of the Sierra Crest shear zone. In and near this map area, a strike-slip duplex system, a Riedel shear system, and shear zone-parallel major fault strands all comprise a heavily quartz and silicate vein-sealed, brittle, and partially ductilely overprinted fault system. The strike-slip duplex system is defined by spectacular restraining and releasing bend duplex geometries. New and published stable isotopic compositions of these veins (𝛿18O = +14.5 to –3.2‰) and their fluid inclusions (𝛿D = –79 to –137‰) monitor mixing between three fluid sources. The main mixing trend includes an earlier local (likely hot magmatic) to a later distal (likely cool meteoric) fluid source over time.\nWe interpret the following. (1) Strike-slip faulting subparallel to stratigraphy at the BDT can result in strike-slip duplexes and semi-ductile Riedel shears. As planar mechanical anisotropies are folded, continued offset of the fold requires either rotation of the material about an axis, or extension of the inverted limb. In homogeneous units, rotation becomes exceedingly difficult with thickness. Thus the folded material may be subjected to enhanced tension relative to outside limbs, which in turn nucleates shear zone-subparallel lateral ramps along which folds are transported. (2) This mechanism may promote the fault-assisted descent of fluids from the surface to the seismogenic base of contractional arc crust, where earlier deformation has transposed stratigraphy toward the shear plane in a simple or transpressive wrench shear zone. (3) Duplex fractures in both restraining and releasing bends can be sinks for descending hydrothermal fluids.",

            "abstract": "The future productivity of this world depends upon how ecosystems respond to the changing environment. It is generally expected that the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere should stimulation biomass production, especially in semi-arid or seasonally dry environments. However, many experiments in grassland systems have shown clearly that the effect of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on biomass production varies substantially among years, with the eCO2 effect varying from strongly positive to strongly negative across years. Recently, we demonstrated that the eCO2 effect on biomass in one such highly-variable system (the TasFACE experiment) can be explained very accurately by the seasonal distribution of rainfall, with more rainfall in summer leading to eCO2 stimulation of biomass and more rainfall in spring or autumn reducing the eCO2 effect. Thus, the overall impact of eCO2 on net primary productivity in such systems depends upon the seasonal rainfall balance, not the total amount that falls. Here, we use the relationship derived from the TasFACE experiment to simulate biomass production and the eCO2 effect using both historical and projected future rainfall patterns. We also compare the projections from this simple, experimentally-derived empirical relationship with those from a more complex, mechanistic ecosystem model that accurately predicts current biomass production in this system. Both sets of projections show that both historical and future rainfall variability substantially influence the simulated eCO2 effect, but the mechanistic model fails to predict the negative effects of eCO2 on biomass production. It is probable that linkages between rainfall and soil nitrogen availability are not sufficiently captured in the mechanistic model and that this influences the projections of ecosystem productivity. Such effects need to be captured in mechanistic models if we are to improve our ability to predict and model future land-atmosphere feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "The National Weather Service StormReady Supporter program exists to give schools, companies, TV stations, and other facilities the opportunity to earn recognition for their weather preparedness and awareness. Requirements to earn StormReady Supporter status include having a facility warning point, use of NOAA Weather Radios, and weather hazard Emergency Operation Plans. Despite the increasing importance of weather preparedness in schools, only 1.2% of Minnesota schools are deemed StormReady by the National Weather Service. It was determined that the major impedance for schools becoming StormReady Supporters is the lack of time for administrators to engage in anything “extra” beyond their listed duties. As part of a 2015 Hollings Scholar project, the StormReady in a Box concept was developed to remedy this, by empowering teachers and students to take charge and complete the StormReady Supporter application for their school. StormReady in a Box is a project developed for Junior High School students to learn about weather preparedness and to help their school acquire StormReady status. The project was designed to be relevant to the Minnesota State Education Standards in Science, be simple for teachers to do with their students, and most importantly, to be enjoyable for Junior High School age students to do. The project was also designed to enhance critical thinking skills and logical reasoning abilities, as they relate to the StormReady Supporter application. This presentation will present the overall rationale for the undertaking of this project, the creation of, and the logical next steps for the StormReady in a Box project.",

            "abstract": "Proppant, such as sand, is injected during hydraulic fracturing to maintain fracture aperture and conductivity. Proppant performance is a complex result of fluid flow, discrete particle mechanics and geomechanical deformation. We present investigations into these phenomena at scales ranging from millimeters to meters.\nTraditionally, the design goal for proppant placement is uniform distribution by using viscous carrier fluids that keep the proppant suspended and maintain conductivity over the full area of the fracture. Large volume hydraulic fracturing in shales typically use low viscosity fluids, resulting in proppant settling out from the carrier fluid. Consequently, the proppant occupies the lower portion of the fracture. In addition, many shale plays host natural fractures that take up injected carrier fluid, but may not develop sufficient aperture to accommodate proppant. We present simulations investigating natural development of heterogeneity in proppant distribution within fracture networks due to settling and network flow.\nIn addition to natural development of heterogeneity, the petroleum industry has sought to engineer heterogeneity to generate isolated propped portions of the fracture that maintain aperture in adjacent, open channels. We present two examples of such heterogeneous proppant placement (HPP) technologies. The first involves pulsating proppant at the wellhead and the second utilizes a homogenous composite fluid that develops heterogeneity spontaneously through hydrodynamic instabilities. We present simulation results that compare these approaches and conclude that spontaneous creation of heterogeneity has distinct geomechanical advantages. Finally, we present simulations at the scale of individual proppant particles that emphasize the complexity of dynamic instabilities and their influence upon proppant fate.\nDisclaimer: This work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Earth's continents exhibit striking properties, including relatively thick and low-density crust and a strong, thick, long-lived mantle lithosphere. Major questions related to the formation, stability, evolution, and dynamics of cratonic lithosphere remain unanswered. One promising avenue for understanding the stability of cratonic lithosphere through geologic time is to understand how their margins are deformed via tectonic processes such as orogenesis and rifting. Here we present results of several recent and ongoing studies which aim to constrain past lithospheric deformation along the eastern margin of the North American craton. Each of these studies focuses on constraining seismic anisotropy, or the directional dependence of seismic wavespeeds, in the lithospheric upper mantle. Because there is a causative link between upper mantle deformation and the resulting seismic anisotropy, studies of anisotropic structure in the upper mantle beneath continental interiors can shed light on the deformation processes associated with past tectonic events. The recent explosion in the availability of seismic data in the eastern United States, largely due to the EarthScope initiative, has enabled detailed studies of lithospheric deformation using anisotropic receiver function (RF) analysis and SKS splitting analysis. A comparison of lithospheric structure inferred from RFs for stations located to the east of the Grenville deformation front with those located within the cratonic interior argues for extensive deformation of the lithosphere during the formation and/or breakup of Rodinia. The pattern of fast SKS splitting directions measured at USArray Transportable Array (TA) stations shows clear evidence for a specific lithospheric anisotropy signature at stations beneath the Appalachian Mountains, indicating strong, coherent lithospheric deformation associated with Appalachian orogenesis. The Mid-Atlantic Geophysical Integrative Collaboration (MAGIC) experiment, a linear array of 28 broadband seismometers that is currrently deployed, is providing new insights into the structure and dynamics of the southeastern US continental margin from the Coastal Plain to the continental interior.",

            "abstract": "The pattern of mantle flow in subduction systems, and the processes that control the mantle flow field, is a fundamental but still poorly understood aspect of subduction dynamics. Mantle flow plays a key role in controlling the transport of volatiles and melt in the wedge, deformation of the overriding plate, mass transfer between the upper and lower mantle, and the morphology and dynamics of slabs. The Cascadia subduction zone provides a compelling system in which to understand the controls on mantle flow, particularly given the dense geophysical observations provided by EarthScope, GeoPRISMS, the Cascadia Initiative, and related efforts. Cascadia is a particularly intriguing system because observations of seismic anisotropy, which provide relatively direct constraints on mantle flow, seem to yield contradictory views of the mantle flow field in different parts of the system. Observations of seismic anisotropy on the overriding plate apparently require a significant component of three-dimensional, toroidal flow around the slab edge, while new observations from offshore stations are compellingly explained with a simple two-dimensional entrained flow model. Recent evidence from seismic tomography for the fragmentation of the Cascadia slab at depth provides a further puzzle: how can a fragmented slab provide a driving force for either two-dimensional entrained flow or three-dimensional toroidal flow due to slab rollback? I will present a synthesis of recent observations of seismic anisotropy in the Cascadia subduction system, and how they can be integrated with constraints from geodynamical modeling, geochemistry, and the history and timing of Pacific Northwest volcanism. I will discuss the compelling but contradictory evidence for each of the endmember mantle flow models (two-dimensional entrained flow vs. three-dimensional toroidal flow) and explore possible avenues for resolving the Cascadia Paradox.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimates of aerosol’s direct and indirect radiative forcings still suffer from large uncertainties due, at least in part, to a lack of rigorous and systematic understanding as to how the forcings are determined from perturbations to aerosol and cloud properties. This study examines this linkage of the forcing values to key uncertainties in fundamental processes of aerosols and clouds based on the estimates with different global models, including traditional types of climate models and an aerosol-coupled global cloud-resolving model. The model output are analyzed to investigate how the uncertainties in forcing stem from those in model representations of aerosol and cloud processes in an attempt to identify key factors that control the forcing values. The key findings include: i) the direct forcing systematically depends on how aerosol and cloud layers are stratified, ii) the forcing varies in both magnitude and sign with optical depth of clouds underlying the aerosol layer in a manner depending on the single-scattering albedo, and iii) the indirect forcing substantially depends on how the precipitation responds to perturbed aerosols as represented in different parameterizations of key cloud microphysical processes (e.g. the coalescence process). The analysis is also aided with simplified one-dimensional models of radiative transfer and cloud microphysics to better understand the relationship between the radiative forcing values and fundamental characters of aerosol and cloud processes as a basis for theoretically interpreting the global model statistics. Such a theoretical analysis provides a useful way to attribute the source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing to process-level uncertainties in aerosols, clouds and their interrelationship.",

            "abstract": "Research experiences for secondary school science teachers have been shown to improve their students' test scores, and there is a substantial body of literature about the effectiveness of RET (Research Experience for Teachers) or SWEPT (Scientific Work Experience Programs for Teachers) programs. RET programs enjoy substantial support, and several opportunities for science teachers to engage in research currently exist. However, there are barriers to teacher participation in research projects; for example, laboratory-based projects can be time consuming and require extensive training before a participant can meaningfully engage in scientific inquiry. Field-based projects can be an effective avenue for involving teachers in research; at its best, earth science field work is a fun, highly immersive experience that meaningfully contributes to scientific research projects, and can provide a payoff that is out of proportion to a relatively small time commitment. In particular, broadband seismology deployments provide an excellent opportunity to provide teachers with field-based research experience. Such deployments are labor-intensive and require large teams, with field tasks that vary from digging holes and pouring concrete to constructing and configuring electronics systems and leveling and orienting seismometers. A recently established pilot program, known as FEST (Field Experiences for Science Teachers) is experimenting with providing one week of summer field experience for high school earth science teachers in Connecticut. Here I report on results and challenges from the first year of the program, which is funded by the NSF-CAREER program and is being run in conjunction with a temporary deployment of 15 seismometers in Connecticut, known as SEISConn (Seismic Experiment for Imaging Structure beneath Connecticut). A small group of teachers participated in a week of field work in August 2015 to deploy seismometers in northern CT; this experience followed a visit of the PI to the classroom of one of the teacher participants during spring 2015 to give a series of talks on Connecticut earthquakes and geology. This presentation will focus on the challenges and opportunities of running small, PI-driven, field-based RET programs.",

Like previous studies, we conclude that rigid plate tectonics fails to describe the Sumatran subduction system; however, we attribute this failure to the well documented internal strain within the Eastern Indian Ocean lithosphere. We further constrain the along-strike variation in the rate of underthrusting of oceanic lithosphere beneath the Sumatran forearc, an important boundary condition for paleogeodetic studies of elastic strain accumulation within the forearc and the cycle of great Sunda megathrust earthquakes.",

At the time of this writing, geologic mapping has been performed on Dawn Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the late Approach phase (up to 1.3 km/px) and Survey orbit (415 m/px), including clear filter and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) starting in December 2015.\nThe Yalode Quadrangle is dominated by the ~300-km diameter impact basin Yalode and includes rugged and smooth terrains to the east. Yalode basin has a variably preserved rim, which is continuous and sharply defined to the north/northwest and is irregular or degraded elsewhere, and may have an interior ring structure. The basin floor includes hummocky and smooth areas (some bounded by scarps), crater chains, and a lineated zone. High-resolution images will be used to search for volcanic features on the basin floor and in association with basin structures. Yalode basin and its floor deposits appear to have been strongly affected by the Urvara impact to the west. Impact craters in Yalode Quadrangle display a range of preservation states. Degraded features, including Yalode basin and numerous smaller craters, exhibit subdued rims, lack discrete ejecta deposits, and have infilled interiors. More pristine features (including the large unnamed basin in the SE corner of the quadrangle and craters on Yalode basin floor) have well-defined, quasi-circular forms with prominent rims and in some cases discernible ejecta. Some of these craters have bowl-shaped interiors and others contain hills or mounds on their floors.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

The changes in SEA climate are closely related to the changes in global climate, especially via the changes in ENSO and the large-scale Asian monsoon circulation. In the past decades, both ENSO and the monsoon have experienced remarkable long-term changes, leading to significant climate signals over Southeast Asia and its adjacent regions. This study attributes these climate signals to different factors, emphasizing the contributions from water vapor feedback to surface climate signals, and from cloud and atmospheric feedbacks to the changes in the troposphere.\nOn the other hand, SEA and its adjacent regions also exert significant influences on the climate outside the regions. Various experiments with NCAR CESM and other earth system models are applied to investigate the impacts of the regional climate on the climate over Africa, Asian-Pacific-American regions, and the southern hemisphere.",

Because many lakes are shallow and ice grows thick (historically 2-m or greater), lakes often freeze solid (bedfast ice) and this condition fundamentally alters lake energy balance and melt-out processes compared to deeper lakes with perennial liquid water below floating ice. Our analysis of lakes in northern Alaska indicated that ice-off in bedfast ice lakes occurred on average 17 days earlier (22-June) than ice-off in adjacent floating ice lakes (9-July). Earlier melt in bedfast ice lakes caused higher open-water evaporation, 28 % on average, relative to floating ice lakes and this divergence increased in lakes closer to the coast and in cooler summers. Specific conductivity and water isotopes (18O and 2H) indicated similar differences in evaporation between these lake types. Our analysis suggests that ice regimes and associated ice-out timing currently create a strong hydrologic divergence among Arctic lakes, which makes understanding the distribution and dynamics of lakes by ice regime essential for predicting regional hydrology. An observed trend towards more floating ice lakes due to thinner ice growth may initially offset lake drying because of lower evaporative loss from this lake type. This potential negative feedback caused by winter processes is in spite of an overall projected increase in evapotranspiration as the Arctic climate warms. The unusually warm spring observed in 2015 caused much earlier lake ice-out throughout Arctic Alaska, thus providing perfect conditions to test these hypotheses concerning differential lake hydrologic responses.",

            "abstract": "The Pliocene and Quaternary are times of rapid, extreme climate variability, but 3-D geologic exposures of lacustrine strata from this time are rare, impeding observations of the impact of climate-change on lake sedimentation. The Qaidam Basin (QB) in western China provides a unique geologic setting, where internally drained lakes have existed for the past few million years, and recent deformation of the basin floor has uplifted and exposed lacustrine strata. This stratigraphy records a detailed history of lake level fluctuation, evaporite deposition, and climate change. We provide new paleomagnetic, δ18O and δ13C data combined with detailed sedimentology from the lower 475 m of a 900 m thick stratigraphic section (38.28N, 91.54E) in the northwestern QB to reveal a high-resolution record of sedimentation and climate change during the Plio-Quaternary. 12 magnetozones indicate an age for the lower half of the section between 6.0-3.0 Ma. The section consists of 9 lithofacies (1 mudstone, 4 sandstone, 1 conglomerate, 2 gypsum, 1 halite) that can be divided into 3 stratigraphic units based on evaporite concentration. Alternating mud, gypsum, and halite beds imply multiple lake-level fluctuations and occasional complete drying of the lake. This is consistent with >12.5‰ variation in the δ18O values of lacustrine carbonates (δ18Oc), indicating large-scale lake level fluctuation below 410 m, consistent with the boundary of Unit 1 and 2. Between 410 and 475 m, the δ18Oc values are ~-5 ‰. Above 475 m, an increase in gypsum concentration causes a thick salt-crust to develop on the outcrop, making sampling impossible. This stratigraphic level corresponds to an age of ~3.0 Ma, when the QB became hyper-arid. The presence of gypsum and halite throughout the section implies that the QB was arid and internally drained by at least 6 Ma, although the basin may have been divided into multiple lakes based on the bimodal δ18O values from different parts of the QB during that time. Overall, the section shows shallowing of the lake throughout the Plio-Quaternary time, and may correlate with the uplift of nearby mountains and a cooling climate. Our data imply that the northwest QB contained a closed lake system throughout the Pliocene, in contrast to the southwest QB, where open lake conditions were present.",

            "abstract": "There are a large number of natural and synthetic zeolites having a microporous structure, which is generally composed of Si/AlO4 three-dimensional framework. Analcime, NaAlSi2O6·H2O, is one of the most common naturally occurring zeolites. It forms a variety of solid solutions with wairakite, (Ca,Na2)Al2Si4O12·2H2O, pollucite (CsAlSi2O6·nH2O), and hsianghualite (Ca3Li2Be3Si3O12·F2). This study aimed to clarify structural variations in the solid solution between analcime and wairakite. Single crystals with compositions between analcime and wairakite were synthesized using hydrothermal synthesis method. Aluminium sulfate and sodium metasilicate nonahydrate gelled with distilled water were heated for 24 hours under 200 °C. The hydrothermally synthesized crystalline materials were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images showed that the grown single crystals exhibited euhedral trapezohedron shape up to 400μm in size. The effect of the cations substitution on the structural variation was examined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and electron probe micro-analyser (EPMA). Structure refinements based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data exhibited that crystal structures between analcime and wairakite belong to the cubic Ia-3d and kept approximately unchanged. Lattice parameter was monotonously reduced from 13.713 (1) Å to 13.650 (1) Å as a function of Ca concentration. In addition, the lattice parameter was also varied with Si/Al framework cation ratio. The contraction of the 6-membered oxygen rings was closely associated with exchanged cations and substituted framework cations. This study indicates that a geometry of micro-porous zeolite structure is significantly influenced by substitution of not only extra-framework cations but framework cations.",

            "abstract": "This study measures the uplift rates of a flight of marine terraces along the Glenafric coastal region of the South Island of New Zealand, which will provide a context for how local fold growth in the North Canterbury fold and thrust belt (NCFTB) contributes to local uplift rates. Several preliminary methods were used to measure uplift rate of the marine terraces including: 1) use of DGPS surveys to collect the elevations of marine terrace inner edges and possible erosional surfaces 2) collecting shell samples for AAR dating in order to refine terrace ages 3) creating several cross-sections based on the DGPS surveys to refine terrace boundaries; and 4) calculating the uplift rate of each flight of marine terraces along the North Canterbury fold and thrust belt to determine possible structural influence on local uplift.\nCorrelations of inner edge elevations to the Cass and Montserrat anticlines show that inner edges closest to the anticlinal axis were generally higher than points farther from the axis, indicating proximity to the anticlinal axis as a dominate control on terrace uplift. However, as this is not the case for all GPS survey points, another mechanism must contribute to marine terrace uplift as well. LIDAR topographic profiles and calculated uplift rates show evidence of marine terrace southwestward tilting, following the southwestward plunge of the Cass Anticline and the southwestward propagation of the Hamilton Fault. GPS points with the highest uplift rates (1.0-1.3 m/kyr) are closest to the structural culmination of the Cass or Montserrat anticline, therefore experiencing fold influence and uplift for the longest period of time. Proximity to the structural culmination of each anticline, not proximity to the anticlinal axis, is therefore the dominate control on marine terrace uplift rate.",

            "abstract": "Neotectonic brittle faults are commonly associated with near-surface deformation and fluid transport. Fault slip and fluid-rock interactions both contribute to generation of fault gouge composed of rock fragments and authigenic clay minerals. Numerous studies have demonstrated it is possible to determine the absolute timing of brittle faulting by isotopic (K-Ar) dating of authigenic illite clay minerals. Precise size separation combined with mineral characterization (SEM, TEM, XRD, LPS etc.) yields reliable results. The Alpine Fault in the South Island of New Zealand, marks the Australian-Pacific plate boundary. An amphibolite-facies mid-crustal ductile shear zone (mylonite series rocks) in the Pacific Plate hanging wall is exhumed along a current brittle fault marked by cataclasite and fault gouge. Preliminary investigations of two <2 micron illite gouge separates from fault gouge samples collected from surface exposures of the Alpine Fault at Gaunt Creek and Waikukupa River yield K-Ar ages of resp. 4.1 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.2 Ma, corresponding to the late Pliocene. The high error is caused by low radiogenic 40Ar content of c. 12 to 15%. The K-Ar illite ages are consistent with well-defined field constraints and within error similar to c. 1 to 2.5 Ma 40Ar/39Ar ages for micas from hanging wall metapelites and amphibolites and to published K-Ar mica and near-zero apatite fission track ages. The overlapping illite and mica ages indicate that hanging wall rocks were rapidly exhumed and cooled c. 1 – 4 Ma ago, and that exhumation was coeval with extensive hydration in the brittle part of the Alpine Fault resulting in illite neoformation. The ages of fault gouge illite provide absolute time constraints on the youngest, retrograde, neotectonic movements on this part of the Australian-Pacific plate boundary.",

Temperature profiles acquired at different times after circulation record the evolution of temperatures towards equilibrium and thus allow us to estimate the thermal diffusivity of the rock environment in the Alpine Fault’s hanging wall. After drilling stopped, a multi-strand fibre-optic cable was installed along the full length of the 893 m-deep borehole. This cable has been used to make repeated temperature measurements on an approximately two-monthly basis since January 2015. Local temperature anomalies correlate with fractures identified in borehole televiewer and laterolog data. Zones where temperature profiles differ from the average geothermal gradient indicate thermal disturbance, caused by advection of heat by fluids. The identification and characterisation of flowing fractures provide insight into the permeability structure, stress field, and hydrogeological regime of the hanging wall of the central Alpine Fault.",

            "abstract": "Biotic/abiotic redox reaction is a ubiquitous process in a mineral alteration and an elemental cycling in the sediments/ocean. The role of psychrophiles in clay mineral alteration was tested in the soil for the seven sites from the coast to the inland at Barton Peninsula. Batch experiments of microbe-mineral interaction under the various temperatures (4 ℃, 15 ℃) that mimics the Antarctic condition were performed to understand the mechanism of biogeochemical alteration of clay minerals. After 12 months incubation of the bulk surface soil samples in the M1 minimal medium, the extent of Fe reduction was reached up to 49 and 42 % at 4 ℃ and 15 ℃. The increase in CEC corresponds to the extent of Fe reduction. Moreover, precipitations of secondary phase mineral such as vivianite were observed only in 12 months enrichment samples at 4 ℃ and 15 ℃. Sulfate reducing bacteria and Fe-reducing bacteria capable of reducing Fe were identified by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. The Fe reduction coupled to oxidation of organic matter might be enhanced by cooperation of a consortium of Sulfate reducing bacteria and Fe-reducing bacteria. Moreover, Nitrate reducing bacteria which have an ability to oxidize ferrous iron anaerobically with nitrate reduction were identified at 15 ℃. The lower values observed in the extent of Fe reduction at 15 ℃ may be associated with Fe-oxidation induced by nitrate reduction.In order to verify the mechanism of microbial Fe reduction in clay minerals at low temperatures (4 and 15 ℃), Fe-rich Nontronite (NAu-1) and Psychrophilic bacteria were incubated for 4 months in anaerobic condition. Total structural Fe in NAu-1 is 16.4 % and 99.6 % of the total Fe is ferric. The extent of Fe reduction in nontronite was reached up to 11.5 % and 11 % at 4 ℃ and 15 ℃, respectively. The structural modification of biologically Fe-reduced nontronite was observed in the (001) peak shift to the lower 2 theta indicating the layer collapse associated with K-fixation. Vivianite precipitation suggesting the reductive dissolution of nontronite were observed in 4 months enrichment samples at 4 ℃ and 15 ℃. The present study, therefore, indicates the feasibility of biological effects on chemical/structural modification in clay minerals in cold environment suggesting a new pathway of Fe-supply into the Antarctic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The Great Siberian Rivers integrate meteorological and hydrological changes in their watersheds and play a significant role in the physical and biogeochemical regime of the Arctic Ocean. Given the magnitude of Siberian Arctic dissolved organic matter (DOM) export and the uncertain extent to which it is degraded to greenhouse gases, intensified studies to better quantify and understand this large carbon pool and processes acting on it are urgently needed. The East Siberian Arctic shelf is characterized by the highest rate of coastal erosion and significant volume of the riverine discharge which derived terrigenous DOM in the Arctic Ocean. DOM plays a significant role in freshwater and marine aquatic ecosystems including its effects on nutrients and carbon cycling. The colored fraction of DOM, CDOM, directly affects the quantity and spectral quality of available light, thereby impaction both primary production and UV exposure in aquatic ecosystems. Since 2003 we measure CDOM in the East Siberian Arctic Seas (ESAS) in situ using the WETStar fluorometer which doesn’t require prefiltration of sample. Combined analysis of CDOM and DOC data obtained at near-annual basis in (2003-2011) demonstrate a high degree of correlation between these parameters. For all the measured samples taken during the ISSS cruises (2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2011), there is an overall linear relationship between DOC concentration, CDOM, and salinity. Here we report the spatial-time variability of river-borne DOM in the ESAS using CDOM as a proxy parameter. Higher absorption coefficients (a254), spectral slope parameter over range 275-295 nm (S275-295) and CDOM concentrations reflect the dominant contribution of terrigenous DOM. It is shown that the attenuation light coefficient in the shallow ESAS is mostly determined by riverine CDOM.",

As a part of the series, a dipole test (Tracer Test Run 13-05) using radionuclides, colloids and conservative tracers was performed to determine the breakthrough between CRR99.002-i2 and BOMI87.010-i2. To date, the breakthrough data of only the conservative dye tracer (Amino-G acid) are available. In the preceding project, the Colloid and Radionuclide Retardation Project (CRR), a transmissivity field for the MI shear zone was obtained by the geostatistical inverse modeling approach. In this study, the breakthrough of the tracer was computed by a gray lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The transmissivity field with finite elements grid was transformed to the effective fracture aperture or flow porosity according to the cubic law, and the grid was uniformalized by the interpolation. The uniform mesh of the effective aperture was utilized as the model domain of the gray LBM. In the gray LBM, the heterogeneity of the aperture was dealt with a partial-bounceback scheme. The profiles of hydraulic heads monitored at the boreholes nearby were used as the reference values in the calculation of the pressure distribution in the model domain. The modeling results could reveal a dominant pathway of tracers in the dipole test. The developed model can be utilized in the calculation of the reactive transports of radionuclides and colloids by coupling with a geochemical model, such as Phreeqc, the Geochemist’s Workbench, etc.",

In this meeting, key officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Forests, and Fisheries and the Tonga Meteorological Services had a meeting with the APEC Climate Center scientists with the idea to collaborate on a joint project. The project evolved to include the following components: assessment of users’ needs and capacities, development of an agricultural database, research on the core relationships between agriculture and climate through modeling and field trials, and the development and delivery of agro-meteorological services. Envisioned outputs include a 2-7 day warning for pests and diseases, a suite of tools supporting decisions on planting dates and crop varieties, and other advisory services derived from seasonal climate forecasts. As one of the climate adaptation projects under its Pacific Island portfolio, the project will deliver urgent information services for Tongan agricultural growers and exporters. The project comes into greater importance and urgency, as the 2014 drought event resulted in the destruction of 80% of squash in Tonga, a main export crop from which the country derives foreign exchange earnings. Since 2014, some of the project achievements include the first agro-met data collection in Tonga, the development of an agricultural DB management system that houses archived agriculture data, and key meetings with stakeholders to ensure alignment of the project objectives and design with the interests of the Tongan government and other stakeholders. In addition, rigorous scientific research through modeling and field trials has been conducted to address the twin goals of supporting Tonga’s economy as well as food security.

            "abstract": "Many constituents typically associated with oil and gas production, such as methane and higher-order hydrocarbons, exist naturally in shallow groundwater. Recent studies of aquifers in the footprint of several gas plays across the US have showed that (1) dissolved thermogenic methane may or may not be present in the shallow subsurface and (2) shallow thermogenic methane could be naturally occurring and emplaced through mostly vertical migration over geologic time and is not necessarily a consequence of gas production from a gas play. A total of 800+ water wells have been sampled across the state of Texas to characterize shallow methane in fresh-water aquifers overlying shale plays and other tight formations (Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville shale areas as well as in the Delaware Basin of West Texas). Analytical results suggest that dissolved methane is not widespread in shallow groundwater and that, when present at concentration greater than 10 mg/L, is often of natural but thermogenic or mixed origin according to the isotopic signature and to the presence of other light hydrocarbons.",

            "abstract": "A study of compositions of mineral inclusions from representative collection (more than 150 samples) of diamonds from the placers of Ural Mountains was performed. Overwhelming majority of rounded octahedral and dodecahedral stones typical for placers contain eclogitic (E-type) mineral inclusions (up to 80%) represented by garnets with Mg# 40-75 and Ca# 10-56 including a unique high calcic “grospydite” composition, omphacitic pyroxenes containing up to 65% of jadeite as well as kyanite, coesite, sulphides and rutile. U/P type inclusions are represented by olivine, Cr-pyrope, chromediopside, enstatite and chromite typical for diamonds worldwide. One typical rounded dodecahedral diamond was found to contain abundant primary oriented submicrometer (<0.5 mm) octahedral fluid inclusions identified by TEM, caused a milky color of the whole diamond crystal. EEL spectrum of an inclusion has a peak at about 405 eV indicating the presence of nitrogen. Raman spectrum with a peak at 2348 cm-1 confirms the solid state of the nitrogen. This means that fossilized pressure inside fluid inclusions may be within the range of 4.0-4.5 GPa at room T. Volatile components of inclusions were analyzed by combined gas chromatography mass-spectrometry. They are represented by nitrogen (40%), water (26%), carbon dioxide (3,0%) and heavy hydrocarbons (CnH2n+2) which represent 30% rel. of all detected hydrocarbons. Equilibration PT conditions were estimated mainly from chemical composition of coexisting garnets and clinopyroxenes (35 pairs) as 950-1250oC at 5.0 GPa. However, the identification of unique fluid inclusions in one typical placer diamond allows to expand pressure limit at least up to 6.0 GPa. We conclude that Ural placer diamonds are of kimberlitic origin and are comparable in their high E-type/P-type inclusion ratios with those from north-eastern part of the Siberian Craton and in part with diamonds of Arkhangelsk kimberlite province.",

            "abstract": "Biotic/abiotic redox reaction is a ubiquitous process in mineral formation and growth, and changes in elemental redox states, particularly Fe/Mn may reflect the redox conditions in the sediment/ocean when the mineral forms. Samples were dredged from the seamounts in the western Pacific, OSM11 in order to investigate the formation, growth and its implications to geological history. The crust consist of five well-defined layers (here after called “layer 1” (rim) through “layer 5” (core)). Quartz, feldspar, and hematite are detected only in the layer 1 in addition to the poorly crystallined Fe-rich vernadite, which is likely to be associated with slower growth rate compared to the layers 2-5. CFA were identified in layers 4 and 5 under XRD measurement. Visible size of white colored well crystallined CFA were only observed in layer 4; whereas nano-sized CFA in layer 5 were identified by TEM. Clay minerals such as smectite were observed by TEM with SAED pattern and EDX in layers 1 and 3. The oxidation states of Fe and Mn in Fe-rich vernadite in entire layers were determined by EELS analysis. All the layers of Mn oxide minerals was consisted with dominantly Mn4+, which is consistent with appearance of vernadite in Fe-Mn crust. Fe-rich vernadite in layers 1 and 4 were consisted with 26-52 % of Fe3+/Fetot, dominant reduced form of Fe compared to layers 2, 3, and 5. The observed alternative patterns of Fe oxidation state in five distinct layers of Fe-Mn crust is likely to be associated with the various redox conditions in seawater, changes in growth rate of crust resulting in the various oxygen exposure time, and uplift-subsidence of sea mounts. A non-cultivation-based molecular approach with T-RFLP indicated the presence of functional gene (CumA) association with Mn oxidizing bacteria in Fe-Mn crust layers. The presence of Mn oxidizing gene may suggest that the biotic Mn oxides precipitation may persist locally in the Fe-Mn crust; whereas functional gene of Fe-oxidizing bacteria have not been identified from current T-RFLP experiment suggesting an abiotic Fe-oxidation. The alternative patterns of Fe-oxidation states in layers of Fe-Mn crust might be induced by abiotic processes reflecting the various redox conditions and thus can used as a proxy for explaining the environmental changes in geological history of seamounts.",

            "abstract": "Dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs) transport magnetic flux to the inner and dayside magnetosphere, heat the plasma sheet, and provide a seed population to the radiation belt. The magnetic perturbation ahead of them, often referred to as a dipolarization front (DF), is asymmetric with a small Bz dip followed by a sharp Bz enhancement. The Bz dip is thought to be generated from dawnward currents carried by DF-reflected ions; after reflection, these earthward-moving ions gyrate clockwise and contribute to dawnward diamagnetic currents ahead of the front. Using observations of hundreds of DFs, we investigate this hypothesis. We find that the depth of the Bz dip as a function of the front azimuth depends on DF propagation speed and ambient plasma density. These statistical signatures support the hypothesis that the Bz dip is caused by ion reflection, and suggest that secondary currents carried by these reflected ions can reshape the front significantly.",

Here we examine diurnal wind variability in the ITCZ region and its relation to the diurnal cycle of convection; the satellite wind signals are noisy but we find both diurnal and semidiurnal signals in the ITCZ surface winds that correspond to robust cloud signals. We find a poor agreement between the diurnal wind-convection relationship in observations and in a global, explicit-convection atmospheric model.",

            "abstract": "Past work suggests deep convective clouds will deepen and/or ascend faster as a result of increasing aerosol concentrations, an effect called “convective invigoration”. While a number of model and observational studies have looked at this effect, the possible interaction between aerosol-invigorated deep cloud and shallow clouds remains uninvestigated. One objective of this work is to understand the remote responses of shallow and/or deep clouds to convective invigoration due to changes in synoptic scale motions. The large scale motion chosen for this study is the Hadley Circulation associated with the Eastern Pacific Inter-Tropical Convective Zone, which has been found in a number of studies to exhibit a shallow meridional circulation (SMC). In this study we use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF 3.5.1) model and set up an idealised case in order to reproduce the circulation. SMC remains robust to the different resolutions of 20 km and 2 km (where cumulus schemes are used at 20 km but not at 2 km).\nWe investigate the potential affect of aerosols in two ways: by adding a proxy effect of aerosols in the form of localised heating perturbations that mimic latent heating effects, and by directly increasing the CCN concentration from 100 to 800 per cc. Four simulations are performed. The first simulation is considered as a control in which there is no added heating perturbation. The next two are perturbed cases in which localised heating perturbations are added - to latent heating in the cumulus and microphysics schemes at 20km and 2km resolutions respectively. The final simulation increases the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration to a high value. Results from both proxy heating and high CCN 2km resolution simulations show invigoration of deep convective clouds with no effect on shallow clouds. Proxy heating experiment at 20 km resolution show similar invigoration of deep convective clouds followed by suppression of shallow clouds. Cloud changes with respect to aerosol from two different methodology will be presented and throughly discussed.",

Once implemented, TWO will be positioned to support high-impact water science that is highly relevant to societal needs and serve as a regional resource for better understanding and/or managing agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, biodiversity, disasters, health, energy, and weather/climate. TWO infrastructure will span land uses (cultivation agriculture, range/pasture, forest), landforms (low-relief erosional uplands to depositional lowlands), and across climatic and geologic gradients of Texas to investigate the sensitivity and resilience of fertile soils and the ecosystems they support. Besides developing a network of field water observatory infrastructure/capacity for accounting water flow and storage, TWO will facilitate developing a new generation interdisciplinary water professionals (from various TAMU Colleges) with better understanding and skills for attending to future water challenges of the region.

Interest in the USAM is motivated both by climate change (i.e., documented ocean warming may contribute to seepage) and energy resource (i.e., the amount of gas-in-place in hydrates on the USAM is about the same as that in the northern Gulf of Mexico) issues. USGS-led field efforts have included an April 2015 study to acquire high-resolution multichannel seismic data, coincident split-beam water column methane plume imaging data, and real-time sea-air methane flux measurements between Wilmington and Norfolk Canyons and a September 2015 cruise (with OSU, UCLA, and Geomar) to collect piston cores, multicores, heat flow data, subbottom imagery, CTDs, and coincident water column imagery from Block Canyon to the Currituck Slide. In April 2015, we discovered methane seeps not included in the previously-published database, but found that some known seeps were not active. New high-resolution multi-channel seismic data revealed clear differences between the deep gas distribution in mid-Atlantic upper slope zones that are replete with (up to 240 sites) and lacking in seeps. Based on sea-air flux measurements, even shallow-water outer shelf (~125 m water depth) seeps and a 900-m-high methane plume originating on the mid-slope do not contribute methane to the atmosphere. Using thermistors placed on piston core outriggers, we will in September 2015 acquire thermal data to identify zones of high fluid advection and to constrain background geotherms in areas where heat flow has never been measured. During that same cruise, we will collect a series of piston cores across the no-hydrate/hydrate transition on the upper slope to constrain fluid and gas dynamics in this zone.",

In this work, we suggest that the atmospheric stationary planetary wave feedback leads to the contrasting asymmetrical evolution of ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere during the glacial cycles. Model results suggest that the stationary wave induced by the glacial ice sheet topography suppresses the cooling of the land in the central Asia and prevents the ice sheet growth of the east-southern part of the Fennoscandian ice sheet and enables its faster retreat at the ice age termination. Because of the smaller eccentricity during the last 120 ka compared to the penultimate glacial during 230 to 130 ka, the Laurentide ice sheet grew to a larger size at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than the Penultimate Glacial Maximum (PGM). This, in turn, resulted in the Fennoscandian ice sheet to be smaller in LGM than PGM through the stationary wave feedback mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Climate change with wax and wane of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheet occurred in the past 800 thousand years characterized by 100 thousand year cycle with a large amplitude of sawtooth pattern, following a transition from a period of 40 thousand years cycle with small amplitude of ice sheet change at about 1 million years ago. Although the importance of insolation as the ultimate driver is now appreciated, the mechanism what determines timing and strength of terminations are far from clearly understood. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere–asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. We discuss further the mechanism which determine the timing of ice age terminations by examining the role of astronomical forcing and change of atmospheric carbon dioxide contents through sensitivity experiments and comparison of several ice age cycles with different settings of astronomical forcings.",

            "abstract": "The projection of future hydro-climatic extremes due to anthropogenic climate change is a major research focus, as well as a major challenge for regional climate modeling. An analysis of hydro-climatic extremes is presented based upon a small ensemble of dynamically downscaled climate projections. The ensemble is comprised of four independent, identically configured CESM integrations (RCP 8.5), which were downscaled over Western Canada using WRF in two different configurations at 10 km resolution. In the climate projections presented here, changes in precipitation extremes generally follow changes in the (seasonal) mean, even though precipitation changes in general are found to differ strongly between seasons and regions. At the end of the 21st century the highest projected increase in precipitation (extremes) is approximately 30% in fall at the coast and in winter away from the coast. In summer only a small increase in precipitation (extremes) is projected, and the statistical significance of the signal is weak. Nevertheless, cumulus precipitation consistently increases by 20-30%. Furthermore, the total summer precipitation change appears to be sensitive to the choice of the cumulus scheme. In order to detect a robust climate change signal in the Extreme Value Analysis that has been performed, a novel method of aggregating data from climatologically similar stations is introduced and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since 2007, experiences of actual operation of EEW have been gained by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). During this period, we have learned lessons from many M6- and M7-class earthquakes, and the Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake.\nDuring the Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake, JMA system functioned well: it issued a warning message more than 15 s before strong ground shaking in the Tohoku district (relatively near distance from the epicenter). However, it was not perfect: in addition to the problem of large extent of fault rupture, some false warning messages were issued due to the confusion of the system because of simultaneous multiple aftershocks which occurred at the wide rupture area.\nTo address the problems, JMA will introduce two new methods into the operational system this year to start their tests, aiming at practical operation within a couple of years. One is Integrated Particle Filter (IPF) method, which is an integrated algorithm of multiple hypocenter determination techniques with Bayesian estimation, in which amplitude information is also used for hypocenter determination. The other is Propagation of Local Undamped Motion (PLUM) method, in which warning message is issued when strong ground shaking is detected at nearby stations around the target site (e.g., within 30 km). Here, hypocenter and magnitude are not required in PLUM.\nAiming at application for several years later, we are investigating a new approach, in which current wavefield is estimated in real time, and then future wavefield is predicted time evolutionally from the current situation using physics of wave propagation. Here, hypocenter and magnitude are not necessarily required, but real-time observation of ground shaking is necessary.\nJMA also plans to predict long period ground motion (up to 8 s) with the EEW system for earthquake damage mitigation in high-rise buildings. Its test will start using the operational system in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The age spectrum of detrital monazite grains is used to unravel the tectono-thermal history of the pre-Neogene terranes, which is required for geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste on tectonically active Japanese Islands. The CHIME (Chemical Th-U-total Pb isochron method, Suzuki and Adachi, 1991) is best suited for dating of detrital monazite whose grains are not chronologically uniform. In the previous studies (eg, Suzuki, 2011), EPMA equipped with conventional R=140 mm spectrometers was used for measurement of U, Th and Pb. However the spectrometers have low count rate of measurement of Pb. The JEOL JXA-8530F FE-EPMA equipped with R=100 mm spectrometers has been applied for the CHIME monazite dating. The intrinsic responses of each of the R=100 mm spectrometers for PbMβ are around ten times higher than that of the R=140 mm spectrometer. The R=100 mm spectrometers permits obtaining high count rate, which enables us to shorten measurement time than before. As these spectrometers have peculiar spectral interference, the method reported by Amli and Griffin (1978) is applied for correction of the interference. In order to verify the dating using the FE-EPMA and the interference correction method, two distinct age groups of monazite were measured. The ages were 425±25 Ma for monazite from Cooma granite in southeastern Australia, which had dated by SHRIMP as 432.8 ± 3.5 Ma (Williams, 2001) and 67 ± 7 Ma for monazite of the Kojaku granite in southwestern Japan, which is corresponding to the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages of 68.5 ± 0.7 Ma. These results indicate that the FE-EPMA and the interference correction method are useful for the CHIME monazite dating and for revealing the tectono-thermal history of the terranes.\n This study was carried out under a contract with Agency of Natural Resources and Energy(ANRE), part of Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan as part of its R&D supporting program for developing geological disposal technology.",

            "abstract": "A M7.2 inland earthquake occurred in Bohol, Philippines on the 15th of October 2013, associated with rupture along a newly-discovered thrust fault called the North Bohol Fault. While secondary hazards including lateral spreading, landslides, sinkholes, liquefaction, coastal uplift and subsidence have been observed, the impact was dominated by strong ground shaking that killed about 230 people and damaged over 70,000 buildings. Because of the extensive damage and the wide spread of intensities inferred to have shaken the island, the Bohol earthquake presents an important opportunity to improve knowledge of building fragility for the Philippines and similar countries. To this end we undertook a statistical building survey of over 18,000 damaged and undamaged structures located in urban and rural settings and at various inferred ground motion intensity levels. Building typology developed by structural engineers in the Philippines has been considered in classifying the structures based on structural materials and era of construction. The vast majority of the buildings are residential houses with wall types made of wooden materials, concrete hollow blocks or confined masonry. Tailored to assess the vulnerability of structures to earthquake loadings, this post-event analysis aims to validate and constrain the building fragility curves for seismic risk assessment. This can lead to more robust impact forecasts and higher priorities on seismic regulations and construction practices, applicable not only in Bohol but in other areas in the Philippines as well.",

            "abstract": "The application of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to analyze social vulnerability to recognize the resilience within sites is a challenging tasks. The aim of this study is to propose a computational method to identify the sites according to their similarity and to determine the most relevant variables to characterize the social vulnerability in each cluster. For this purposes, SOM is considered as an effective platform for analysis of high dimensional data. By considering the cluster structure, the characteristic of social vulnerability of the sites identification can be fully understand. In this study, the social vulnerability variable is constructed from 17 variables, i.e. 12 independent variables which represent the socio-economic concepts and 5 dependent variables which represent the damage and losses due to Merapi eruption in 2010. These variables collectively represent the local situation of the study area, based on conducted fieldwork on September 2013. By using both independent and dependent variables, we can identify if the social vulnerability is reflected onto the actual situation, in this case, Merapi eruption 2010. However, social vulnerability analysis in the local communities consists of a number of variables that represent their socio-economic condition. Some of variables employed in this study might be more or less redundant. Therefore, SOM is used to reduce the redundant variable(s) by selecting the representative variables using the component planes and correlation coefficient between variables in order to find the effective sample size. Then, the selected dataset was effectively clustered according to their similarities. Finally, this approach can produce reliable estimates of clustering, recognize the most significant variables and could be useful for social vulnerability assessment, especially for the stakeholder as decision maker.

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the in-situ subsurface stress fields, including their orientations and magnitudes provide the directions along which the most permeable fractures are present and/or are likely to occur during hydraulic fracturing. Thus, their estimation is important for characterizing the naturally fractured, unconventional, and carbon sequestered reservoirs. The stress fields can be measured at the well locations and multicomponent seismic data are effective for estimating them away from the wells. Because acquisition and processing of three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent seismic data is expensive, in most areas single component (P-wave) 3D seismic data are generally available. Consequently, estimating the subsurface in-situ stress fields from traditional 3D P-wave seismic data is of practical importance.\nStress fields induce azimuthal anisotropy resulting in distinct differences in the azimuthal reflection amplitudes in the recorded P-wave seismic data. In this work, we combine pre-stack waveform inversion (PWI) with amplitude-variation-with-offset-and azimuth (AVOZ) analysis in estimating the stress fields from the azimuthally dependent P-wave reflection amplitudes. By sorting the recorded data in into different azimuth bins, and then applying PWI, we first estimate accurate velocity fields along different azimuths. Converting offset domain azimuthal pre-stack data into incidence-angles using the PWI velocity fields, we then stack the angle domain gathers to obtain angle stacks for each azimuth. Finally, we apply AVOZ analysis on these angle stacks to estimate the orientations of the subsurface stress fields. Applying the methodology on a real 3D seismic data from the Rock-Springs uplift, Wyoming, USA, we demonstrate that our method can reliably obtain the subsurface stress fields that are consistent with what is observed at a well location. We conclude that our method is an effective tool for estimating the subsurface stress fields from 3D P-wave seismic data.",

            "abstract": "Variability of the Arctic climate has affected many aspects of the Arctic environment, especially in the Pacific sector of the Arctic. The primary implication is that today’s Arctic cryosphere (glaciers, frozen ground, and sea ice) and biosphere (terrestrial, lacustrine, and marine) are not at steady state; they have changed and will continue to change in response to evolving Arctic climate. Over the decade 2004–2013 environmental changes in the Pacific sector of the Arctic have been dramatic enough to suggest that a ‘new normal’ climate is emerging (Wood et al., 2015). Like everywhere in the Arctic, understanding of environmental change in the Chukchi Sea is hindered by sparse data. Dynamics of the carbonate system (CS) in the eastern Chukchi Sea (US EEZ) has been studied more extensively for a longer period and is better understood than in its western (Russian EEZ) part. Here we focus on the carbonate system data collected in the Russian part of the Chukchi Sea over > 10 years (2000-2011).\nOur data exhibit a strong mesoscale and interannual dynamics of carbonate system parameters in the surface seawater. The aragonite saturation state (WAr) was highly variable but also has generally been decreasing in the upper waters from 2000 to 2011. It was shown that despite strong sea ice loss, waters heating and storm increasing, the surface waters in this area have been consistently undersaturated by CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. Notable localized exceptions, where CO2 outgassing occurs, include the well-mixed waters near Bering Strait. Combining our long-term carbonate system data set (1996-2011) with the available literature data we felt in conclusion that the entire Chukchi Sea during ice-free season absorbs ~12-15× 1012 g C and a significant part of this carbon was transferred to the deep layers and insulated from contact with the atmosphere for a long time. Note that the CO2 invasion is a similar value with the CO2 outgassing from the shallow eastern Laptev Sea and the western part of the East Siberian Sea.",

            "abstract": "Round Top Mountain, west Texas, USA, is composed almost entirely of peraluminous rhyolite, with pervasive low-grade enrichment in yttrium and heavy rare earth elements (Y+HREEs). The exposed rhyolite laccolith also contains Li, Be, U, Th, Nb, Ta, Ga, Rb, Cs, Sn, and F. The valuable Y+HREEs are hosted in yttrofluorite, which is soluble in dilute sulfuric acid. Texas Rare Earth Resources, Inc. proposes to surface mine, crush, and heap leach the massive, 109ton deposit.\n The distribution of Y+HREEs, and that of other trace elements, is remarkably homogeneous at outcrop drill hole scale (Pingitore et al., FM14-V23D-4827: Uniform Distribution of Yttrium…). Here we document that Y+HREE mineralization appears pervasive through the rhyolite at a sub-millimeter scale.\n We examined 15 thin sections of rhyolite fragments randomly selected from a composite sample produced by mixing several hundred kg of aliquot material recovered from >100 reverse circulation drill holes scattered across much of the mountain. A total of 16 elements (Y, Dy, Yb, F, U, Th, Nb, Sn, Zr, Rb, Ca, Na, K, Fe, Al, Si) plus back scattered electron image were mapped in WDS mode by stage raster across a 2 x 2 mm field at 516 x 516 pixel resolution on a Cameca SX-100 class EPMA.\n Typical maps revealed 5-10 grains that contained Y + Dy + Yb; most also contained F and Ca, indicating yttrofluorite mineralogy. Most grains were under 10 μm in 2-D size. We view this 5-10 grain figure of merit as a minimum number of target grains since we employed a conservative approach to their identification. This finding suggests that a 1 mm cube of the rhyolite contains 250-500 target grains (assuming that the EPMA sampled to a depth of 5 μm and that sampled grains did not extend below that depth in size). Viewed from a mining processing standpoint, each particle for the anticipated heap leach, with a nominal crush size of ½ to 1 inch (13-26 mm), would contain on the order of 250,000 to 500,000 target microscopic mineral grains.\n These findings confirm that the distribution of Y+HREEs in Round Top Mountain rhyolite is homogeneous through many orders of magnitude of scale, i.e., from outcrop to sub-thin section. The material thus is ideal for a heap leach operation where homogeneous feedstock is crucial to consistent and economic operation. UTEP-TRER contracts 226821112 & 16. NEP serves on TRER Board.\n ",

            "abstract": "Impoundment of reservoirs can lead to increase in crustal pore pressure and Coulomb stress, and promotes nearby faults to fail. Abnormal seismicity increase around reservoir is often thought to be triggered by the water impounded behind the dam. In this study, we analyze the impact of Longtan reservoir in Guangxi province, southwest China, on local seismicity, which has increased significantly since the initial impoundment in October, 2006. Most of the earthquakes cluster around the reservoir according to local seismic network and CEA reports, and the greatest earthquake is of magnitude 4.2. We introduce an improved Bayesian method to show that the temporal variation of b-value is inversely correlated with the seasonal fluctuation of reservoir water level. Upon extracting background seismicity using the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, we show that background seismicity variation is highly related to the filling rate and volume We further investigate the mechanism of seismicity increase and reservoir impoundment by performing a fully coupled 3-D poroelastic model with the reservoir loading history as a dynamic boundary condition. An optimally oriented fault plane is chosen according to the regional stress field and GPS deformation data when calculating the induced Coulomb stress. Our results demonstrate that most earthquakes occurred within positive Coulomb stress regime, and the seismicity rate is highly related to the rate of pore pressure increase. In the next step we plan to apply the coupled poroelastic model to understand hydraulic fracturing induced earthquakes in shale gas exploration, such as the recent Fox Creek event cluster, in the western Canada sedimentary basin.",

            "abstract": "Late Triassic magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy has recently been investigated in both continental and Tethyan marine sequences (Hounslow and Muttoni, 2010). However, there is no agreed on geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) for the Late Triassic, because of poor age control of many Late Triassic magnetostratigraphic sections, missing or duplicated intervals, and within- section changes in sedimentation rates (Lucas, 2013).\nHere we present lower Carnian to upper Norian magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy (conodont and radiolaria) of the Upper Triassic bedded chert successions from the Mino belt, Inuyama area, central Japan. The bedded chert was deposited in a mid-oceanic basin of the Panthalassa Ocean. Chert samples were collected at two sections (Sakahogi and Momotaro sections) where Sugiyama (1997) investigated the radiolarian biostratigraphy. Based on detailed study of the conodont biostratigraphy from the study sections, five conodont zones are recognized in ascending order as follows: lower Carnian lower Quadralella polygnathiformis zone, upper Carnian upper Quadralella polygnathiformis zone, lower Norian Epigondolella quadrata zone, middle Norian Epigondolella postera zone, and late Norian Epigondolella bidentata zone. Thermal demagnetization showed four distinct remanent magnetization components from the cherts. The highest blocking temperature component shows positive reversal test and is regarded as the primary remanent magnetization, which produced a magnetostratigraphy of the lower Carnian to upper Norian. The magnetostratigraphy consists of 15 substantive normal- reverse polarity chrons, defined by sampling at 256 stratigraphic levels. Paleomagnetic polarity reversals observed at the vicinity of Carnian/Norian boundary and middle Norian/upper Norian boundary are correlated with those of Tethyan marine sections (Pizzo Mondello and Silickà Brezovà). Assuming that the rocks in the two Tethyan marine sections were deposited in the Northern Hemisphere, the magnetostratigraphic correlation indicates that the bedded chert of Inuyama area was deposited in the Northern Hemisphere. The mean inclination of the last demagnetized component suggests the bedded chert originated in an equatorial area.",

            "abstract": "The most important unknown in the study of the lightning discharge is the physics of the initiation process. Both cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes lowering negative charge and intracloud (IC) flashes raising negative charge begin with a sequence of relatively large electric field pulses in the initial breakdown (IB) stage that are well documented, however, the pulse luminosity in the IB stage has not yet been analyzed with sufficient time resolution to properly resolve its characteristics. In the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015 we simultaneously recorded luminosity and electric field waveforms from IB pulses in numerous ground discharges and, for the first time, in cloud discharges. For all of these events radar was available, and, for some, Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) 3-D location of sources during the IB stage. The upper frequency response of the luminosity measurement, made with a photodiode system was 50 MHz. In 2013 and 2014, thirty IB luminosity pulses in CG flashes had an average 10% to 90% rise time of 25 μs, average half width of 68 μs, and average delay time of 8 μs between start of the associated electric field and the start of the pulse luminosity. For IC flashes, thirty-seven luminosity pulses were analyzed and the three time-parameters were found to be significantly longer: 59 μs, 176 μs, and 34 μs. The roughly ten LMA sources associated with the time period of each initial breakdown in the 2014 data are grouped within about 1 km. The mean height of the LMA sources during the IB period for CG flashes is 4.4 km with a standard deviation of 490 m and the same data for IC flashes is 6.2 km and 550 m. It follows from these luminosity data that the physics of the initiation process of CG flashes and IC flashes may indeed be different. We discuss the potential influence of scattering of the optical signal on the IB pulse luminosity wave shapes and delay times. We also will discuss the summer 2015 data, which is being acquired at the time of this Abstract’s writing.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) place an equal emphasis on science process skills and science content. The goal is to have K-12 students “doing” science, not just “learning about” science. However, most traditional college science classes for elementary education majors place a much stronger emphasis on science content knowledge with the hands-on portion limited to a once-a-week lab. The two models of instruction are not aligned. The result is that many elementary school teachers are unprepared to offer interactive science with their students. Without additional coaching, many teachers fall back on the format they learned in college – lecture, handouts, homework. If we want teachers to use more hands-on methods in the classroom, these techniques should be taught to elementary education majors when they are in college.\nDickinson State University has begun a collaboration between the Teacher Education Department and the Department of Natural Sciences. The physical science course for elementary education majors has been completely redesigned to focus equally on the needed science content and the science process skills emphasized by the NGSS. The format of the course has been adjusted to more closely mirror a traditional K-5 classroom; the course meets for 50 minutes five days a week. A flipped-classroom model has been adopted to ensure no content is lost, and hands-on activities are done almost every day as new concepts are discussed.\nIn order to judge the effectiveness of these changes, a survey tool was administered to determine if there was a shift in the students’ perception of science as an active instead of a passive field of study. The survey also measured the students’ comfort-level in offering a hands-on learning environment in their future classrooms and their confidence in their ability to effectively teach science concepts to elementary students. Results from the first year of the study will be presented.",

And MH concentrated zones are being extracted.\nThis study is an introduction for the case example of interpretation of 3-D seismic data in the area which have not been drilled.\nThe characteristic of 3-D seismic data in this study area shows fold structure, which undulates severalfold. In addition, some faults are interpreted, which does not show the large displacement, are seen. Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) is very visible continuously. Clear velocity contrast in the boundary between above and below of BSR and the high velocity anomaly above BSR are confirmed in the high density velocity analysis profile. MHs are assumed to exist in sand heterogeneously because the velocity distribution in the extracted zones is inhomogeneous. In the results of geomorphological analysis, channel deposits and mid submarine fan deposits, which are located above BSR, are presumed the sediments which bear sand.\nThus the extracted zones are estimated MH concentrated zones.\nAs above, even the area has not been drilled, the extraction of MH concentrated zones can be estimated by the interpretation of the seismic data, the result of the high density velocity analysis, and the distribution of sand by geomorphological analysis. These results will be useful for the plan of the future drilling programme.\nThis introduction is the example of 3-D seismic survey area. It will become a useful information for 3-D seismic survey plan by performing similar interpretation in 2-D seismic survey lines.",

As the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 to 65-70 parts per billion (ppb), it is important to further study the relationship between both anthropogenic and natural pollutants that lead to production and accumulation of surface ozone. Ground-level ozone data from Trinidad Head, California (THD) was analyzed from 2010-2014 to investigate the factors contributing to high ground-level ozone events. For this research project, a high ozone event was defined as ground-level ozone readings greater than the 90th percentile of the seasonal ozone variability observed during the 2003-2014 period. The ozone exceedances were also required to last for three continuous hours or more. Meteorological parameters, such as wind speed and synoptic patterns, were taken into account. In addition, impacts related to stratospheric intrusions, Asian pollution transport, and the influence of local forest fires were considered. We show that high ground-level ozone events at THD occur during a dominant wind direction and are highly dependent on the origin of the air mass. This understanding of enhanced ground-level ozone drivers will provide a foundational knowledge of climate adaptation and mitigation with improved scientific understanding of the changing climate and its impacts.",

            "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) are the key enablers in the domain of nanoscience and have found many applications due to their physico-chemical and optical properties. For example, they are used in solar cells, lighting technologies, and biomedical imaging. Their presence in the environment following their application and life-cycle is inevitable. Therefore, it is critical to understand their behavior in the soil water system to assess the risks they may pose to natural systems and to public health. Assessing the factors that impact the stability and mobility of QDs in the soil water system is important. Natural organic ligands occur in subsurface environments and alter chemical processes in soils through complex reactions with metal ions in solution and ligand exchange reactions on soil surfaces. Consequently, the presence of ligands may alter the surface properties of QDs and impact their stability and mobility in saturated porous media. In this study, characteristics and stability of CdSe/ZnS QDs in water solutions are tested in batch experiments. The impacts of organic ligands (acetate, oxalate, and citrate) on the stability of QDs under various pH (5, 7 and 9) and ionic strength (0.05 and 0.1 M) conditions were investigated. The stability and aggregation kinetics of QDs were examined using UV-vis and DLS methods. Selected parameters from batch experiments were then used as study conditions to perform column transport experiments to generate breakthrough curves and retention profiles to assess the fate and transport of QDs in saturated porous media, which is the first phase in simulating their behavior in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "By using ray theory in conjunction with the Born approximation, Dahlen et al. [2000] computed 3-D sensitivity kernels for finite-frequency seismic traveltimes. A series of studies have been conducted based on this theory to model the mantle velocity structure [e.g., Hung et al., 2004; Montelli et al., 2004; Ren and Shen, 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014]. One of the simplifications in the calculation of the kernels is the paraxial assumption, which may not be strictly valid near the receiver, the region of interest in regional teleseismic tomography.\nIn this study, we improve the accuracy of traveltime sensitivity kernels of the first P arrival by eliminating the paraxial approximation. For calculation efficiency, the traveltime table built by the Fast Marching Method (FMM) is used to calculate both the wave vector and the geometrical spreading at every grid in the whole volume. The improved kernels maintain the sign, but with different amplitudes at different locations. We also find that when the directivity of the scattered wave is being taken into consideration, the differential sensitivity kernel of traveltimes measured at the vertical and radial component of the same receiver concentrates beneath the receiver, which can be used to invert for the structure inside the Earth. Compared with conventional teleseismic tomography, which uses the differential traveltimes between two stations in an array, this method is not affected by instrument response and timing errors, and reduces the uncertainty caused by the finite dimension of the model in regional tomography. In addition, the cross-dependence of P traveltimes to S-wave velocity anomaly is significant and sensitive to the structure beneath the receiver. So with the component-differential finite-frequency sensitivity kernel, the anomaly of both P-wave and S-wave velocity and Vp/Vs ratio can be achieved at the same time.",

            "abstract": "An environmental correlation approach establishes predictive relationships between the measured properties of the critical zone with a comprehensive suite of environmental covariates. The environmental covariates ideally cover or represent proxies for the factors that control soil/regolith formation. These factors include parent material, time, climate, biological and landscape processes. The corresponding proxies include lithology maps, satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat TM, MODIS), geophysical imagery (e.g. magnetics, radiometrics and gravity), terrain attributes (e.g. slope, wetness index) and climate surfaces (e.g. annual rainfall).\nUsing this approach we model and spatially predict two important components of the critical zone including: depth of weathering and geochemistry. Predictive maps of these attributes are based on nested piecewise linear tree models. Models of critical zone thickness and geochemistry (including elements, element ratios and chemical indices) have been developed at the catchment scale and at the continental scale. Thickness and weathering intensity (determined through geochemical weathering indices) of the critical zone profoundly affects groundwater interactions, subsoil water movement, water storage and nutrient availability. In highly weathered Australian landscapes we commonly see geochemical convergence typified by the abundance of end-member weathering phases such as quartz, clays and oxyhydroxides. The modelling can be used to map elements of economic importance or those which are potentially hazardous to human health.\n Modelling and integration of environmental covariates helps to facilitate our understanding of the processes occurring within the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere that control the nature and distribution of the weathered materials. It also provides an approach to integrate and model the vast amount of spatial information we have from ground, airborne and satellite remote sensing.",

In a symmetric current sheet, four types of compound structures are found: (a) RD-SS compound structure: show shock (SS) is attached to the downstream of rotational discontinuity (RD), (b) SS-RD: SS is followed by an adjacent RD, (c) SS-RD-SS: RD is trapped inside SS, and (d) switch-off slow shock (SSS). In the asymmetric current sheet, the rotational angle of magnetic field across an RD on the side with a higher plasma density is usually larger than that with a lower plasma density. In the asymmetric cases, a pure RD, a single SS, or a pure slow expansion wave (SE) may appear. When the asymmetry is further increased, RD may become absent in the low density side. For a highly asymmetric current sheet, a slow expansion wave (SE) is formed behind the SS-RD compound structure on the side with a very high plasma density.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary deposits in the Valles Marineris region of Mars are investigated to build a catalog of sedimentary and deformational features. The occurrence of these features provides new and important constraints on the origins of these sedimentary deposits and of their broader geologic histories. Regional surveys and mapping of these features is warranted given the plethora of recently acquired observations by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Select sedimentary and deformational features were identified using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) observations and stereo pairs, along with Context camera images. Feature locations were cataloged using Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS) the geospatial information system. Images acquired in and around Hebes, Ophir, Tithonium, Candor, Ius, Melas and Coprates Chasmata were the focus of this investigation.\nMass wasting processes, soft-sediment deformation structures, and fan-like deposits are known to occur in abundance across the Valles Marineris region. For this reason, the features recorded in this investigation were landslides, contorted bedding, injectites, putative mud volcanoes, faults, folds, and fan-shaped deposits. Landslides, faults, and fan-shaped deposits were found to be common occurrences, while contorted bedding, injectites, putative mud volcanoes, and folds occur less frequently and in clusters. The placement and frequency of these features hint at past tectonic and depositional processes at work in Valles Marineris. This catalogue of sedimentary and deformational features in the Valles Marineris region of Mars is being used to define targets for future HiRISE observations.",

            "abstract": "Cruise NBP14-02 conducted the first interdisciplinary oceanographic survey of the continental shelf adjacent to the Totten Glacier-Moscow University Ice Shelf system on the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. Hydrographic data indicate that this system is presently influenced by subsurface (>350 m) intrusion of relatively warm (>0°C) modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) via a cross-shelf trough. To assess the late Quaternary influence of mCDW, we collected marine sediment cores at two locations, each of which recovered a complete 10-13 m sequence of glacial diamict and Holocene laminated diatom ooze/mud. Chronology is constrained by 210Pb and species-specific foraminifer-based AMS 14C dates.\nForaminifer CaCO3 is most abundant in surface sediments (0-0.2 mcd) and from 1.5 to 5 mcd. Planktic foraminifer, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma(s), dominates surface sediments and diatom muds downcore, but is less abundant in diatom oozes. Benthic foraminifer species, Bulimina aculeata, which prefers hemipelagic environments and bottom waters >0°C, dominates the living benthic assemblage. The fossil benthic assemblage is characterized by Trifarina angulosa, associated with oxygenated bottom waters and strong bottom currents, suggesting that this assemblage may record past changes in the shoreward flow of ocean currents and the location of oceanic frontal zones. T. angulosa presence in oozes of mat-forming diatom species associated with oceanic fronts, supports this interpretation.\nModern benthic and planktic δ18O suggest a well-mixed water column. Below 1.5 mcd, foraminifer isotopes and diatom assemblages indicate surface stratification and increased biogenic productivity, suggesting that modern environmental conditions, including mCDW inflow, existed episodically during the Holocene. Paired T. angulosa δ18O and Mg/Ca analyses will provide additional information on past mCDW influence on this climatically sensitive region at the outlet of the extensive (287,000 km2) Aurora Subglacial Basin, which holds a 2-4.5 km thick volume of ice equivalent to >5 m of eustatic sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "We have constructed an earthquake and fault database, conducted a series of ground-shaking scenarios, and proposed seismic hazard maps for all of Myanmar and hazard curves for selected cities. Our earthquake database integrates the ISC, ISC-GEM and global ANSS Comprehensive Catalogues, and includes harmonized magnitude scales without duplicate events. Our active fault database includes active fault data from previous studies. Using the parameters from these updated databases (i.e., the Gutenberg-Richter relationship, slip rate, maximum magnitude and the elapse time of last events), we have determined the earthquake recurrence models of seismogenic sources. To evaluate the ground shaking behaviours in different tectonic regimes, we conducted a series of tests by matching the modelled ground motions to the felt intensities of earthquakes. Through the case of the 1975 Bagan earthquake, we determined that Atkinson and Moore’s (2003) scenario using the ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) fits the behaviours of the subduction events best. Also, the 2011 Tarlay and 2012 Thabeikkyin events suggested the GMPEs of Akkar and Cagnan (2010) fit crustal earthquakes best. We thus incorporated the best-fitting GMPEs and site conditions based on Vs30 (the average shear-velocity down to 30 m depth) from analysis of topographic slope and microtremor array measurements to assess seismic hazard. The hazard is highest in regions close to the Sagaing Fault and along the Western Coast of Myanmar as seismic sources there have earthquakes occur at short intervals and/or last events occurred a long time ago. The hazard curves for the cities of Bago, Mandalay, Sagaing, Taungoo and Yangon show higher hazards for sites close to an active fault or with a low Vs30, e.g., the downtown of Sagaing and Shwemawdaw Pagoda in Bago.",

            "abstract": "Electron precipitation down to the atmosphere caused by wave-particle scattering in the magnetosphere contribute significantly to the enhancement of auroral ionospheric conductivity. Global MHD models that are incapable of capturing kinetic physics in the inner magnetosphere usually adopt MHD parameters to specify the precipitation flux to estimate auroral conductivity, hence losing self-consistency in the global circulation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. In this study we improve the coupling structure in global models by connecting the physics-based (wave-particle scattering) electron precipitation with the ionospheric electrodynamics and investigate the feedback effect on the magnetospheric dynamics. We use BATS-R-US coupled with a kinetic ring current model RAM-SCB that solves pitch angle dependent particle distributions to study the global circulation dynamics during the Jan 25-26, 2013 storm event. Following tail injections, we found enhanced precipitation number and energy fluxes of tens of keV electrons being scattered into loss cone due to interactions with enhanced chorus and hiss waves in the magnetosphere. This results in a more profound auroral conductance and larger electric field imposing on the plasma transport in the magnetosphere. We also compared our results with previous methods in specifying the auroral conductance, such as empirical relation used in Ridley et al. (2004). It is found that our physics-based method develops a larger convection electric field in the near-Earth region and therefore leads to a more intense ring current.",

            "abstract": "Sumba Island is uniquely positioned within the Sunda-Banda forearc, at the transition between oceanic subduction and arc-continent collision. There, the convergence between the Sunda and Australian plates is accommodated along at least three major structures: the megathrust, the Savu backthrust located south of Sumba and the Flores backthrust located north of the volcanic arc. The incipient collision in the vicinity of Sumba is responsible for coastal vertical movements. Quaternary reefal deposits form spectacular uplifted flights of terraces, which directly overlie Mid Miocene - Early Pliocene deep carbonate and volcaniclastic rocks at elevations exceeding 500m. Although aerial fossil reefs extensively rim the northern and eastern coasts of Sumba, studies have been limited to Cape Laundi where an uplift rate of 0.2-0.5 m/kyr is estimated for the last 400 kyr, partly on the basis of alpha-spectrometric U/Th dating. At the island scale, the relief morphology and the hydrographic network point to a N-S asymmetry, indicating a general tilt toward the north. A subducting seafloor asperity and south-dipping normal faults have been postulated to generate this asymmetry. However as the pattern and kinematics of the deformation remain partially determined, structures and processes capable of driving such deformation and accommodating the nascent collision may be undisclosed. New topographic data coupled with field observations and coral mass-spectrometric U/Th dating allow investigating the morphology, stratigraphy and age of the fossil reef terraces at the island scale. Tectonic structures disrupting the topography are identified and their activities are relatively dated with respect to fossil reef terraces. The deformation pattern of Sumba is characterized, especially in Cape Laundi where the uplift rate is re-evaluated. Through a multi-disciplinary study, we intend to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of Sumba island and, at a larger scale, of the collision in SE Indonesia.",

Offered on Saturday afternoons, each event focuses on a different science-related theme. Families can attend these events free of charge, and the kids participate in a large variety of hands-on activities which center around the event’s theme.\nThis year, the November event focused on climate change and the roles soil plays in the climate system. The timing of this topic was carefully chosen. 2015 has been declared the International Year of Soil by the United Nations, and the Soil Science Society of America theme for the month of November was Soils and Climate. This public outreach event was an amazing opportunity to help the youth in our community learn about climate change and soil in a fun, interactive environment. The activities also helped the children learn how science is a process of discovery that allows them to better understand the world they live in. In addition to the hands-on activities, a planetarium show focusing on climate change was also offered during the event. The fully immersive, 360-degree show allowed the kids and their parents to personally observe phenomena that are otherwise difficult to visualize.\nAll of the activities at the Family Science Day event were staffed by university students, and this proved to be a very valuable experience for them as well. Some of the students who helped are majoring in a science field, and for them, the experience taught public communication. They learned to break complicated concepts down into simpler terms that young kids can understand. Education majors who participated practiced communicating science concepts to children, and students in other majors who helped with this event gained experiences that reinforced various concepts they had learned in their general education science courses.",

            "abstract": "The primitive upper mantle (PUM) represents the silicate residue of terrestrial core formation and should reflect element partitioning between metal and silicate melts that equilibrated in a magma ocean. Laboratory experiments suggest that the W/Mo ratio of PUM is only reproduced if S is added to the Earth during the late stages of accretion (Wade et al. 2012). Core-segregation, however, is posited to occur at >35 GPa and >3000 K; above the pressure range explored by existing W partitioning experiments and conditions under which O may also enter core-forming metal. The effect of light element solutes on a metallic Fe liquid can be modeled using experimentally determined interaction parameters (ε). On the basis of ε values determined at ambient pressure, both O and S should interact strongly with W (εw-o = 4.1, εw-s = 6.1), possibly complicating the history of W distribution during accretion.\nWe have performed experiments to assess the metal-silicate partitioning of W at conditions directly relevant to those expected for the base of a magma ocean, under which O enters the metal phase. Experiments were performed at 15-50 GPa in a diamond anvil cell, using Re gaskets and an MgO pressure medium. In several instances, cells were loaded with two sample mixtures, containing W in either oxidized or reduced form. Heating spots subject to the same temperature and heating duration but different initial W oxidation state will be used to assess if heating times were sufficient to approach equilibrium. Samples were laser-heated at sector 13 of the Advanced Photon Source then recovered for analysis using a focused ion beam, to reveal cross-sections through the heated spot. Samples comprise a Fe-rich metal bleb, surrounded by silicate glass. The quenched metal contains exsolved spherules of a Si+O-rich phase, indicating significant solution of these elements at high pressure and temperature. Work is ongoing to quantify the element distribution between metal and silicate phases.",

            "abstract": "Vertical displacements excited by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or tsunamis excites pressure waves in the atmosphere. The excited oscillation propagates to ionosphere where solar radiation ionize a part of atmosphere, resulting in a disturbance of the total electron content (TEC).\nWhere numerous studies have reported ionospheric disturbance excited by earthquakes or tsunamis, much smaller number of studies have investigated that excited by volcanic eruptions. This study reports on the ionospheric disturbance excited by the 2015 Kuchinoerabu-jima eruption observed by continuous GPS observations.\nThe 2015 Kuchinoerabu-jima eruption is a phreatomagmatic eruption occurred on 29 May 2015. The eruption is explosive with a column height up to 10,000 meters above the vent. The disturbance of TEC started from about 10 minutes after the eruption at approximately 100 km from the volcano. The disturbance then propagates outward for about 10 minutes. The velocity of pressure wave is estimated to be about 500 m/s, consistent with the average acoustic velocity in the ionosphere.\nThe dominant frequency of the observed disturbance is about 11 mHz, much higher than the eigenfrequencies of Earth's atmosphere, 3.7 mHz and 4.4 mHz. The dominant frequency observed here might be related to the dominant frequency of the acoustic wave excited by the eruption and the dissipation of the medium.\nWhile the ionospheric disturbance associated with the 2003 Soufrière Hills lasted more than an hour, that in this study lasted only up to a few minutes. This difference might correspond to the difference in time scale of the excitation.\nThe pressure wave excited by the eruption is also recorded by broadband seismometers in the Japanese islands. Our goal is thus to gain more insights into the mechanics of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling as well that of the 2015 Kuchinoerabu-jima eruption consisent with both seismic and GPS observations.",

            "abstract": "During Expedition ARA05C (from Aug 26 to Sep 19, 2014) on the Korean icebreaker RV ARAON, the multi-channel seismic (MCS) data were acquired on the outer shelf and slope of the Canadian Beaufort Sea to investigate distribution and internal geological structures of the offshore ice-bonded permafrost and gas hydrates, totaling 998 km L-km with 19,962 shots. The MCS data were recorded using a 1500 m long solid-type streamer with 120 channels. Shot and group spacing were 50 m and 12.5 m, respectively. Most MCS survey lines were designed perpendicular and parallel to the strike of the shelf break. Ice-bonded permafrost or ice-bearing sediments are widely distributed under the Beaufort Sea shelf, which have formed during periods of lower sea level when portions of the shelf less than ~100m water depth were an emergent coastal plain exposed to very cold surface. The seismic P-wave velocity is an important geophysical parameter for identifying the distribution of ice-bonded permafrost with high velocity in this area. Recently, full waveform inversion (FWI) and reverse time migration (RTM) are commonly used to delineate detailed seismic velocity information and seismic image of geological structures. FWI is a data fitting procedure based on wave field modeling and numerical analysis to extract quantitative geophysical parameters such as P-, S-wave velocities and density from seismic data. RTM based on 2-way wave equation is a useful technique to construct accurate seismic image with amplitude preserving of field data. In this study, we suggest two-dimensional P-wave velocity model (Figure.1) using the FWI algorithm to delineate the top and bottom boundaries of ice-bonded permafrost in the Canadian shelf of Beaufort Sea. In addition, we construct amplitude preserving migrated seismic image using RTM to interpret the geological history involved with the evolution of permafrost.",

            "abstract": "High resolution seismic waveform studies show that intra-continental earthquakes can occur at depths of 70-80km. This has puzzled researchers for decades because the high pressure and high temperature conditions at these depths should prohibit brittle failure. Indeed, in most continental regions, earthquakes are restricted to the upper half of the crust. Beneath southernmost and northwest Tibet, the crust is up to 50-90 km thick, where rocks under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions should be eclogitic. However, receiver functions show a well-defined Ps conversion continuously from ~40 km depth in northern India to ~90 km in northwest and southern Tibet. This suggests that the deep crust cannot be eclogite, which has similar seismic velocities to the upper mantle peridotite and cannot result in a sharp seismic discontinuity. For these reasons, as well as related gravity, topography and density data, it is suggested that the deep lower crust beneath southern and northwest Tibet is likely metastable granulite. Very few studies on the mechanism of deep crustal earthquakes have been reported. Eclogitic psuedotachylites observed in the Western Gneiss Region of Norway were attributed to faulting in the deep crustal rocks in dry granulite (Austrheim, 1994). Deep crustal earthquakes under Tibet may be related to a similar transformation of metastable granulite to eclogite. We have conducted preliminary deformation experiments on a metastable felsic-granulite in the stability field of eclogite using a modified Griggs-type apparatus. In contrast to mafic granulite that showed ductile behaviors at P = 1GPa, T = 1273K and strain rates between 1×10-4 and 8.77×10–6 s–1 (Wang et al., 2012). The felsic-granulite specimen deformed within the eclogite stability field, at P=3GPa, T=1273K and strain rate of 2×10-4/s, shows well developed faults. Ultra-fine grain materials (grain size < 1 mm), as the products of eclogitic phase transformation, are observed in fault gauges. These results reveal that the eclogitization of granulite may be a viable mechanism for certain deep crustal earthquakes under Tibet. In situ deformation experiments using the D-DIA are underway.",

            "abstract": "In many methods of the present EEW systems, hypocenter and magnitude are determined quickly, and then the strengths of ground motions are predicted using the hypocentral distance and magnitude based on a ground motion prediction equation (GMPE), which usually leads the prediction of concentric distribution. However, actual ground shaking is not always concentric, even when site amplification is corrected. At a common site, the strengths of shaking may be much different among earthquakes even when their hypocentral distances and magnitudes are almost the same. For some cases, PGA differs more than 10 times, which leads to imprecise prediction in EEW.\nRecently, Numerical Shake Prediction method was proposed (Hoshiba and Aoki, 2015), in which the present ongoing wavefield of ground shaking is estimated using data assimilation technique, and then future wavefield is predicted based on physics of wave propagation. Information of hypocentral location and magnitude is not required in this method. Because future is predicted from the present condition, it is possible to address the issue of the non-concentric distribution. Once the deviated distribution is actually observed in ongoing wavefield, future distribution is predicted accordingly to be non-concentric. We will indicate examples of M6-class earthquakes occurred at central Japan, in which strengths of shaking were observed to non-concentrically distribute. We will show their predictions using Numerical Shake Prediction method.\nThe deviated distribution may be explained by inhomogeneous distribution of attenuation. Even without attenuation structure, it is possible to address the issue of non-concentric distribution to some extent once the deviated distribution is actually observed in ongoing wavefield. If attenuation structure is introduced, we can predict it before actual observation. The information of attenuation structure leads to more precise and rapid prediction in Numerical Shake Prediction method for EEW.",

            "abstract": "The Gardar Province in southern Greenland is a long-lived, rift-related igneous province comprising a suite of basaltic flows, alkaline complexes and dikes. The Gardar period is known to last more than 200 Ma from c. 1350 Ma to 1140 Ma, but is characterized by two main phases of igneous activity represented by early (1300 – 1250 Ma) and late (1180 – 1140 Ma) Gardar intrusions, respectively. The earliest rocks ascribed to the Gardar period are terrestrial sandstones and lavas composing the Eriksfjord Formation that unconformably overlie the Paleoproterozoic basement rocks. One of the unsolved issues in the Gardar Province is to determine the precise age of the lavas from the Eriksfjord Formation, which can constrain the timing of the beginning of the Gardar rifting. In this study, for the first time, we presented precise U-Pb zircon ages of the lavas from the Eriksfjord Formation.\nZircons were separated from five samples of basaltic lavas collected at the Motzfeldt Center for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating. All the zircons under CL image analysis show oscillatory zoning, indicative of magmatic origin, and their U-Pb ages were measured by SHRIMP at Korea Basic Science Institute. The mean 207Pb/206Pb ages of each sample range from 1315 – 1329 Ma, whereas the concordant 207Pb/206Pb ages from 1322 – 1327 Ma. When all of the analyzed data from five samples were considered together, they showed a normal distribution pattern and yielded a mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1322.8 ± 4.7 Ma (MSWD = 0.04) and a concordant 207Pb/206Pb age of 1324.5 ± 3.4 Ma (MSWD = 0.04), respectively. These ages are consistent with the age of 1.35 – 1.31 Ga inferred from paleomagnetic data for the entire succession of the Eriksfjord Formation. Our ages suggest that the Gardar magmatism started at c. 1325 Ma and lasted until c. 1140 Ma in southern Greenland.",

It is crucial to accurately estimate cloud radiative heating profiles associated with the Madden－Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Kelvin Waves (KW) to better understand these large-scale convective phenomena.\nA new method based on ARM surface long term remote sensing data was developed to account deviations of radiative heating derived from the 1:30 and 13:30 A-Train sampling from the dirunally averaged heating. The new method was applied to CloudSat and CALIPSO 1:30 and 13:30 radiative heating structures associated with MJO and KW were investigated. It is found that under the “large-scale active convection” scenario the net heating was consistently over estimated if only using the two-time sampling. The adjusted net radiative heating associated with active phases of both MJO and long-wave KW (wave numer <=4) were more “bottom heavy”. The radiative heating associated with MJO is more “bottom heavy” than that associated with KW whose feature is dominated by waves with wave number>4. However, when the wave numer is less than 4 (ie. the spatial scale of its convection is comparable to that of MJO), the KW radiative heating structure is similar to that of MJO.",

The origin of the up-down motions of the current sheet, referred to as flapping motions, is among the most fundamental issues of magnetotail dynamics. Observational evidences suggest that the flapping motion is a kind of internal excited kink-like waves, but its particular propagating features such as the low phase speeds and the propagating direction from the tail center toward flanks do not match any local generation mechanisms previously established so far. Here we report observations of the current sheet flapping motions induced by non-adiabatic ions in the magnetic field configurations with a finite guiding component, whose population present periodic hemispherical asymmetries. Three type of current sheet flapping event in this paper will be discussed. This current sheet flapping phenomenon implies that the excitation mechanism of the current sheet flapping motions is a self-circulation process between the non-adiabatic ion population and the current sheet equilibrium itself.",

Users can easily get the uploaded data by use of a web browser through Internet.\nThe cloud sharing system is designed for residential and only shared in local community internal. Residents can freely add sensors and register information about installation points in each region.

Array observation is one of the powerful method for estimating incident angle and apparent velocity. We have constructed array observation network with six CV-374 type strong motion seismometers (Tokyo Sokushin co.) in our institute and have worked on the improvement of array analysis technique in real-time.\n Efficient calculation of array data is the key issue as well as the evaluation of analyzed result when we use array data in EEW system. We adopt semblance analysis and oct-tree search algorithm for estimating incident angle and apparent velocity of wavefield. As a result, we have been able to calculate semblance value with time window of 4 s within every 1 s.\n Semblance value tends to be high when direct P or S wave arrives, while they become gradually lower at the time of P or S coda. Absolute value of semblance is higher with direct P waves than those of direct S waves. Residuals for incident angles of P waves of 103 earthquakes show some azimuthal dependency. In addition, calculation of cross-spectrum with a reference station indicates that each station have its site effect in phase domain corresponding to the condition of installed place.

Some commercial activated carbons previously selected (Monteleoneet al., 2011) as being effective in hydrogen sulfide up taking have been tested in an adsorption measurement apparatus, by flowing both hydrogen sulphide and volatile siloxane (Decamethycyclopentasiloxane or D5) in a nitrogen stream,typically 25–300 ppm D5 over N2, through an clay minerals, Fe oxides and Silica; the adsorption process was analyzed by varying some experimental parameters (concentration, grain size, bed height). The best silica shows an adsorption capacity of 0.2 g D5 per gram of silica. The next thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) confirms the capacity data obtained experimentally by the breakthrough curve tests.The capacity results depend on D5 and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. A regenerative silica process is then carried out byheating the silica bed up to 200 ° C and flushing out the adsorbed D5 and hydrogen sulphide samples in a nitrogen stream in athree step heating procedure up to 200 ° C. The adsorption capacity is observed to degrade after cyclingthe samples through several adsorption–desorption cycles.",

Trees assimilate carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, in the process faithfully recording the average atmospheric 14C content over the growing season in each annual tree ring. Using 14C as a proxy for fossil CO2, we examine interannual variability over six years of fossil CO2 observations between 2004 and 2012 from two trees growing near the Kapuni Natural Gas Plant in rural Taranaki, New Zealand. We quantify the amount of variability that can be attributed to transport and meteorology by simulating constant point source fossil CO2 emissions over the observation period with the atmospheric transport model WindTrax. We then calculate the amount of change in emissions that we can detect with new observations over annual or multi-year time periods given both measurement uncertainty of 1ppm and the modelled variation in transport. In particular, we ask, what is the minimum amount of change in emissions that we can detect using this method, given a reference period of six years? We find that changes of 42% or more could be detected in a new sample from one year at the pine tree, or 22% in the case of four years of new samples. This threshold lowers and the method becomes more practical with a larger signal; for point sources 10 times the magnitude of the Kapuni plant (a typical size for large electricity generation point sources worldwide), it would be possible to detect sustained emissions changes on the order of 10% given suitable meteorology and observations.",

            "abstract": "In urban settlements temperatures are typically elevated compared to their rural surrounding. This so-called urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon exists in all diverse layers of modern cities such as surface and subsurface. While both are typically investigated individually, the coupling of these zones is not sufficiently understood. Using satellite derived land surface temperatures (LST) and interpolated groundwater temperature (GWT) measurements we compare the spatial properties of both heat islands in four German cities and analyze their dissimilarities in order to understand the interaction between the urban surface and subsurface. The best correlation of more than 80% is found in old, mature cities such as Cologne and Berlin. However, local groundwater hotspots under the city center and industrial areas are not revealed in satellite derived land surface temperatures. Overall groundwater temperatures are higher than land surface temperatures in 95% of the analyzed area due to the influence of below ground anthropogenic heat sources such as elevated basement temperatures. Thus, an estimation method is proposed that relates groundwater temperatures to mean annual land surface temperatures, building density and elevated basement temperatures. Using this method regional groundwater temperatures can be accurately estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.9 K.\nSince land surface temperatures and building densities are available from remote sensing, this method has the potential for a large scale estimations of urban groundwater temperatures. Thus, it is feasible to detect subsurface urban heat islands (SUHI) on a global level. Furthermore, geothermal potentials and groundwater quality issues such as thermal stress to groundwater ecosystems can now be investigated using satellite derived data.",

            "abstract": "There are a growing number of speleothem δ18O records emerging from the Southwest US that are interpreted to reflect, in part, past variability in moisture source. The present-day sources of moisture to the region, however, have yet to be quantified. We present results from a simulation of modern climate (1975-2013) using the Community Atmosphere Model (version 5)/Community Land Model (version 4) (1.9x2.5° grid resolution) that included six water tags to track water evaporated from over the North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, west and central North Pacific, far east Pacific and Gulf of California, the entire Southern Hemisphere, and land over the Northern Hemisphere. In the model, sea surface temperature and sea ice were prescribed, and the atmosphere and land were allowed to evolve freely. The results document a strong, NW-SE gradient in winter Pacific-derived precipitation, from 50% in southern California to 5% in east Texas. SE to NW gradients in annual precipitation derived from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic are similar, and range from 30% in east Texas to 5% in southern California. The proportions of winter precipitation from the Atlantic plus Gulf of Mexico negatively co-vary with that from the Pacific across the region. The contribution of water evaporated from land (i.e., terrestrial moisture) comprises the largest source water fraction (50%) during summer months over most of the region, contrary to the notion that Gulf of Mexico is the dominant moisture source during summer. Lastly, fractions of moisture source contributions are not correlated with precipitation amount, except for terrestrial moisture (positive correlation). The lack of correlation can account for the inferred decoupling between moisture source and amount suggested by the lack of co-variation in speleothem δ18O values and growth rate in recently published speleothem records from New Mexico and Texas. Future work will dynamically assess the climate processes driving variations in the proportion of source water contributions to the region.",

            "abstract": "Redox reaction associated with microbial elemental respiration is a ubiquitous process in sediments and suspended particles at various temperatures or pH/Eh conditions. Particularly, changes in elemental redox states (structural or dissolved elemental form) induced by microbial respiration result in the unexpected biogeochemical reactions in the light of biotic/abiotic mineralization. The objective of the present study is, therefore to investigate the secondary phase mineralization through a-/biogeochemical Fe and As redox cycling in the acido-hyperhtermal Norris Geyser Basin (NGB) in Yellowstone National Park, USA, typical of the extreme condition. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer and liquid chromatography with ICP-mass spectroscopy with filtrated supernatant were performed for the mineralogical and hydro-geochemical analysis.\nThe clay slurry collected from the active hot-spring of the NGB area (pH=3.5 and Temperature=78 ℃) was incubated with (“enrichment”) or without the growth medium (“natural”). The control was prepared in the same condition except adding the glutaraldehyde to eliminate the microbial activity. The secondary phase mineral formation of the oxidative phase of Fe and As, and K identified as ‘Pharmacosiderite’ only appeared in the enrichment set suggesting a role of extremophiles in the mineral formation. The considerable population of Fe-oxidizer (Metallosphera yellowstonensis MK-1) and As-oxidizer (Sulfurihydrogenibium sp.) was measured by phylogenetic analysis in the present study area. The inhibition of As-oxidation in the low pH conditions was reported in the previous study, however the As-redox reaction was observed and consequently, precipitated the Pharmacosiderite only in the enrichment set suggesting a biotic mineralization. The present study collectively suggests that the microbial activity may bypass the chemical or thermodynamical reaction barriers and promote the secondary phase mineral formation through the elemental respiration. The possible biotic/abiotic mechanism or process in mineral alteration/formation in extreme environment will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "California recently passed legislation mandating dedicated groundwater quality monitoring for new well stimulation operations. The authors provided the State with\nexpert advice\n on the design of such monitoring networks. Factors that must be considered in designing a new and unique groundwater monitoring program include:\nProgram design: The design of a monitoring program is contingent on its purpose, which can range from detection of individual well leakage to demonstration of regional impact. The regulatory goals for permit-required monitoring conducted by operators on a well-by-well basis will differ from the scientific goals of a regional monitoring program conducted by the State.\nVulnerability assessment: Identifying factors that increase the probability of transport of fluids from the hydrocarbon target zone to a protected groundwater zone enables the intensity of permit-required monitoring to be tiered by risk and also enables prioritization of regional monitoring of groundwater basins based on vulnerability. Risk factors include well integrity; proximity to existing wellbores and geologic features; wastewater disposal; vertical separation between the hydrocarbon and groundwater zones; and site-specific hydrogeology.\nAnalyte choice: The choice of chemical analytes in a regulatory monitoring program is guided by the goals of detecting impact, assuring public safety, preventing resource degradation, and minimizing cost. Balancing these goals may be best served by tiered approach in which targeted analysis of specific chemical additives is triggered by significant changes in relevant but more easily analyzed constituents. Such an approach requires characterization of baseline conditions, especially in areas with long histories of oil and gas development.\nMonitoring technology: Monitoring a deep subsurface process or a long wellbore is more challenging than monitoring a surface industrial source. The requirement for monitoring multiple groundwater aquifers across a range of depths and of monitoring at deeper depths than is typical for regulatory monitoring programs requires consideration of monitoring technology, which can range from clusters of wells to multiple wells in a single wellbore to multi-level systems in a single cased wellbore.",

            "abstract": "Strategies to mitigate dangerous anthropogenic climate change require a dramatic transformation of the energy system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, that in turn requires large-scale investments. Investment decisions depend not only on investment capital availability but also on investment risks. A number of factors such as national policy environments, quality of public and private institutions, sector, firm and technology specific characteristics can affect investors’ assessments of risks, leading to a wide variation in the business climate for investment. Such heterogeneity in investment risks can have important implications, as investors usually respond to risks by requiring higher returns for riskier projects; delaying or forgoing the investments; or preferring to invest in existing, familiar projects. We study the impact of variation in investment risks on regional patterns of emissions mitigation, the cost of emissions mitigation and patterns of technology deployment. We modify an integrated assessment model, widely used in global climate policy analyses (the Global Change Assessment Model) and incorporate decisions on investments based on risks along two dimensions. Along the first dimension, we vary perceived risks associated with particular technologies. To do so, we assign a higher cost of capital for investment in low-carbon technologies as these involve intrinsically higher levels of regulatory and market risk. The second dimension uses a proxy to vary investment risks across regions, based on an institutional quality metric published by the World Economic Forum. Explicit representation of investment risks has two major effects. First, it raises the cost of emissions mitigation relative to a world with uniform investment risks. Second, it shifts the pattern of emissions mitigation, with industrialized countries mitigating more, and developing countries mitigating less. Our results suggest that institutional reforms aimed at lowering investment risks could be an important element in lowering the cost of climate change mitigation solutions.",

            "abstract": "Today, almost 40.000 large reservoirs, containing approximately 6.000 km3 of water and inundating an area of almost 400.000 km2, can be found on earth. Since these reservoirs have a storage capacity of almost one-sixth of the global annual river discharge they have a large impact on the timing, volume and peaks of river discharges.\nGlobal Hydrological Models (GHM) are thus significantly influenced by these anthropogenic changes in river flows. We developed a parametrically parsimonious method to extract operational rules based on historical reservoir storage and inflow time-series.\nManaging a reservoir is an imprecise and vague undertaking. Operators always face uncertainties about inflows, evaporation, seepage losses and various water demands to be met. They often base their decisions on experience and on available information, like reservoir storage and the previous periods inflow. We modeled this decision-making process through a combination of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks in an Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In a sensitivity analysis, we compared results for reservoirs in Vietnam, Central Asia and the USA.\nANFIS can indeed capture reservoirs operations adequately when fed with a historical monthly time-series of inflows and storage. It was shown that using ANFIS, operational rules of existing reservoirs can be derived without much prior knowledge about the reservoirs. Their validity was tested by comparing actual and simulated releases with each other. For the eleven reservoirs modelled, the normalised outflow, <0,1>, was predicted with a MSE of 0.002 to 0.044.\nThe rules can be incorporated into GHMs. After a network for a specific reservoir has been trained, the inflow calculated by the hydrological model can be combined with the release and initial storage to calculate the storage for the next time-step using a mass balance. Subsequently, the release can be predicted one time-step ahead using the inflow and storage.",

            "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that injections of high-pressure fluids into underground formations are capable of inducing significant earthquakes. The seismic hazards caused by fluid injection have become important topics of political and scientific discussion in recent years (Ellsworth,2013). Earthquake source parameters are crucial in studies of injection-induced earthquakes. However the accuracy of source parameters based on traditional travel-time method is limited by the available data recorded in sparse seismic network. The location error is often sizable in the area with sparse network; sometimes it can reach 10 km or more (Bondár et al., 2004). Fortunately, if there are one or two close seismic stations, we can improve the precision of source parameters by analyzing three-component seismic waveforms in details.In this study, we first obtained a shallow crust velocity model using the joint inversion of short-period Rayleigh wave group velocity and ellipticity for Rongchang (ROC) region in Chongqing, China. With the better-constrained velocity model, we relocated earthquakes in the vicinity of the seismic station ROC by analyzing three-component seismic waveforms and then determined the focal depths with the aid of local sPL depth phases. About 160 M~2.0 earthquakes during 2002 to 2014 were relocated with an uncertainty of 1~2 km. Results show that earthquakes in Rongchang area are along a geologic fault in the vicinity of fluid injection wells at depths of 2~5 km. Focal mechanism of the September 10, 2010 M4.7 Rongchang earthquake was inverted using the gCAP method and its b-value was estimated based on enhanced catalog via sliding-window cross-correlation. Focal mechanism of the earthquake is consistent with the fault’s strike; its b-value of 1.7 is significantly different from typical tectonic earthquakes. Therefore we propose that seismicity in Rongchang and adjacent areas tend to be induced by fluid injections.",

            "abstract": "Within rapid urbanization and industrialization, Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in China, has been facing serious water shortage. More than 80% of water demand in Shenzhen, i.e., about 1.6 billion m3/yr, is satisfied by water diversion projects. A lot of energy has been used to extract, clean, store and transmit these water. In this paper, energy consumption of urban water system in Shenzhen, China was investigated from a life cycle perspective, and the water system can be divided into five subsystems, i.e., water diversion, water production & supply, household water use, sewage treatment and water reuse. Industrial water use was not considered here, because industrial production processes were so varied. The results showed that water diversion subsystem in Shenzhen consumed electricity of about 0.839 billion kWh/yr (0.53 kWh/m3), water production & supply subsystem about 1.241 billion kWh/yr (0.64 kWh/m3), household water use subsystem about 6.57 billion kWh/yr (9.65 kWh/m3) sewage treatment subsystem about 0.449 billion kWh/yr (0.29 kWh/m3) and water reuse treatment subsystem about 0.013 billion kWh/yr (0.33kWh/m3). So the human-related water system in Shenzhen consumes electricity of about 9.113 billion kWh/yr in total, accounting for about 11.0% of all the electricity use in Shenzhen. Among this, household water use subsystem consumed up to 72.1% of all electricity used in urban water system, followed by water production & supply subsystem (13.6%), water diversion subsystem (9.2%) and sewage treatment and reuse subsystem (5.1%). Unit energy consumption of sewage treatment and reuse subsystem was much less than that of water diversion subsystem, indicating local sewage resource development was advantageous on saving energy to water diversion from a long distance. Further, it implied that the best way to save energy in urban water system is to save portable water, since both water production and household use require to consume much energy.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion is linked to overland flow processes that often occur in patchy patterns within the landscape. This patchiness arises from local differences in soil surface conditions, anthropogenic effects, vegetation cover, microtopography, and rainfall distribution and is not typically represented in catchment models. The continuity of overland flow is extremely important in predicting the severity of event-based erosion and the delivery of sediment to channels. Without some connectivity across the hillslope, surface water will reinfiltrate and any erosion that develops will be minor and local in nature. However, if runoff patches are connected by the development of other disturbances or overwhelmed by runoff during large events, the connectivity of overland flow will increase and erosion will be enhanced. A number of studies have shown that levels of both overland flow and erosion are generally greater in small plots compared to hillslopes because of opportunities for reinfiltration as runoff progresses. However, if runoff becomes concentrated and begins to incise rills and gullies, these ‘hot spots’ may increase erosion at larger scales and actually connect runoff from otherwise minor sediment contributing portions of the landscape into erosion channels. When external sources of water augment these dynamic systems (e.g., road and trail runoff), severe erosion consequences may occur. Capturing this important behaviour in catchment sediment models requires the identification of erosion hot spots and other anthropogenic effects that affect runoff, evaluation of thresholds for rill and gully incision, and assessment of topographic attributes that facilitate sediment linkages from source areas to channels. In many managed sites, a small percentage of the catchment contributes most of the sediment, thus modelling needs to identify these source areas and their linkages to streams in a parsimonious manner.

            "abstract": "Mars, just like Earth experience different seasons because of its axial tilt (about 25°). This causes growth and retreat of snow cover (primarily CO2) in Martian Polar regions. The perennial caps are the only place on the planet where condensed H2O is available at surface. On Mars, as much as 30% atmospheric CO2 deposits in each hemisphere depending upon the season. This leads to a significant variation on planet’s surface albedo and hence effecting the amount of solar flux absorbed or reflected at the surface. General Circulation Model (GCM) of Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) currently uses observationally derived surface albedo from Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument for the polar caps. These TES albedo values do not have any inter-annual variability, and are independent of presence of any dust/impurity on surface. Presence of dust or other surface impurities can significantly reduce the surface albedo especially during and right after a dust storm. This change will also be evident in the surface energy flux interactions. Our work focuses on combining earth based Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model with current state of GCM to incorporate the impact of dust on Martian surface albedo, and hence the energy flux. Inter-annual variability of surface albedo and planet’s top of atmosphere (TOA) energy budget along with their correlation with currently available mission data will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The physical and chemical properties of soil dust aerosol particles fundamentally affect their interaction with climate, including shortwave absorption and radiative forcing, nucleation of cloud droplets and ice crystals, heterogeneous formation of sulfates and nitrates on the surface of dust particles, and atmospheric processing of iron into bioavailable forms that increase the productivity of marine phytoplankton. Lidar measurements, such as extinction-to-backscatter, color and depolarization ratios, are frequently used to distinguish between aerosol types with different physical and chemical properties. The chemical composition of aerosol particles determines their complex refractive index, hence affecting their backscattering properties. Here we present a study on how dust aerosol backscattering and depolarization properties at wavelengths of 355, 532 and 1064 nm are related to size and complex refractive index, which varies with the mineral composition of the dust. Dust aerosols are represented by collections of spheroids with a range of prolate and oblate aspect ratios and their optical properties are obtained using T-matrix calculations. We find simple, systematic relationships between lidar observables and the dust size and complex refractive index that may aid the use of space-based or airborne lidars for direct retrieval of dust properties or for the evaluation of chemical transport models using forward simulated lidar variables. In addition, we present first results on the spatial variation of forward-simulated lidar variables based on a dust model that accounts for the atmospheric cycle of eight different mineral types plus internal mixtures of seven mineral types with iron oxides, which was recently implemented in the NASA GISS Earth System ModelE2.",

            "abstract": "Until recently, active fault zones were thought to deform via seismic slip during earthquakes in the upper, brittle portion of the crust, and by steady, aseismic shear below. However, since 2000, this view has been shaken by seismological observations of seismic tremor deep in the roots of active fault zones, including on the section of the San Andreas to the southeast of Parkfield, CA, deep (~20-30 km) beneath the nucleation zone of the great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. With funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, we have improved the seismic network in the area above the tremor source by installing four new broadband/strong motion surface stations and four borehole sites with uphole accelerometers and downhole geophones, broadband and strong motion sensors. Data from all stations are telemetered in real-time. They are analysed as part of normal earthquake monitoring, and archived and distributed through the Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC). Data from the TremorScope project is improving earthquake monitoring in the region south of Parkfield, including allowing empirical Greens function finite fault analysis of moderate events in the area. Locations and characterization of tremor episodes are improved by the data recorded by TremorScope stations. For example, the rate of ambient tremor activity in the TremorScope area increased by a factor of ~8 within ~12 hours of the 2014 Napa M6.0 earthquake and remained elevated for ~ 100 days, exceeding the tremor rate increase following the 2004 Parkfield M6.0 quake despite the differences in epicentral distance (~300 km vs. ~15 km). No comparable increases in tremor rates have been observed between the Parkfield and Napa events. This suggests that the sensitivity to external stressing in the in the deep tremor zone of the TremorScope region may have increased since 2004. We also show how this network's strong motion instrumentation will provide unprecedented and exciting insights into the seismic rupture process should a great San Andreas earthquake occur during the experiment.",

            "abstract": "Wind is a major disturbance in the Amazon and has both short-term impacts and lasting legacies in tropical forests. Observed patterns of damage across landscapes result from differences in wind exposure and stand characteristics, such as tree stature, species traits, successional age, and fragmentation. Wind disturbance has important consequences for biomass dynamics in Amazonian forests, and understanding the spatial distribution and size of impacts is necessary to quantify the effects on carbon dynamics. In November 2013, a mesoscale convective system was observed over the study area in Ucayali, Peru, a highly human modified and fragmented forest landscape. We mapped downfall damage associated with the storm in order to ask: how does the severity of damage vary within forest patches, and across forest patches of different sizes and successional ages? We applied spectral mixture analysis to Landsat images from 2013 and 2014 to calculate the change in non-photosynthetic vegetation fraction after the storm, and combined it with C-band SAR data from the Sentinel-1 satellite to predict downfall damage measured in 30 field plots using random forest regression. We then applied this model to map damage in forests across the study area. Using a land cover classification developed in a previous study, we mapped secondary and mature forest, and compared the severity of damage in the two. We found that damage was on average higher in secondary forests, but patterns varied spatially. This study demonstrates the utility of using multiple sources of satellite data for mapping wind disturbance, and adds to our understanding of the sources of variation in wind-related damage. Ultimately, an improved ability to map wind impacts and a better understanding of their spatial patterns can contribute to better quantification of carbon dynamics in Amazonian landscapes.",

            "abstract": "As the demand for introductory earth science classes rises at educational institutions, large class sizes place strain on the educator’s time and ability to offer extensive project-based assignments. As a result, exams covering a broad spectrum of material are more heavily weighted in students’ grades. Students often struggle on the first exam, as they attempt to retain a large amount of information from several different topics, while having no exposure to the type of questions that will be asked. This frequently leads to a large dropout rate early in the academic term, or at least a sense of discouragement and stress among struggling students. To better prepare students for a broad scope exam, a review activity modelled after the traditional Milton Bradley “Memory” game was developed to remind students of what would be covered on the exam, prepare them for the style of questions that may be asked, as well as provide a fun, interactive, and educational activity. The Earth Science Memory Game was developed to have interchangeable sets to cover a broad range of topics and thus also be reusable for the duration of the course. Example games sets presented include, but are not limited to, the scientific method, minerals, rocks, topographic maps, tectonics, geologic structures, volcanoes, and weather. The Earth Science Memory Game not only provides an effective review tool to improve success rates on broad scope exams, but is also customizable by the instructor, reusable, and easily constructed by common office supplies.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Cultivated Land Quality Grade monitoring and evaluation is an important way to improve the land production capability and ensure the country food safety. Irrigation guarantee capability is one of important aspects in the cultivated land quality monitoring and evaluation. In the current cultivated land quality monitoring processing based on field survey, the irrigation rate need much human resources investment in long investigation process. This study choses Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei as study region, taking the 1 km × 1 km grid size of cultivated land unit with a winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system as study object. A new irrigation capacity evaluation index based on the ratio of the annual irrigation requirement retrieved from MODIS data and the actual quantity of irrigation was proposed. With the years of monitoring results，the irrigation guarantee capability of study area was evaluated comprehensively. The change trend of the irrigation guarantee capability index (IGCI) with the agricultural drought disaster area in rural statistical yearbook of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area was generally consistent. The average of IGCI value, the probability of irrigation-guaranteed year and the weighted average which controlled by the irrigation demand index were used and compared in this paper. The experiment results indicate that the classification result from the present method was close to that from irrigation probability in the gradation on agriculture land quality in 2012, with overlap of 73% similar units. The method of monitoring and evaluation of cultivated land IGCI proposed in this paper has a potential in cultivated land quality level monitoring and evaluation in China.\nKey words: remote sensing, evapotranspiration, MODIS，cultivated land quality, irrigation guarantee capability\nAuthors: Chao Zhang, Jianxi Huang, Li Li, Hongshuo Wang, Dehai Zhu\nChina Agricultural University zhangchaobj@gmail.com",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux is one of the major greenhouse gas fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems. N2O is produced as a by-product of the transformations of nitrogen in the soil and is generally released from the soil surface to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study is to provide a data-oriented global estimate of N2O flux from the soil. In this study, a semi-empirical model was developed by modifying a model for soil CO2 flux (Raich et al. 2002). The model consists of the functions of nitrogen, air temperature, and precipitation. The parameters of the functions were determined using a global dataset of N2O emission (Stehfest and Bouwman 2006) through the Bayesian approach. The function of nitrogen is a function of carbon to nitrogen ratio. For agricultural land use, the effect of nitrogen fertilizer was also incorporated in the function of nitrogen. The model was applied at a spatial resolution of 5 min and at a monthly time resolution.\nPreliminary calculation revealed that the total amount of N2O emission was 10 Tg N yr−1. The upland natural land was the major source of N2O emission, followed by the upland agricultural land. Latitudinally, the flux was high at 30°N–40°N and 10°S–10°N. The major contribution to the peak at 30°N–40°N was by the upland agricultural land and that to the peak around the equator was by the upland natural land. The monthly flux showed a clear seasonality, and it was the highest and lowest in August and February, respectively. The global scale seasonality was mainly contributed by the N2O flux from the upland agricultural land in the northern mid-latitude. This study provides data-oriented spatiotemporal distribution of soil N2O flux, and I hope that these data will be used for a benchmark and constraint of process-based modeling.",

            "abstract": "Wetting phenomena are inherently multiscale; owing to the complex nature of porous and fractured media, immiscible flows in this setting continue to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. To gain some insight into the interplay between wettability and roughness of the medium, here we study experimentally the immiscible displacement of one fluid by another in a Hele-Shaw cell (two glass plates separated by a thin gap) with rough surfaces. We use a radial Hele-Shaw cell and saturate it with highly viscous silicone oil; we then inject a less viscous liquid at the center of the cell. Displacement of a more viscous liquid by a less viscous one leads to a hydrodynamic instability, known as viscous fingering. Wettability of the medium, however, has a profound influence on the displacement patterns and can lead to a complete suppression of the viscous fingering instability. Roughness, on the other hand, amplifies the wettability of the medium, making a wetting surface even more wetting and a non-wetting surface even more non-wetting. Roughness can also lead to contact-line pinning and intermittent avalanche-like behavior in the flow. We study the interplay between roughness and wettability of the medium by isolating each effect. We then propose a phase diagram that classifies the different displacement patterns, elucidating the underlying physics at play across scales.",

            "abstract": "On 27 September 2014, Mt. Ontake in Japan produced a phreatic (steam type) eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index value of 2 after being dormant for seven years. The local stress field around volcanoes is the superposition of the regional stress field and stress perturbations related to volcanic activity. Temporal stress changes over periods of weeks to months are generally attributed to volcanic processes. Here we show that monitoring temporal changes in the local stress field beneath Mt. Ontake, using focal mechanism solutions of volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes, is an effective tool for assessing the state of volcanic activity. We estimated focal mechanism solutions of 157 VT earthquakes beneath Mt. Ontake from August 2014 to March 2015, assuming that the source was double-couple. Pre-eruption seismicity was dominated by normal faulting with east-west tension, whereas most post-eruption events were reverse faulting with east-west compression. The misfit angle between observed slip vectors and those derived theoretically from the regional (i.e., background) stress pattern is used to evaluate the deviation of the local stress field, or the stress perturbation related to volcanic activity. The moving average of misfit angles tended to exceed 90° before the eruption, and showed a marked decrease immediately after the eruption. This indicates that during the precursory period the local stress field beneath Mt. Ontake was rotated by stress perturbations caused by the inflation of magmatic/hydrothermal fluids. Post-eruption events of reverse faulting acted to shrink the volcanic edifice after expulsion of volcanic ejecta, controlled by the regional stress field. The misfit angle is a good indicator of the state of volcanic activity. The monitoring method by using this indicator is applicable to other volcanoes and may contribute to the mitigation of volcanic hazards.",

This high population to land ratio, combined with socioeconomic development and increasing consumption has placed tremendous pressure on India’s land resources for food, feed, and fuel.\nIn this talk, we present contemporary (1985 to 2005) spatial estimates of land change in India using national-level analysis of Landsat imageries. Further, we investigate the causes of the spatial patterns of change using two complementary lines of evidence. First, we use statistical models estimated at macro-scale to understand the spatial relationships between land change patterns and their concomitant drivers. This analysis using our newly compiled extensive socioeconomic database at village level (~630,000 units), is 100x higher in spatial resolution compared to existing datasets, and covers over 200 variables. The detailed socioeconomic data enabled the fine-scale spatial analysis with Landsat data. Second, we synthesized information from over 130 survey based case studies on land use drivers in India to complement our macro-scale analysis. The case studies are especially useful to identify unobserved variables (e.g. farmer’s attitude towards risk). Ours is the most detailed analysis of contemporary land change in India, both in terms of national extent, and the use of detailed spatial information on land change, socioeconomic factors, and synthesis of case studies.",

Resonant interaction with chorus waves plays an important role in situ acceleration. In this paper, we study the simultaneous data of chorus waves and energetic electrons fluxes during the storm 19 to 21 February 2014. The Van Allen Probes observed substantial enhancements in fluxes of energetic (53.8-108.3 keV) and relativistic (2-3.6 MeV) electrons. Chorus waves were excited at location L=4-6 after the fluxes of energetic electrons were greatly enhanced in the recovery phase. We calculate the PSD ( =3433 MeV/G) as a function of time and L* for =0.11 REG1/2. We find that the peak in radial PSD profile occurs in the vicinity of L*=4.5, characteristic of local acceleration. The results provide a further evidence for in-situ electron acceleration caused by whistler mode chorus waves in the outer radiation belts.",

The sky radiometer, manufactured by PREDE Co. Ltd., Japan, is one of the SKYNET instruments. Present research activities have made it possible to retrieve not only optical characteristics of aerosols and clouds, but also columnar water vapor and ozone concentrations using data of this instrument. This study analyzes sky radiometer data of various sites to understand optical characteristics of aerosols of different backgrounds. Several interesting results were obtained. For example, the light-absorption capacity of dust aerosols was observed to depend on not only mixed pollutants but also on aerosol size. We further studied the effects of aerosols on atmospheric heat budget using such observation data and a radiative transfer model. The results showed clear spatial and temporal variations of aerosol radiative forcing at the surface as well as top of atmosphere (TOA). Sky radiometer data of selected super sites of SKYNET were also analyzed to understand the optical characteristics of clouds. Such retrieved cloud parameters were validated using irradiances measured at the surface as well as MODIS cloud parameters. Though differences exist with respect to MODIS cloud parameters, irradiances calculated using sky radiometer retrieved cloud parameters agree fairly well with observed values.",

            "abstract": "To perform an ensemble-based ENSO probabilistic forecast, the crucial issue is to design a reliable ensemble prediction strategy that should include the major uncertainties of a forecast system. In this study, we developed a new general ensemble perturbation technique to improve the ensemble-mean predictive skill of forecasting ENSO using an intermediate coupled model (ICM). The model uncertainties are first estimated and analyzed from EnKF analysis results through assimilating observed SST. Then, based on the pre-analyzed properties of the model errors, a zero-mean stochastic model-error model is developed to mainly represent the model uncertainties induced by some important physical processes missed in the coupled model (i.e., stochastic atmospheric forcing/MJO, extra-tropical cooling and warming, Indian Ocean Dipole mode, etc.). Each member of an ensemble forecast is perturbed by the stochastic model-error model at each step during the 12-month forecast process, and the stochastical perturbations are added into the modeled physical fields to mimic the presence of these high-frequency stochastic noises and model biases and their effect on the predictability of the coupled system.\nThe impacts of stochastic model-error perturbations on ENSO deterministic predictions are examined by performing two sets of 21-yr retrospective forecast experiments. The two forecast schemes are differentiated by whether they considered the model stochastic perturbations, with both initialized by the ensemble-mean analysis states from EnKF. The comparison results suggest that the stochastic model-error perturbations have significant and positive impacts on improving the ensemble-mean prediction skills during the entire 12-month forecast process. Because the nonlinear feature of the coupled model can induce the nonlinear growth of the added stochastic model errors with model integration, especially through the nonlinear heating mechanism with the vertical advection term of the model, the ensemble mean dynamics can make the model-error perturbations have the positive effects on improving the prediction skills for longer lead time.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a toxic heavy metal, which exists in various chemical forms in the environmental system. In the atmosphere, Hg exists in three forms (Hg0(g), Hg+2(g), and Hg(p)). Hg0(g) is the dominant species of atmospheric Hg, accounting for >95% of the total Hg in the atmosphere. Because Hg0(g) is highly volatile and has limited solubility in water, it cannot be easily removed by wet or dry deposition processes. Therefore, the residence time of Hg0(g) in the atmosphere is relatively long (1 to 2 years), allowing long-range transport from mercury emission source(s). Conversely, Hg+2(g) and Hg(p) are effectively removed from the atmosphere through wet and dry depositions. The determination of mercury source attribution using quantitative data is challenging because Hg0(g) may be deposited on an area upon oxidation to Hg+2(g) and associated with aerosols and particulates to form Hg(p) while the global cycling of Hg0(g).\nOver the last decade, the development of analytical methods of highly precise Hg isotopic measurements demonstrated mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes in environmental samples. For instance, MDF of Hg isotopes is thought to occur during various natural and industrial Hg transformations. MIF of Hg isotopes is observed during abiotic reduction, photochemical and non-photochemical, and physical and chemical processes. Such processes lead to differences in the Hg isotopic composition of different emission sources, both natural and anthropogenic, and atmospheric processes (i.e., transportation, oxidation/reduction, deposition, and reemission). Therefore, Hg isotopic compositions could be used to trace the sources and processes of atmospheric Hg.\nFor securing the reliability and accuracy of atmospheric Hg isotope data, the methods of collection, pretreatment, and isotopic measurement for Hg0(g) were developed to obtain high recovery yield of samples with no Hg isotopic fractionation during each analytical procedures. Using the optimum setting, Hg0 samples were collected in the rural, urban, and coastal environments for isotopic measurements.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between the timescales of tropical Pacific variability –seasonal to interannual to multidecadal- remain an open question. Paleoclimate records from the mid-Holocene indicate that a weakening of the eastern Pacific annual cycle is associated with a significant reduction in ENSO activity. In addition, we show here that last-millennium proxies indicate a negative correlation between ENSO activity and the zonal tropical Pacific SST gradient at decadal timescales, which supports the hypothesis that residual nonlinear heating from large ENSO events warms the cold tongue and thus decreases the zonal SST gradient beyond interannual scales (ENSO rectification hypothesis). On the other hand, the response of the seasonal cycle, ENSO, and the zonal SST gradient to global warming is inconclusive: While climate models project a weakening of the zonal SST gradient, the magnitude of this weakening as well as the sign and magnitude of the changes in ENSO and in the eastern Pacific annual cycle ranges significantly among models. Then the question becomes: do models exaggerate or mute tropical Pacific warming and annual cycle changes based on what kind of El Niño they simulate? What is the dominant balance of feedbacks that creates ENSO nonlinearities, and does it affect model projections of multidecadal tropical Pacific climate? Here, we diagnose the role of nonlinearities in ENSO response to external forcing using low-order models, which are derived from GCM simulations and encompass nonlinearities and seasonal dependences. We find that the relative balance between the Bjerknes feedback, atmospheric damping, and nonlinear advection feedbacks in the eastern Pacific not only influences the projected changes in ENSO variance and skewness, but also affects the response of the cold tongue at multidecadal timescales. Hence, we find that climate models with weak ENSO nonlinearities may overestimate the warming of the cold tongue, in the absence of strong thermodynamic damping and ENSO rectification processes that could balance the effects of radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "The tropical Pacific is the ocean’s largest natural source of CO2 to the atmosphere, thus playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. Observational studies show that that since 1980, the outgassing of CO2 over the central equatorial Pacific has remained constant or slightly increased, as ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) has risen at about the same rate as atmospheric pCO2. On the contrary, Earth System Models (ESMs) project robust decreases in the sea-air pCO2 difference (ΔpCO2) and associated outgassing throughout the 21st Century. We reconcile these conflictive ideas using an ensemble of 28 simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1). The large size of the ensemble allows us to explore the interaction of internal and forced changes in Pacific outgassing. The CESM1 ensemble shows that during the 1980-2014 period, internally driven and forced trends can have similar magnitudes, suggesting that they could have constructive or opposing effects, depending on the phase of internal variability. For instance, the changes in ΔpCO2 and outgassing are negligible when Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) is trending towards its negative phase, just as observed during 1980-2014. Translating this result to nature implies that equatorial outgassing could be already diminishing in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. This signal, however, has not emerged from the background of internal variability, particularly due to the ongoing multi-decadal trends in Pacific climate.",

Though studied with decades, the mechanism of deformation and southeastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau remain controversial. As the tectonic transitional zone between the uplifting Tibetan Plateau and the Yangtze block, the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is of particular interest. In past 10 years, several large scale dense seismic arrays were deployed in the eastern Tibetan Plateau with an average inter-station distance about 35km. We collected the seismic data of these densely deployed seismic arrays and the permanent seismic network in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and obtained more than 300,000 high quality teleseismic Ps receiver functions. We have obtained high-resolution topographies of the Moho and upper mantle discontinuities beneath the eastern Tibetan Plateau by using receiver function common conversion points stacking technique. The results show a strong lateral variation of the crustal thickness, the depths of 410km and 660km seismic velocity discontinuities, and the thickness of upper mantle transitional zone in this region. Although the depth of the upper mantle discontinuities beneath Sichuan basin is similar to that of the average earth model, the thickness of the upper mantle transitional zone in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is about 30km thicker. The lateral variation of the thickness of upper mantle transitional zone in the region may be related to the subduction process of the India plate. The spatial distribution of the velocity discontinuities has a good correlation with surface tectonic structure, indicating the upper mantle dynamic process has great inference on the crustal deformation and shortening in eastern margin of Tibetan Plateau.",

We applied the spectral-element method (e.g. Komatitsch and Tromp 1999) and adjoint method (Liu and Tromp 2006) to the broadband seismograms in order to infer the 3D model. We used the travel-time tomography result (Matsubara and Obara 2011) as an initial 3D model and used broadband waveforms recorded at the NIED F-net stations. We selected 147 earthquakes with magnitude of larger than 4.5 from the F-net earthquake catalog and used their bandpass filtered seismograms between 5 and 20 second with a high S/N ratio. The 3D model used for the forward and adjoint simulations is represented as a region of approximately 500 by 450 km in horizontal and 120 km in depth. Minimum period of theoretical waveforms was 4.35 second. For the adjoint inversion, we picked up the windows of the body waves from the observed and theoretical seismograms. We used SPECFEM3D_Cartesian code (e.g. Peter et al. 2011) for the forward and adjoint simulations, and their simulations were implemented by K-computer in RIKEN. Each iteration required about 0.1 million CPU hours at least. The model parameters of Vp and Vs were updated by using the steepest descent method. We obtained the fourth iterative model (M04), which reproduced observed waveforms better than the initial model. The shear wave-speed of M04 was significantly smaller than the initial model at any depth. The model of compressional wave-speed was not improved by inversion because of small alpha kernel values.

The EARS traverses two regions of crustal uplift, the Ethiopian and East African Domes, separated by the Turkana Depression. This wide region of subdued topography coincides with the NW-SE trend of the Jurassic-Paleogene Anza Rift. Opinions on the fundamental geodynamic driver for EARS rifting are divided, however, principally between models involving migrating plume(s) and a single elongated ‘superplume’. While competing models have similar topographic outcomes, they predict different morphotectonic evolutions for the Turkana Depression. Models inferring southward plume-migration imply that the plume must have passed below the Turkana Depression during the Paleogene, in order to have migrated to the East African Dome by the Miocene. The possible temporal denudational response to such plume activity is testable using low temperature thermochronology.\nWe present apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He (AHe), and zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) data from the Lapurr Range, an uplifted Precambrian basement block in northern Turkana. Low radiation damage ZHe results displaying an age range of ~70-210 Ma, and combined with stratigraphic evidence, suggest ~4-6 km of Jurassic-Early Cretaceous denudation, probably associated with early Anza Rift tectonism. AFT ages of ~9-15 Ma imply subsequent burial beneath no more than ~4 km of overburden, thus preserving the Jurassic-Cretaceous ZHe ages. Together with AFT results, AHe data (~3-19 Ma) support ~2-4 km of Miocene-Pliocene uplift of the Lapurr Range in the footwall of the E-dipping Lapurr normal fault. Miocene AFT and AHe ages are interpreted to reflect the initiation of the EARS in the Turkana Depression. If extension is associated with plume activity, then upwelling in the Turkana region is unlikely to have started prior to the Miocene, much later than the Paleogene age predicted by plume migration models.",

            "abstract": "Large–scale oceanic/continental subduction introduces a range of crustal materials into the Earth’s mantle. These subducted material will be gravitationally trapped in the deep mantle when they have been transported to a depth of greater than ~250–300 km (“depth of no return”). However, little is known about the fate of these trapped continental material. Here, we conduct experimental study on a natural continental rock which compositionally similar to the average upper continental crust (UCC) over a pressure and temperature range of 9–16 GPa and 1300–1800 oC to constraint the fate of these trapped continental materials. The experimental results demonstrate that subducted UCC produces ~20–30 wt% K–rich melt (>55 wt% SiO2) in the upper mantle (9–13 GPa). The melting residue is mainly composed of coesite/stishovite + clinopyroxene + kyanite. In contrast, partial melting of subducted UCC in the MTZ produces ~10 wt% K–rich melt (<50 wt% SiO2), together with stishovite, clinopyroxene, K–Hollandite, garnet and CAS–phase as the residue phases. The melting residue phases achieve densities greater than the surrounding mantle, which provides a driving force for descending across the 410 km seismic discontinuity into the MTZ. However, this density relationship is reversed at the base of MTZ, leaving the descended residues being accumulated above the 660 km seismic discontinuity and may contribute to the stagnated “second continent”. On the other hand, the melt is ~0.3–0.7 g/cm3 less dense than the surrounding mantle and provides a buoyancy force for the ascending of melt to shallow depth. The ascending melt preserves a significant portion of the bulk–rock REEs and LILEs. Thus, chemical reaction between the melt and the surrounding mantle would leads to a variably metasomatised mantle. Re-melting of the metasomatised mantle may contribute to the origin of the “enriched mantle sources” (EM–sources). Therefore, through subduction, stagnation, partial melting and melt segregation of continental crust may create EM–sources and“second continent” at shallow depth and the base of the MTZ respectively, which may contribute to the observed geochemical/geophysical heterogeneity in Earth’s interior.",

            "abstract": "Temperature and velocity conditions in the Greenland ice sheet interior, particularly at the bed, remain fairly uncertain, with the exception of sparse borehole measurements and radar inferences. As surface melt progresses inland, these basal conditions may play an important role in future ice sheet dynamics. Using a two-dimensional flow line thermo-mechanically coupled model, we generate steady state velocity and temperature fields for 75 flow lines in the Greenland ice sheet interior, whose accuracy is assessed using robust surface velocity field measurements at stations measured by the Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA) around the approximate 2,000 m elevation contour of the ice sheet. It is generally useful to perform forward modeling exercises and associated sensitivity analyses as a prelude to detailed inverse modeling, as a means to reveal relations between various uncertain parameters and the observations. We explore the influence of geothermal flux, enhancement factor for Wisconsin ice, and bed topography on temperature and velocity fields in the Greenland interior. A notable finding is a negative feedback between increasing geothermal flux and ice surface velocity in regions with temperate bed. We present simulated temperature and velocity profiles from the main divide to the PARCA stakes, as well as maps of inferred regions of temperate bed and temperate ice thickness. The suggested extent of temperate bed from our simulations is consistent with all available borehole and radar observations in the Greenland interior, and reproduces general features evident from other modeling studies. The velocity and temperature conditions produced in this work for widespread regions of the interior of the Greenland ice sheet may be used to inform and constrain models of future ice sheet response, particularly involving subglacial hydrology and basal refreezing in the interior.",

            "abstract": "The Australasian strewn field, a horizon of glassy clasts formed of molten ejecta from the impact of a bolide about 770,000 years ago, covers about a tenth of the Earth – from Indochina to Australia and from the Indian to western Pacific oceans. The distribution of chemical and physical characteristics of these tektites implies a very large impact somewhere in central Indochina. A half-century of unsuccessful searching for the impact crater implies obscuration by either erosion or burial.\nGeomorphological and stratigraphic evidence suggests that the crater lies buried beneath lavas and cinder cones of a 100-km wide volcanic shield centered atop the Bolaven Plateau of southern Laos. One critical test of this hypothesis, using precise 40Ar/39Ar dating, is now in progress – are these highly weathered basalts younger than the tektites? Although volcanic rocks cover most of the area proximal to our purported impact site, a thick, crudely bedded, bouldery to pebbly breccia that crops out southeast of the obscured crater rim appears to be part of an ejecta blanket. The basal unit of this fining-upward sequence comprises large boulders of late-Mesozoic sandstone bedrock that display in situ shattering. This implies emplacement ballistically rather than by debris-flow.\nOld surfaces in the surrounding region (as others have noted) and on the Plateau have a mantle of pebbly, detrital lateritic debris that in its upper 15 cm contains angular tektite fragments. We hypothesize that this debris is a proximal fall bed produced by shock-induced comminution and ejection of a lateritic soil that covered the Plateau bedrock. Deposition was nearly complete when sparse tektite fragments ejected from nearer the center of the impact began to land. At many sites this pebbly, lateritic bed is overlain by a thick silty bed that others have associated with aeolian erosion of a barren, incinerated tropical landscape.

            "abstract": "Exhumed shear zones often contain folded and/or dynamically recrystallized structures such as veins and pseudotachylytes that record contemporaneous brittle and ductile deformation representing mixed bulk rheology. Here, we constrain the conditions that promote the transitions between ductile and brittle deformation by investigating quartz veins with shear offsets in the Saddlebag Lake shear zone in the central Sierra Nevada, California. Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks within the shear zone contain transposed bedding, strong cleavage, dextrally rotated porphyroclasts, and a steep mineral lineation, which together suggest an overall transpressive kinematic regime for the ductile deformation. Foliation sub-parallel veins are one subset of the veins in the shear zone. They have observed horizontal trace lengths of up to around 5 meters, though most are obscured by limited exposure, and displacements range from ~3-30 mm, with 1-5 mm of opening. Foliation sub-parallel veins are folded with the foliation and quartz microstructures and fluid inclusion thermobarometry measurements from vein samples indicate temperatures during vein formation by fracture were between 300-680°C. Quartz δ18O values (+5.9 to +16.5) suggest extended fluid-rock interaction that involved magmatic (δ18O ~ +8 to +10) and meteoric (δ18O down to –1) fluids. Foliation sub-parallel veins are most abundant in relatively massive, quartz-rich rocks where they are boudinaged, indicating they were rigid inclusions after formation. Based on the orientation and spatial distribution of the veins, we infer that they formed under high differential stress with pore pressures sufficiently high for the rocks to be critically stressed for shear failure along mechanically weak foliation planes. These observations suggest high pore pressures and mechanical heterogeneity at a variety of scales are necessary conditions for nucleation of shear fractures within ductile shear zones.",

            "abstract": "Most of observational studies on the Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance focus on detecting linear trends of mass loss at multi-decadal or longer periods. Yet short-term, non-secular mass variations are poorly observed, especially at individual outlet glaciers that are largely responsible for recent dramatic changes happening on Greenland. In this study we examined the annual variations in the crustal uplift measured at two continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations near Upernavik Isstrøms in western Greenland. Both GPS time series show pronounced annual cycles, resulted from strong annual changes in all surface mass combined. To detect and interpret glaciological signature in the GPS uplift measurements, we modeled and removed surface mass loading from non-ice sources, including atmospheric, ocean, and continental water mass changes. Of these components, the atmospheric mass loading is the largest contributor, accounting for about 47–70% of the annual variability. We also compared the residual GPS uplift with the modeled surface mass balance (SMB) loading based on a climate simulation model RACMO2/GR and found that the latter overestimates the annual variability. This discrepancy makes it difficult to assess contributions from glacial dynamics to the glacial mass balance at annual periods and requires an improved modeling effort. Our study underlines the importance of quantifying loading from various sources and their uncertainties for better understanding short-term glacial variability from GPS measurements.",

We impose horizontal shortening in the model and observe that a tapered wedge develops. Inside the accretionary wedge, the horizontal effective stress increases to about 2.3 times the vertical effective stress. The maximum principle stress direction rotates gradually from the initial vertical direction to the horizontal direction as the sediment gets closer to the backstop. We use stress paths to illustrate how the stresses evolve during the thrust loading. We find the sediment stress path starts from uniaxial condition and moves towards critical state condition. We categorize the thrust belt into 3 zones according to their stress conditions from the backstop to the farfield: critical state region, transition region, and uniaxial region. We show that the sediments within the accretionary wedge are at critical state, which indicate they lost their strength to resist deformation. The sediment porosity decreases dramatically within the wedge due to high mean effective and differential stress. We built the model in finite element program Elfen. The sediments are modeled as poro-elastoplastic materials with a critical state soil model. Overall, our results provide insights of stress and porosity evolution in compressional regimes and can assist field stress and pressure predictions.",

Deep-sea sediment cores of the Bengal Fan fluctuate between sand, hemipelagic and terrestrial sediment layers. All but one of the sites (U1454) contain a layer of calcareous clay in the uppermost part of the core that is late Pleistocene in age. During Expedition 354 site U1452C was sampled at high resolution (every 2cm) by a broad group of collaborators with the goal of reconstructing monsoon strength and oceanographic conditions using a variety of proxies. The top 480 cm of site U1452C (8ºN, 87ºE, 3671m water depth) contains primarily nannofossil rich calcareous clay. The relatively high abundance of foraminifera will allow us to generate a high resolution record of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) using standard foraminifera proxies. We will present oxygen isotopes (δ18O) and Mg/Ca data of mixed layer planktonic foraminifera from the top 70cm of the core, representing the Holocene to the last glacial maximum. δ18O of planktonic foraminifera records global ice volume and local SST and SSS, while Mg/Ca of foraminifera is a proxy for SST. The paired Mg/Ca and δ18O measurements on the same samples of foraminifera, together with published estimates with global ocean δ18O, can be used to reconstruct both SST and local δ18O of seawater, which is a function of the evaporation/precipitation balance. In future work, the local SSS and SST during the LGM will be paired with terrestrial and other oceanic proxies to increase our understanding of how global climate is connected to monsoon strength.",

The GCMs with a natural vegetation map and a land degradation map were used to assess the possible impact of land cover change on the summer circulation over the East Asia. In the IM land degradation study, it shows the land degradation caused dry conditions in North China and wet conditions in southern China. Because in the desertification area the reduction in evaporation dominants the changes in the local surface energy budget, and the reduction in convective latent heating above the surface layer enhanced sinking motion. In the TP and NWC study, it shows that land cover change from vegetated land to bare ground over TP and NWC decreased radiation absorbed by the surface and leads to weaker surface thermal effects, which lead to lower atmospheric temperature over, as well as weaker vertical ascending motion, low-layer cyclonic, upper level anticyclonic over TP. These changes in circulation cause a decrease in the precipitation in the southeastern TP. In NWC, especially in northern Xinjiang and surrounding areas, less latent heating causes stronger anomalous lower-level anticyclonic circulation and upper-level cyclonic circulation, leading to less summer precipitation and higher surface temperature. Coincidentally, the East Asia summer monsoon circulation was weakened and the precipitation is reduced due to the land degradation over three areas.",

We use a combination of satellite data and previously-collected field measurements to study this question. We compare same-day and same-pixel NASA MODIS satellite data to in situ observations of sediment and nutrient concentrations over 20 years, and found that for at least 6 tributaries, the r2 value for a linear regression between the satellite reflectance and fieldwork measures of nitrogen, phosphorus, or suspended sediment concentrations exceeded 0.7, while for at least 12 tributaries, the r2 value exceeded 0.5. We took advantage of this relationship to estimate sediment and nutrient concentrations in the Chesapeake following major storm events, even in the absence of continuous in situ data. We studied sediment/nutrient levels daily following the storm, for every date on which a cloud-free MODIS image was available, for a month. The storms included 2003’s Hurricane Isabel, 2011’s Hurricane Irene, and 2012’s Superstorm Sandy. The tributaries we focused on were the York and Piankatank Rivers of southern Virginia (heavily forested), the Potomac River (heavily urban), and the Nanticoke River of the Eastern Shore (heavily farmed). Results show that in the Potomac River, which over the last 15 years has experience a signifiant increase in urbanization, sediments and nutrients persist for longer periods and at higher levels compared to less urbanized rivers.",

Our results show (1) initial shear stress drop was related to the generation of low viscosity melt patches, (2) the evolution of shear stress in the postmelting regime was congruent with frictional melt rheology, and (3) the slip strengthening was presumably resulted from dehydration of the frictional melt. In particular, the state-of-art of in situ synchrotron analyses (X-ray diffraction and Transmission X-ray Microscope) determine the presence of ultrafine spherical quartz (USQ) (~10 nm to 50 nm) in the glassy matrices presumably produced at high temperature. Our observations confirm that the USQ formed in rock friction experiments do occur in natural faults. We surmise the USQ is the result of frictional melting on siltstone and represents the latest slip zones of the Chelungpu fault, and further infer that the viscous melts may terminate seismic slips at shallow crustal conditions.",

            "abstract": "Fault Zone Guided Waves (FZGWs) are seismic coda that are trapped by the low velocity damage zone of faults. Inversions of these phases can be carried out using their measured dispersion and a Bayesian probability approach. This method utilises a Markov chain Monte Carlo which allows uncertainties and trade-offs to be quantified. Accordingly we have developed a scheme that estimates the dispersion curve and amplitude response variability from a FZGW record. This method allows the computation of both the point estimates and the covariance of the dispersion curve. The subsequent estimation of fault zone parameters is then based on a Gaussian model for the dispersion curve. We then show that inversions using FZGW dispersion data can only resolve fault zone velocity contrast and fault zone width - it leaves densities, absolute country rock velocities and the earthquake location unresolved. We show that they do however significantly affect the estimated fault zone velocities and widths. As these parameters cannot be resolved, we allow for their effects on the estimates of fault zone width and velocity contrast by using the Bayesian approximation error method. We show that using this method reduces computational time from days to minutes and the associated loss of accuracy is insignificant compared to carrying out the inversion on all parameters. We have extended our scheme to 2-D using 1-D slices. The Bayesian approximation error methodology is further employed to provide a ‘correction term’ with uncertainty for the 1-D slice approximation. We investigate these features with both synthetic data and FZGW data from the Alpine Fault of New Zealand.",

In total, 5878 plasmapause crossing events are identified, sufficiently covering all 24 Magnetic Local Time (MLT) sectors. Based on this plasmapause crossing database, we investigate the correlations between plasmapause locations with solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices. Input parameters for the best fits are obtained for different MLT sectors and finally we choose five input parameters to build a plasmapause location model, including five-minute-averaged SYM-H, AL and AU indices as well as hourly-averaged AE and Kp indices. An out-of-sample comparison on the evolution of the plasmapause is shown during April 2001 magnetic storm, demonstrating good agreement between model results and observations. Two major advantages are achieved by this model. First, this model provides plasmapause locations at 24 MLT sectors, still providing good consistency with observations. Second, this model is able to reproduce dynamic variations of plasmapause in the time scale as short as five minutes.",

            "abstract": "Gas movement within the earth’s subsurface and its exchange with the atmosphere is one of the principal elements contributing to soil and atmospheric function. As the soil permeability increases, gas circulation by convective mechanisms becomes significantly greater than the diffusion. Two of the convective mechanisms, which can be of great importance, are being explored in this research. The first one is thermal convection venting (TCV), which develops when there are unstable density gradients. The second mechanism is wind induced convection (WIC), which develops due to surface winds that drive air movement. Here, we report the results of a study on the relationships between the porous media permeability and particle size, and the development and magnitude of TCV and WIC with the development of thermal differences and surface winds. The research included large high-permeability column experiments carried out under highly controlled laboratory conditions, using well-defined single-sized spherical particles while surface winds and thermal differences were forced and monitored. CO2 enriched air, functioned as a tracer, was used to quantify the impact of TCV and WIC on gas migration in the porous media.\nResults show that in homogenous porous media a permeability range of 10-7 to 10-6 m2 is the threshold value for TCV onset under standard atmospheric conditions. Adding surface wind with an average velocity of 1.5 m s-1 resulted in WIC effect to a depth of -0.3 m in most experimental settings; however, it did not caused additional air circulation at the reference depth of -0.9 m. Furthermore, given the appropriate conditions, a combined effect of TCV and WIC did significantly increase the overall media ventilation. Simulations of temperature profiles in soil under that permeability, showed that as the thermal gradient changes with depth and is a continuous function, TCV cells can be developed in local sections of the profile, not necessarily reaching the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Lake levels in the Tibet and Qinghai Plateaus provide valuable records for climate change studies. Most lakes here are hard to access, having only few lake level gauges that give in situ measurements of changes in lake level and area. Remote sensing sensors, such as satellite imagery and satellite altimetry, are able to measure lake level variations with a dense spatial coverage and with a high temporal resolution. In this study, we use the TOPEX/Poseidon series of satellite altimeters (TP, Jason-1 and -2, 1992-2014) to observe lake level variations at 23 lakes along their repeat ground tracks every 10 days. We also use the Envisat altimeter (2002-2008) to observe lake levels in three lakes of Qinghai at an interval of 35 days. We use subwaveform retracking to improve the ranging precisions of satellite altimeters. We employ an optimal processing technique to obtain quality measurements, including outlier detection, space-time reduction of measurements to a common reference point, and optimal filtering. Jason-1 fails to deliver height measurements over most of the lakes. The waveforms are classified to ensure observations with a sufficiently good quality. Over 1992-2014, the lake levels of most lakes in eastern Tibet rose, while the lake levels in western Tibet dropped. In Qinghai, the lake levels dropped before 2005 and then rose afterwards, suggesting a sharp climate change in 2005, or that the measure to protect the Qinghai ecosystem (e.g., reducing livestocks) started to take effect in 2005. In general, the overall pattern of lake change in Tibet and Qinghai is related to the variation of the Indian monsoons and locations of lakes. Most lake levels show clear annual and inter-annual oscillations. In some lakes, the amplitudes of annual variation in the TP era (1992-2002) were large and then turned smaller in the Jason-2 era (2008-2014). In some lakes, the annual amplitudes were reversed between the TP and Jason-2 eras. Also, some lakes show phase shifts in the lake level highs. The lake level trends from 1992 to 2014 can be classified into three categories: (1) lakes with continuous dropping levels, (2) lakes with continuous rising levels, (3) lakes with rising or dropping levels before a major ENSO event and then with reversed trends afterwards.",

However, due to the binary data format (NetCDF, HDF) with high spatial and temporal dimensions, the computing frameworks in Apache Hadoop ecosystem are not originally suited for big climate data. In order to make the computing frameworks in Hadoop ecosystem directly support big climate data, we propose a columnar storage format with spatiotemporal index to store climate data, which will support any project in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem (e.g. MapReduce, Spark, Hive, Impala). With this approach, the climate data will be transferred into binary Parquet data format, a columnar storage format, and spatial and temporal index will be built and attached into the end of Parquet files to enable real-time data query. Then such climate data in Parquet data format could be available to any computing frameworks in Hadoop ecosystem. The proposed approach is evaluated using the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) climate reanalysis dataset. Experimental results show that this approach could efficiently overcome the gap between the big climate data and the distributed computing frameworks, and the spatiotemporal index could significantly accelerate data querying and processing.",

            "abstract": "The Nankai Trough off southwest Japan is one of the best subduction-zone to study megathrust earthquake fault. Historic, great megathrust earthquakes with a recurrence interval of 100-200 yr have generated strong motion and large tsunamis along the Nankai Trough subduction zone. At the Nankai Trough margin, the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate to the northwest at a convergence rate ~4 cm/yr. The Shikoku Basin, the northern part of the PSP, is estimated to have opened between 25 and 15 Ma by backarc spreading of the Izu-Bonin arc. The >100-km-wide Nankai accretionary wedge, which has developed landward of the trench since the Miocene, mainly consists of offscraped and underplated materials from the trough-fill turbidites and the Shikoku Basin hemipelagic sediments. Particularly, physical properties of the incoming hemipelagic sediments may be critical for seismogenic behavior of the megathrust fault.\n We have carried out core-log-seismic integration (CLSI) to estimate 3D acoustic impedance and porosity for the incoming sediments in the Nankai Trough. For the CLSI, we used 3D seismic reflection data, P-wave velocity and density data obtained during IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program) Expeditions 322 and 333. We computed acoustic impedance depth profiles for the IODP drilling sites from P-wave velocity and density data. We constructed seismic convolution models with the acoustic impedance profiles and a source wavelet which is extracted from the seismic data, adjusting the seismic models to observed seismic traces with inversion method. As a result, we obtained 3D acoustic impedance volume and then converted it to 3D porosity volume. In general, the 3D porosities show decrease with depth. We found a porosity anomaly zone with alteration of high and low porosities seaward of the trough axis. In this talk, we will show detailed 3D porosity of the incoming sediments, and present implications of the porosity anomaly zone for the megathrust fault behavior.",

            "abstract": "Light absorption properties of water soluble organic aerosol were investigated at Fresno, CA from 13 January to 11 February, 2013 as part of the NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign. The light absorption spectra of water soluble organic aerosol in PM2.5 was measured using a UV/vis diode array detector (DAD) coupled with a particle into liquid sampler (PILS) that sampled downstream of a PM2.5 cyclone (URG). The PILS was also coupled with two ion chromatographs (IC) to measure inorganic and organic ionic species in PM2.5. In addition, an Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was deployed at the same site to measure size-resolved chemical composition of submicrometer aerosol (PM1) in real time during this study.\nLight absorption at 365 nm (Abs365), which is typically used as a proxy of water-soluble brown carbon (BrC), showed strong enhancement during night time and appeared to correlate well (r = 0.71) with biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) from residential wood burning for heating in the Fresno area. The tight correlations between Abs365 and biomass burning relevant tracers such as acetonitrile (r = 0.69), AMS-signature ions for phenolic compounds (r = 0.52-0.71), PAH (r = 0.74), and potassium (r = 0.67) further confirm that biomass burning contributed significantly to water soluble brown carbon during this study. The absorption angstrom exponent (Åa) values fitted between 300 and 700 nm wavelength were 3.3 ± 1.1, 2.0 ± 0.9 and 4.0 ± 0.8, respectively, in the morning, afternoon and nighttime, indicating that BrC is prevalent at night in Fresno during wintertime. However, there are also indications that small amount of BrC existed during the daytime as well, likely due to daytime wood burning and other sources such as the formation of light-absorbing secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Finally, light absorption at 300 nm, 330 nm, and 390 nm were found to correlate tightly with BBOA, which indicate that biomass burning also emits chromophores that are absorbing at these wavelengths. Literature reviews and analysis of the HR-ToF-AMS organic aerosol spectra suggest that nitrogen-containing organic compounds from biomass burning emissions seem to contribute to aerosol absorption at these wavelengths. However, the properties and potential impacts of these compounds remain unknown.",

            "abstract": "We deployed a network targeting acoustic emissions (AEs) down to Mw~ –5 at 1-km depth in the Cooke 4 mine in South Africa as a part of a 5-year project called \"Observational Studies in South African Mines to Mitigate Seismic Risks.\" This network of 30 sensors spans ~100 m, and collected waveform data for more than 4.5-million triggers in 5 years. We provide an overview of the main findings. 1) Naoi et al. (2015; Pageoph) reported that 90% of observed AEs aggregated along the advancing mining front. Their size distribution obeyed the Gutenberg-Richter law down to Mw –4, and their b-values were invariant with time from blasting, contradicting a previous study. 2) Moriya et al. (under review) showed that this AE aggregation consists of several tabular clusters, which were formed regularly as the mining front advanced. Although large earthquakes (Mw > 1) were not found, the clusters likely represent the preparation process of large shear fracture events because their geometry resembles large shear fractures, known by in-situ wall-rock observation, which formed concurrently with large seismic events. 3) Naoi et al. (2015; Tectonophysics) reported that the remaining 10% of AEs exhibit very sharp, planar distributions, with high b-values. They are likely events located on pre-existing geological faults loaded by mining-induced stresses. Such on-fault events are rare for intraplate faults, where microseismic events generally occur in the surrounding region. 4) Naoi et al. (2015; JGR) found planar clusters that newly emerged ahead of a mining front and gradually expanded to 20 m. They likely represent the evolution of a slow-slip patch on a pre-existing fault. The b-value of those AEs decreased drastically from 2.5 to 1.5, consistent with stress buildup by the approaching mining front.

Beamforming in Antarctica, however, is not straightforward due to the effects of array deformation and atmospheric neutral wave-ionospheric plasma coupling. We take these effects into account and present a method to invert for the seismically generated acoustic wave using TEC observations. The back azimuths, speeds and waveforms obtained by the beamform are in excellent agreement with the hypothesis that the TEC signals are generated by the passage of Rayleigh waves from the Maule and Tohoku-Oki earthquakes. The Tohoku-Oki earthquake is ~12,500 km from Antarctica, making this the farthest observation of CIDs to date using GPS.",

It induces degradation of external components and propagates inside providing damage to internal environment. Space radiation particles and induced secondary particle showers can lead to variety of damage to astronauts in short- and long- term perspective. Contribution of two main sources of space radiation- Sun and out-of-heliosphere space varies in time in opposite phase due to the solar activity state.\nCurrently the only habituated mission is the international interplanetary station that flights on the low Earth orbit. Besides station shell astronauts are protected with the Earth magnetosphere- a natural shield that prevents significant damage for all humanity. Current progress in space exploration tends to lead humanity out of magnetosphere bounds. With the current study we make estimations of spacecraft parameters and astronauts damage for long-term interplanetary flights.\nApplying time dependent model of GCR spectra and data on SEP spectra we show the time dependence of the radiation in a human phantom inside the shielding capsule. We pay attention to the shielding capsule design, looking for an optimal geometry parameters and materials. Different types of particles affect differently on the human providing more or less harm to the tissues. Incident particles provide a large amount of secondary particles while propagating through the shielding capsule. We make an attempt to find an optimal combination of shielding capsule parameters, namely material and thickness, that will effectively decrease the incident particle energy, at the same time minimizing flow of secondary induced particles and minimizing most harmful particle types flows.",

            "abstract": "Sediment cores were sampled in the estuary of the Nelson and Churchill Rivers in western Hudson Bay, as well as in the estuary of the Moisie and Sainte-Marguerite Rivers in Gulf of St. Lawrence in order to evaluate the impact of hydroelectric dams on the sedimentary regime of these estuaries. The gravity cores at the mouth of the Nelson River recorded several cm-thick rapidly deposited layers with a reverse to normal grading sequence, indicating the occurrence of hyperpycnal flows generated by major floods during the last few centuries. These hyperpycnal flows were probably caused by ice-jam formation, which can increase both the flow and the sediment concentration following the breaching of such natural dams. Following the construction of hydroelectric dams since the 1960s, the regulation of river discharge prevented the formation of hyperpycnal flows, and hence the deposition of hyperpycnites in the upper part of the cores. In the core sampled in the estuary of the Churchill River, only one hyperpycnite was recorded. This lower frequency may be due to the enclosed estuary of the Churchill River, its weaker discharge and the more distal location of the coring site.\nIn the Gulf of St. Lawrence, grain size measurements allowed the identification of a major flood around AD 1844±4 years in box cores from both the Sainte-Marguerite and Moisie Rivers, whereas a drastic decrease in variations in the median grain size occurred around AD ~1900 in the estuary of the Sainte-Marguerite River, highlighting the offshore impact of the SM1 dam construction in the early 1900s. Furthermore, sedimentological variations in the box cores from both estuaries have been investigated by wavelet analysis and the sharp disappearance of high frequencies around AD 1900 in the estuary of the dammed river (Sainte-Marguerite River), but not in the estuary of the natural river (Moisie River), also provides evidence of the influence of dams on the sedimentary regime of estuaries.",

A temporary broadband seismograph array we deployed near the China-Nepal border recorded the Gorkha earthquake and its aftershocks. Using teleseimic P waveform modeling and multi-scale double-difference earthquake relocation methods for the locally, regionally and teleseismically recorded events, we relocated 153 Gorkha earthquakes with MW>3.5. In addition, 43 earthquakes with MW>3.0 that occurred in the source region during three decades prior to the Ghorka earthquake were also relocated. The results of the study provide refined hypocenters with good depth constraints. From the aftershock data, we can see the shallowly dipping fault structure for the MHT, as well as other structures in the hanging wall of the fault zone.\nThis is the first well-recorded earthquake sequence that has occurred on the shallowest portion of the MHT, providing new constraints on the structure of the MHT and its earthquake potential along the Himalaya orogen.",

            "abstract": "The amount of GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in Tropical Asia regions became enormous. Thailand has the history that logged from natural forest and shifted to plantation such as rubber or teak. This tendency might also continue because of the presence of the neighboring country, which imports enormous timbers each year. And seasonal variation of rainfall amount in Thailand is very large as an effect of monsoon climate and Phenology changes clearly in deciduous forest. Thus, seasonal variation of CO₂ emissions from Teak plantation in Thailand might be larger compare to other tropical regions, but not enough researched. From the facts above mentioned, this study pursues to reveal the carbon flow in rainy and dry season in Teak plantation in Thailand and finally to reveal that which environmental factor controls soil respiration variation. The experiments were carried out in an even-aged teak (Tectona grandis) plantation located in Lampang Province, northern Thailand. The teak plantation was established in 1968. The amount of Carbon flow flux in rainy season and dry season were calculated using the data of soil respiration in 2007-2013, carbon flux above the canopy in 2006, litter fall amount in 2009, and above ground plant growth in 2006-2012. In rainy season (from June to September), GPP, above ground plant growth, litter fall, and soil respiration are 10700kgC/ha, 5046±1021kgC/ha, 835kgC/ha, and 6304±1664kgC/ha, respectively. TBCF was calculated by GPP and above ground plant growth as 5654kgC/ha. In dry season (from December to March), 2691kgC/ha, -806±373kgC/ha, and 2230kgC/ha, respectively. TBCF is 3497kgC/ha. Now, experiment of measuring root growth and withering is conducted. Soil respiration in rainy season is three times as large as that in dry season. And in dry season, the ratio of TBCF to GPP is much higher than that in rainy season.",

            "abstract": "Fluid seepage of reduced organic compounds such as methane impacts the geology and biology of the seabed by inducing complex, microbially mediated biogeochemical processes. Authigenic carbonates serve as one of the few permanent records of these of dynamic biogeochemical interactions that involve methanogenesis, methanotrophy, sulfate reduction and carbonate precipitation. Meister et al. (2007) investigated deep-sea dolomite formation at Sites 1227–1229 on the Peru margin, where dolomite precipitation occurs in association with organic carbon-rich continental margin sediments. Geochemical and petrographic studies indicated episodic dolomite precipitation at a dynamic sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). Variations in δ13C values of these dolomites between +15‰ and −15‰ were attributed to non-steady state conditions as a result of the upward and downward migration of the SMTZ.\nOur study aims to better understand the biogeochemical processes associated with authigenic carbonate precipitation in this dynamic deep-sea setting. We focused our efforts on IODP Site 1230, which is a gas-hydrate-bearing site that shows sulphate consumption within the uppermost 10 m below the seafloor as well as high methane production. Using a multi proxy approach, we combined X-ray diffraction, stable isotope geochemistry, and trace metal analysis of authigenic carbonates to elucidate conditions for authigenic carbonate formation. Results from Site 1230 are compared to Sites 1227 and 1229, which lacks gas hydrates and is characterized by high pore water sulfate and low methane concentrations. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of authigenic carbonate formation and associated biogeochemical processes in continental margin sediments.\nMeister, P., Mckenzie, J.

            "abstract": "Some reanalyses and global climate models have a difficult time capturing the change in cloud fraction across stratocumulus to cumulus transitions; however, this has not yet been assessed for NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). Here, the vertical profile of cloud fraction from MERRA is compared with ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and CloudSat/CALIPSO observations across the stratocumulus transition region in the southeast Pacific. A recent study indicates that cloud fraction transitions along the climatological wind trajectory are a good representation of stratocumulus transitions along individual Langrangian trajectories. MERRA, ERA-Interim, and CloudSat/CALIPSO cloud fractions are extracted along the climatological wind trajectory in the southeast Pacific for 2007-2010 and the climatological and seasonal transitions are analyzed. Preliminary results indicate that MERRA underestimates cloud fraction in this region, similar to previous studies comparing reanalysis and observations in the northeast Pacific transition. Environmental variables such as temperature, specific humidity, vertical pressure velocity, lower tropospheric stability, and planetary boundary layer height from the reanalyses are also compared to in situ observations to understand potential causes for the lack of clouds. MERRA produces lower temperatures throughout the atmosphere, a shallower boundary layer, and a weaker inversion compared to observations. MERRA also shows weaker subsidence compared to ERA-Interim. This study shows that more work is needed to improve the representation of the stratocumulus transitions in reanalyses.",

This fault system has been allocated at least four big earthquakes in the last 230 years. In this work we describe the macroseismic intensities of these earthquakes not only to its epicentral zone but also in others places as Bogotá metropolitan area far from AFS more of 200 km. The AFS is shaped by three thrust faults. From north to south these are Guayuriba Fault with with 160 km of lengh, the Algeciras Fault with 149 km of lengh, and the Garzon - Pitalito Fault with 128 km of lengh.\nThe big earthquakes, whose macroseismic data are analyzed here, its that of the 1785 (M=6.8) event, for which the Guayuriba Fault was related; it caused heavy damage in Bogotá and Neiva. This fault also produced the 1917 (6.9Ms) earthquake which significantly affected to Bogotá and Villavicencio. The 1967 earthquake (7.2Mw) is related to the Algeciras Fault; this event was very destructive in rural villages of Huila Department and caused significant damage in Bogotá and Neiva. With the latter earthquake high vulnerability was evident in the Bogota metropolitan area front to a large event ocurred by this fault system. The 16 November 1827 (M=7.3) earthquake ocurred on the Garzon - Pitalito Fault and was felt throughout the whole Andean region of Colombia. This event produced high intensities both in Bogota like in Popayan, Neiva, Pasto and where today are located the cities of Armenia, Manizales and Pereira toward west of Colombia. These lattest cities were founded in the second half of nineteen century after happened this earthquake.\nFrom historical seismicity review, we can determine the scope of seismic hazard for this fault system which not only affects its area of influence but also the center and west of the country, a región inhabited by more than 65% of the population of Colombia.",

            "abstract": "Large numbers of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle, and the river systems they occur in serve as important water resources for more than a billion people, but systematic observations of the lake water balance is scarce on the TP. Stable isotopes of water (δ18O and δD) can be used to understand the lake water cycle and its impact on water resources. Here we present a detailed study on the water cycle of Cona Lake, at the headwater of Nujiang-Salween River, based on three years of observations of δ18O and δD, including samples from precipitation, upper lake water (<1 m), outlet surface water, and atmospheric water vapor. Theδ18O-δD relationship in lake water (δD = 6.67δ18O – 20.37) differed from that of precipitation (δD = 8.29δ18O + 12.50). The deuterium excess (d-excess = δD - 8δ18O) was lower in the Cona Lake water (-7.5‰) than in local precipitation (10.7‰), indicating evaporation of lake water. The ratio of evaporation to inflow (E/I) of the lake water was estimated using the Craig-Gordon model. The E/I ratios of Cona lake ranged from 0.24 to 0.27 in the three years, indicating that 73-76% of lake water flowed downstream. Compared to the Craig-Gordon model, the Rayleigh distillation model had limited success in estimating lake evaporation, especially when lake water experienced intensive evaporation. In-situ observation of atmospheric water vapor isotope improved the estimate of E/I by 0.04 for δ18O and 0.08 for δD on average compared to water vapor isotope derived from the precipitation-vapor equilibrium method. Continuous sampling of lake water was necessary to estimate the E/I ratio accurately for lakes impacted by seasonal precipitation or meltwater, with sampling in the late summer or fall recommended for regional surveys. The results from this work imply the feasibility of d-excess in the study of lake water cycle for other lakes on the TP. The result is also helpful for the catchment-scale hydrological simulation work, as usually the role of lakes in the water cycle might be ignored in hydrological model as in this basin.",

Zones of fractures, areas of subsurface alteration and pre-eruption hydrologic changes at Old Faithful Geyser and surrounding hydrothermal mounds were observed. Despite being viewed directly by about 3,000,000 people a year, shallow subsurface geologic and hydrologic conditions on and near Old Faithful Geyser are poorly characterized. GPR transects of 5754 ft (1754m) show strong horizontal to sub-horizontal reflections, which are interpreted as 2.5 to 4.5 meters of sinter. Some discontinuities in reflections are interpreted as fractures in the sinter, some of which line up with known hydrothermal features and some of which have little to no surface expression. Zones with moderate and weak amplitude reflections are interpreted as sinter that has been hydrothermally altered. Temporal changes from stronger to weaker reflections are correlated with the eruption cycle of Old Faithful Geyser, and are interpreted as post-eruption draining of shallow fractures, followed by pre-eruption fracture filling with liquid or vapor thermal fluids.",

            "abstract": "Ultralow frequency (ULF) electromagnetic oscillations in the magnetosphere can accelerate electrons via a process called drift resonance. In the conventional drift-resonance theory [Southwood & Kivelson, 1981], a default assumption is that the wave growth rate is time-independent, positive, and extremely small. However, this may not be always the case in the magnetosphere. The ULF waves should have experienced a growth stage when their energy was taken from external and/or internal sources, and as time progresses the waves have to be damped with a negative growth rate. Therefore, a more generalized theory on particle behavior during different stages of ULF waves is required. In this paper, we introduce a time-dependent imaginary wave frequency to accommodate the growth and damping of the waves in the conventional drift-resonance theory, to study the particle interactions with the waves during the entire wave lifespan. We then predict from the generalized theory the particle signatures for different stages of the waves, which agree very well with Van Allen Probe observations. The more generalized theory, therefore, provides a new understanding of wave-particle interactions and ULF wave evolution in the magnetosphere. ",

However, it is not clear if this increase is only due to the increased ice-free area, and what ecological consequences it is having on the net community production (NCP). The timing of the spring or summer phytoplankton bloom is becoming earlier in certain areas of the Arctic Ocean and the fall bloom has appeared in other areas. Satellite-based measurements of ocean color have provided most of the evidence for large-scale changes in the ocean but are limited by cloud cover, solar zenith angle and proximity to ice. We evaluate the evidence for various trends in the magnitude and annual cycles of NPP and NCP in Arctic Ocean and the effects that missing data and algorithm uncertainties can have on the apparent trends.",

            "abstract": "The Millennium Drought was the worst drought on record for southeast Australia. Several previous studies have revealed that the ecosystem greenness during the major growing season was not strongly influenced by the water deficit in this multi-year drought. In this study, we explore the possible mechanisms of this ecosystem resilience to the severe drought by integrating optical satellite-observed leaf area index (LAI) data, microwave satellite-observed vegetation optical depth (VOD) data, and the process-based ecohydrological model (Ecohydro-SiB: e.g., Sawada et al. [2014]). During the beginning of the 21st century, the microwave VOD, which can penetrate the canopy to some extent, significantly decreases in southeast Australia while the LAI observation shows no such response, which implies that vegetation lost a lot of water stored in the tissue of whole aboveground biomass while they did not greatly lose the photosynthetically active part of biomass. This observation suggests that the carbon allocation fraction for leaf biomass greatly increases under the severe droughts to maintain the LAI although the total amount of aboveground vegetation water content (and aboveground biomass) is decreased. We demonstrate that this hypothesis is consistent to the result of our ecohydrological model applications. Although our modeled LAI significantly decreases in the Millennium Drought when we use the default model parameter that is widely used by the dynamic vegetation modeling communities, the model can reproduce the observed resilience when we chose the model parameter which makes the carbon allocation more sensitive to the light and water availability. In addition, we found that a CO2 fertilization effect, which induces the increase of water use efficiency, cannot fully explain the satellite-observed ecosystem resilience according to our model sensitivity study. The effect of this ecosystem resilience on our available water resources is also discussed by analyzing our simulated runoff.",

The UTWVC variations with sea surface temperature (SST) are important components for climate feedbacks. In particular, the iris effect hypothesized by Lindzen et al. (2001) highlights that the radiative role of UTWVC is effective in relieving global warming. The iris effect and its implication for climate sensitivity and hydrological change (Mauritsen and Stevens 2015) center on the sign and magnitude of UTWVC with SST. We assess the UTWVC variations with SST using satellite observations and model simulations. The nearly 30-year observations of high cloud from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the over 10-year observations of UT water vapor, cloud and radiative fluxes from NASA’s A-Train satellites are examined, in comparison with the counterparts in 14 CMIP5 models. We find that models underestimate the increase of outgoing longwave radiation with increasing SST compared to the observations, and this behavior is linked to the modeled UTWVC variations with SST. Across the 14 models, the ones with weaker iris effect tend to have higher equilibrium climate sensitivity.",

In total, more than 19 km of wireline logging data including 4.8 km of borehole televiewer imagery were acquired during the three-month drilling operation, which reached a maximum depth of 893 m (817 m true vertical depth). In conjunction with manual and automatic measurements of hydraulic parameters, on-site analysis of rock cuttings and fluid geochemistry, and post-drilling temperature measurements, the wireline data permit detailed analysis of bulk rock properties, fracturing, and fault zone structure. We focus in particular on understanding how the hydraulic conductivity of individual fractures relates to the high bulk conductivity of the hanging-wall, and thus to the transport of fluids and heat through the shallow crust.",

            "abstract": "Recently, forest management practices, such as thinning and pruning, were infrequently conducted in coniferous plantations of Japan. Some researchers in Japan have speculated that unthinned plantations could consume more water via evapotranspiration from the dense canopies and cause a loss of water resources. Therefore, some prefectures in Japan conducted intensive thinning of coniferous plantations, mainly to secure water resources. Although canopy interception loss (Ic) is a major component of evapotranspiration, few studies have examined changes in Ic due to intensive thinning. We measured Ic in a Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest, the most common type of plantation in Japan. We compared and contrasted three canopy interception models (Mulder, revised Gash, WiMo) before and after intensive thinning operations. The experimental Japanese cedar forest was intensively thinned with removal of 54% of all stems, reducing the stocking level from 1300 to 600 stems ha-1 and the basal area by 50% from 99.7 to 49.6 m2 ha-1. The ratios of throughfall (Tf), stemflow (Sf), and Ic to precipitation (Pr) (i.e., Tf/Pr, Sf /Pr, and Ic/Pr) before thinning were 74%, 12%, and 14%, respectively. After thinning, those percentages changed to 86%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. Thus, thinning decreased Ic by 43%, a value comparable to changes in stem density and basal area. The Mulder model represented the measured Ic well, both before and after thinning. Ic for the revised Gash and WiMo models tended to be larger than the measured Ic both before and after thinning. This suggests that the Mulder model might be best suited to predict canopy interception losses from Japanese cedar plantations before and after thinning operations.",

            "abstract": "A huge earthquake (Mw 7.8, USGS) occurred on 25 April, 2015 in Nepal, followed by the largest aftershock (Mw 7.3, USGS) on 12 May. We applied an InSAR technique to detect crustal deformation caused by the earthquakes using L-band SAR data acquired by ALOS-2.\nOne of the advantages of ALOS-2 over ALOS is ScanSAR interferometry. Beam synchronization, which is a critical factor for ScanSAR interferometry, is always tuned among ALOS-2 observations. While a width of 350 km is covered by a ScanSAR acquisition, the provided data is divided into five swaths with each width of 70 km. Adjacent swaths have an overlapping area with a width of several kilometers, where interferometric phases for two swaths are basically comparable. We processed each swath independently.\nPreliminary interferograms are contaminated by noises with long wavelength, which makes it difficult to measure the amount of the crustal deformation accurately. We reduce the noises by following steps. First, pseudo reference points with no displacement are put at intervals of 40-100 km outside of the possible deforming area. The differential phase at the points are assumed to be due to the noises. The curved surface of the noises is estimated by smoothly interpolating the differential phase at the points. Note that the pseudo reference points should be located in a high coherence area where the phases can be unwrapped. Furthermore the points in the overlapping area between adjacent swaths allow to preserve consistency of the phases between adjacent swaths.\nThe interferograms show the clear and detailed crustal deformation (published on http://www.gsi.go.jp/cais/topic150429-index-e.html). The maximum of a quasi up-down component of the deformation estimated from the interferograms with different beam directions reaches over 1.4 m uplift at 20 km northeast from Kathmandu and 0.6 m subsidence at a northern part of the deforming area.",

            "abstract": "Iron (Fe) isotope fractionations were determined during reduction of structural Fe(III) in nontronite NAu-1 biologically by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and chemically by dithionite. ~10% reduction was achieved in biological reactors, with similar reduction extents obtained by dithionite. We hypothesize that two stages occurred in our reactors. Firstly, reduction started from edge sites of clays and the produced Fe(II) partially remained in situ and partially was released into solution. Next aqueous Fe(II) adsorbed onto basal planes. The basal sorbed Fe(II) then undergoes electron transfer and atom exchange (ETAE) with octahedral Fe(III) in clays, with the most negative fractionation factor Δ56Febasal Fe(II)-structural Fe(III)of −1.7‰ when basal sorption reached a threshold value. Secondly, when the most reactive Fe(III) was exhausted, bioreduction significantly slowed down and chemical reduction was able to achieve 24% due to diffusion of small size dithionite. Importantly, no ETAE occurred between basal Fe(II) and structural Fe(III) due to blockage of pathways by collapsed clay layers.\nThis two-stage process in our reduction experiments is distinctive from abiotic exchange experiments by mixing aqueous Fe(II) and NAu-1, where no structural change of clay would block ETAE between basal Fe(II) and structural Fe(III). The separation of reduction sites (clay edges) and sorption sites (basal planes) is unique to clay minerals with layered structure. In contrast, reduction and sorption occur on the same sites on the surfaces of Fe oxyhydroxides, where reduction does not induce structure change. Thus, the Fe isotope fractionations are the same for reduction and abiotic exchange experiments for Fe oxides. Our study reveals important changes in electron transfer and atom exchange pathways upon reduction of clay minerals by dissimilatory Fe reducing bacteria, which is prevalent in anoxic soils and sediments.",

Study samples are collected on the Umitaka Spur (MD179-3304), a west part of the Oki Trough (UT14-PC1303&PC1305), and a north part of the Mogami Trough (HR14-RC1408). Each sedimentation rate is calculated by the ages of 14C, tephra, oxygen isotope events, and bottoms of the thin laminated layer.\nObvious occurrences of the methane related foraminifera, Rutherfordoides sp., are found from three all core sediments, and these sedimentation ages range to 28-25ka, early part of the MIS 2. However, we never find the unique occurrences from RC1408 sections except of MIS 2 even if another low stand stage of MIS 6. Above Rutherfordoides distributions, rare benthic foraminiferal number shows an anoxic bottom condition where most benthic foraminifera couldn’t live during the LGM (Oba et al., 1991), nonetheless, Rutherfordoides sp. lived continuously until the LGM. From the surface sediments, Rutherfordoides cornuta, lives on plural area from the northwest Pacific but not from the Japan Sea (Matoba and Nakagawa, 2009) is related to high methane gas content of the sediments in the Sagami Bay (Akimoto et al., 1996). Nakagawa et al. (2009) reported that distributions of Rutherfordoides rotundata (closely related R. cornuta) indicate that an expulsion of a large amount of methane occurred on the Umitaka Spur during the LGM due to a massive dissociation of subsurface methane hydrate. And, the negative carbon isotope peak signal of Rutherfordoides sp. from RC1408 in the Mogami Trough, also indicate to dissociations of methane hydrate and active methane seeps by the lowest sea level same as Umitaka Spur (Takeuchi et al., 2007).\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was a part of METI’s project entitled “FY2014 Promoting research and development on methane hydrate” .",

There have been numerous investigations into the contrail properties, radiative effects, and climate impact. However, very little effort has been focused on the impact of contaminated contrails. Generated by the combustion process within the aircraft engine, the aerosols and exhaust gases frequently influence contrail formation. Contrail ice crystals contaminated by soot particles have been found to exhibit dramatically different light scattering properties from those of pristine crystals. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art light scattering computational capabilities to calculate the single-scattering properties of soot-contaminated contrails. The contaminated contrail particle is assumed to be a hexagonal ice column containing several soot particles. The invariant imbedding T-matrix method and the Ray-by-Ray geometry optics method are combined to construct a simplified yet novel set of contaminated contrail optical properties. The bulk optical properties are calculated based on the data set and are parameterized for use in the Community Atmospheric Model. Using global contrail retrievals from satellite remote sensing observations in 2006 and 2012, simulations are conducted using the general circulation model to analyze contaminated contrail radiative effects as well as their climatic sensitivities. Our results show that the contaminated contrail is significantly more absorbing than pristine contrail in the shortwave spectrum. As a result, much stronger contrail radiative impact and climate feedback are found. Several sensitivity studies are also implemented to quantify the effect of contrail contamination.",

            "abstract": "Heavy metals leached from exhausted mines have been causing severe environmental problems in nearby soils and groundwater. Environmental mitigation was performed based on the heavy metal stabilization using Calcite and steel slag in Korea. Since the soil stabilization only temporarily immobilizes the contaminants to soil matrix, the potential risk of re-leaching heavy metal still exists. Therefore the follow-up management of stabilized soils and the corresponding evaluation methods are required to avoid the consequent contamination from the stabilized soils. In this study, microbial community analysis using pyrosequencing was performed for assessing the potential leaching of the stabilized soils. As a result of rarefaction curve and Chao1 and Shannon indices, the stabilized soil has shown lower richness and diversity as compared to non-contaminated negative control. At the phyla level, as the degree of contamination increases, most of phyla decreased with only exception of increased proteobacteria. Among proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria increased against the heavy metal contamination. At the species level, Methylobacter tundripaludum of gamma-proteobacteria showed the highest relative portion of microbial community, indicating that methanotrophs may play an important role in either solubilization or immobilization of heavy metals in stabilized soils.",

The passage includes a set of faults and basins connecting the Virgin Island Basin to the Sombrero Basin.\nThe geodynamic causes, the tectono-sedimentary evolution and the eastward extent of the Anegada passage are still unclear. Various models for the formation of the passage were published: (1) pure extension, (2) dextral or (3) sinsitral transtension.\nDuring the geophysical cruise ANTITHESIS-1 (Nov.2013–Jan.2014), we acquired deep penetration multichannel seismic and wide-angle seismic data, high resolution seismic (3.5 khz) data and multibeam swath bathymetry in this poorly-investigated margin segment. These data shed new light on the extent and structure of the Anegada system as well as on its past and current tectonic activity.\nThe crustal thickness and velocity (Vp) structure are consistent with a previously-proposed oceanic origin under hotspot influence. The crustal Vp structure does not significantly vary astride the Anegada Passage suggesting similar nature of the rocks. Thus, the Anegada Passage does not correspond to a possible boundary between differing–origin basements in Greater and Lesser Antilles.\nThe Anegada system extends NE of the Sombrero Basin with a set of newly-observed basins and faults that all together draw an en echelon structure. This fault system widens eastward, with numerous short and shallow E-W-trending faults suggesting an anastomosing system near the accretionary prism.\nWithin the Sombrero Basin, the shallowest undeformed sedimentary unit overlays deformed and fan-shaped deeper units indicating a recently-sealed tectonic activity consistent with the seismic and geodetic records. This low current seismic and tectonic activity indicates that the Anegada Passage formed during a past tectonic phase possibly related to the Bahamas Platform docking against the Greater Antilles subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Southern Central Range of Taiwan, a place where deep-seated tectonic tremors (a proxy of slow slip) and earthquake swarms are closely located in space and highly correlated in time, provides rare opportunity towards the understanding of physical mechanisms governing different style of slip. To identify tremor events, we used the identification scheme similar to Ide et al. (2015) but applied slightly different techniques: (1) Higher waveform cross-correlation coefficient (>0.6) (2) careful visual inspection for excluding local earthquakes and short-lasted event (duration < 60 s) (3) Signal to noise ratio higher than 1.2 and lower than 30 (4) No spatio-temporal clustering technique used. During the study period of 2007-2012, we identified 2320 tremor events with duration ranging from 60 s to 1550 s. They are located underneath southern Central Range, forming a NS-striking and SE-dipping pipe-like structure at a depth of 20-40 km. The up-dip extension of this tremor structure reaches an aseismic zone under the western flank of Central Range at shallow depths, where is an area characterized by high heat flow, low Vp and Vs anomaly. Such seismic gap was explained by the buoyancy induced crust detachment during continental subduction of Eurasian Plate. This detachment may open a new channel for hot and ductile material ascending to shallow depth, producing high temperatures along the way. This provides a common mechanism for down-dip tremor and up-dip shallow seismic gap along the same eastern dipping channel. In addition, the tremor events are found to be mostly occurred in high tides and exhibit higher correlation with tide data from west coast of Taiwan. This may again imply the association between tremor activity and subduction of Eurasian Plate.",

            "abstract": "Tulare Lake is located in the San Joaquin Valley of California west of the Sierra Nevada mountains (Preston, 1981). The Poso Canal trench locality is located in the southeastern portion of Tulare Lake in the Ton Tachi lake plane south of the Atwell Island sand spit. This area was chosen because these sediments lie beneath a road bed that predates agricultural tilling, preserving late-Holocene lake sediments. Sediments from trench TL13-7C were sampled for geophysical and geochemical analyses in order to create a higher resolution lake-level history during the late-Holocene than had been possible using only lithologic descriptions. The new record is comprised of grain size, clay percentage, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios, total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC), and nitrogen (N) analyses taken at 2-cm intervals over 181-cm of section comprising four lithologic units. From oldest to youngest, Unit 1A consists of relatively equal and steady percentages of clay, silt, and sand, and relatively low C/N ratios, TIC, TOC, and N, suggesting an unproductive lake and relatively deep lake levels at this high elevation site. Fluctuating C/N ratios, a steady decrease in clay percentage, and a steady increase in sand percentage in Unit 1B suggests periods of flooding and fluctuating lake levels and eventually shallow evaporative lake conditions, as evidenced by a considerable and sudden increase in TIC (to 4.51%) in Unit 2. In addition to the drastic change in TIC, Unit 2 shows evidence of a large influx of terrestrial organic matter perhaps transported by floods by an increase in sand percentage and two pronounced spikes in C/N ratios to 38 and 65 (Meyers and Lallier-Verges, 1999). Unit 3 shows low but steady levels of clay and sand percentages, and higher but steady levels of silt. Levels of TIC, TOC, C/N, and N are all steady, with relatively higher levels of TOC and N, which are indicators of high lake level and productivity (Cohen, 2003). Unit 4 is very similar to Unit 3, however toward the upper region of the unit, sand percentages increased with a slight increase in TIC, suggesting a relatively shallower lake. This record will be used to test lake-level models for Tulare Lake put forth by Blunt and Negrini (in press) and Jackson (2015).",

            "abstract": "Surface observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter document the widespread occurrence of atmospherically-corrected ground temperatures consistent with the presence of extensive CO2 frost deposits at low latitudes at 3AM. While the detection of CO2 ice has previously been reported outside the polar regions, in discrete locations associated with very high elevation terrains (i.e. associated with Elysium, Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes), our observations provide the first observational evidence of a global-scale diurnal CO2 cycle involving the atmosphere and the surface.\nMCS surface temperatures consistent with the presence of ephemeral diurnal CO2 frost deposits are strongly correlated with geologic terrains characterized by high emissivity, high albedo, and low thermal inertia. All of these properties are conducive to low nighttime temperatures. Thermal modeling of these low inertia terrains (i.e. < 75 J m-2K-1s-1/2), which cover a large fraction of the Martian surface, confirms that the regolith frequently reaches CO2 frost point temperatures at all latitudes near 3AM, with seasonal variations noticed. In addition, models used in conjunction with MCS temperature retrievals also predict that right before sunrise, nearly all of the Martian dusty low thermal inertia units are frosted at some point during the Mars Year. Energy/mass balance modeling suggests deposits with depths of up to several hundreds of microns of CO2 (<<0.1% of the Martian atmosphere). This is not sufficient to generate a measurable diurnal pressure cycle. The discovery of this diurnal CO2 cycle may nonetheless represent an important step forward in our understanding of the way the Mars atmosphere interacts with the surface.",

            "abstract": "Fires are natural hazards that affect communities globally and while many studies about their effects on environments such as forests and woodlands have been extensively researched, the effects of fire on karst is a topic that is not well understood. The sensitivity of caves to environmental changes make karst systems natural record keepers of environmental events and have been used as proxies for paleo environmental studies in recent times. Building on from this, karsts could potentially also be used to extend currently known fire histories beyond recorded events further back in time. Identifying quantifiable signatures in infiltration water characteristics from the burnt environments and how they are altered as they travel from a soil dominated medium (overlying soil) to a carbonate dominated medium (underlying karst system), is the key identifying fire signatures in the caves through which these waters flow.\nMultiple infiltration experiments conducted using a soil column set up (soil profiles from burnt environment) amended to represent a subsurface cave system (Fig. 1), have been conducted to measure chemical composition, organic matter, carbon dioxide concentrations, pH, electronic conductivity and alkalinity after a controlled fire over the test site at Yarrangobilly Caves in the Snowy Mountains, NSW. Recurring trends in the variables of the infiltration water could be identified and used to identify a fire signature originating from surface to cave.\nThe fire event on which this paper is based is a cool controlled fire over Yarrangobilly Caves, very similar to back burning practises undertaken in regions prone to wildfires globally. In saying this, samples from hotspots that had experienced higher temperatures, had also been collected for this experiment to simulate the effects of hotter wildfires on the underlying karst systems.\nFigure 1: Soil column with isolated chamber containing limestone used to represent a subsurface karst environment",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that emerging micropollutants containing endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs); bisphenol A, 17 α-ethinylestradiol, 17 β-estradiol and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs); sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, atenolol, benzophenone, benzotriazole, caffeine, gemfibrozil, primidone, triclocarban in water have been linked to ecological impacts, even at trace concentrations (sub ug/L). Adsorption with adsorbent such as activated carbon having a high-binding affinity has been widely used to eliminate various contaminants in the aqueous phase. Recently, an efficient treatment strategy for EDCs and PPCPs has been considered by using cost effective adsorption particularly with biochar in aqueous environmentIn this study, the objective of this study is to determine the removal of 13 target EDCs/PPCPs having different physicochemical properties by a biochar at various water quality conditions (pH (3.5, 7, and 10.5), background ions (NaCl, CaCl2, Na₂SO₄), ionic strength, natural organic matter (NOM)). The activated biochar produced in a laboratory was also characterized by using conventional analytical methods as well as advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, which answer how these properties determine the competitive adsorption characteristics and mechanisms of EDCs and PPCPs.The primary findings suggest that micropollutants can be removed more effectively by the biochar than the commercially available powdered activated carbon. At pH values below the pKa of each compound, the adsorption affinity toward adsorbents increased significantly with the pH, whereas the adsorption affinity decreased significantly at the pH above the pKa values. Na+ did not significantly impact adsorption, while increasing the concentration of Ca2+lead to increase in the adsorption of these micropollutants. NOM adsorption with humic acids on these adsorbents disturbed adsorption capacity of the target compounds as occupying active adsorption sites and interacting with EDCs/PPCPs. Conclusion that can be drawn thus far is that the biochar shows great physicochemical properties for adsorption to reduce the micropollutants.",

            "abstract": "Implementing Community Based Flood Early Warning System (EWS) in developing countries like Nepal is challenging. Complex topography and geology combined with a sparse network of river and rainfall gauges and little predictive meteorological capacity both nationally and regionally dramatically constrain EWS options. This paper provides a synopsis of the hydrological and meteorological conditions that led to flooding in the Karnali River, West Nepal during mid-August 2014, and analyses the effectiveness of flood EWS in the region.\nOn August 14-15, 2014, a large, slow moving weather system deposited record breaking rainfall in the foothills of the Karnali River catchment. Precipitation depths of 200 to 500 mm were recorded over a 24-hour period, which led to rapid rise of river heights. At the Chisapani river gauge station used for the existing EWS, where the Karnali River exits the Himalaya onto the Indo-Gangetic Plain, water levels rapidly exceeded the 11 meter danger level. Between 3 to 6 am, water levels rose from 11 to 16. 1 meters, well beyond the design height of 15 meters. Analysis suggests that 2014 floods may have been a one-in-1000 year event.\nStarting with the onset of intense rainfall, the Chisapani gauge reader was in regular communication with downstream stakeholders and communities providing them with timely information regarding rising water level. This provided people just enough time to move to safe places with their livestock and key assets. Though households still lost substantial assets, without the EWS, floodwaters would have caught communities completely unaware and damage would almost certainly have been much worse. In particular, despite the complications associated with access to the Chisapani gauge and failure of critical communication nodes during the floods, EWS was instrumental in saving lives.\nThis study explores both the details of the flood event and performance of the early warning system, and identifies lessons learned to help strengthen flood response in Nepal other regions facing similar data and technology constraints. This research also underscores the need to move from observation to forecast based EWS, ideally coupled with hydrological and meteorological models that would provide flood estimates well in advance to vulnerable communities.",

            "abstract": "Glacial measurements in Zailiyskiy- Kungei Alatau mountainous systems (Tien Shan, Kazakhstan) began in the 1950s and proceeded in two ways: Detailed continuous mass balance and meteorological measurements were conducted at Tuyuksu (benchmark glacier of the WGMS) while wider inventories were conducted across the glacial systems using airborne and satellite measurements using Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery. At Tuyuksu, a valley glacier with a current map area of 2.27 km2, measurements started in 1957 and were conducted during the melt season becoming year-round in 1972. They include regular accumulation and ablation measurements from a network of 120 stakes, snow density and geodetic measurements and observations of temperature, precipitation, sun-shine hours and cloudiness at the meteorological station located at the foot of the glacier. Regional glacier inventories were conducted in 1955, 1974, 1979, 1990, 2008.\nAnalyses of the data of the inventories and mass balance observations are in good agreement and indicate that glaciers have been retreating since mid-1950s. Rates of retreat during different time periods changed from -0.65 to -1.38 % year-1. The average rate for the period 1956-2008 is 0.757 % year-1. Maximum rates observed for southern macro-slopes of the ridges.\nThe mass balance records from Tuyuksu indicate that cumulative mass balance has been declining since middle 1970s and annual mass balance was positive only 14 times for 58 years. Ablation season at Tuyuksu lasts between June and August while accumulation occurs around the year. There is a good correlation of the annual and winter mass balance. With the general increase of air temperature during the ablation period, in most cases the relatively small values of the summer balance correspond to previous winter balance.\nThe result of our research allow us to conclude that mass balance monitoring data of Tuyuksu glacier reliably reflect general trends in deglaciation of the Zailiyskiy- Kungei Alatau Mountains.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial drainage is known to play an important role in glacier dynamics trough its influence on basal sliding. However, drainage is also one of the most poorly understood process in glacier flow due to the difficulties of observing, identifying and modeling the physics involved.\nIn an effort to improve understanding of subglacial processes, we have monitored a small, approximately 100 m thick surge-type alpine glacier for seven years. Over 300 boreholes were instrumented with pressure transducers over a 0.5 km² in its upper ablation area, in addition to a permanent GPS array and weather station.\nTo quantitatively characterize the morphology and evolution of the subglacial drainage, we use Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) in combination with various filtering techniques. This allows us to identify clusters of boreholes exhibiting similar evolution in water pressure. Using moving time windows, we use this approach to identify connections between boreholes, and to track how these changes evolve over longer time intervals.\nOur results include:\ni) The different areas can be subdivided in three groups according to the water pressure variations: Hydraulically isolated, hydraulically connected with distributed drainage, and channelized areas\nii) Transitions between connected and isolated areas are mostly discrete and rapid switch-like events, taking from a few minutes to a few hours\niii) There is limited evidence to support the assumption that the hydraulic connection between instruments installed at the bed happens necessarily trough the bed interface itself, with engacial conduits also playing an important role\niv) Transmissivity, conductivity and reflectivity measurements in a small subsets of boreholes suggest that most water pressure variation measured at the bed in areas of “distributed” drainage are not accompanied by substantial water transport, even where time lags and attenuation of pressure suggest behavior consistent with a “macroporous” water sheet at the bed\nvi) Preliminary evidence suggest that englacial conduits can persist over winter, potentially forming an hydraulic network that could play an important role in water transport\nWe discuss how our results fit into current efforts to model subglacial drainage and alterations to drainage model physics that are suggested by our observations.",

            "abstract": "The Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, USA, is a hypersaline terminal lake that is home to some of the highest concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) ever measured in natural waters. While terrestrial organisms typically have very low concentrations of MeHg because it is produced almost exclusively in sub-oxic aquatic environments, we documented elevated concentrations of MeHg in brine flies (Ephydra spp.) and spiders along the shores of the GSL. We hypothesized that brine flies, with their larval and pupal stages in the GSL, act as vectors that transfer Hg from the lake to surrounding terrestrial ecosystems as flying adults where they are eaten by spiders and other organisms. The GSL is visited annually by millions of migratory birds, and a major food source for both resident and migratory birds at the GSL are brine flies, so brine flies may represent an important source of Hg to birds here. We conducted a spatial and temporal study of HgT and MeHg in surface waters, brine flies, spiders, and Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) a predatory terrestrial songbird of conservation concern, and investigated sublethal effects due to Hg exposure on Antelope Island in the GSL. Samples were also analyzed for their stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios. While HgT and MeHg concentrations in surface waters were elevated, they varied relatively little throughout the year and exhibited no clear seasonal trends. However, seasonal maxima in concentrations of HgT and MeHg in brine flies and spiders occurred in spring and fall, periods of peak migratory bird numbers at the GSL. Approximately 20% of adult/juvenile shrikes had blood HgT concentrations above thresholds previously shown to reduce breeding success in other songbirds, with these concentrations increasing after the annual appearance of orb weaving spiders. HgT concentrations of shrikes decreased with increasing distance from the shoreline and decreasing brine fly abundance, again suggesting the GSL is the ultimate source of Hg in these organisms. Preliminary data from a subset of videos do not show a correlation between nestling Hg levels and nestling feeding rates or growth rate.",

            "abstract": "A primary challenge in critical zone science is to understand and predict the interaction between aboveground and belowground ecohydrologic processes. We study the role of hydraulic redistribution (HR) by roots as a mechanism for facilitating aboveground-belowground interactions that drive water and carbon dynamics and the development of emergent spatial patterns of soil moisture and vegetation distribution. By linking field measurements of stem, taproot, and lateral root sap flux, with a shared resource model where the soil is a common reservoir, we examine competitive and facilitative dependencies between the co-occurring plant species. We used trenching as a means of severing any HR connectivity between overstory and understory plants in a subset of plots. We monitored leaf- level transpiration, photosynthesis, sub-canopy ET, NEE, soil evaporation, and soil respiration for trenched and un-trenched (control) trees in a dryland savanna that lacks access to stable soil moisture sources. HR in the trees at the site is detected, but the implications of HR on overstory-understory interactions and resulting spatial patterns and gradients remain untested. During an inter-storm period of the rainy season, we observed hydraulic lift, which may be increasing water availability to understory. Understory grasses may survive inter-storm dry periods by way of facilitative dependency on water resources supplied by overstory trees. On the other hand, immediately after storms we observe hydraulic descent that may be reducing water availability for the understory. Modeling is incorporated to capture the competitive and facilitative interaction between aboveground and belowground as detected in the field. This study provides deep insights for dryland regions, which enables broader generalizations regarding the interaction between groundwater, vegetation roots and aboveground assemblage and their role in whole-ecosystem performance.",

            "abstract": "Dam removal revealed the facies architecture and distribution of detrital carbon in the sediments of two former large reservoirs, providing an unparalleled opportunity to develop a stratigraphic framework for understanding processing and storage of organic carbon in reservoir sediments. Incision following the 2011-2014 removal of Elwha (34 m high; Lake Aldwell reservoir) and Glines Canyon (64 m; Lake Mills reservoir) Dams on the Elwha River in Washington State exposed 85+ years accumulation of reservoir sediment in cross section, creating the first known opportunity to characterize post-impoundment sediments of a large reservoir in situ. In Lake Mills, the upstream reservoir, the Elwha River deposited an estimated 1.56x106 m3 sediment primarily in a steep-fronted, Gilbert-style delta, while deposition in downstream Lake Aldwell comprised only ~3.0x106 m3 sediment, deposited broadly in an elongate, low-angle delta. Allochthonous carbon is primarily preserved in delta foresets and complexly-bedded prodelta sands, with secondary lenses of coarse-grained organics deposited as channel-lag in migrating topset channels. Organic units tend to be coarse-grained, open-framework lenses and beds consisting of well-preserved branches, cones, and needles in the topset and foreset beds, while prodelta sands consist of well-sorted, well-preserved needles and leaves associated with fine sands and silts. Compared to Lake Mills, Lake Aldwell’s delta deposits are lower angle and have finer, more organic-rich topset beds. Lacustrine beds in the main body of the reservoir are dominated by mineral sediments. Taking the average total organic carbon (TOC) content and geometry of individual facies provides a first-order estimate of the total organic carbon load in the reservoir sediments, and provides insight into the spatial variability of carbon deposition, a key challenge in understanding the carbon footprint of large water reservoirs.",

A distributed eco-hydrological model was developed and cryosphere processes were coupled with hydrological processes in the model simulation. Model validation shows that the model shows high skill in simulating the river discharge, soil moisture, soil temperature and heat flux. The study area is the Heihe River basin, the second largest inland river basin in China. Numerical experiment shows that the soil freezing/thawing shows significant impact of hydrological processes and it reduced base flow and increased peak flow. Hydrological changes of the past 50 years in the Heihe River were analyzed based on model simulation. Soil temperature was found to be increased and melting depth shows significant increasing trend. Due to the limited areas, glacier melting shows little impact on the runoff changes. However, the changes in frozen soil and the snow melting shows significant effects on the river discharge changes. The results highlights the importance of study of the cryosphere hydrology in understanding the hydrological changes in the high altitude cold regions.\nKey words: the Heihe River basin, hydrological changes, Cryosphere processes",

The seabed bedforms are in the area where Yellow Sea Trough extends to the Okinawa Trough and lies in the entrance channel of Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC), one branch of the Kuroshio Current. The fine post-processing and characteristic analysis for seabed bedforms data will contribute to an overall understanding of seabed topographic features and distribution of the ridges and troughs. Based on the high-precision multi-beam echo sounder (MBES) data, we create a high-precision seabed Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and sonar mosaic images to generate high-resolution 3D seabed maps, as well as seabed slope, aspect maps and other special terrain profiles. From those maps, we can measure height, width, length, direction and other characteristic parameters of the seabed Rippled Scour Depressions (RSDs) and sand ridges. We find a deep seabed gully with the water depth of 153.2 m in the northeast corner of the study area. The relative height difference is up to 32 m indicates strong erosion with dramatic changes in seabed topography. There are also more than 10 large-scale straight RSDs and sand ridges, all NW-SE direction, in length from a few kilometers to 40 km. The general height difference is about 5 m and the maximum height difference can reach up to 10 m. In the study area we find out a great quantity of seabed sand ridges and erode RSDs, which form ridges-troughs and erosion-deposition special seabed topographic features.",

In each station, the fundamental dispersion mode data of Rayleigh waves are inverted into shear-wave profile. The crustal thickness structure and Poisson’s ratio model are constructed by H-K stacking of RFs, rather than pre-determined. The inverted crustal thicknesses changes from 30 km in the south to 62 km in the north, showing strong lateral variations and matching well with the tomography in mirror symmetry. The inverted Vs structure varies laterally too. There are low velocity zones (LVZs) distribute at the crust and upper mantle. Both LVZs extend from the northern Yunnan towards southeast and southwest, respectively, and then separate at the southern Yunnan. These two LVZs possibly present two flowing channels of crustal and upper mantle materials at the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau.\nKeywords: Tibetan Plateau; joint analysis; crustal flow; receiver function; surface wave dispersion",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have documented that tree ring oxygen and hydrogen isotopes primarily reflect source water; however, biosynthetic fractionation processes modify this signal and can have a varied response to environmental conditions. The degree to which source water contributes to δ2H and δ18O values of plant α-cellulose is species-specific and modern calibration studies are necessary. Here we present a calibration data set of P. tamarugo α-cellulose δ2H and δ18O values from the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile. P. tamarugo trees are endemic to the region and have adapted to the extremely arid environment where average annual precipitation is < 5mm/yr. This modern isotope chronology has been constructed from living P. tamarugo trees (n=12) from the Pampa del Tamarugal Basin in the northern Atacama. Generally, the tree-ring α-cellulose δ18O values are poorly correlated with meteorological data from coastal stations (i.e. Iquique); however, there is good agreement between regional groundwater depth and α-cellulose δ18O values. Most notably, average α-cellulose δ18O values increase by >2 ‰ over the past 20 years associated with a ~1.1 m lowering of the local groundwater table throughout the area. The correlation between a-cellulose isotope values and hydrologic conditions in modern times provides a baseline for interpretation of tree-ring isotope chronologies from the past 9.5 kya. A high-resolution Holocene (1.8-9.1 kya) age record of Prosopis sp. tree ring α-cellulose δ18O values provides a proxy for climatic and hydrologic conditions. During the early Holocene δ18O values range from 31 to 35‰ (2σ=0.58‰), while during the late Holocene values are much more variable (27.4 to 41‰; 2σ=2.64‰). Anthropogenic demand on local water sources is the most significant environmental factor affecting the variation in modern α-cellulose δ18O values; however, climate induced changes in regional water availability are the dominant driver of variability in the paleo-record. Increased variability in α-cellulose δ18O values in the late Holocene most likely indicates a reduction in annual recharge and an increase in episodic flood events driven by ENSO and other modes of atmospheric variability.",

To achieve this goal, we at first investigated seasonal changes in surface water coverage by using satellite remote sensing data. For this investigation, we used MODIS and AMSR-E satellite remote sensing data. These data showed that at the beginning of the wet season, surface water appears from the southern (lower) part and then expands to the northern (higher) part of the CSSWs. We also assessed the effect of the introduction of rice-millet mixed-cropping systems on evapotranspiration in the CSSWs region. For this investigation, we used data obtained by the Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) method at an experimental field site established in September 2012 on the Ogongo campus, University of Namibia. This analysis showed the importance of water and vegetation conditions when introducing mixed-cropping to the region. Finally, in order to understand water sources of small wetlands in the CSSWs, stable isotopic ratio of water (precipitation, surface-, and subsurface-water) were analyzed. This analysis showed that shallow groundwater of small wetlands is very likely to be recharged from surface-water, source of which was local precipitation and was pooled in lowest part of small wetlands.",

            "abstract": "Flow in a nature river are usually unsteady, while nearly all the theories about bedload transport are on the basis of steady, uniform flow, and also with supposed equilibrium state of sediment transport. This is may be one of the main reasons why the bedload transport formulas are notoriously poor accuracy to predict the bedload. The aim of this research is to shed light on the effect of unsteadiness on the bedload transport based on experimental studies. The novel of this study is that the experiments were not carried out in a conventional flume but in a physical model, which are more similar to the actual river. On the other hand, in our experiments, multiple consecutive flood wave were reproduced in the physical model, and all the flow and sediment parameters are based on a large number of data obtained from many of identical flood waves. This method allow us to get more data for one flood, efficiently avoids the uncertainty of bedload rate only for one single flood wave, due to the stochastic fluctuation of the bedload transport. Three different flood waves were selected in the experiments. During each run of experiment, the water level of five different positions along the model were measured by ultrasonic water level gauge, flow velocity at the middle of the channel were measured by two dimensional electromagnetic current meter. Moreover, the bedload transport rate was measured by a unique automatic trap collecting and weighing system at the end of the physical model. The results shows that the celerity of flood wave propagate varies for different flow conditions. The velocity distribution was approximately accord with log-law profile during the entire rising and falling limb of flood. The bedload transport rate show intensity fluctuation in all the experiments, moreover, for different flood waves, the moment when the shear stress reaches its maximum value is not the exact moment when the sediment transport rate reaches its maximum value, which indicates that the movement of flow and the sediment are not always synchronous during the flood processes. Comparing the bedload transport rate with the existing results of steady flows shows that the bedload transport capacity in unsteady flow is greater than that of the steady flow with same bed shear stresses.\n(Supported by KPNST(2013BAB12B01; 2012BAB04B01) and NSFC(11472310))",

            "abstract": "The Solar-C is a Japan-led international solar mission planned to be launched in mid2020. It is designed to investigate the magnetic activities of the Sun, focusing on the study in heating and dynamical phenomena of the chromosphere and corona, and also to develop an algorithm for predicting short and long term solar evolution. Since it has been revealed that the different parts of the magnetized solar atmosphere are essentially coupled, the SOLAR-C should tackle the spatial scales and temperature regimes that need to be observed in order to achieve a comprehensive physical understanding of this coupling. The science of Solar-C will greatly advance our understanding of the Sun, of basic physical processes operating throughout the universe. To dramatically improve the situation, SOLAR-C will carry three dedicated instruments; the Solar UV-Vis-IR Telescope (SUVIT), the EUV Spectroscopic Telescope (EUVST) and the High Resolution Coronal Imager (HCI), to jointly observe the entire visible solar atmosphere with essentially the same high spatial resolution (0.1-0.3 arcsec), performing high resolution spectroscopic measurements over all atmospheric regions and spectro-polarimetric measurements from the photosphere through the upper chromosphere. In addition, Solar-C will contribute to our understanding on the influence of the Sun-Earth environments with synergetic wide-field observations from ground-based and other space missions. Some leading science objectives and the mission concept, including designs of the three instruments aboard SOLAR-C will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The wind in Taiwan Strait is strong and stable which offers an opportunity to build offshore wind farms. However, frequently visited typhoons and strong ocean current require more attentions on the wave force and local scour around the foundation of the turbine piles. In this paper, we introduce an in-house, multi-phase CFD model, Splash3D, for solving the flow field with breaking wave, strong turbulent, and scour phenomena. Splash3D solves Navier-Stokes Equation with Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for the fluid domain, and uses volume of fluid (VOF) with piecewise linear interface reconstruction (PLIC) method to describe the break free-surface. The waves were generated inside the computational domain by internal wave maker with a mass-source function. This function is designed to adequately simulate the wave condition under observed extreme events based on JONSWAP spectrum and dispersion relationship. Dirichlet velocity boundary condition is assigned at the upper stream boundary to induce the ocean current. At the downstream face, the sponge-layer method combined with pressure Dirichlet boundary condition is specified for dissipating waves and conducting current out of the domain. Numerical pressure gauges are uniformly set on the structure surface to obtain the force distribution on the structure. As for the local scour around the foundation, we developed Discontinuous Bi-viscous Model (DBM) for the development of the scour hole. Model validations were presented as well. The force distribution under observed irregular wave condition was extracted by the irregular-surface force extraction (ISFE) method, which provides a fast and elegant way to integrate the force acting on the surface of irregular structure. From the Simulation results, we found that the total force is mainly induced by the impinging waves, and the force from the ocean current is about 2 order of magnitude smaller than the wave force. We also found the dynamic pressure, wave height, and the projection area of the structure are the main factors to the total force. Detailed results and discussion are presented as well.",

            "abstract": "The boreal winter 2013/2014 can be characterized by continuous strong activity of planetary waves of zonal wavenumber 2 (wave 2) in the stratosphere almost throughout the season, in spite of no major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) occurrence. The purpose of this study is to compare features of the planetary wave propagation in boreal winters and discuss causation mechanisms of the predominance of wave 2 in the winter 2013/2014 using three reanalysis data (JRA-55, MERRA and ERA-Interim) along with satellite data retrieved from the Aura-MLS observations. We first investigate interannual changes of the vertical component of Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux averaged over 30-90N at 100 hPa integrated during each boreal winter since 1958/1959. As a result, we find that the upward EP flux of wave 2 during the winter of 2013/14 was almost equal to the highest value during the winter 2008/2009. In addition, the ratio of the wave 2 contribution to the sum of wave 1 and wave 2 largely surpassed 0.75 in only these two winters. Note that no major SSWs occurred in the winter 2013/14 while a remarkable major SSW occurred in the winter 2008/09. However, on the basis of wave activity flux analyses, both the upward propagation over Western Russia (around 60E) and the downward propagation over Northern Canada (around 120W) of planetary wave packets were the strongest in recent 34 winters since 1980/1981; similar structural features could not be seen in the winter 2008/09.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we investigate the initiation locations of all intracloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes in two small thunderstorms which occurred over NASA/Kennedy Space Center on July 22, 2011. Initiation points of 47 of the 58 lightning flashes (19 IC and 28 CG) were identified using the first initial breakdown (IB) pulse of each flash measured with E-change data. In this study 32 of the flashes had an LDAR2 (VHF) location coincident with the first IB pulse. For 15 flashes we used Position By Fast Antenna or PBFA [Karunarathne et al., 2013, JGR Atmospheres] to determine the location of the first IB pulse. (The remaining flashes had neither LDAR2 nor PBFA locations of the first IB pulse.) All these initiation points were then mapped onto radar reflectivity of the parent thundercloud. The initiation points of the flashes tend to cluster in specific regions in thundercloud. Lightning activity in both thunderstorms lasted 35 minutes, and all the flash initiation points in each storm occurred within a horizontal region of 4 km by 8 km. Flash initiation altitudes for IC flashes of the two thunderstorms ranged from 5.1 km to 12.1 km altitude while for CG flashes the altitude ranged from 4.6 km to 8.1 km. Based on available radar data for 14 IC flashes and 27 CG flashes, all but one of the IC flashes originated in 10 dBZ – 30 dBZ reflectivity regions while 22 of the CG flashes originated in 30 dBZ – 40 dBZ reflectivities. During the lifetimes of these two storms, no Narrow Bipolar Events occurred.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic soluble iron (Fe) to the ocean has been suggested to modulate primary ocean productivity and thus indirectly affect the climate. A key process contributing to anthropogenic sources of soluble Fe is associated with air pollution, which acidifies Fe-containing mineral aerosols during their transport and leads to Fe transformation from insoluble to soluble forms. However, there is large uncertainty in our estimate of this anthropogenic soluble Fe. Here, we interactively combined laboratory kinetic experiments with global aerosol modeling to more accurately quantify anthropogenic soluble Fe due to air pollution. We firstly examined Fe dissolution kinetics of African dust samples at acidic pH values with and without ionic species commonly found in aerosol water (i.e., sulfate and oxalate). We then constructed a new empirical scheme for Fe release from mineral dust due to inorganic and organic anions in aerosol water, by using acidity as a master variable. We implemented this new scheme and applied an updated mineralogical emission database in a global atmospheric chemistry transport model to estimate the atmospheric concentration and deposition flux of soluble Fe under preindustrial and modern conditions. Our improved model successfully captured the inverse relationship of Fe solubility and total Fe loading measured over the North Atlantic Ocean. However, our modeled Fe solubility was significantly lower than that deduced from observations over the South Atlantic east downwind from the Patagonian dust source regions. Our modeled Fe solubility for dry deposition over the Atlantic is in good agreement the measurement, while that for wet deposition is significantly lower than the measurement. Our model results suggest that human activities contribute to about half of the soluble Fe supply to a significant portion of the oceans in the Northern Hemisphere, while their contribution to oceans in the high latitude remains highly uncertain due to limited understanding of dust blown off the coasts of Alaska, Iceland and the Patagonia desert.",

This is one of the most devastating earthquakes occurred along Himalayan Arc and brought more than 80,000 deaths and more than 5.2 billion USD economical loss. The earthquake had duration of 25s and 75km rupture length along the surface. In order to investigate the strong motion caused by this earthquake, we simulate the Kashmir earthquake by the Curved grid finite difference method (CG-FDM). The finite-fault rupture, real topography variations and modified crustal model are considered. Simulated results are compared with available records, showing good mutual agreement between the synthetic and observed ground motions. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the intensity of four observed points had reached scale IX, whereas our simulated results show those points are located in the regions with our predicted intensity scale IX or VIII. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and Peak ground velocity (PGV) are most important parameters for hazard analysis, and our results are sufficiently coincide with their observed values. Finally, we also discuss the significant effect of surface topography on ground motion resulting by the Earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Satellite based remote sensing techniques are the primary means of identifying the location of volcanic ash during eruption events. This information is then used to initialize ash dispersion models, which employ meteorological fields to forecast the future locations of ash. Remote sensing of ash in tropical regions is especially challenging due to the difficulty of demarcating ash from the ice and water in convective clouds which results in frequent missed and false detections of ash. Dispersion models also contain uncertainties that arise from uncertainties in the meteorological fields and the source term such the height of the ash column. Communicating forecasting uncertainties is becoming increasingly important to stakeholders for the purposes of improved risk management. For these reasons the Bureau of Meteorology is engaged in research with the aim of providing probabilistic forecasts of ash in the near future based on ensembles of dispersion model simulations. The ensembles are constructed to reflect two fundamental uncertainties. Firstly, uncertainties in the meteorological fields are incorporated by the use of the Bureau’s ensemble model system which issues a set of 24 meteorological forecasts representing possible states of the atmosphere. Secondly, uncertainties in the model parameters such as the ash column height are also incorporated. This is accomplished by running a suite of dispersion model simulations, each with a different value of the model parameter. Pattern correlations are then used to quantify the match between the model and observations. The model parameters which provide the best matches between model and observations are then employed in the ensemble to issue probabilistic forecasts of ash. This process can also ameliorate errors due to incorrect or missing model physics. The efficacy of these techniques shall be demonstrated by the use of several case studies.",

Seven different compositions in the FeOOH-TiO2 system having molar ratios of x = Ti/(Fe + Ti) = 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.75 that were prepared by mixing reagent grade a-FeOOH (goethite) and TiO2 (anatase) powders were used as starting materials. High-pressure and high-temperature experiments were carried out using Kawai-type multi-anvil apparatus (Orange-1000 at Ehime University and SPI-1000 at Tokyo Institute of Technology). In this system, we identified two stable iron-titanium oxyhydroxide phases whose estimated composition is expressed by (FeH)1 – xTixO2 . One is the Fe-rich solid solution (x < 0.23) with e-FeOOH type crystal structure (e-phase, orthorhombic, P21nm) that was described by the previous studies (e.g., Suzuki 2010), and the other is the more Ti-rich solid solution (x > 0.35) with a-PbO2 type structure (a-phase, orthorhombic, Pbcn). The a-phase is stable up to 1500ºC for a composition of x = 0.5 and at least to 1600ºC for x = 0.75. Our result means that this phase is stable at average mantle temperature in the Earth’s mantle transition zone. The Iron-titanium-rich hydrous phases was possible to stable in basalt + H2O system (e.g., Hashimoto and Matsukage 2013). Therefore our findings suggest that water transport in the Earth’s deep interior is probably much more efficient than had been previously thought.",

Also, it is planned to use lightning data for Global Electric Circuit (GEC) investigation.\nCurrently, there are lightning detection networks in many countries. In Kazakhstan we have only separate units in airports. So, we don’t have full lightning information for our region. It is planned, to setup 8-10 measurement points with magnetic and electric filed antennas for VLF range. The final data set should be including each stroke location, time, type (CG+, CG-, CC+ or CC-) and waveform from each station. As the magnetic field lightning antenna the ferrite rod VLF antenna will be used. As the electric field antenna the wide range antenna with specific frequencies filters will be used.

An improvement of understanding and better modeling of the relationship of clouds, aerosols and radiation are therefore prominent part in climate research and weather prediction. It is important to obtain the global data of clouds and aerosols occurrence, structure and physical properties that are derived from measurements of solar and thermal radiation.\nEarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer) is one of the future earth observation mission of ESA and JAXA. The satellite will carry four instruments for observation of clouds and aerosols; Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID), Cloud Profiling Rader (CPR), Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI), and Broad-Band Radiometer (BBR). This mission aims at understanding of the role that clouds and aerosols play in reflecting incident solar radiation back into space and trapping infrared radiation emitted from Earth’s surface. These observations are needed to improve the precision of climate variability prediction.\nMSI provides across-track information on cloud with channels in the visible, near infrared, shortwave and thermal infrared. Water cloud optical properties are derived in using EarthCARE/MSI standard product based on CLAUDIA [Ishida and Nakajima, 2009] and CAPCOM [Nakajima and Nakajima, 1995; Kawamoto et al., 2001].

            "abstract": "Frictional mechanics are controlled by the ice micro-structure - surface asperities and flaws - but also the ice fabric and permeability network structure of the contacting blocks. Ice properties are dependent upon the temperature of the bulk ice, on the normal stress and on the sliding velocity and acceleration. This means the shear stress required for sliding is likewise dependent on sliding velocity, acceleration, and temperature. We aim to describe the micro-physics of the contacting surface. We review micro-mechanical models of friction: the elastic and ductile deformation of asperities under normal loads and their shear failure by ductile flow, brittle fracture, or melting and hydrodynamic lubrication. Combinations of these give a total of six rheological models of friction.\nWe present experimental results in ice mechanics and physics from laboratory experiments to understand the mechanical models. We then examine the scaling relations of the slip of ice, to examine how the micro-mechanics of ice friction can be captured simple reduced-parameter models, describing the mechanical state and slip rate of the floes. We aim to capture key elements that they may be incorporated into mid and ocean-basin scale modelling.",

            "abstract": "Coastal mangroves provide a barrier between the coast and lower energy intertidal environments. The presence of mangrove roots (pneumatophores) alters local hydrodynamics by slowing currents, dissipating waves, enhancing within-canopy turbulence, and introducing significant spatial variability to the flow, particularly on the stem scale. To date, limited measurements exist within pneumatophore regions owing to the difficulties of measuring on sufficiently small scales. Hence, little is known about the turbulence controlling sediment transport within these regions.\nWe report unique field observations near the seaward edge of a mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. This forest is exposed to moderate wave energy (maximum heights of around 1 m), with waves observed to propagate and break up to 100 m inside the forest. Our measurements focus on a rapidly prograding area with a relatively sandy substrate and a gentle topographic slope. We resolved millimeter-scale turbulent flows within and above the pneumatophore canopy. Precise measurements of vegetation densities as a function of height were obtained using photogrammetry techniques. The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy was enhanced at the canopy edge (ε ~ 10-4 W/kg), and decreased with distance into the forest (ε ~ 10-5 W/kg), although rates remained elevated above values measured on the tidal flat immediately offshore of the mangroves (ε ~ 10-6 W/kg). The dependence of turbulence on vegetation characteristics and on the stage of the tidal cycle is explored. The hydrodynamic measurements are then linked with changes in bathymetric features noted after a large wave event. Finer mud sediments were deposited outside the forest on the intertidal mudflat, whereas sandy sediments in the fringe region were significant scoured around regions of dense pneumatophores, and sediment mounds developed in the gaps between pneumatophores.",

            "abstract": "Soil contains the largest pool of organic carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is important for evaluating carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems at regional scale. How the selected pedotransfer functions (PTFs) of bulk density (BD) influence the estimates of SOC storage is still unclear at large scales, although BD is an important parameter in all equations. Here, we used data from the second national soil survey in China (8210 soil profiles) to evaluate the influence of eight selected PTFs on the estimation of SOC storage. The results showed that different PTFs may result in a higher uncertainty of SOC storage estimation, and the coefficient of variation (CV, %) for the eight PTFs varied from 10.61% to 70.46% (mean = 12.75%). The observed CV values were higher in the 0–20 cm layer (12.48%) than in the 20–100 cm layer (10.05%). CV values were relatively stable (10–15%) when SOC content ranged from 0.13% to 3.45%. The findings indicate that PTFs may be used cautiously in soils with higher or lower SOC content. Estimates of SOC storage in the 0–100 cm soil layer varied from 67.19 to 95.97 Pg C in the eight PTFs in China, with an average of 87.36 ± 8.93 Pg C (CV = 10.23%). Our findings provide the insight that differences in PTFs are important sources of uncertainty in SOC estimates, except for the different SOC data sets and estimation methods. The development of better PFTs, or the integration of various PFTs, is essential to accurately estimate SOC storage at regional scales.",

            "abstract": "Various studies over the last decades have revealed complex velocity structures of Earth’s inner core. Especially, researches using differential travel times of body waves mainly contribute to finding more sophisticated and precise structures in the inner core out. However, observed differential travel times compiled from different studies showed wide deviations with respect to the mean values and it made reliable determination of heterogeneous structures difficult. Recently, using well-constrained differential travel times of PKPbc-PKPdf from dense Hi-net array, we reported that Vp in the uppermost inner core (top 350 km of the inner core) is regionally perturbed by about 1% within each quasi-hemisphere. Although our well-constrained data reliably showed the existence of regional heterogeneity, the detailed 2-D or 3-D heterogeneity structures cannot be constrained by only perturbed differential travel times. To overcome this limitation, we utilize not only the differential travel times but also the differential ray parameters of PKPbc-PKPdf to study Vp structure of the uppermost inner core. The differential ray parameters measured by slant-stacking of waveforms recorded at Hi-net array also show regional variations in both quasi-hemispheres. This observation is important because it supports previous results obtained from differential travel time measurements and provides additional information to better constrain a characteristic parameter representing a high-dimensional Vp structure. We test many models with different characteristic levels of heterogeneities to explain the observed regional variation of the differential travel times and differential ray parameters. The level of heterogeneities estimated in our study can be helpful to understand the nature of the uppermost inner core.",

            "abstract": "Fragmentation and overturn of lunar surface materials produces a layer of regolith, which increases in thickness through time. Experiments on the lunar surface during the Apollo era, combined with remote sensing, found that the upper 10's of cm of regolith exhibit a rapid increase in density and thermal conductivity with depth. This is interpreted to be the signature of impact gardening, which operates most rapidly in the uppermost layers. Gravity data from the GRAIL mission showed that impacts have also extensively fractured the deeper crust. The breakdown and mixing of crustal materials is therefore a central process to lunar evolution and must be understood in order to interpret compositional information from remote sensing and sample analysis. Recently, thermal infrared data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner radiometer were used to provide the first remote observational constraints on the rate of ejecta breakdown around craters < 1 Ga (Ghent et al., 2014). Here, we use nighttime regolith temperatures derived from Diviner data to constrain regolith thermal inertia, thickness, and spatial variability. Applied to models, these new data help improve understanding of regolith formation on a variety of geologic units. We will also discuss several anomalous features that merit further investigation.\n",

            "abstract": "Climate change will have important effects on arctic productivity and greenhouse gas exchange. These changes were projected by the model ecosys under an SRES A2 scenario over the 21st century for a landscape including an upland tundra and a lowland fen at Daring Lake, NWT. Rising temperatures and precipitation caused increases in active layer depths (ALD) and eventual formation of taliks, particularly in the fen, which were attributed to heat advection from warmer and more intense precipitation and downslope flow. These changes raised net primary productivity from more rapid N mineralization and uptake, driven by more rapid heterotrophic respiration and increasing deciduous vs. evergreen plant functional types. Consequently gains in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 29 and 10 g C m-2 y-1 were modelled in the tundra and fen after 90 years. However CH4 emissions modelled from the fen rose sharply from direct effects of increasing soil temperatures and greater ALD on fermenter and methanogenic populations, and from indirect effects of increasing sedge growth which hastened transfer of CH4 through porous roots to the atmosphere. After 90 years, landscape CH4 emissions increased from 1.1 to 5.2 g C m-2 y-1 while landscape NEP increased from 34 to 46 g C m-2 y-1. Positive feedback to radiative forcing from increases in CH4 emissions more than offset negative feedback from increases in NEP. This feedback was largely attributed to rises in CH4 emission caused by heat advection from increasing precipitation, the impacts of which require greater attention in arctic climate change studies.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data from the Galileo and Cassini-Huygens missions are consistent with the presence of aqueous subsurface oceans in Ganymede, Callisto and Titan, the largest icy satellites of the solar system. To understand the history and present state of these moons, the next generation of evolution models will require an accurate description of the properties of these liquid layers to predict the phase boundaries, heat transports and chemical exchanges within them.\nSound speed measurements in pressure and temperature allow for the reconstruction of the Gibbs free energy surface of a phase, which in turn gives access to the desired properties (chemical potential, density, heat capacity...). However, such data are still scarce for aqueous solutions bearing Na+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42- ions (major ions expected in extra-terrestrial oceans) at the high pressures and low temperatures expected for water inside these moons (up to 1.5 GPa for Ganymede, down to freezing temperatures). For pure water, IAPWS accuracy for sound speeds is given to 0.3% above 0.4 GPa. MgSO4aqueous solutions have been explored to 0.7 GPa with a precision limited to about 0.5%. Most other aqueous solutions bearing any combination of these four ions have not been explored at all above a few hundreds MPa.\nTo acquire new high-precision sound speeds in aqueous solutions of various compositions, we set up a new experimental system working in the 0 – 0.7 GPa pressure range and 240 – 350 K temperature range. The device consists in an oil-pressurized steel vessel enclosing a titanium alloy rod supporting the sample and a sealing bellows. A transducer at the top end of the titanium rod generates ultrasonic waves and collects the series of subsequent reflections. Preliminary tests with pure water illustrate a precision of 0.02% and an accuracy within 0.1% of IAPWS on our whole pressure range.\nRevision of the properties of pure water and H2O-MgSO4 solutions up to 0.7 GPa along with the first data in the H2O-MgCl2 above 0.1 GPa will be presented, and their implications for the internal structure or large icy moons discussed.",

The Niger Inland Delta (NID) is the single most important wetland conditioning the water availability downstream. A significant fraction of the river flow is lost through evaporation and water use in the NID and the conditions are likely to change with increasing population and changing inflow conditions.\nA comprehensive understanding of the NID’s hydro-climatological functioning is therefore crucial for assessing the water resources in the basin under changing conditions in the future.\nDespite this significance, the components of the water balance in the NID are poorly quantified.\nWe use optical and microwave remote sensing data to characterize the temporal flooding, and observations of river flow and spatially explicit information on water abstractions to develop NIDWat, a water balance model for the NID. Simulated evapotranspiration losses varied by ~ 50%, depending on flooded area map or climatic data. The combined effect of irrigation abstraction and climatic data generated a global water losses range of 16 to 33.04 km3 a-1.\nThe model was validated against observed river discharge and water abstractions and shows a good performance. We then implemented the model as a module in a hydrological model to assess the water balance in the NID and the downstream water availability under changing conditions. We use a multi model approach using regional climate data from the CORDEX initiative. Results suggest, despite increasing runoff an increase in ET losses and changes in the temporal dynamics of flooding that impact water resources availability downstream.",

            "abstract": "One question that has received little attention in the literature on wood in rivers is the degree to which the pattern and architecture of woody debris accumulations reflect the hydrologic regime of those rivers. In this study we focus on how patterns of woody debris in mountain streams reflect the underlying flow regime by comparing wood loading, piece orientation, location, and jam architecture in spring- and runoff dominated streams with similar bioclimatic settings in the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest. A key aspect of spring-dominated streams is that flows are near constant and vary by less than a factor of 2 over the course of the year, rarely exceeding bankfull. In contrast, flow in highly variable runoff-dominated streams can vary by as much as two orders of magnitude. To compare wood accumulations in these two stream types, we took over 40 measurements for each piece of wood along four reaches in streams of similar size but different hydrologic regime.\nDifferences in woody debris are so great that characteristics of woody debris can actually be a useful field indicator of overall flow regime. Wood in stable, spring-fed streams is largely immobile (83%), found as a single piece (67%) or as part of an open-fabric log jam (33%), and is near perpendicular to channel, indicating little movement since emplacement. In a real sense, wood becomes part of the channel and represents the dominant structural feature in these channels, accounting for a large fraction of total flow resistance and form drag. In contrast, the majority of wood in runoff-dominated streams is mobile (83%), has stripped bark (86%), occurs in densely-packed log jams (84%), and is found parallel or sub-parallel to the channel, all indicators of frequent fluvial transport. In these systems, wood moves through the channel quickly and is a much smaller component of total resistance.\nWe conclude that wood patterning and mobility do reflect the degree of flow variability in a stream, and that differences in flow-dictated wood architecture control channel stability and key channel structures. Understanding how flow regimes control wood accumulations and patterns is therefore fundamental to properly interpreting the geomorphic and ecologic role of wood in streams.",

Various researches are still undergoing not only for their profound academic significance but also for their hazardous impact potential to seafloor infrastructures and coastal areas. In order to investigate the morphology and cause of landslides along the western margin of the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea, we collected multiple geophysical datasets in the summer of 2015, including sparker, subbottom profiler, and multibeam echosounder. The preliminary analysis of the bathymetric data shows a number of U-shaped scarps that occur on a rather steep slope (up to 10°) in water depths of ~600 m. The scarps cover an area of ~100 km2 and have reliefs of up to 50 m. Seismic data clearly image erosional headwalls and the basal gliding plane which is characterized by a prominent high-amplitude reflector. Chaotic- to transparent-seismic facies, located immediately downslope of the headwall scarps, represent landslide deposits of about 20 m in thickness. At the base of slope, the slides form lens-shaped transparent bodies, resting on well-stratified turbidite deposits. Several V-shaped seafloor depressions near the head of these scarps are seen on the subbottom profiles. These depressions, which are ~5 m deep and ~150 m wide, are interpreted to be representing pockmarks, resulted from upward migration of gas in the sediment layers beneath. The presence of these pockmarks directly above the scars may suggest that the gases and/or gas fluids might be playing an important role for destabilizing slope sediments. Furthermore, subbottom profiles suggest the presence of numerous faults in close vicinity of headwall scarps; some are extending to the seafloor suggesting their recent activity. Earthquakes associated with tectonic activity are indicated to be the cause of these faults. Thus the fault-related earthquakes might be the final triggering mechanism of the landslides along the slopes.",

            "abstract": "The eastern margin of the Asian continent is a well-known subduction zone, where the Pacific (PAC) and Philippine Sea (PHS) plates are being subducted. In this region, several island arcs (Kuril, Northeast Japan, Southwest Japan, Izu-Bonin and Ryukyu arcs) meet one another to form a very complicated tectonic environment. At 2014, we started to construct fundamental structure models for island arcs and subducted plates in and around Japan. Our research is composed of 6 items of (1) topography, (2) plate geometry, (3) fault models, (4) the Moho and brittle-ductile transition zone, (5) the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, and (6) petrological/rheological models. Such information is basic but inevitably important in qualitative understanding not only for short-term crustal activities in the subduction zone (particularly caused by megathrust earthquakes) but also for long-term cumulative deformation of the arcs as a result of strong plate-arc/arc-arc interactions.\nThis paper is the first presentation of our research, mainly presenting the results of items (1) and (2). The area of our modelling is 12o-54o N and 118o-164o E to cover almost the entire part of Japanese Islands together with Kuril, Ryukyu and Izu-Bonin trenches. The topography model was constructed from the 500-m mesh data provided from GSJ, JODC, GINA and Alaska University. Plate geometry models are being constructed through the two steps. In the first step, we modelled very smooth plate boundaries of the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates in our whole model area using 42,000 earthquake data from JMA, USGS and ISC. For 7,800 cross sections taken with several directions to the trench axes, 2D plate boundaries were defined by fitting to the earthquake distribution (the Wadati-Benioff zone), from which we obtained equi-depth points of the plate boundary. These equi-depth points were then approximated by spline interpolation technique to eliminate shorter wave length undulation (<50-100 km). The obtained models represent the plate geometry with longer wave lengths (>75-150 km), but provide a rather clear undulation of the PHS plate under the SW Japan arc. In the second step, finer scale plate configuration is being constrained especially in the vicinity of Japan by recent results from seismic tomography, RF analysis and active source experiment.",

We investigated the effect of faunally-induced crack morphology on soil carbon dynamics in three dryland soil systems in central Kenya: bioturbated soils, biocompacted soils, and undisturbed soils. Carbon fluxes were characterized using a closed-system respiration chamber, with CO2 concentration differences measured using an infrared gas analyzer. Results show that faunal influenes play a divergent biomechanical role in bulk soil cracking morphology and topology: macrofauna-induced bioturbation creates shallow, large, well-connected networks relative to those from megaherbivore-induced biocompaction, with the latter showing a \"memory\" of past drying events through a crack layering effect. These morphologies may further drive differences in soil carbon flux: under dry conditions, bioturbated and control soils show a persistently high and low mean carbon flux, respectively - biocompacted soils suggest a diurnal trend, with daytime lows and nighttime highs comparable to the control and bioturbated soils, respectively. Overall fluxes under wet conditions are considerably higher, but also more variable, though higher mean carbon fluxes are observed in the biocompacted and bioturbated soils. Our results suggest that fracture morphology induced in biocompacted soils may enhance diffusive fluxes that are typical in undisturbed soils to levels that are as high as those from macrofaunal respiration, but that particular physical conditions in fracture morphology and topology may be necessary as a prerequisite.",

            "abstract": "Electric power utilities are increasingly cognizant of the risks water scarcity and rising temperatures pose for generators that use water as a \"fuel\" (i.e., hydroelectric dams) and generators that use water for cooling (i.e., coal, natural gas and nuclear). At the same time, utilities are under increasing market and policy pressure to retire coal-fired generation, the primary source of carbon emissions in the electric power sector. Due to falling costs of renewables and low natural gas prices, retiring coal fired generation is mostly being replaced with combined cycle natural gas, wind and solar. An immediate benefit of this shift has been a reduction in water withdrawals per megawatt-hour and reduced thermal impacts in surface water systems. In the process of retiring older coal-fired power plants, many of which use water intensive open-loop cooling systems, utilities are making their systems less vulnerable to water scarcity and higher water temperatures. However, it is not clear whether financial risks from water scarcity will decrease as result of this change. In particular, the choice to replace coal with natural gas combined cycle plants leaves utilities financially exposed to natural gas prices, especially during droughts when natural gas generation is used to replace lost hydropower production. Utility-scale solar, while more expensive than natural gas combined cycle generation, gives utilities an opportunity to simultaneously reduce their exposure to water scarcity and fuel price risk. In this study, we assess how switching from coal to natural gas and solar changes a utility’s financial exposure to drought. We model impacts on retail prices and a utility’s rate of return under current conditions and non-stationarity in natural gas prices and temperature and streamflows to determine whether increased exposure to natural gas prices offsets corresponding gains in water use efficiency. We also evaluate whether utility scale solar is an effective hedge against the combined effects of drought and natural gas price volatility—one that increases costs on average but reduces exposure to large drought-related losses.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), radionuclides produced either by cosmic-ray interactions or by nucleogenic means can be measured. Typical isotopic abundance ratios range from 1 x 10-10 to 1 x 10-15. The routinely measured radionuclides are 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I. Be-10, 26Al, and 36Cl have isobaric interferences that cannot be eliminated mass through mass analysis, but dE/dx techniques suppresses these isobars enough to allow successful measurements. There are compromises, the isobar for 26Al, 26Mg, precludes successful measurement of 26Al if AlO- is injected into the accelerator. Mg- doesn’t form a stable negative ion so a 26Al measurement requires injection of 26Al-. But the Al‑ ion is formed inefficiently; secondary ion currents using Al- are ~ 10 times less than an AlO- secondary ion beam. Precision scales with count rate so precise measurement of the 26Al/Al for all but higher ratio samples is difficult. It has long been recognized that a gas-filled-magnet (GFM) could potentially improve the measurement of those radionuclides with intractable isobar interferences. A GFM works on the principle that each element of an isobar pair, e.g. 26Mg and 26Al, has a different average charge state as it traverses a gas (3-4 Torr of N2) contained within the vacuum jacket of a magnet. The magnet steers each species with its own momentum-to-charge ratio on its own distinct radius of curvature. The magnet can be tuned to allow the isotope of interest into a dE/dx detector; most of the isobar doesn’t make it into the detector. Using the PRIME Lab GFM we are now able to routinely run 26Al with a precision that is comparable to that obtained with 10Be. We are also using the GFM for routine measurements of 10Be and 36Cl. Although the improvement for these nuclides is not as pronounced as it is for 26Al, the GFM has improved the detection sensitivity for both. Our 10Be background is now ~ 5 x 10-16 and for 36Cl we can now run the source more efficiently since we reject 36Cl. In addition to improving 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl measurements the GFM may allow the measurement of radionuclides not traditionally measured, most notably 53Mn.",

            "abstract": "The earliest preserved crust formed in a tectonic regime that different from present in several significant ways. Earth was still losing a significant fraction of its primordial heat, and heat production was declining more rapidly than in any period subsequently. Additionally, a waning impact flux provided an important thermal – and mechanical – forcing on the early Earth. These factors affect tectonics in a number of ways – internal velocities are faster, and internal viscosities lower due to hotter internal temperatures. Previous modelling of the tectonic evolution of the Earth under these conditions suggests that the early Earth may have exhibited periods of hot stagnant-lid convection – where vigorous internal convection – and volcanic activity – occurred under a tectonically quiescent lid. As the Earth cooled the planet would have transited into an episodic regime – characterised by periods of tectonic quiescence interspersed by extreme tectonic activity. Such scenarios explain a number of facets of the early Earth, including its observed slow mixing rates, inefficient cooling, and its paleomagnetic and tectonic history. Here we expand these models to incorporate the effects of major impacts. We find tectonic forcing due to impacts to be a major dynamic driver during the Hadean, with major return flow driving horizontal surface deformation, and transient subduction events. Such events may be reflected in the Hadean zircon record. Post this impact-dominated phase, models suggest an over-heated Earth may have then experienced a long phase of stagnant-lid convection, lasting till the meso-Archaean.",

            "abstract": "The upper ocean heat content has been observed to be increasing over the past few decades much of which has been attributed to anthropogenic effects resulting in an increase in greenhouse gases thereby increasing the amounts of incoming longwave (LWin) radiation impinging onto the ocean’s surface. However, the penetration depth of LWin extends to micrometer scales, where the ocean's thermal skin layer (TSL) exists, and does not directly heat the upper few meters of the ocean thereby raising the conundrum of how does the upper ocean warm with increasing levels of infrared (IR) radiation. The TSL consists of a strong temperature gradient on the aqueous side of the interface that sustains the upward heat flux by molecular conduction. As such, we hypothesize the heat lost through the air-sea interface which is controlled by the TSL, modulates the amount of heat stored in the upper few meters of the ocean. An analysis of properties of the retrieved TSL profiles from a shipboard IR spectrometer with heat fluxes (specifically LWin) and wind speeds from two cruises limited to night-time data are presented. We also show a comparison between these properties with current published viscous layer models. The results indicate that the data have an inherent wind speed dependence with net flux thereby requiring a segregation of the data into wind speed bins to acknowledge the effects of wind-driven shear in the analysis. The temperature differences derived from the models indicates that at low wind speeds (<2 m/s), where wind-driven shear effects are negligible and buoyancy effects dominate, the TSL profile’s gradient is decreasing with increased LWin which leads to a lowered net heat flux and is in agreement with our hypothesis. However our field results show an opposite effect (higher gradient at higher LWin) which is believed to be due to the formation of a thicker TSL at low winds. The presence of a thicker TSL suggests that more of the vertical temperature gradient lies below the depth of the deepest retrieved temperature, limited by the IR emission depth of <0.1 mm.",

Residual saturation is also a key parameter in oil and gas production when a field is under consideration for enhanced oil recovery. Tracers are an important tool that can be used to estimate saturation in field tests.\nA series of measurements of CO2 saturation in an aquifer were undertaken as part of the Otway stage 2B extension field project in Dec. 2014. These tests were a repeat of similar tests in the same well in 2011 with improvements to the data collection and handling method. Two single-well tracer tests using noble gas tracers were conducted. In the first test krypton and xenon are injected into the water-saturated formation to establish dispersivity of the tracers in single-phase flow. Near-residual CO2 saturation is then established near the well. In the second test krypton and xenon are injected with CO2-saturated water to measure the final CO2 saturation. The recovery rate of the tracers is similar to predicted rates using recently published partitioning coefficients.\nDue to technical difficulties, there was mobile CO2 in the reservoir throughout the second tracer test in 2014. As a consequence, it is necessary to use a variation of the previous simulation procedure to interpret the second tracer test. One-dimensional, radial simulations are used to estimate average saturation of CO2 near the well.\nEstimates of final average CO2 saturation are computed using two relative permeability models, thermal and isothermal simulations, and three sets of coefficients for the partitioning of the tracers between phases. Four of the partitioning coefficients used were not previously available in the literature.\nThe noble gas tracer field test and analysis of the 2011 and 2014 data both give an average CO2 saturation that is consistent with other field measurements. This study has demonstrated the repeatability of the methodology for noble gas tracer tests in the field.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is warming much more rapidly than the lower latitudes. In contrast to the rapid Arctic warming, in winters of the recent decade, the cold-air outbreaks over East Asia occur more frequently and stronger than in 1990s. By accompanying the snow over East Asia, the strong cold surges have led to a severe socio-economic impact. Such severe cold surges in recent decade over east Asia is consistent with the more dominant negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), that may be attributed by the Arctic amplification. In both observation-based reanalysis and numerical model experiments, the Arctic sea ice melting leads to the weakening of the AO polarity by reducing the meridional temperature gradient through a heat flux feedback. The Arctic warming and associated sea ice melting over the Kara-Barents area in late fall and early winter first release a lot of heat to the atmosphere from the ocean by a strong contrast in temperature and moisture and higher height anomaly is developed over the Kara/Barents and the Ural mountains The anomalous anticyclonic anomaly over the Arctic strengthen the Siberian High and at the same time the east Asian trough is developed over the western coast of the North Pacific. Through the passage between the margin of the Siberian High and east Asian tough, an extremely cold air is transported from east Siberia to east Asia for sometimes more than a week. Such a severe sold air brings about the moisture from nearby ocean, largely influencing the daily lives and economy in north East China, Korea, and Japan. The recent Arctic and associated sea ice melting is not only contributed to the local climate and weather, but also a severe weather in mid-latitudes through a modulation in polar vortex.",

            "abstract": "Dryland closed basin lake systems are ideal natural laboratories for model-proxy evaluations of how climate change alters the regional water balance. We use an existing water balance and lake-evaporation model of the Walker Lake Basin, a 1600-year reconstruction of Walker Lake shoreline elevations, and fields from the 20th Century Reanalysis to provide the following insights: 1) The three major historical (post-Little Ice Age) droughts observed in the California-western Nevada region (the 1930s, 1987-1992, and 2012-2015) are comparable in magnitude to the severe droughts of the Medieval Climate Anomaly but not in duration; 2) The atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with these events include poleward deflections of storm tracks and reduced moisture transport into the region; 3) To produce the Medieval lowstands of Walker Lake, precipitation and circulation anomalies comparable to historical droughts must persist for a minimum of 50 years. These insights show how severe historical and ongoing droughts in this region are within the range of natural variability. The 2012-2015 drought is also shown to be exacerbated by recent positive temperature anomalies that may be outside of the range of natural variability. These results can help to improve future water resource planning for the western United States, where ongoing and future changes in climate leading to increased water scarcity will have significant negative impacts on socioeconomic and ecological systems.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation productivity is increasingly being impacted upon by climate change/variability and anthropogenic activities, especially in developing countries, where many livelihoods depend on the natural resource base. Despite these impacts, the individual and combined roles of climate and anthropogenic factors on vegetation dynamics have rarely been quantified in many ecosystems and regions of the world. This paper analyzes recent trend in vegetation productivity across Africa and quantified the relative roles of climate change/variability and human activities in driving this trend over 2000-2014 using net primary productivity (NPP) as an indicator. The relative roles of these factors to vegetation productivity change were quantified by comparing the trend slope (p<0.1) and total change in interannual actual NPP (NPPA), potential NPP (NPPP), and human appropriated NPP (NPPH). NPP significantly increased across Africa relative to NPP decline, though the extent of NPP decline is also quite appreciable. Whereas estimated NPP declined by 207 Tg C over 140 X 104 km of land area, vegetation productivity was estimated to improve by 1415 Tg C over 786 X 104 km of land area. NPP improvement is largely concentrated in equatorial and northern hemispheric Africa, while subequatorial Africa exhibited the most NPP decline. Generally, anthropogenic activities dominated climate change/variability in improving or degrading vegetation productivity. Of the estimated total NPP gained over the study period, 32.6, 8.8, and 58.6 % were due to individual human, climate and combined impacts respectively. The contributions of the factors to NPP decline in the same order are: 50.7, 16.0 and 33.3 %. The Central Africa region is where human activities had the greatest impact on NPP improvement; whereas the Sahel and the coastlines of west northern Africa are areas associated with the greatest influence of climate-driven NPP gain. Areas with humans dominating NPP degradation include eastern Angola, western Zambia, and Liberia; whereas climate-driven NPP loss is pronounced in Zambia and Mozambique. Results from this study indicate that, compared to climate change/variability, contemporary anthropogenic activities are contributing more to the decline of Africa’s vegetation productivity than to vegetation improvement.",

Those soils with high concentration of Cd and Hg originated alluvial material and terrigenous clastic rocks need to be continuously monitored before determining a cost-effective remediation technology.\nKeywords: Heavy metals; Ecological risk;Parent materials of soil;China",

            "abstract": "Subtropical marine low stratiform clouds (LSCs), which are quite important for the earth's climate in terms of cloud radiative effect, simulated in AMIP experiments by COSP ISCCP simulators implemented in nine CMIP5 models are evaluated by comparing with ISCCP observational data. In regions with large amounts of higher level clouds, low clouds observed from satellites can be obscured by them, especially by using passive sensors like ISCCP; however, high cloud amounts are climatologically small in the subtropical regions, corresponding to the descending branches of the Hadley circulation. Although middle cloud amounts are smaller in lower latitudes, they are relatively large in the eastern subtropical oceans such as off Peruvian coast. These clouds are not middle but indeed low clouds; this is because of the misdetection due to their cold cloud top temperatures. In addition, optically thick low clouds correspond to LSCs, while thin to shallow cumuliform clouds, generally in the ISCCP classification. Therefore, to facilitate robust evaluation, only ocean areas between 40N and 40S where climatological high cloud amounts are less than 20% are considered, and middle+low cloud amounts, corrected with the random-overlap assumption, with optical thickness >9.4 are defined as \"the LSC amount\" in this study. From these definitions, five LSC regions (Californian, Canarian, Peruvian, Namibian, and Australian) are detected in the ISCCP observations. We also derived the LSC amounts from the ISCCP simulator outputs of each CMIP5 model. CCSM4, HadGEM2-A, and MRI-CGCM3 are relatively well simulated, whereas IPSL-CM5B-LR and bcc-csm1-1-m produce similar patterns but with greater LSC amounts. CanAM4 and MPI-ESM-LR show noisy spatial distributions. The LSC amounts in CNRM-CM5 and MIROC5 are much less; they are smaller in regions closer to land. Comparing with the satellite observations and reanalysis data, the relationships with meteorological processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The paleoposition of South China during the Ediacaran–Silurian is important for understanding the assembly of Gondwana. We report here the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Ediacaran–Silurian Nanhua foreland basin in South China, and discuss South China's connection with Gondwana and potential tectonic triggers for both the Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny in South China and the Bhimphedian orogeny in north India. The Nanhua basin was involved in a three-stage evolution, which are: Stage 1 (the Ediacaran–Cambrian) recording the start of tectonic subsidence with turbiditic marine clastic deposition, fed by exotic orogens outboard South China; Stage 2 (the Ordovician to earliest-Silurian) featured by migrating depocentres with dominant shallow marine to deltaic clastic deposition, fed by the local Wuyi–Yunkai orogen; and Stage 3 (the Silurian) showing the arrival of depocentre in the Yangtze Block during the waning stage of the Wuyi-Yunkai orogeny with deltaic deposition in the remanent foreland basin.\nDetrital zircon analyses of the Ediacaran–Silurian sandstones across the Nanhua basin reveal a prominent age population of 1100–900 Ma (with a peak age at ~980 Ma) and moderate populations of Archean–Paleozoic ages, grossly matching that of crystalline and sedimentary rocks in northern India. Zircon isotopes of the Stage 1 samples suggest three Precambrian episodes of juvenile crustal growth at 3.0 Ga, 2.5 Ga and 1.0 Ga, and a major crustal reworking at 580–500 Ma for the source areas, which are constraint to be northwestern India and its surrounding orogens. Together with other evidence, we propose that South China likely collided with northwestern India during the Gondwana assembly, generated the Bhimphedian orogeny in north India and formed two foreland basins on both the north India and South China sides. Far-field stress of the collision triggered the Ordovician–Silurian Wuyi–Yunkai orogeny in South China. The Stage 2–3 samples in the Nanhua basin of South China were shed from the both locally recycled Ediacaran–Cambrian rocks and eroded Cathaysian basement within South China. The Wuyi–Yunkai late-orogenic magmatic rocks also contributed to the Stage 3 sediments in the Nanhua basin.",

            "abstract": "At nowadays, the severe greenhouse effect causes rapid sea level rise around the Korea Peninsula. Paleo-climate researches have been concentrating on hydrological activities during the mid-Holocene optimum and the last interglacial period to use the paleo-analogues data in predicting the future hydrological environments. The previous studies on the late Pleistocene interstadial coastal sediments have primarily been biased towards the terraces of the east coast in the Korean Peninsula. According to the results, the last interglacial marine terraces of the east coast were existed at 18 m in elevation. Uplift rate of them was presumed to be 0.1mm/year (Choi, 2006). Also, the stratigraphy of the Quaternary coastal deposits of the Yellow Sea has been suggested by Park et al. (1998) and Lim et al. (2003). In recent, Jang et al. (2014) reported the OSL dated Eemian marine deposit along the southwest coast of Korea. However, the age-equivalent outcrops of the south coast are not discovered yet.\nThe first outcrops of the late Pleistocene interstadial coastal sediment above the present sea level were discovered at IJin-ri site of Haenam, south coast of Korea. It would be very useful for calculating the rates of Eemian sea level rise and uplift of south coast of Korea. 62 cubic samples were collected at 6 cm intervals from the section (4.8-8.83m in elevation). Four sedimentary units, from Unit 1 to 4 in ascending order, are distinguished based on sedimentary textures and grain size distribution as follows: Unit 1 (sand, 4.8 m-5.32 m in elevation), Unit 2 (silty clay, 5.32 m-6.8 m in elevation), Unit 3 (gravelly sand, 6.8m-7.8m in elevation) and, Unit 4(sandy gravel, 7.8m-8.83m in elevation). The sediments which included rounded or semi-rounded gravels are thought to be transported from marine. Also, the assemblages of clay minerals from the sections are similar to those of Yellow Sea. It shows the possibility that the sediments originated from marine during high sea level stage of Eemian and/or storm surge.",

Of course with increasing watershed scale come corresponding increases in watershed complexity, including wide ranging water management infrastructure and objectives, and ever increasing demands for forcing data. Simulations of large watersheds using grid-based models apply a fixed resolution over the entire watershed. In large watersheds, this means an enormous number of grids, or coarsening of the grid resolution to reduce memory requirements. One alternative to grid-based methods is the triangular irregular network (TIN) approach. TINs provide the flexibility of variable resolution, which allows optimization of computational resources by providing high resolution where necessary and low resolution elsewhere. TINs also increase required effort in model setup, parameter estimation, and coupling with forcing data which are often gridded. This presentation discusses the costs and benefits of the use of TINs compared to grid-based methods, in the context of large watershed simulations within the traditional gridded WRF-HYDRO framework and the new TIN-based ADHydro high performance computing watershed simulator.",

An ensemble of five hydrological models, comprising of one distributed physically based and four lumped conceptual hydrological models, developed using weighted average method was chosen as the best-performing ensemble, based on categorical and temporal assessment of several ensembles developed using eight hydrological models and eight ensemble methods. The member models of the chosen ensemble were then used to simulate the river discharge over 2006 – 2050, using the projected climatic data of two regional climate models (RegCM4 and HadGEM3) under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The trend analysis of the ensemble discharge using Mann Kendall test shows that monthly peak discharge and mean monthly discharge are increasing in the first and last months of the monsoon season (June and September) and decreasing in the middle two months (July and August) in case of RCP 4.5. In case of RCP 8.5, however, the monthly peak discharge and mean monthly discharge show a decreasing trend in the starting two months (June - July) and an increasing trend in the last two months. The analysis of monthly proportion of annual yield shows that there is a persistent decrease in the percent yield after monsoon to the next monsoon in case of RCP 4.5, though the condition is less serious in case of RCP 8.5 due to alternate increasing and decreasing trend in various months. The annual yield, however, is found to be decreasing and increasing in case of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively. We further quantified the rate of change using Sen’s slope method followed by analysis of temporal change in dependable flow at different levels under both the emission scenarios, and found that dependable flow is increasing with atmospheric CO2 concentration level at almost all times of exceedance.",

The predictive skill for winter mean temperature in China is estimated by evaluating statistical cross-validated hindcasts made using simple linear regression models with four summer-autumn variables, including October-November Eurasian snow cover, July-August-September North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), September Arctic sea ice and September 100-hPa geopotential height, which significantly influence the following Northern Hemisphere winter atmospheric circulation. Maximum covariance analyses are first performed between each anomaly field of these variables and the 600-station winter mean temperature in China during the period of 1979-2012, and indices are then built based on key areas where these variables have significant impacts on winter temperature in China. Standard linear regression models to predict mean winter temperature at individual stations are built using one or all four predictor indices. Hindcasts using a single predictor show noticeable skill over most areas, but using all predictors almost all stations except in the Tibetan Plateau area show significant skill. The anomaly correlation coefficient ranges from 0.55 to 0.70, and this method outperforms a climatological hindcast by up to 30-50% over most stations of eastern China. Results here suggest that it is important to incorporate cryosphere variability in seasonal prediction systems.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of the frictional behavior of fault gouges in order to predict a wide range of natural phenomena, including earthquakes, steady creep, afterslip, or transient slow slip events, depends critically on laboratory shearing experiments. Here we report that in friction experiments on simulated fault gauges, an increase in sliding velocity can induce a change from steady-state frictional strength or slip hardening, to slip-weakening behavior. Here we explicitly consider slip-weakening or hardening trends in laboratory friction experiments. We use a mixture of silt-sized quartz and commercially obtained clay-rich sediment as an analogue fault gouge. Experiments are conducted in a single-direct shear apparatus under normal stress of 2 MPa, with total shear displacements of up to ~16 mm. We evaluate both the velocity- and slip-dependence of friction by extracting the velocity-dependent friction parameters a, b, and Dc, and measuring the rate of change in friction coefficient with shear displacement as the slip-dependence of friction. Our results show that the slip weakening is dominantly observed during our experiments. This suggests a large total difference in strengths can result from a change slip velocities due to the combination of velocity- and slip-dependence of friction. On natural tectonic faults, this suggests that a slip hardening fault area at low slip rates will tend to change into a slip weakening area with a velocity perturbation, such as coseismic rupture propagating onto a fault patch. Therefore, it may be possible that a fault which is experiencing a transient slip, or stable sliding may be more easily induced to slip coseismically if dynamic rupture from large earthquake propagated to the fault.",

            "abstract": "Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are brackish coastal water bodies with an intermittent connection to the ocean that is closed periodically due to the accumulation of marine sediment forming an entrance berm. ICOLLs have dynamic coastal systems that may be vulnerable to minor changes in catchment hydrology. However, little is known regarding the impacts of groundwater on the hydrological cycles of ICOLLs. The relative contribution of rainfall versus groundwater discharge in two ICOLLs (Welsby, and Mermaid Lagoon) and a nearby wetland (South Welsby Lagoon) located on Bribie Island (Australia) were investigated using radon (222Rn) as natural geochemical groundwater tracer. Four seasonal surveys were undertaken to quantify the temporal and spatial groundwater dynamics of the ICOLLs. Radon contour maps revealed temporal and spatial changes over the study period. The estimated groundwater discharge rates from a radon-mass balance were 3.4±3.1, 7.3±9.8 and 2.6±3.8 cm d-1 in Weslby, South Weslby and Mermaid Lagoons, respectively. These values are at least 8-fold greater than rainfall (1420 mm per year, or 0.4 cm d-1). Assuming very minor surface water flows (not perceived during field surveys), this demonstrates that these systems are groundwater-dominated and their hydrology can be influenced by regional changes in groundwater level.",

            "abstract": "Drought is an extreme natural hazard and becomes a severe problem in the world. It arises as a result of interactions between climate input and human activity, displaying the nonlinearity and complexity. Nonlinear time series analyses open a way to study the underlying dynamic characteristics of drought, and then provide the forward knowledge to understanding the physical mechanism of drought event. The rationale behind this idea is that information about the representation of nonlinear properties could be used as an additional quality indicator. To that end, the correlation dimension method, a powerful nonlinear time series analysis method based on the chaos theory, has been suggested to assess the intrinsic dimensionality or degree of freedom of time series according to Takens (1981). It can provide an assessment of the dominant processes that is required to map the observed dynamics. In this study, daily discharge and hourly groundwater level data of 63 catchments in Germany and China were investigated with correlation dimension method. The results indicated that the correlation dimension values of studied discharge exhibited none clear spatial patterns, but showed significant correlations with the spatial heterogeneity within the catchments. In contrast, the correlation dimension values of groundwater level displayed spatial patterns due to the different aquifer conditions (confined or unconfined). High correlation dimension values indicate partly confined conditions. In addition, Hurst analysis was involved to qualify the persistence of drought. It seems that drought mechanisms can be learnt from the data themselves in an inverse manner.",

            "abstract": "Half of the world's population depends on rice for survival. Rice agriculture thus plays an important role in the developing world’s economy. Vietnam is one of the largest rice producers and suppliers on earth and more than 80% of the exported rice was produced from the Mekong Delta region, which is situated in the southwestern Vietnam and encompasses approximately 40,000 km2. Changes in climate conditions could likely trigger the increase of insect populations and rice diseases, causing the potential loss of rice yields. Monitoring rice-farming activities through crop phenology detection can provide policymakers with timely strategies to mitigate possible impacts on the potential yield as well as rice grain exports to ensure food security for the region. The main objective of this study is to develop a logistic-based algorithm to investigate rice sowing and harvesting activities from the multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)–Landsat fusion data. We processed the data for two main cropping seasons (i.e., winter–spring and summer–autumn seasons) through a three-step procedure: (1) MODIS–Landsat data fusion, (2) construction of the time-series enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) data, (3) rice crop phenology detection. The EVI2 data derived from the fusion results between MODIS and Landsat data were compared with that of Landsat data indicated close correlation between the two datasets (R2 = 0.93). The time-series EVI2 data were processed using the double logistic method to detect the progress of sowing and harvesting activities in the region. The comparisons between the estimated sowing and harvesting dates and the field survey data revealed the root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 8.4 and 5.5 days for the winter–spring crop and 9.4 and 12.8 days for the summer–autumn crop, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the double logistic-based algorithm for rice crop monitoring from temporal MODIS−Landsat fusion data. The results in forms of spatialtemporal and quantitative information of rice sowing and harvesting activities were vital for crop management, and the methods are thus suggested for rice crop monitoring in the study region and could be transferable to other regions for crop monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Chinese Chang’e 5 (CE-5) lunar sample return mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 to bring back surface regolith and drill samples from the northeastern Oceanus Procellarum region on the Moon. The Lunar Mineralogical Spectrometer (LMS) on the CE-5 lander is a VIS/IR imaging spectrometer (0.48 μm -3.2 μm) designed to analyze the mineralogical composition of the sample return site. LMS employs acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) and is composed of a VIS/NIR module (0.48 μm -1.450 μm) and an IR module (1.4 μm -3.2 μm). It has spectral resolution in the range of 5-25 nm, with a field of view (FOV) of 3°×3°. An aluminum plate and an Infragold plate are used as calibration targets in the VIS/NIR and IR spectral range, respectively. Before launch, a ground verification test of LMS needs to be conducted in order to: 1) test and verify the performance of LMS through evaluation of the quality of image and spectral data collected with simulated lunar samples in the lab; and 2) calculate calibration parameters for calibration on the Moon through simulation of instrument calibration on the ground. The ground verification test will be conducted both indoors (for NIR to medium wavelength IR) and outdoors (for VIS to short wavelength IR). The indoor test will be conducted under condition of <60% relative moisture content, to reduce the effect of water vapor absorption near 2.7 μm. The spectra of simulated lunar regolith/mineral samples in the 2.5 μm -3.2 μm range will be collected simultaneously by the LMS and a calibrated FT-IR spectrometer (Model 102F). The outdoor test will be conducted with solar incidence angle >75° and relative moisture content <60%. The spectra of simulated lunar regolith samples in the 0.48 μm -2.5 μm range will be collected simultaneously by the LMS and a calibrated VIS/IR spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res). In this paper we report the results of the LMS ground verification test regarding the evaluation of LMS spectral and image data quality, mineral identification and inversion ability, and calibration accuracy and geometric positioning accuracy.",

            "abstract": "A tailings storage facility (TSF) is a fundamental part of the mining process and should be carefully designed and managed to prevent any adverse environmental effects. TSF is site-specific and its design criteria are determined by regulations. The new mine waste regulation for the deposition of hazardous waste in a tailings storage facility in Turkey enforces, from bottom to top, 0.5 m thick compacted clay layer with K less than or equal to 1X10-9 m/s , 2 mm thick HDPE geomembrane, and a protective natural material or geotextile. Although these criteria seem to be enough to prevent leakage from the base, in practice, manufacturing and application errors may cause leakage and subsequent contamination of groundwater.\nThe purpose of this study is to assess potential impacts of leakage from the base of TSF on groundwater quality both in operational and post-closure period of a mine site in western Turkey. For this purpose, analytical and 2-D and 3-D numerical models are used together. The potential leakage rate of sulphate-bearing solution from the base of TSF is determined from analytical model. 2-D finite element models (SEEP/W and CTRAN/W) are used to simulate unsaturated flow conditions and advective-dispersive contaminant transport below the TSF under steady-state and transient conditions for the operating period. The long-term impacts of leakage from the base of TSF on groundwater resources are evaluated by 3-D numerical groundwater flow (MODFLOW) and contaminant transport models (MT3DMS). The model results suggest that sulphate-bearing solution leaking from the base of TSF can reach water table in about 290 years. Hence, during the operational period (i.e. 21 years), no interaction is expected between the solution and groundwater. Moreover, long-term simulation results show that about 500 years later, the sulphate concentration in groundwater will be below the maximum allowable limits (i.e. 250 mg/L).",

Therefore, the detailed information of structures of buried gas hydrates and their concentrations are prerequisite for the production for the gas hydrate as a reliable source of alternate energy. Recently, for this reason, a lot of gas hydrate assessment methods have been proposed by many researchers. However, it is still necessary to establish as new method for the further improvement of the accuracy of the 3D gas hydrate distribution. In this study, we present a 3D joint inversion method that provides superior quantitative information of gas hydrate distributions using 3D seismic data obtained by ocean-bottom cable (OBC) and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. To verify our inversion method, we first built the general 3D gas hydrate model containing vertical methane-flow pathways. With the described model, we generated synthetic 3D OBC data and marine CSEM data using finite element modeling algorithms, respectively. In the joint inversion process, to obtain the high-resolution volumetric P-wave velocity structure, we applied the 3D full waveform inversion algorithm to the acquired OBC data. After that, the obtained P-wave velocity model is used as the structure constraint to compute cross-gradients with the updated resistivity model in the EM inversion process. Finally, petrophysical relations were applied to estimate volumetric gas hydrate concentrations. The proposed joint inversion process makes possible to obtain more precise quantitative gas hydrate assessment than inversion processes using only seismic or EM data. This technique can be helpful for accurate decision-making in gas hydrate development as well as in their production monitoring.",

The results are consistent between the two observations as a whole, but there exists some underestimation with the whole-sky camera compared to the ceilometer.\nOne of the reasons is possibly that the imager is apt to dismiss an optically thinner cloud that can be detected by the ceilometer. On the other hand, the difference of their view angles between the imager and the ceilometer possibly affects the estimation. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the cloud properties with detailed match-up analyses in future. Another future task is to compare the cloud fractions with satellite observation such as MODIS cloud products.\nShipboard observations in themselves are very valuable for the validation of products from satellite observation, because we do not necessarily have many validation sites over ocean in particular.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, scientists have learned how to codify tools into reusable software modules that can be chained into multi-step executable workflows. Existing scientific workflow tools, created by computer scientists, require domain scientists to meticulously design their multi-step experiments before analyzing data. However, this is oftentimes contradictory to a domain scientist’s daily routine of conducting research and exploration. We hope to resolve this dispute. Imagine this: An Earth scientist starts her day applying NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) published climate data processing algorithms over ARGO deep ocean temperature and AMSRE sea surface temperature datasets. Throughout the day, she tunes the algorithm parameters to study various aspects of the data. Suddenly, she notices some interesting results. She then turns to a computer scientist and asks, “can you reproduce my results?” By tracking and reverse engineering her activities, the computer scientist creates a workflow. The Earth scientist can now rerun the workflow to validate her findings, modify the workflow to discover further variations, or publish the workflow to share the knowledge. In this way, we aim to revolutionize computer-supported Earth science.\nWe have developed a prototyping system to realize the aforementioned vision, in the context of service-oriented science. We have studied how Earth scientists conduct service-oriented data analytics research in their daily work, developed a provenance model to record their activities, and developed a technology to automatically generate workflow starting from user behavior and adaptability and reuse of these workflows for replicating/improving scientific studies. A data-centric repository infrastructure is established to catch richer provenance to further facilitate collaboration in the science community. We have also established a Petri nets-based verification instrument for provenance-based automatic workflow generation and recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies based on best track data for tropical cyclones (TCs) over the North Atlantic revealed a strong dependence of the TC intensification rate (IR) on TC intensity. The TC IR shows a maximum (i.e., most rapid intensification) when the TC intensity reaches about 35 - 40 m s-1. Physically, this intensity-dependence has been explained in terms of the inner-core inertial stability and the decreased potential for a TC to intensify as it approaches its maximum potential intensity (MPI). Here, we propose a new simplified dynamical system based on TC energetics. For this purpose, the TC system is considered as a Carnot heat engine as in earlier theoretical studies, and formulated on the grounds of major energy production and dissipation processes. This offers a way to explain the IR behavior of TCs in terms of its sensitivity to the physical processes involved, and to derive a physically-based relationship between TC intensification and intensity. This relationship is consistent with observations, and in quantitative agreement with that gained from empirical relations in an alternative dynamical system proposed by DeMaria(2009), which has been formulated analogously to the logistic growth equation (LGE). Results from idealized full-physics model simulations confirm the validity of several key assumptions implicitly involved in the simplified dynamical system and the intensity-dependence of the TC IR as well.",

Because the deformation mode and strength of porous rocks are dependent on porosity and effective stress, rapid reduction of sediment porosity from 60-70% to less than 5% should strongly affect deformation style in the shallow portion of subduction zones. Here, we present the results of laboratory experimental studies on modern clay-rich sediments subducting at the Nankai Trough and rocks from the exhumed Shimanto accretionary complex near the Nobeoka thrust, which is an ancient out-of-sequence-thrust, to constrain porosity, rock strength and fault rheology in the Nankai subduction zone.\nBased on uniaxial and triaxial experiments on mudstones, combined with seismic velocity data from geophysical surveys in the Nankai Trough, estimated porosity along the plate boundary decreases from ~40% at the trench, to ~5% at 50 km from the trench (~8 km depth). This porosity reduction is faster than that expected in a basinal environment, and can be attributed to the effects of horizontal tectonic loading. The phyllites and cataclasites (2-5% porosity) across the Nobeoka thrust fault deform brittlely with a peak strength of 80-90 MPa, followed by strain weakening to residual strengths of 40-60 MPa at effective pressure of 20 MPa and temperature of 250°C. At effective pressure of 120 MPa, on the other hand, they exhibit strain hardening and their strength at 10% strain reaches ~300 MPa. The extrapolation of a brittle-ductile transition for the Nankai mudstones as a function of porosity and confining stress is consistent with the behavior of the ancient prism samples, which serve as an analog for the mechanical behavior of rocks at seismogenic depth in the modern Nankai Trough. These results suggest that as the clay-rich sediments subduct, their deformation behavior will transit from ductile to brittle and their strength of the clay-rich sediments will increase but not as high as that of sandstones or carbonates.",

            "abstract": "As a part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE), a deep riser borehole has been drilled into the Kumano forearc basin and the underlying inner accretionary wedge at Site C0002, located ~35 km landward from the trench. One of the primary objectives of drilling the riser site was to characterize in-situ stress and pore pressure in the hanging wall above the locked plate boundary. Here, we: (1) investigate the mechanical strength and deformation behavior of prism sediment via laboratory experiments on core samples; and (2) quantify in-situ stress (Sv, Sh, and SH), and pore pressure (Pp) in the Kumano basin and the inner prism. We conducted triaxial compression experiments on core samples recovered from ~ 2200 meters below sea floor (mbsf) during IODP Expedition 348, at effective pressures (Pe) ranging from 8 and 36 MPa, and at temperatures of either 25°C or 60°C.\nOur preliminary results indicate that the prism (20 - 42% porosity) rocks deform brittlely at Pe < 22 MPa, but exhibit strain hardening at Pe = 36 MPa. This pressure-porosity condition for a brittle-ductile transition is consistent with previous work defining yield models for incoming sediments at the Nankai Trough (Kitajima and Saffer, 2012). Combining P-wave velocity logs and downhole measurements of leak-off pressure at Site C0002 with an empirical relationship between P-wave velocity, porosity, and effective stress, we show that the Kumano forearc basin is in a uniaxial-strain loading path, which defines a normal faulting stress regime (Sv>SH>=Sh), whereas the inner accretionary prism is in a triaxial-strain loading path that defines a strike-slip faulting regime (SH>Sv>Sh). We estimate excess pore pressure below ~2000 mbsf ranging from 0-12 MPa, corresponding to a pore pressure ratio λ* of 0 - 0.40.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is the second largest component of land surface hydrological cycle, behind only precipitation. Globally, over 60% of precipitation is returned to atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. However, owing to lacking of long-term direct measurements of ET, ET is often assessed using indirect measures (e.g., pan evaporation, residual between precipitation and runoff), which partly makes ET the most problematic term in the water budget. Eddy covariance (EC) method can directly measure ET on a continuous and long-term basis and is preferred among meteorologists and ecologists. Since 2002, China has utilized EC method to measure ET of major vegetation types in key regions and data from over 50 sites have been collected. Therefore, by synthesizing ecosystem-level water flux data observed by eddy covariance method in China, we analyzed the ET and surface water balance variations in China. Results showed that both the climate and vegetation effects were significant on ET variation, while the climate and vegetation interaction effects were not significant. Similarly, surface water balance (the ratio of ET to precipitation) also showed significant differences among different vegetation and climate types. Besides, we also compared several published global ET products over China. Results showed that, although their predictions for all the sites were significantly correlated with the EC-observations over China, there were huge departures on the magnitude of ET, which is because very few site measurements from China have been applied in verifying the effectiveness of global ET products.",

            "abstract": "Determining the contribution of different sources to the total BC is necessary for targeted mitigation. Absorption Angstrom exponent (αabs) measurements of black carbon (BC) have recently been introduced as a novel tool to apportion the contribution of biomass burning sources to BC. Two-component Aethalometer model for apportioning BC to biomass burning sources and fossil fuel combustion sources, which uses αabs as a generic indicator of the source type, is widely used for determining the contribution of the two types of sources to the total BC. Our work studies BC emissions in the highly-populated, anthropogenic emissions-dominated Indo-Gangetic Plain and demonstrates that the αabs cannot be used as a generic tracer for biomass burning emissions in a complex environment. Simultaneously collected high time resolution data from a 7-wavelength Aethalometer (AE 42, Magee Scientific, USA) and a high sensitivity Proton Transfer Reaction- Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) installed at a sub-urban site in Mohali (Punjab), India, were used to identify a number of biomass combustion plumes during which BC enhancements correlated strongly with an increase in acetonitrile (a well-established biomass burning tracer) mixing ratio. Each type of biomass combustion is classified and characterized by distinct emission ratios of aromatic compounds and oxygenated VOCs to acetonitrile. The identified types of biomass combustion include two different types of crop residue burning (paddy and wheat), burning of leaf-litter, and garbage burning. Traffic (fossil-fuel burning) plumes were also selected for comparison. We find that the two-component Aethalometer source-apportionment method cannot be extrapolated to all types of biomass combustion and αabs of traffic plumes can be >1 in developing countries like India, where use of adulterated fuel in vehicles is common. Thus in a complex environment, where multiple anthropogenic BC sources and air masses of variable photochemical age impact a receptor site, the angstrom exponent is not representative of the combustion type and therefore, cannot be used as a generic tracer to constrain source contributions.",

            "abstract": "Past few decades, deterioration of the underground facilities such as sewage facilities has increased significantly with growing urban development in Korea. The old damaged sewage pipes or conduits have washed away the surrounding soils beneath the roadbed, causing underground cavities and eventual ground depressions or sinkholes in the urban areas. Therefore, the detection of the roadbed cavities is increasingly required to prevent property damage and loss of human lives for precautionary measures. 3-D GPR technique was applied to conduct the full-scale experiment for roadbed cavity detection. The physical experiment has employed the soil characteristics of silty sand soils. The experimental site is composed of physically simulated cavities (Styrofoam, εr = 1.03) with dome-shaped structure and concrete sewage conduit. The simulated cavities were installed at regular intervals in spatial distribution. The land surface of the site was not paved with asphalt concrete at the current stage of the experiments. The results of the GPR measurements over the experimental site show that the reflection patterns from the simulated cavities are hyperbolic returns typical to the point source in 2-D perspective. A closer inspection of 3-D GPR volume data has yielded more clear interpretation than 2-D GPR data regarding where the cavities are situated in space. However, in case sewage conduits adjacent to the cavities are present, they could mask the GPR signals from cavities, leading misinterpretations. Therefore, data processing procedures should be more appropriately applied compared to the data for linear target detections. It is strongly believed that 3-D high density GPR data could be usefully applied to the roadbed cavity detections in the experiments. This study is an ongoing project of KIGAM and more realistic environments of the underground conditions would be prepared for the future study.",

            "abstract": "A paradigm useful in managing dams and diversions is that the combined effects of changing flow regime and sediment supply perturb regulated rivers into sediment deficit or sediment surplus. In the U.S. Southwest, large dams constructed on interregional rivers typically create sediment deficit segments >100 km long. Further downstream, sediment surplus may occur if desert tributaries deliver sufficient amounts of fine sediment, such as parts of the Rio Grande, lower Green River, and Colorado River delta. Sediment surplus also occurs on most smaller regional rivers.\nThe protocols for managing rivers perturbed into sediment deficit have been refined for the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam but are nonetheless challenged by externally determined water-supply agreements that require annual water deliveries that sometimes occur when there has been little tributary resupply. Virtually all of the naturally supplied sand to the depleted, 100-km long Marble Canyon comes from the Paria River. The sand delivery rate since 2012 was sufficiently large to trigger short-duration controlled floods under the High Flow Experiment (HFE) Protocol. The sand mass balance of Marble Canyon since 2012 when the HFE Protocol was adopted was positive due to the combination of relatively large sand delivery from the Paria River and average total annual flows. Large total annual flows have the potential to export large amounts of sand and create a negative sand mass balance. Despite the challenge of managing a scarce and highly variable sand supply and occasional years of large reservoir releases, the long-term (2006-2015) sand mass balance for the upstream half of Marble Canyon is indeterminant and is positive for the downstream half of Marble Canyon.\nThe apparent success of managing sand in Grand Canyon under deficit conditions suggests that fine sediment management protocols might be developed for other regulated rivers. Implementation would require establishment of networks of gages to measure fine sediment flux. The greatest challenges in implementing these protocols are occasional large volume stream-flow releases to meet water supply objectives in sediment deficit rivers and the resistance to release sediment-transporting flows in sediment-surplus rivers when drought is persistent.",

Therefore, the convective flow and the seismic properties of the Earth’s deep mantle should depend strongly on the mechanical and physical properties of this mineral. Nowadays, atomic scale modelling of dislocation properties appears as one of the possible route to accurately infer the plastic behaviour of high pressure minerals.\nIn this study, we propose a theoretical modelling of dislocation glide in the easiest slip systems in MgSiO3 perovskite taking into account the influence of pressure and the effect of temperature. We focus on [100](010) and [010](100) slip systems and develop a multi scale model based on atomistic calculations to evaluate the mobility of dislocation under the conjugate action of stress and temperature and at various strain-rates. In particular, we show how numerical techniques such as Nudged Elastic Band are useful to evaluate the intermediate atomistic configurations which control lattice friction. Finally, we show that our model enables to calculate the strength of MgSiO3, either under laboratory conditions to compare with experimental data or under mantle strain rates.",

            "abstract": "Northeast British Columbia, specifically the Horn River Basin (HRB) and Montney Trend, are among the largest shale gas production regions in western Canada. In contrast, there has been no large-scale hydraulic fracturing (HF) operation in the Northwest Territories in the Norman Wells region of the central Mackenzie valley. In this study, we investigate the effect of injection pressure, operation duration and injected volume on the observed seismicity in the HRB and Norman Wells regions and compare our observations with the pre-HF records. In the HRB, we apply the single-station location and waveform correlation methods to establish a homogenous earthquake catalog (2006/12-2011/12). In the Northwest Territories, we combine data from a local seismograph network of 4 stations plus a dense array of 7 stations located from 1 km to 50 km from the operation wells to locate earthquakes (2013/09-2014/07). In the HRB, the initial effect of an increased injected volume is an increase in earthquake frequency but not magnitude. Local earthquakes gradually become larger in magnitude as the scale of HF in the region expands. While the injection pressure during HF operations has been regulated at a relatively constant level, the massive increase of injection volume in 2010 and 2011 coincides with a series of ML>3 events. Relatively large seismic moment release (>1014 N m) occurred only when the monthly injected volume exceeded ~150,000 m3. In addition, we observe variable time lags, from days to up to 4 months between intense HF and the occurrence of a significant local earthquake. On the other hand, in the Norman Wells region, two small-scale HF were performed in 2014 with a total injected volume of ~ 14000 m3. We observed an increase in the number of micro-earthquakes (M < 2.0) during the HF period without a clear change in the overall seismic pattern. From these two observations, we conclude that HF operations do not necessarily result in an increase in the occurrence rate of larger earthquakes. A clear change in background seismicity pattern towards more frequent occurrence and/or greater magnitudes occurred only when the monthly total injected volume became significantly higher. The hydrologic properties of the source formations and local geologic conditions might also play important roles in induced seismogenesis.",

In spite of its tectonic and rheological importance, only few mineralogical and petrological studies have been reported from Yugu peridotite. In order to understand the microstructural evolution of the Yugu peridotites, we conducted a detailed analysis of the microstructures and petro-fabrics.\nThe majority of Yugu peridotite body is significantly serpentinized, and it consists predominantly of spinel harzburgite together with minor lherzolite, dunite, and clinopyroxenite. We collected peridotites from mainly two areas (northwestern and southwestern parts) of the Yugu ultramafic body, and all samples are spinel harzburgites consisting of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, spinel, and amphibole. These samples have similar mineralogy except for the varied amount of clinopyroxene and amphibole. These mineral contents are generally increasing from proto-mylonite peridotites to mylonite peridotites. Based on microstructural characteristics of highly deformed peridotites (especially grain-size of olivine), we classified the samples into four textural types, which are proto-mylonite, proto-mylonite to mylonite transition, mylonite, and ultra-mylonite. Depending on the texture of specimen, it is found that the lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine varies from A-type (proto-mylonite) via D-type like (mylonite) to E-type (ultra-mylonite). The fabric strength of olivine (M-index and J-index) systematically decreases with decreasing grain-size of olivine from proto-mylonite via mylonite to ultra-mylonite. The cause of fabric evolution in the Yugu peridotites will be discussed.",

The microtremors are very important and useful measurements in site response which could be compensated the shortage and deficiency of the seismic recorded data, especially when there are missing of seismic stations for a long time. The aim of this study is to prepare a GIS-based microzonation map of the Aluja settlement area for the purposes of urban planning theme.The predominant natural frequency at each site was determined using the Horizontal to Vertical Noise Ratio (HVNR) of the microtremors records. It was applied to 100 points which cover the study area.The areas were divided into cells by a grid system of 300 m x 300 m for estimating the effects of site conditions.Using the outputs of these results, to classify the area in three zones with frequencies ranging from 0.5-0.8, 0.8-1 and 1-1.5 Hz.

It has been used to test\nadvanced data assimilation methods with an online model that couples meteorology and\ntracer transport. In the present study, the tracer subsystem of the model is replaced\nwith a reduced photochemistry module meant to emulate reactive air pollution. This\ncoupled chemistry meteorology model, the L95-GRS model, mimics continental and\ntranscontinental transport and photochemistry of ozone, volatile organic compounds and\nnitrogen dioxides.\nThe L95-GRS is specially useful in testing advanced data assimilation schemes, such as the\niterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS) that combines the best of ensemble and\nvariational methods. The model provides useful insights prior to any implementation of\nthe data assimilation method on larger models. For instance, online and offline data\nassimilation strategies based on the ensemble Kalman filter or the IEnKS can easily be\nevaluated with it. It allows to document the impact of species concentration observations\non the wind estimation. The model also illustrates a long standing issue in atmospheric\nchemistry forecasting: the impact of the wind chaotic dynamics and of the chemical species\nnon-chaotic but highly nonlinear dynamics on the selected data assimilation approach.",

We suggest the modified electrical resistivity methods using electrodes floating on the water and apply line current sources instead of conventional point current sources in order to facilitate simple analysis.

Next, a experiments on the effect factor of the filed geophysical exploration were conducted by using a barrage model. And then, modified electrode arrays were applied to the concrete barrage in practice in Korea. Finally, all of the results have been compared and analyzed in order to determine the applicability of three modified electrode arrays to water leakage detection of a concrete barrage. As a result, when water leakage occurred, all kind of array operations demonstrated a distinct change of aspect of potential difference in the numerical analysis, model experiment and field geophysical exploration graphs. Therefore, this modified electrode array of electrical resistivity survey, which has been adapted to the concrete barrage, has been found to be a useful method to detect water leakage.",

The exploration of new potential reservoirs is a challenging process that requires integrated geological and geophysical investigations for finding the best location of a future production well.\nIn this study, we perform seismic depth imaging on reflection seismic profiles, which provides the starting point for geological interpretation and three-dimensional model building. For this purpose, we start with first-arrival traveltime tomography for resolving the near-surface velocity model, and then proceed with analyzing the migration velocities for deeper layers using Kirchhoff pre-stack depth migration. Finally, we apply Fresnel volume migration which increases the resolution of the reflectivity images and enables a better characterization of the predominant geological structures in this area. At that point, we are particularly interested in a strong reflective marker, the so-called “K-horizon”, which is associated with the regional heat sources. We image this important reflector and quantify its depth uncertainty in relation to the velocity model.\nThe seismic imaging results provide the base for geologic modeling and a hydrothermal assessment of the potential reservoir area which contribute to optimizing the geothermal exploration in that region.",

            "abstract": "We use latest version of International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) regional climate model RegCM4.4 for the study of seasonal mean and monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISOs) during Indian summer monsoon season over south Asian CORDEX domain. First time we have done detailed analysis to evaluate RegCM4.4 for space-time evolution characteristics of MISOs. The model is initialized at 1st January, 2000 for a 13-year continuous simulation at a spatial resolution of 50km. The sensitivity of the model performance to cumulus physics in simulating MISOs has been evaluated by considering three different combinations of Grell (G) and Emanuel (E) cumulus schemes. The models reasonably simulate the seasonal mean precipitation and 850-hPa wind with a notable bias in precipitation over Indian subcontinent and Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO). The models exhibit higher skill in simulating seasonal mean wind than moisture and precipitation. On seasonal scale, the performance of RegCM-EG is more close to observation. However, on intraseasonal time scales, RegCM-EG fails to capture 25-90 day filtered precipitation variance over EIO which reflects in improper representation of features of MISOs. The space-time characteristics of MISOs are well captured by RegCM-EE over RegCM-GE, however it fails to show the eastward propagation of the convection across the Maritime Continent. Except RegCM-EE all other models completely underestimated the moisture advection from EIO onto Indian land region throughout the life-cycle of MISOs. It is found that the improvement in the representation of moist processes in RegCM-EE makes it useful for the study of characteristics of MISOs at regional scales.\nFigure below is lag composite of vertically integrated 25-90 day filtered horizontal moisture advection (shaded) and precipitation (black contour).",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic modelers and mathematicians have strived to improve 1-D Richards' equation (RE) solution reliability for predicting vadose zone fluxes. Despite advances in computing power and the numerical solution of partial differential equations since Richards first published the RE in 1931, the solution remains unreliable. That is to say that there is no guarantee that for a particular set of soil constitutive relations, moisture profile conditions, or forcing input that a numerical RE solver will converge to an answer. This risk of non-convergence renders prohibitive the use of RE solvers in hydrological models that need perhaps millions of infiltration solutions. In lieu of using unreliable numerical RE solutions, researchers have developed a wide array of approximate solutions that more-or-less mimic the behavior of the RE, with some notable deficiencies such as parameter insensitivity or divergence over time. The improved Talbot-Ogden (T-O) finite water-content scheme was shown by Ogden et al. (2015) to be an extremely good approximation of the 1-D RE solution, with a difference in cumulative infiltration of only 0.2 percent over an 8 month simulation comparing the improved T-O scheme with a RE numerical solver. The reason is that the newly-derived fundamental flow equation that underpins the improved T-O method is equivalent to the RE minus a term that is equal to the diffusive flux divided by the slope of the wetting front. Because the diffusive flux has zero mean, this term is not important in calculating the mean flux. The wetting front slope is near infinite (sharp) in coarser soils that produce more significant hydrological interactions between surface and ground waters, which also makes this missing term 1) disappear in the limit, and, 2) create stability challenges for the numerical solution of RE. The improved T-O method is a replacement for the 1-D RE in soils that can be simulated as homogeneous layers, where the user is willing to neglect the effects of soil water diffusivity. This presentation emphasizes the transformative nature of the improved T-O finite water-content solution, and highlights the benefits of the methods' reliability in high-resolution large watershed simulations in the high performance computing environment, and discusses coupling of the soil matrix and non-Darcian macropores.",

To investigate the CO budget in the mixed layer, we measured air-sea gas exchange, microbial consumption rate, and CDOM on-board at two stark different marine environments in summer season of 2012: the Amundsen Sea, Antractica, and the North Pacific. Dark incubation experiments revealed that microbial consumption rate in the North Pacific was 4.5 nM d-1 whilst 0.8 nM d-1 in the Amundsen Sea. Also CO production rate was about 3.5-times higher in the North Pacific (2.4 nM d-1) likely due to weak dilution and strong photochemical production. This different CO budget between the two regions renders different amplitude of diurnal variation of dissolved CO. That is, compared to the Amundsen Sea, CO was produced faster at daytime and removed faster at nighttime in the North Pacific where the amplitude of CO cycle is larger. In both regions, sea-to-air flux was insignificant (about 0.1 nM d-1 for the both regions) and microbial consumption overwhelmed CO sinks. A simple mass-balance model simulated well our observations, suggesting that other processes than mentioned above were unrevealed.",

Assuming that the ruptured fault connects to the surface trace of the of Main Frontal Thrust fault (MFT) between 84.34E and 86.19E, the best-fitting model suggests a dip angle of 7 degrees. The moment calculated from the slip model is 6.17*1020 Nm, corresponding to the moment magnitude of 7.79. The rupture of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake was dominated by thrust motion that was primarily concentrated in a 150-km long zone 50 to 100 km northward from the surface trace of the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT), with maximum slip of ~6 m at a depth of ~ 8 km. Data thus indicate that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake ruptured a deep part of the seismogenic zone, in contrast to the 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake, which had ruptured a shallow part of the adjacent fault segment to the East.",

For the last 25 kyr, εNd values obtained on foraminifera present large range from -4 to -6.7 suggesting large changes in the contribution of the NPDW (εNd = -4) and the UCDW (εNd -6 to -8) in the western Pacific. The glacial εNd values (~ -6.5) are interestingly similar to those obtained in the South Atlantic and in the Indian Ocean during the LGM and indicate a strong northward propagation of the Southern Sourced Water (SSW) in the subtropical western North Pacific. During the deglaciation, εNd records indicate a relatively decreased proportion of the SSW in the deep-water component of the western subtropical Pacific interrupted by two negative excursions of the εNd implying higher proportion of SSW during the time intervals 17 - 15 cal kyr BP and 10 - 8 cal kyr BP coeval to the Heinrich Statial 1 (HS1) and the early Holocene. The seawater εNd record is also well correlated to δ13C record obtained on benthic foraminifera Cibicides wuellerstorfi of the SCS and Southern Ocean confirming that εNd record reflect global circulation changes. The negative shifts centered on the Heinrich Statial 1 (HS1) is coeval with an enhanced upwelling in the Southern Ocean associated to pole wards shifts of the southern westerly inducing a enhanced formation of the SSW that propagate to the subtropical western Pacific. The negative excursion of the εNd during the Early Holocene (~10 - 8 cal kyr BP) indicate a relatively higher proportion of the SSW that could be associated to a higher production of the SSW as it was already recently observed in the South Atlantic and/or a possible reduction of the NPIW in the North Pacific induce by an intensification of the summer East Asian monsoon rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Drought is one of the most frequent and costliest natural disasters, which imposes enormous effects to human societies and ecosystems. Agricultural drought is referred to an interval of time, such as weeks or months, when the soil moisture supply of a region consistently falls below the appropriate moisture supply leading to negative impacts on agricultural production. Millions of households in Central America were dependent upon major food crops, including maize, beans, and sorghum, for their daily subsistence. In recent years, impacts of climate change through global warming in forms of higher temperature and widespread rainfall deficits have however triggered severe drought during the primera cropping season (April−August) in the study region, causing profound impacts on agriculture, crop production losses, increased market food prices, as well as food security issues. This study focuses on investigating agricultural droughts for cropland of Central America using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We processed the data for a normal year 2013 and an abnormal year 2014 using a simple vegetation health index (VHI) that is developed based on the temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation condition index (VCI). The VHI results were validated using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) precipitation data and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) that is developed based on the empirical analysis of TCI and VCI data. The correlation coefficients (r) obtained by comparisons between the VHI data and the AMSR2 precipitation and TVDI data were higher than 0.62 and –0.61, respectively. The severe drought was intensive during the dry season (January–April) and likely backed to normal conditions in May with the onset of rainy season. The larger area of serve drought was observed for the 2014 primera season, especially during April–July. When investigating the cultivated areas affected by severe drought in the primera season, the total cropland areas affected (by severe drought) observed for 2013 and 2014 were 2,463 km2 and 3,874 km2, respectively. This study demonstrates the applicability of MODIS data for agricultural drought monitoring in Central America.",

            "abstract": "The emissions of Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from vegetation, mainly in form of isoprenoids, play an important role in the tropospheric ozone (O3) formation. The potential large expansion of isoprene emitter species (e.g. poplar) as biofuels feedstock might impact the ground level O3 formation. Here we report the simultaneous observations, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, of isoprene, O3 and CO2 fluxes in a short rotation coppice (SRC) of poplar. The impact of current poplar plantations and associated isoprene emissions on ground level ozone concentrations for Europe was evaluated using a chemistry transport model (CTM) LOTOS-EUROS. The isoprene fluxes showed a well-defined seasonal and daily cycle that mirrored with the stomata O3 uptake. The isoprene emission and the stomata O3 uptake showed significant statistical relationship especially at elevated temperature. Isoprene was characterized by a remarkable peak of emissions (e.g. 38 nmol m-2s-1) occurring for few days as a consequence of the rapid variation of the air and surface temperature. During these days the photosynthetic apparatus (i.e. the CO2 fluxes) and transpiration rates did not show significant variation while we did observe a variation of the energy exchange and a reduction of the bowen ratio. The response of isoprene emissions to ambient O3 concentration follows the common form of the hormetic dose–response curve with a considerable reduction of the isoprene emissions at [O3] > 80 ppbv indicating a potential damping effect of the O3 levels on isoprene.\nUnder the current condition the impact of SRC plantations on ozone concentrations / formation is very limited in Europe. Our findings indicate that, even with future scenarios with more SRC, or conventional poplar plantations, the impact on Ozone formation is negligible.",

            "abstract": "Many freshwater aquifers have saltwater bodies in their deeper part. Such saltwater bodies may be a result of various processes, the most well-known of which is seawater intrusion. Studying the physical processes in the transition zone between fresh and saline waters in the aquifer is important since it can help in reducing risk of salinization of pumping wells.\nSpecifically, we study the effect of pumping from a well whose screen is submerged into the transition zone. Typically, wells are screened only against freshwater bearing strata, and the pump is installed close to the water table. However, if the screen of a production well extends below the freshwater body, and the well is screened against the transition layer between the two bodies, or even against the saltwater, the question is whether saline or brackish water will be pumped when the well is operated. It seems this problem has never been tested by scientific tools in the past.\nA preliminary lab experiment and a preliminary numerical model revealed that the well screen may have an important role in the physical process of mixing. The flow through the fine mesh of the screen results in head loss. The head difference between the outside and the inside of the screen results in a ‘jump’ in the elevation of transition zone. This jump forces the freshwater outside the screen to flow through the screen slots in thin filaments into the saltwater, leading to enhanced mixing, in comparison to the case where no such head loss exists.",

            "abstract": "Seamounts and seamount chains are common in both the upper and lower plates of active subduction zones. Their OIB-type volcanic products are distinctly different from suprasubduction zone (arc, forearc and backarc) generated volcanic rocks in terms of their compositions and mantle sources. Tectonic accretion of such seamounts into the Japanese archipelago in the NW Pacific and into subduction-accretion complexes and active margins of continents/microcontinents within the Tethyan realm during the Cretaceous played a significant role in continental growth. Seamount assemblages comprise alkaline volcanic rocks intercalated with radiolarian and hemipelagic chert, and limestone, and may also include hypabyssal dolerite and gabbro intrusions. In the Tethyan orogenic belts these seamount rocks commonly occur as km-scale blocks in mélange units beneath the late Jurassic – Cretaceous ophiolites nappes, whereas on the Japanese islands they form discrete, narrow tectonic belts within the late Jurassic – Cretaceous accretionary prism complexes. We interpret some of these OIB occurrences in the Japanese and Tethyan mountain belts as asperities in downgoing oceanic plates that formed in <10 million years before their accretion. Their magmas were generated by decompressional melting of upwelling asthenosphere, without any significant mantle plume component, and were brought to the seafloor along deep-seated brittle fractures that developed in the flexed, downgoing lithosphere as it started bending near a trench. The modern occurrences of these “petit-spot volcanoes” are well established in the northwestern Pacific plate, off the coast of Japan. The proposed mechanism of the formation of these small seamounts better explains the lack of hotspot trails associated with their occurrence in the geological record. Magmatic outputs of such flexural bending-induced plumelets should be ubiquitious in the accretionary (Japanese-style) and collisional (Tethyan-style) orogenic belts.",

            "abstract": "The iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS) is a data assimilation method meant for efficiently tracking the state of\nnonlinear geophysical models. It combines an ensemble of model states to estimate the errors similarly to the ensemble\nsquare root Kalman filter, with a 4D-variational analysis performed within the ensemble space. As such it belongs to\nthe class of ensemble variational methods. Recently introduced 4DEnVar or the 4D-LETKF can be seen as particular cases\nof the scheme. The IEnKS was shown to outperform 4D-Var, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and smoother, with low-order\nmodels in all investigated dynamical regimes. Like any ensemble method, it could require the use of localization of the\nanalysis when the state space dimension is high. However, localization for the IEnKS is not as straightforward as for\nthe EnKF. Indeed, localization needs to be defined across time, and it needs to be as much as possible consistent with\nthe dynamical flow within the data assimilation variational window. We show that a Liouville equation governs the time\nevolution of the localization operator, which is linked to the evolution of the error correlations. It is argued that\nits time integration strongly depends on the forecast dynamics. Using either covariance localization or domain\nlocalization, we propose and test several localization strategies meant to address the issue: (i) a constant and uniform\nlocalization, (ii) the propagation through the window of a restricted set of dominant modes of the error covariance\nmatrix, (iii) the approximate propagation of the localization operator using model covariant local domains.

            "abstract": "Large interplate earthquakes are often followed by postseismic slip that is interpreted to occur in areas surrounding the coseismic ruptures on the plate interfaces. Such spatial partitioning is expected from the difference in frictional property that controls slip behavior during inter-, co-, and post-seismic periods. However, the estimation of high-resolution slip in offshore area is usually difficult due to the lack of seafloor geodetic data. An Mw9.0 earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, ruptured vast area on the plate interface offshore Tohoku district, northeastern Japan where Pacific plate is subducting beneath the continental plate from Japan Trench. We investigated the postseismic slip using both seafloor and terrestrial geodetic data, namely seafloor GPS/Acoustic ranging, ocean bottom pressure, and terrestrial GPS, to examine whether the co- and post-seismic slip of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake are spatially partitioned. The postseismic slip distribution with applying a comprehensive FEM model to eliminate the viscoelastic components from observed postseismic displacements time series with taking landward movements on the seafloor into account. The high-resolution co- and post-seismic slip distributions clarified that they are partitioned spatially which also agree with the activities of interplate and repeating earthquakes. These results mean that the conventional frictional property model on the plate interface based on the rate- and slip-dependent friction law is still valid for the source region of the megathrust earthquake. The results also imply higher probabilities of the interplate earthquakes that rupture on the plate interface north and south to the main shock than previously expected, because the postseismic slip at the areas that surrounds the rupture areas of past interplate large earthquakes are significantly faster than the slip in the source regions of the potential earthquakes where subducting and overriding plates must be still coupled.",

            "abstract": "Generating age models for paleo proxy data can be extremely difficult. Oftentimes assumptions are made which are based on hypothetical relationships between climate and orbital forcings. Whether these relationships (expressed in terms of correlation models) are physically justified and whether they are stationary is testable using transient climate model simulations.\nSeveral standard methods to generate age models for paleo-proxy data are scrutinized here, such as orbital tuning and synchronization to benthic stacks. To overcome some of the fundamental weaknesses of these methods we propose to use transient paleo climate model simulations to derive dynamically and physically consistent age models for paleo-proxy data. We illustrate this suggestion using\n1) millennial-scale climate variations during MIS\n2) orbital-scale climate variability during the past ~800 ka\nAd 1) A physically forced MIS3 global hindcast model simulation with an earth system model, designed to match the reconstructed North Atlantic SST variability, can be used to determine the relative timing of different climate and biogeochemical variables at various locations with respect to an initial absolute reference timescale (GICC05 in our case). Corresponding leads and lags are a result of the physical equations of the climate system – not of oversimplisitic statistical assumptions (such as wiggle matching). The key assumption for this approach is that global patterns of Dansgaard-Oeschger variability are caused by centennial to millennial-scale AMOC variability.\nAd 2) A transient earth system model simulation of the past ~800 ka is forced with observed greenhouse gas variations (on EDC3), orbital and estimated ice-sheet forcing. Simulated rainfall variations over the Eastern Mediterranean are compared with hydroclimate reconstructions from Lake Van. The simulated rainfall agrees well with the hydroclimate reconstruction (on the MoSto27 timescale) for the first 200 ka. Following this we demonstrate how the simulated rainfall variations from 201 to 600 ka can then be used to develop an independent age model for the Lake Van sediment core. Tie points from 40Ar/39Ar measurements and geomagnetics can then be used for verification of the simulation-based age model.",

The isotopic variations of REEs occurring naturally has a potentially significant influence in geochemical research fields. The REEs has key features that their chemical similarities and gradual changes of ionic radius, which may help us to understand the mechanisms of isotopic variations of REEs in nature. Among the REEs, geochemical and physicochemical features of Ce, which could be presence as the tetravalent state, be anomalous, and oxidation state of Ce can change by reflecting the redox conditions of the environment. Therefore, the study of the difference in the degree of isotopic fractionation between Ce and other REEs may provide information on the redox conditions. In this study, we developed a new separation method to determine the mass-dependent isotopic fractionations of REEs in geochemical samples, and examined the optimum concentration of hydrochloric acid for the separation. The samples were decomposed by a mixture of acids, then REEs were separated as a group from major elements using cation exchange resin columns and RE Spec resin. The separations within the REEs group were carried out using Ln2Spec resin. For the recovery of La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, 0.1 M HCl was used, and for isolation of Sm, Eu, and Gd, 0.25 M HCl was used. Then, 0.6 M HCl was used for separation of Tb, and Dy, 1 M HCl was used for separation of Ho, Y, and Er, finally, Tm, Yb, and Lu were collected using 2 M HCl.

To what degree are biota and biogeochemical function in the subsurface influenced by surface properties, including land cover and land management, as opposed to the geologic properties of the local rock? How do extreme events at the surface impact subsurface community structure and function? The newly established Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory in central Germany provides an infrastructure platform to study these questions in a karst parent material setting. It includes specialized wells to access shallow (6m to 100m deep) groundwater along a ~6km transect in the direction of hydrologic flow through limestone parent material, and spanning forest, pasture and agricultural land uses. Collaborating researchers combine ‘omics’ technologies with biogeochemistry, tracer measurements and hydrogeology, including new data platforms to better inform across disciplines and groups. We will present some initial results, which demonstrate fundamental differences in the biota and biogeochemistry of two shallow aquifers, likely related to the land use in their respective recharge areas.

            "abstract": "Oil and gas exploration activities (O&G) in Wattenberg Field, located north of the Denver Metropolitan area, have expanded in the last few years. Although VOC emissions and the potential for ozone formation in the area from these sources have been studied previously, no information is available on the impact on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. During the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE), airborne measurements of trace gases and aerosol composition were made in the northern Front Range during July-August 2014. We present analyses on evolution of organic aerosol (OA) and their precursors in order to assess the impact of urban vs. O&G emissions on SOA formation. Significant contribution of SOA to total OA was observed in pure urban and urban plumes mixed with O&G emissions. Under an OH-exposure of 2.8×1011 molecule cm-3 s, enhancement ratios of OA relative to carbon monoxide (ΔOA/ΔCO) increased by factors of ~3.6-5.4; however, (ΔSOA/ΔCO)urban+O&G was 87% higher than (ΔSOA/ΔCO)urban. Predicted ΔSOA/ΔCO values from the oxidation of C7-C11 alkanes, C6-C9 aromatics, and biogenics were about a factor of 10-15 too small compared to the measurements. Predicated alkane-derived SOA contributed to 38% (16%) of anthropogenic ΔSOA/ΔCO values in urban+O&G- (urban-) influenced air masses.",

            "abstract": "Top-down approaches (or atmospheric inversions) using atmospheric transport models with CO2 observations are an effective way to estimate carbon fluxes at global and regional scales. CO2 flux estimation by Bayesian inversions require a priori knowledge of terrestrial biosphere and oceanic fluxes and fossil fuel (FF) CO2 emissions. In most inversion frameworks, FF CO2 is assumed to be a known quantity because FF CO2 based on world statistics are thought to be more reliable than natural CO2 fluxes. However different databases of FF CO2 emissions may have different temporal and spatial variations especially at locations where statistics are not so accurate. In this study, we use 3 datasets of fossil fuel emissions in inversion estimations and evaluate the sensitivity of the optimized CO2 fluxes to FF emissions with two different inverse models, JAMSTEC’s ACTM and CarbonTracker Europe (CTE).\nInterannually varying a priori FF CO2 emissions were based on 1) CDIAC database, 2) EDGARv4.2 database, and 3) IEA database, with some modifications. Biosphere and oceanic fluxes were optimized. Except for FF emissions, other conditions were kept the same in our inverse experiments. The three a priori FF emissions showed ~5% (~0.3GtC/yr) differences in their global total emissions in the early 2000’s and the differences reached ~9% (~0.9 GtC/yr) in 2010. This resulted in 0.5–1 GtC/yr (2001–2011) and 0.3–0.6 GtC/yr (2007-2011) differences in the estimated global total emissions for the ACTM and CTE inversions, respectively. Regional differences in the FF emissions were relatively large in East Asia (~0.5 GtC/yr for ACTM and ~0.3 GtC/yr for CTE) and Europe (~0.3 GtC/yr for ACTM). These a priori flux differences caused differences in the estimated biosphere fluxes for ACTM in East Asia and Europe and also their neighboring regions such as West Asia, Boreal Eurasia, and North Africa. The main differences in the biosphere fluxes for CTE were found in Asia and the Americas.",

During this period, 27 MJO events with strong magnitude and clear propagation are identified and further classified as either primary, or successive, according to the existence of preceding event. While the successive events are analyzed in composite fields, the primary events will be explored individually.\nA composite of scale-separated lower-tropospheric (1000-700 hPa) moisture (qL) budget is analyzed in four stages: suppressed, cloud developing, convective and decaying, each corresponding to the RMM index phase 567(781), 81(23), 2(4), and 34(56), respectively, for IO (MC). In the suppressed stage, the dominant moisture source over both region is surface evaporation/shallow convection (-Q2). Nonlinear zonal (meridional) advection by synoptic disturbances also has non-negligible contribution over IO (MC). In the cloud developing stage, qLapproaches maximum with moistening tendency to its east. This moistening is contributed by the advection of mean moisture by anomalous easterlies associated with downstream Rossby wave response of the dry anomaly and boundary layer moisture convergence. In the convective stage, while the zonal advection of anomalous westerlies and intense precipitation dries the atmosphere, the moistening of meridional advection by downstream Rossby anti-cyclonic gyres leads to the eastward propagation of deep convection. In the decaying stage, the strong westerlies bring in dry air from the west causing widespread drying. Overall, the moisture evolution of MC is consistent with IO expect meridional component is more essential in suppressed stage.\nA column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget is also analyzed to further identify the role of radiation and surface flux. The result shows that longwave heating is the dominant energy source in convective stage and latent heat flux is more prominent in decaying stage when the westerly is strong. The in-phase relation of longwave heating with column-integrated MSE suggests that longwave heating acts to maintain MSE and retard the propagation. Latent heat flux also slows down the propagation due to the phase lag.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater resources around the world are increasing in scarcity due to population growth, industrialization and climate change. This is a serious concern for water stressed countries, including those in Asia and North Africa where future food production is expected to be negatively affected by this. To address this problem, we investigate the potential of combining freshwater reservoir and wastewater reclamation operations. Reservoir water is the cheaper source of irrigation, but is often limited and climate sensitive. Treated wastewater is a more reliable alternative for irrigation, but often requires extensive further treatment which can be expensive. We propose combining the operations of a reservoir and a wastewater reclamation plant (WWRP) to augment the supply from the reservoir with reclaimed water for increasing crop yields in water stressed regions. The joint system of reservoir and WWRP is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem with the double objective of maximizing the crop yield and minimizing total cost, subject to constraints on reservoir storage, spill and release, and capacity of the WWRP. We use the crop growth model Aquacrop, supported by The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to model crop growth in response to water use. Aquacrop considers the effects of water deficit on crop growth stages, and from there estimates crop yield. We generate results comparing total crop yield under irrigation with water from just the reservoir (which is limited and often interrupted), and yield with water from the joint system (which has the potential of higher supply and greater reliability). We will present results for locations in India and Africa to evaluate the potential of the joint operations for improving food security in those areas for different budgets.",

            "abstract": "We study dynamics of radiation belt electrons interacting with large amplitude EMIC rising-tone emissions by performing test particle simulations. Engebretson et al. [JGR, 2015] reported observation of large amplitude EMIC rising-tone emissions outside the plasmasphere and depletion of radiation belt electrons in response to these emissions. We make the two kinds of wave models; one is in low-density region based on the observation and the other is in the plasmasphere. To reproduce the large wave amplitude we include the convective wave growth, which are neglected through propagation of EMIC model waves in the previous studies [Omura and Zhao, JGR, 2012, 2013; Kubota et al., JGR, 2015]. Furthermore, we also include Landau damping in setting up the model waves. Comparing with a wave model ignoring the convective wave growth, it is found that the large wave amplitude contributes to rapid electron precipitation. Some of relativistic electrons change their equatorial pitch angles more than 15 degrees in a time scale of 0.1 s, precipitated into the atmosphere. We set up the EMIC model waves in a local longitude and distribute test electrons throughout all longitudinal direction initially. The electrons moving eastward encounter the localized EMIC waves and some of resonant electrons are precipitated into the atmosphere. We obtain distribution of radiation belt electrons with respect to their equatorial pitch angle and kinetic energy. We find that the frequency variation expands the resonant electron range of pitch angles and energies. For comparison with observation of precipitated electrons, we monitor fluxes of electrons lost into the atmosphere in a narrow longitudinal range. Furthermore, we find echo of electron depletion due to eastward drift around the Earth. Energy ranges of efficient precipitation are different depending on the regions of interaction inside and outside of the plasmapause. Inside the plasmapause, electrons with energy > 0.5 MeV are precipitated. Outside the plasmapause, on the other hand, only highly relativistic electrons with energy > 3 MeV are precipitated.",

            "abstract": "Postseismic deformation following the large subduction earthquake of Maule (Chile, Mw8.8, February 27th 2010) have been closely monitored with GPS from 70 km up to 2000 km away from the trench. They exhibit a behavior generally similar to that already observed after the Aceh and Tohoku-Oki earthquakes. Vertical uplift is observed on the volcanic arc and a moderate large scale subsidence is associated with sizeable horizontal deformation in the far-field (500-2000km from the trench). In addition, near-field data (70-200km from the trench) feature a rather complex deformation pattern.\nA 3D FE code (Zebulon Zset) is used to relate these deformation to slip on the plate interface and relaxation in the mantle. The mesh features a spherical shell-portion from the core-mantle boundary to the Earth's surface, extending over more than 60 degrees in latitude and longitude. The overridding and subducting plates are elastic, and the asthenosphere is viscoelastic. A viscoelastic Low Viscosity Channel (LVC) is also introduced along the plate interface. Both the asthenosphere and the channel feature Burger's rheologies and we invert for their mechanical properties and geometrical characteristics simultaneously with the afterslip distribution. The horizontal deformation pattern requires relaxation both in i) the asthenosphere extending down to 270km, with a 'long-term' viscosity of the order of 4.8.1018 Pa.s and ii) in the channel, that has to extend from depth of 50 to 150 km with viscosities slightly below 1018 Pa.s, to fit well the vertical velocity pattern (intense and quick uplift over the Cordillera). Aseismic slip on the plate interface, at shallow depth, is necessary to explain all the characteristics of the near-field displacements. We then detect two main patches of high slip, one updip of the coseismic slip distribution in the northernmost part of the rupture zone, and the other one downdip, at the latitude of Constitucion (35°S). We finally study the temporel evolution of this slip distribution, together with its correlation with the aftershocks distribution.",

            "abstract": "In West Africa, surface atmosphere exchanges have been found to impact both regional and local features of the Monsoon. At local scale the spatial patterns of evaporative fraction can drive the trajectories of mesoscale convective systems. Within Sudanian climate, ~80% of the precipitation returns to atmosphere through evapotranspiration. However, this amount and its seasonal dynamic may vary with the vegetation cover. Consequently, one might expect that any land use or climate changes could lead to the modification of the surface feedbacks, and, thus on both the atmospheric and the continental water cycle. The sudanian region of West Africa is submitted to a 3% demographical increase per year, which induces a drastic expansion of crops areas. In the Upper Oueme basin, the natural forest cover reduces from 70% to 25% in 40 years. This study aims at quantifying the changes in evapotranspiration regime caused by such a land use change under sudanian climate.\nThe AMMA-CATCH observatory documents evapotranspiration flux in West Africa since 2007. A pluri-annual energy budget of a forest and a cropland area are analysed. It is shown that sudanian forest evapo-transpirated always more than cropland areas because of agricultural practice and water availability for trees. Thus, during the dry season, the cropland areas are bare while the forests do not completely lose their leaves. Their deep root systems allow the trees to get access to water. Observed evapotranspiration is significant over forests. During the rainy season, vegetation is fully developed and well-watered. Nevertheless, lower but significant differences in evaporative fraction are also observed. At annual scale these differences lead to a 13% to 30% reduction of evapotranspiration with deforestation.",

More than 50% of the HP–UHP Orogenic Belt was significantly reworked by Early Cretaceous extensional tectonics. This Early Cretaceous event with a fast cooling period, at 130–120 Ma, superimposed on the Early Mesozoic HP–UHP orogenic belt and intensively changed the architecture of this orogen. Each individual segment documents different Early Cretaceous extensional structures, namely the central Tongbaishan domain is a metamorphic core complex (MCC) represented by an A-type non-cylindrical antiform; the central Dabieshan domain is a typical Cordilleran-type migmatite-cored MCC; the Southern Sulu UHP domain is a “wedge-shaped” structure exhumed by a simple detachment fault. These late stage extensional structures expose the previous HP–UHP orogenic belt as fragments along the NCB–SCB boundary. The geodynamic setting of this Early Cretaceous extensional tectonics along the HP–UHP orogen is a part of a 1000 km-scale crustal extension belt that is widespread in eastern Eurasia continent from Trans-Baikal to the central part of the South China Block. Convective erosion or delamination of the mantle lithosphere might be considered as a possible mechanism for mantle removal.",

Ordos Basin, located in the west of the North China Craton, is a typical intraplate. Based on two-dimensional thermal modeling along a profile across Ordos Basin from east to west, obtained the lithospheric thermal structure and rheology. Mantle heat flow in different regions of Ordos Basin is from 21.2 to 24.5 mW/m2. In the east mantle heat flow is higher while heat flow in western region is relatively low. But mantle heat flow is smooth and low overall, showing a stable thermal background. Ratio of crustal and mantle heat flow is between 1.51 and 1.84, indicating that thermal contribution from shallow crust is lower than that from the mantle. Rheological characteristics along the profile are almost showed as “jelly sandwich” model and stable continental lithosphere structure,which is represent by a weak crust portion but a strong lithospheric mantle portion in vertical strength profile. Based on above , both thermal structure and lithospheric rheology of Ordos Basin illustrate that tectonic dynamics environment in the west of North China Craton is relatively stable.\nBy the study on lithospheric thermal structure, we focus on the disparity in thickness between the thermal lithosphere and seismic lithosphere.The difference in western Ordos Basin is about 140km, which decreases gradually from Fenwei graben in the eastern Ordos Basin to the Bohai Bay Basin.That is to say the difference decreases gradually from the west to the east of North China Craton.The simulation results imply that viscosity of the asthenosphere under North China Craton also decreases gradually from west to east, confirming that dehydration of the Pacific subduction is likely to have great effect on the North China Craton.",

            "abstract": "African tropical rainforests host rich biodiversity and play many roles at different scales such as local, regional and global, in the functioning of the earth system. Despite that the African tropical forests are the world’s second largest, it has been neglected in terms of understanding the storage and fluxes of carbon and other nutrients. The question of whether this biome is a net sink or source of atmospheric CO2 is still not answered, and little is known concerning the climate change response. Tropical montane forests are even more poorly sampled compared with their importance. Deeper understanding of these ecosystems is required to provide insights on how they might react under global change. To answer questions related to these issues for African tropical montane forests, 15 permanent 0.5 ha plots were established in 2011 in Nyungwe tropical montane rainforest gazetted as a National Park to protect its extensive floral and faunal diversity. The plots are arranged along an east-westerly transect and includes both primary and secondary forest communities. The study is connected to the global ecosystem monitoring network (GEM, \nhttp://gem.tropicalforests.ox.ac.uk/\n). The aim is to characterize spatial and temporal heterogeneity of carbon and nutrient dynamics processes. The role of microclimate, topography, human disturbances, and plant species to the variability of these pools and processes will be explored.\nWe compare stocks and fluxes of carbon and nutrients of the secondary and primary forest communities. The carbon stock are determined by an inventory of height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of all trees with a dbh above 5 cm, wood density, biomass of understory vegetation, leaf area index, standing and fallen dead wood, fine root biomass and organic content of various soil layers (litter, organic and mineral soil down to 45 cm depth). The carbon fluxes are determined by measurements of photosynthesis and respiration of leaves, above and below ground tree growth (stem, and fine roots), litter fall and soil respiration. Results of the carbon budget defined through the net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic respiration (Ra) and gross primary productivity (GPP) will be presented, comparing primary and secondary forest communities.",

            "abstract": "Slab subduction plays an important role in the mantle material circulation [Stern, 2002], and can also affect the feature of the 410 km and 660 km seismic discontinuities (410 and 660) [Lebedev et al., 2002]. Japan subduction zone is a natural laboratory for studying the mantle composition and velocity structure associated with the deep subduction of the Pacific plate. In this study, triplicated waveforms of an intermediate-depth earthquake at the Hokkaido of Japan (2011/10/21, 08:02:37.62, 142.5315°E, 43.8729°N, Mb6.0, relocated depth: 188 km) are retrieved from the dense Chinese Digital Seismic Network (CDSN). P and S waveforms are filtered with the band of 0.05-1.0 Hz and 0.02-0.5 Hz, respectively, and then integrated into the displacement data. The relative traveltime and synthetic waveform fitting is applied to mapping the deep structure. The best fitting models are obtained through the trial and error tests. We find a 15 km uplift of the 410 and a 25 km depression of the 660, indicating the cold environment caused by the subduction slab; both the 410 and 660 show the sharp discontinuity, but a smaller velocity contrast than the IASP91 model [Kennett and Engdahl, 1991]. Atop the 410 and 660, there are high-velocity layers associated with the subduction (or stagnant) slab. We also find a low-velocity anomaly with the thickness of ~65 km below the 660, which may relate to the slab dehydration or the hot upwelling at the top of the lower mantle. The seismic velocity ratio (VP/VS) shows a lower zone at the depth of ~210-395 km, showing the consistency with the low Poisson’s ratio signature of the oceanic plate; a higher zone at the depth of ~560-685 km, implying the hydrous mantle transition zone.",

            "abstract": "The western US is expected to experience more frequent droughts with higher magnitudes and persistence due to the climate change, with potentially large impacts on agricultural productivity and the economy. Irrigated farmers have many options for minimizing drought impacts including changing crops, engaging in water markets, and switching irrigation technologies. Switching to more efficient irrigation technologies, which increase water availability in the crop root zone through reduction of irrigation losses, receives significant attention because of the promise of maintaining current production with less. However, more efficient irrigation systems are almost always more capital-intensive adaptation strategy particularly compared to changing crops or trading water. A farmer’s decision to switch will depend on how much money they project to save from reducing drought damages. The objective of this study is to explore when (and under what climate change scenarios) it makes sense economically for farmers to invest in a new irrigation system. This study was performed over the Yakima River Basin (YRB) in Washington State, although the tools and information gained from this study are transferable to other watersheds in the western US. We used VIC-CropSyst, a large-scale grid-based modeling framework that simulates hydrological processes while mechanistically capturing crop water use, growth and development. The water flows simulated by VIC-CropSyst were used to run the RiverWare river system and water management model (YAK-RW), which simulates river processes and calculates regional water availability for agricultural use each day (i.e., the prorationing ratio). An automated computational platform has been developed and programed to perform the economic analysis for each grid cell, crop types and future climate projections separately, which allows us to explore whether or not implementing a new irrigation system is economically viable. Results of this study indicate that climate change could justify the investment in new irrigation systems during this century, but the timing of a farmer’s response is likely to depend on a variety of factors, including changes in the frequency and magnitude of drought events, current irrigation systems, climatological characteristics within the basin, and crop type.",

            "abstract": "Both anthropogenic activities and climate change could dramatically affect the biogeochemical processes of natural wetland methanogenesis. Chinese natural wetlands vanished considerably during recent decades mainly due to human activities. Quantifying possible impacts of changing climate and wetland area on wetland methane (CH4) emissions in China is important for improving our knowledge on CH4 budgets locally and globally. However, their respective and combined effects are uncertain. We incorporated changes in wetland area derived from remote sensing into a dynamic CH4 model of TRIPLEX-GHG to quantify the contributions of both human-induced and climate change to methane emissions from natural wetlands of China over the past three decades. Here we found that under the conditions of climate change, human-induced wetland loss contributed 34.3% to the CH4 reduction (0.92 Tg CH4), and climate change only contributed 20.4% to the CH4 increase (0.31 Tg CH4), suggesting that the decrease of CH4 emission due to human-induced wetland area reductions has offset the climate change induced increasing of CH4emission at the national scale. Wetlands in northeastern China made the greatest contribution to national wetland CH4 emission variation under both climate change and wetland area dynamics conditions, followed by the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), where the emissions mainly controlled by climate change. Temperature was a dominant controlling factor for wetland CH4 emission in the northeast (high latitude) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (high altitude) regions, whereas precipitation had a considerable influence in north China. Ignoring the dynamic change of human-induced wetlands loss may result in great uncertainties in quantifying global wetland CH4 emissions.",

The low velocity anomaly migrates towards SE with increasing depth, suggesting a possible SE dipping weak structure in which most of the seismic activity takes place. Inversion of magnetic field data shows that the top of the magnetic basement ranges between 5 and 10 km of depth in the Valley and the Ridge physiographic province while it is shallower (less than 2 km of depth) and locally outcropping in the Blue Ridge province and in the Cumberland Plateau province.\nThe estimated depth of the top of the magnetic basement is in general agreement with existing sedimentary cover map of the broad study area, although the local features of the ETSZ presented in this work are not resolved by previous studies due to poor resolution.\nThe correlation between the magnetic signature and the position of the seismic velocity anomalies support the interpretation of the low velocity zone as a major basement fault, trending NE-SW and juxtaposing Granite-Rhyolite basement to the NW from Grenville southern Appalachian basement to the SE, of which the NY-AL magnetic lineament is the projection on the surface.\nIn order to better constrain our interpretation, inversion of tomography results to obtain absolute shear waves velocity models will be performed as a next step.",

It turns out that in recent decades there are two significant decadal regime shift, late 1970s and the middle of 1990s respectively. Before the late 1970s, the oscillation of Arctic sea ice extent was decrease under the background of global warming, the seasonal melting extent was small but increased significantly; during the late 1970s and the middle of 1990s, the oscillation of the seasonal melting extent was maintain and had no significant trend; while after the middle of 1990s, although there is a hiatus of the global warming, the melting of Arctic sea ice is accelerating, especially after 2007, during which Arctic sea ice seasonal melting extent is greatly increased. Besides that, as the time goes by, the significant seasonal melting area expanded anticlockwise from the East Siberia sea which is in north shore of Asian Arctic to Beaufort Sea-north Canadian Arctic Archipelago gradually, and expand to the central Arctic at the same time. Correspondingly, the total frequency of Chinese Freezing Rain is decreasing during the past several decades and also has significant decadal regime shift. The inter-annual amplitude of the total frequency of Chinese Freezing Rain was large during 1962-1979, then turned small during 1980-1996. After 1997 the total frequency of Chinese Freezing Rain is at a low stage, but is increasing. The relationship between sea surface temperature or sea ice concentration and Chinese Freezing Rain is also been discussed, the related key area are different during different decadal. Chinese freezing rain is influenced by sea surface temperature and sea ice through atmosphere circulation. There is a consistency between the change of Chinese Freezing Rain and the sea ice, which means that the decadal regime shift of the Arctic sea ice may be the cause of the decadal regime shift of Chinese Freezing Rain.",

Soil compaction resulting from mechanization of forest operations is first affecting soil macroporosity, and thus gas and water transfer within the soil, leading to a reduced oxygenation of the soil. This reduction of soil aeration is expected to reduce the methanotrophic activity leading thus to less CH4 oxidation and more CH4 production, affecting the overall soil CH4budget.\nCompaction was applied in 2007 and had created linear ruts. We measured continuously since September 2014, in three different situations (compacted-mound, compacted hollow and control), soil CO2 and CH4 effluxes using closed chamber coupled to a cavity ring down spectrometer in an young oak plantation.\nSince December 2015, in addition to these measurements, we have implanted hydrophobic tubes to measure vertical soil profiles of CH4, O2 and CO2 concentrations in the 3 situations.\nThe soil acts as CH4 sink, with no significant difference in net CH4uptake between control and both hollow and mound in the compacted treatment.\nHowever, the uptake of CH4 was significantly lower for the hollows than for the mounds resulting from both a lower diffusion of CH4 within soil and a higher production of CH4 in deeper layer when the soil is water saturated.",

An approximation of the model is used to examine the dependence of observable magnetosheath properties on the model parameters. An analytical expression for the bow shock distance is derived which depends on the planetary magnetic field. A spacecraft, crossing the bow shock, measures the solar wind conditions postshock and the shock’s location. This data is used to estimate the planetary field parameters. The magnetic field and density distribution close to the magnetopause are used to estimate the local plasma resistivity which is essential to distinguish between Hall reconnection and reconnection due to anomalous resistivity. Our model is used to reconstruct the solar wind parameters from spacecraft data during a magnetosheath passage. To obtain a more precise estimate of the parameters, a complete magnetosheath MHD simulation can be used. We present the results for the dipole and quadrupole moments of the Earth, estimated from magnetosheath observations. The dipole and quadrupole parameters are varied until the simulation results match the observations. To perform the time-consuming minimization procedure, we use an adjoint approach.",

            "abstract": "The biomass of tropical forests sequestrates tons of carbon and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle regulating the climate. Also its high biodiversity ecosystems bring us many valuable resources and cultural and educational ecosystem services. However, large areas of the tropical forest are deforested and converted to oil palm or acacia plantation for the economic benefit of the local society mainly in Southeast Asia. Monitoring of the tropical forest from satellites provides us the information about the deforestation for decadal time period over extensive areas and enables us to discuss it from a scientific point of view. The purpose of this study is to reveal the interannual change and recent trend of deforestation in relation to the land elevation for decadal time period over Borneo by using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).   We acquired the atmospherically corrected and cloud free Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS daily data products (MOD09GA and MYD09GA; collection 5) from 2001 to 2013 for Borneo. We extracted the pixel values in the 500m surface reflectance bands 1 (red) and 4 (green) products and calculated the green–red vegetation index (GRVI), (band 4 – band 1) / (band 4 + band 1), at a daily time step. GRVI shows a positive value for the land prevailed by green vegetation, while it shows a negative value for the land prevailed by no-green components such as bare land. As for the elevation data, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) which has 33.3m spatial resolution was employed. The original resolution was resampled to the grid system of MODIS data (i.e. 500m resolution).   Pixels which had a negative GRVI ratio more than 80 % (termed as “no green pixel”) in each year were regarded as the land characterized by no vegetation, and mapped the distribution for each year. Throughout the 13 years, no green pixels mainly found over the coastal low land below 20m of the elevation and the area was almost constant (around 3000km2). It is considered the deforestation for the plantations generally occurred over the easy access low lands. By contrast, it was obvious that no green pixels extended their distribution up to high elevation (20 to 120m) areas mainly after 2006. This trend suggests recent development of the plantation has been extended to relatively inland and high elevation areas.",

            "abstract": "The impact of global climate change on environment and society causes increasingly concern in different countries around the world. The main climate characteristic values, such as precipitation and temperature, have been changed, which leads to the variation of water resources, especially in large basins. Heilongjiang-Amur Basin and Taihu Basin are two large and important basins in China with large area and population. As global climate change and human activities have siganificant impacts on hydrology and water resources in two basins, the analysis of climate change are of great value. In this study, in Heilongjiang-Amur Basin, precipitation and temperature are investigated and their variation are predicted. And in Taihu Basin, precipitation including plum rain and typhoon, are studied and the variation trend of precipitation is predicted. Hence, the impacts of global climate change are assessed. From the result, it shows that the average temperature will continue to increase, and the precipitation will reduce first and then turn to increase in these two basins. It demonstrates that the water resources have been affected a lot by climate change as well as human activities. And these conclusions are provided as reference for policy makers and basin authorities in water resources management and natural hazards mitigation. Meanwhile, according to basins’ particualr characters, the suggestions to future water resources management in two basins are given, and more scientific, comprehensive and sustained managements are required. Especially, in Heilongjiang-Amur River, which is a boundary river between China and Russia, it is very essential to enhance the cooperation between two countries.",

            "abstract": "Using a VLF loop antenna located at subauroral latitudes in Athabasca (ATH), Canada (54.7N, 246.7E, L=4.3), we have been able to monitor almost ELF/VLF emissions almost continuously since September 2012. This data has allowed us to find a unique conjugate event of ELF/VLF waves between ATH and the RBSP-B satellite, associated with intense magnetic compression.\nThis event took place on December 23, 2014 at 11:17 UT (03:17 MLT) and lasted for a couple of minutes. It was observed just after an intense sudden commencement caused by an enhancement of solar wind speed (~330 to ~420 km/h) during northward IMF. Data from both sources show see a clear chorus emission with discrete elements (rising tones at ATH) centered at ~2 kHz. RBSP-B also sees a hiss-like emission at ~0.8 kHz, starting a minute before the chorus. We suggest the increasing magnetic field on the dayside, caused by the compression of the magnetosphere due to increased solar wind speed, caused betatron acceleration of plasma-sheet electrons. This leads to enhancement of the temperature anisotropy that regulates electron cyclotron instability and thus induced whistler-mode wave generation.\nWe use wave and particle measurements from RBSP-B to discuss the origins and properties of these emissions using both electric and magnetic field data. As the hiss-like emission started one-minute earlier than the chorus, we investigate if they were generated independently or if they instead correspond to upper and lower-band of a single emission. In addition, using electron flux data we examine possible relativistic electron acceleration caused by these chorus waves.",

            "abstract": "Many large cities in the world, including Tokyo and Los Angeles, are located atop sedimentary basins that have the potential to significantly amplify ground motions. The Kanto sedimentary basin, which underlies the Tokyo Metropolitan area, is filled by soft sediments and has a resonance period of 7-10 s, similar to the natural period of some tall buildings. To assess seismic hazard in this particularly seismically active area, we use the information carried by the ambient seismic field continuously recorded by more than 600 seismic stations that have been deployed in the basin. These stations equipped with three-component seismometers are a part of different networks, including the Metropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net), Hi-net and F-net of NIED, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) network. We extracted the 9 components of the Green's function tensors from the ambient seismic field using deconvolution for each pair of stations, regarding one as the virtual source and the other one as the receiver. We show that the extracted Green's functions contain body and surface waves having phase and amplification similar to the ones of earthquake records that occurred close to the virtual sources. For inter-station distances shorter than 30 km, time-frequency analyses suggest that Green's functions with energy higher than 1 Hz can be recovered. We use this dense array to investigate the effect of inter-station distance variations and azimuth dependences on the Green's function retrieval. Results show that the ambient seismic field recorded by stations situated at less than a few kilometers from each other can provide insights on seismic hazard assessment over a broad period range.",

            "abstract": "The Iranian Plateau was formed during the collision of the Arabian plate and Eurasia plate since ~30 Ma following the closure of the Neo-Tethys ocean. Comparing with the Tibetan Plateau to the east, the Iranian Plateau has lower elevation, thinner crust and less internal deformation. Whether these differences can be attributed to two successive stages of a common continent-continent collision process or two different orogenic processes is still under debate. Detailed information of structures at depth can provide key constraints on this debate and is essential for understanding the formation of the plateau.\nTo investigate the deep structure of the Iranian Plateau, we operated a temporary seismic array in northwestern Iran from October 2013 to October 2014, under a collaborative project named CIGSIP (China-Iran Geological and Geophysical Survey in the Iranian Plateau). This array started from the south of the Zagros belt, trending northeastward and ending at the coast area of the southern Caspian Sea. Using the continuous seismic data recorded by this seismic array of the CIGSIP project, we adopted ambient noise tomography to image the 3-D crustal shear velocity structure beneath the sampled area in northwestern Iran. To stabilize the inversion for shear velocities, we incorporated the prior constraints on the depths of the Moho and strong intra-crustal discontinuities from teleseismic receiver functions recorded by the same array. Systematic comparisons were further conducted among images with and without depth constraints incorporated and with various initial models adopted in the inversion, indicating that the resultant shear velocity images reveal robust structural features beneath the study area.\nOur results show that bounding by the Main Zagros Thrust (MZT), the crust exhibits different structural features on the two sides. Low velocity anomalies are mainly confined to the south of the MZT. The crust north of MZT is characterized by high velocities. Low velocity anomalies are also observed in the lower crust beneath the Alborz orogenic belt adjacent to the southern Caspian Sea. Strong azimuthal anisotropy paralelling to the strike of the Zagros belt is also observed in the middle to lower crust north of the MZT.",

            "abstract": "Many satellite data have been compared to ground-based data, which have higher accuracy and precision. Satellite and ground-based instruments generally observe target quantity with different spatial scale/position and different observation time, therefore, it is important to find more plausible coincidence criteria between them. In the case of validating GOSAT data with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), various methods in order to increase the number of match-up data have been used: “Geophysical” (e.g., Morino et al., 2011), “Meteorological” (Wunch et al., 2011), “Model” (Guerlet et al., 2013), and “Geostatistical” (Nguyen et al., 2014).Geophysical, Meteorological, and Model methods use match-up data within a geometric distance centered at each TCCON site, the same potential temperature field at 700-hPa as a proxy for equivalent latitude for CO2 gradients (Keppel-Aleks et al., 2011), and the same concentration field predicted or assimilated with atmospheric transport model (e.g., TM5, CarbonTracker, MACC-II), respectively. Geostatistical method decides a range of semivariogram based on kriging. The range indicates implicated resemblance by the covariance function with GOSAT and TCCON site of interest. We developed a match-up tool that implemented above-mentioned four types of co-locating methods for GOSAT-2, to be launched in early 2018, and applied to the GOSAT data. We present comparisons of areas and numbers of match-up data, and bias/correlation of GOSAT data at each TCCON site using our tool. In Meteorological method, we demonstrate the differences among atmospheric reanalysis data of NCEP, ERA Interim, MERRA, and JRA55.",

            "abstract": "Deep continental subductions are an input for material cycling from surface to deep mantle. The Kokchetav UHPM rocks are the best samples and evidence to understand chemical processes in subducting materials. Transportation of H2O and CO2, is the most important role of the deep continental subduction. Silicate rocks are H2O reservoirs as hydrate minerals and carbonate rocks are CO2 reservoirs during subduction. The timings of dehydrations in silicate rocks and decarbonations in carbonate rocks are different. Dehydrations precede decarbonations and H2O play as a trigger for decarbonations, which are difficult to occur under dry conditions in P-T range of UHP metamorphism. The amount of H2O infiltrating in carbonate rocks controls the amount of CO2 carried into the mantle.\nH2O-bearing fluid plays an important role for diamond formation during subduction of continental materials. Diamonds form and dissolve in subducting materials through H2O fluid. In UHP dolomite marble, diamonds formed at two different stages and 2nd stage growth was from H2O fluid. The diamond at 2nd stage growth has light carbon isotope compositions, -17 to -27 ‰, whereas 1st stage diamond has -8 to -15 ‰. The light carbon of 2nd stage could be organic carbon in gneisses carried by fluid; dissolution of diamond in gneisses had occurred. H2O fluid infiltration into dolomite marble caused the change of carbon solubility in fluid to precipitate abundant fine-grained (10-20 mm) diamonds quickly.\nDuring deep continental subductions, the abundant carbonate remains and are carried to the mantle. In the case of calc-silicate rocks, for example Grt-Cpx rock of the Kokchetav, the carbonate mode is small; therefore, even a small amount of H2O can decompose all amount of carbonate to form Grt and Cpx which contain several hundreds to 1,000 ppm order of water (OH and H2O), as new water reservoirs. UHP metasomatism with skarn mineral formation causes the swapping of H2O carrier from hydrate minerals in silicate rocks to NAMs in calc-silicate rocks to expand the life of H2O transportation into mantle much longer.\nCO2 transportation is controlled by H2O in subducted materials, and poor amount of H2O expands the volume of CO2 transported into the deep mantle as carbonate. Summarizing these, “Intraslab UHP metasomatism” was proposed.",

            "abstract": "Observations, models and paleoclimate reconstructions suggest that Antarctica’s marine-based ice sheets behave in an unstable manner with episodes of rapid retreat in response to warming climate. Understanding the processes involved in this “marine ice sheet instability” is key for improving estimates of Antarctic ice sheet contribution to future sea-level rise. Another motivating factor is that far-field sea-level reconstructions and ice sheet models imply global mean sea level (GMSL) was up to 20m and 10m higher, respectively, compared with present day, during the interglacials of the warm Pliocene (~4-3Ma) and Late Pleistocene (at ~400ka and 125ka). This was when atmospheric CO2 was between 280 and 400ppm and global average surface temperatures were 1- 3°C warmer, suggesting polar ice sheets are highly sensitive to relatively modest increases in climate forcing. Such magnitudes of GMSL rise not only require near complete melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but a substantial retreat of marine-based sectors of East Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nRecent geological drilling initiatives on the continental margin of Antarctica from both ship- (e.g. IODP; International Ocean Discovery Program) and ice-based (e.g. ANDRILL/Antarctic Geological Drilling) platforms have provided evidence supporting retreat of marine-based ice. However, without direct access through the ice sheet to archives preserved within sub-glacial sedimentary basins, the volume and extent of ice sheet retreat during past interglacials cannot be directly constrained. Sediment cores have been successfully recovered from beneath ice shelves by the ANDRILL Program and ice streams by the WISSARD (Whillans Ice Stream Sub-glacial Access Research Drilling) Project. Together with the potential of the new RAID (Rapid Access Ice Drill) initiative, these demonstrate the technological feasibility of accessing the subglacial bed and deeper sedimentary archives. In this talk I will outline the scientific challenges, some potential sub-glacial sedimentary targets, and a strategy for future drilling of sub-glacial sedimentary basins.",

Recently, many studies try to find out the relationship between solar activity, atmosphere and ocean dynamics and changes in the terrestrial environments. The Mediterranean is a very sensitive area with respect to atmospheric dynamics due to (1) its location, right in the boundary between subtropical and temperate climate systems and (2) the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is one of the main mechanism that influence present climate in this area. Here we present a multi-proxy high-resolution study from Borreguil de la Caldera (BdlC), a peat bog that records the last ca. 4500 cal yr BP of vegetation, fire, human impact and climate history from the Sierra Nevada. The pollen, charcoal and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) reconstruction in the BdlC-01 record evidence relative humidity changes in the last millennia interrupting the late Holocene aridification trend. This study shows a relative arid period between ca. 4000 and 3100 cal yr BP; the Iberian Roman humid period (ca. 2600 to 1600 cal yr BP); a relative arid period during the Dark Ages (from ca. AD 500 to AD 900) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (from ca. AD 900 to ca. AD 1300) and predominantly wetter conditions corresponding with The Little Ice Age period (from ca. AD 1300 to AD 1850). This climate variability could be explained by centennial scale changes in the NAO and solar activity.",

            "abstract": "Changes in climate and land-use have and will continue to modify regional hydrology, in turn impacting environmental health, agricultural productivity and water resource quality and availability. The Baltic region is an area of interest as the coast spans nine countries- serving over 100 million people. The Baltic Sea contains one of the largest human caused hypoxic dead zones due to eutrophication driven by anthropogenic excess loading of nutrients. Policies to reduce these loads include also international directives and agreements, such as the EU Water Framework Directive, adopted in 2000 to protect and improve water quality throughout the European Union, and the Baltic Sea Action Plan under the Helsinki Commission aimed specifically at reducing the nutrient loading to and mitigating the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea. In light of these policies and amidst the number of studies on the Baltic Sea we ask, using the accessible nutrient and discharge data what does nutrient loading look like today? Are the most excessive loads going down? Observed nutrient and flow time series across Sweden allow for answering these questions, by spatial and temporal trend analysis of loads from various parts of Sweden to the Baltic Sea. Analyzing these observed time series in conjunction with the ecological health status classifications of the EU Water Framework Directive, allows in particular for answering the question if the loads into the water bodies with the poorest water quality, and from those to the Baltic Sea, are improving, being maintained or deteriorating. Such insight is required to contribute to relevant and efficient water and nutrient load management. Furthermore, empirically calculating nutrient loads, rather than only modeling, reveals that the water body health classification may not reflect what water bodies actually contribute the heaviest loads to the Baltic Sea. This work also underscores the importance of comprehensive analysis of all available data from long term monitoring programs over large spatial scales, including large water quality gradients, in order to assess and address water management problems of today and the future.",

            "abstract": "Kyrgyzstan is the most seismically active nation in the world, owning to the uplift of the Tien Shan mountain range. This record of faulting is far from simple though, with different dates of initiation spanning tens of millions of years in the published literature. Differentiating between these extremes is vital in terms of constructing earthquake hazard maps for the country. Much of the high degree of uncertainty comes from a lack of datable rocks within the time frame associated with the faulting. While paleomagnetic stratigraphic analyses provide highly accurate ages, they in turn need calibration points to preclude multiple possible matches to a global geochronological framework. Herein I provide the first description of Neogene fossil mammal faunas to act as biostratigraphic control for the paleomagnetic data. Dominating the faunal assemblage is rhinoceros species, Chilotherium anderssoni. This taxon is globally only known from 8.7-5.3 million years ago, constraining much of the stratigraphy to the latest Miocene to Pliocene. Additional taxa include Gazella, Samotherium, Hipparion, Hyaenaictithirium, Paleolagus, and Pliocervidae. As fossils are limited to the Miocene/Pliocene Chu Formation, we have also collected additional paleomagnetic samples from the lower Shamsi Formation to extend the age range covered and constraint the initiation of faulting.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1980s, the notion that the Earth’s mantle has a “solar” isotopic signature for neon has been favoured. Indeed, the 20Ne/22Ne ratio is above 12.5 in the mantle sources of OIB and MORB, close to the solar composition (13.4 for the Sun or 13.8 for the solar wind) and different from both atmospheric and chondritic compositions (Phase Q, Neon A). The most well accepted process invoked to explain this observed solar composition in the mantle is dissolution into a magma ocean of solar gases captured by gravity around the proto-Earth. However, Earth was accreted after gas from the proto-planetary disk had evaporated, suggesting that Earth itself could not have captured such a solar primordial atmosphere. Only planetary embryos were formed when the gas was still present in the disk. However, these planetary embryos with the mass of Mars are not massive enough to capture a solar dense atmosphere able to incorporate enough neon into the mantle. New estimates of the neon isotopic compositions of both the Earth’s mantle and of the implanted solar wind into grains suggest that the origin of the neon on Earth is related to solar wind irradiation on µm grains before planetary accretion started and not dissolution. Although incorporation of solar ions by this process is only significant for very volatiles (depleted) elements, the irradiation by x-rays has important consequences for the bulk chemistry of irradiated grains as it has been demonstrated that it produces depletion in Mg and Si, relatively to O (e.g Bradley et al., 1994), a pattern also observed for the Bulk silicate Earth.\n",

            "abstract": "The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), in the northern parts of south Asia, are subjected to dense haze/fog during winter months, on an annual basis. The thick fog prevalent during December/January months is both persistent and widespread in nature, often covering the entire IGP which stretches over 1500km in length. This study used multi-spectral imagery from MODIS data, to develop algorithms for daytime as well as nighttime detection of fog during winter 2000 to 2014 over the IGP. Specifically, our nighttime detection algorithm employs a bispectral thresholding technique, involving brightness temperature difference (BTD) between two spectral channels- 3.9 and 11.02µm. The theoretical basis for the detection using the 3.9 µm and 11.02 µm channels rely on the particular emissive properties of the two channels for fog droplets (Bendix and Bachmann, 1991). The small droplets found in fog are less emissive at 3.9 µm than at 11.02 µm. Brightness temperatures computed from corresponding radiance data (MODIS Level-1B) of band 22 (3.9 µm) and band 31 (11.02 µm), in conjunction with theoretical calculations from a radiative transfer (RT) model, were utilized to evaluate threshold value of BTD. Using theoretical RT calculations and automated analysis of hundreds of moderately high resolution satellite imagery (pixel resolution of 1km), our threshold cutoff for foggy pixels results in BTD value of 4 (deg) K. Additionally, to minimize contamination, we apply a spatial variability filter to discriminate the uniform texture of fog from other low-level clouds. A similar methodology based on BTD is also tested for daytime fog detection and separation from other cloud types. Furthermore, on the basis of operational multispectral retrievals of cloud properties (cloud effective radius, cloud top pressure, and cloud fraction) from MODIS, we have also processed spatial occurrences of fog climatology from 2000 to 2014. To validate our satellite retrieval algorithm of fog detection from MODIS during daytime and nighttime, we have performed a co-located intercomparison with surface meteorological data of fog over several locations in the IGP, including the regional analysis of various meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction and visibility.",

Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), where excess surface water is injected into subsurface aquifers for later recovery, is one promising strategy for managing surplus water and may overcome water shortages. The performance of an ASR scheme is generally evaluated in terms of recovery efficiency, which is defined as percentage of water injected in to a system in an ASR site that fulfills the targeted water quality criterion. Site selection of an ASR scheme typically faces great challenges, due to the spatial variability of groundwater quality and hydrogeological condition. This study proposes a novel method for the ASR site selection based on drinking quality criterion.

In this study, we examined the physical properties of sediments using on-board data and laboratory experimental data on sediments obtained off Costa Rica margin.\nTarget sites are in the Integrate Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 344 off Costa Rica, including reference sites (U1381 and U1414), mid-slope site (U1378, U1380) and upper-slope site (U1413). Seven samples from reference sites were analyzed.\nLaboratory experiments for velocity and porosity measurements were conducted with variation of effective pressure. Velocity-porosity relationships from on-board data and from laboratory experiments are comparable. The porosity-effective pressure curves under isotropic condition were converted to the curves under uniaxial condition (Teeuw, 1971). Using the normal consolidation curves under uniaxial stress conditions, we converted onboard porosity to effective pressure and fluid pressure.\nIn reference sites, hydrostatic fluid pressure was estimated as expected as a reference sites, suggesting that porosity-effective pressure relationship was obtained correctly by experiments and it can be adapted to estimation of fluid pressure for the wedge sites. The porosity-effective pressure relationship under isotropic conditions were used for the estimation in wedge sites.\nIn wedge sites, estimated pore pressures show lower than hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that onboard porosity was lower than that under normal compaction. The lower porosity can be caused by relative uplift from deeper portion. The amount of relative uplift can be estimated by differences in porosity-depth relationships between onboard data and experimental data.\nThe amount of relative uplift for each site shows more than ~1000m up to ~5000m. The small error in porosity depth curve from experimental data makes relative uplift larger or smaller exponentially in the deeper portion. The increment of relative uplift, however, starts from about 1Ma in each site, suggesting some events were occurred at the timing. Laboratory experiments under differential stress should be conducted in the near future because smaller porosity is expected under differential stress conditions.",

Mahmud et al. (2015) used the Terrestrial LiDAR measurements to analyze stalactite morphology and to characterize possible flow locations in this cave. Here we identify the stalactites feeding the drip loggers and classify each as matrix (soda straw or icicle), fracture or combined-flow. These morphology-based classifications are compared with flow characteristics from the drip logger time series and the discharge from each stalactite is calculated. The total estimated discharge from each area is compared with infiltration estimates to better understand flow from the surface to the cave ceilings of the studied areas.\nThe drip discharge data agrees with the morphology-based flow classification in terms of flow and geometrical characteristics of cave ceiling stalactites. No significant relationships were observed between the drip logger discharge, skewness and coefficient of variation with overburden thickness, due to the possibility of potential vadose-zone storage volume and increasing complexity of the karst architecture. However, these properties can be used to characterize different flow categories. A correlation matrix demonstrates that similar flow categories are positively correlated, implying significant influence of spatial distribution. The infiltration water comes from a larger surface area, suggesting that infiltration is being focused to the studied ceiling areas of each chamber. Most of the ceiling in the cave site is dry, suggesting the possibility of capillary effects with water moving around the cave rather than passing through it.\n",

Various kinds of geophysical survey as well as drilling and geological survey should be used to know the status of deep bedrock. A research had been conducted to make the site characterization of deep bedrock for several years, and to achieve its purpose, integrated geophysical survey were applied to the test area which had gneiss bedrock. DC resistivity survey for six surficial profiles was conducted to find the appropriate location of drilling survey. Cross-hole/surface-to-hole resistivity tomography survey and borehole reflection radar survey were applied to the drill holes after its installation completed. Three bore holes of which length was 500 meter were drilled to investigate the status of deep bedrock, and cross-hole tomography survey was applied between two boreholes among these. Also borehole reflection radar survey was conducted to another two boreholes. Deep seated fracture zones which were not identified with the surficial geological and resistivity survey were found through the analysis of tomography section. Fracture zones were consisted of steep slope fault and these were also identified with the result of borehole radar section. After the basic survey was completed, one of three holes was extended to the depth of 1 km. Radar reflection survey which was only available to the deep drill-hole was applied. Because steel casing was installed to the depth of 750 m to stabilize the extended drill-hole, resistivity method was not available and borehole radar reflection method was only available among the geophysical method used in this research. Through results of radar reflection survey, several fracture zones were identified for the newly extended section of drill hole and some of those facture has relatively large size and passed through the bore hole.",

            "abstract": "The most remarkable lineament of microseismicity in the Japanese Islands exists along the northern coastline in the San-in region that is a northern half of the westernmost part of Honshu in southwest Japan. Several M~7 earthquakes including the 1943 Tottori, and the 2000 Western Tottori earthquakes occurred along the lineament. However, no well-developed active fault has been identified in and around the lineament. Though several previous studies proposed a large dextral shear zone corresponding to seismicity lineament in the San-in region, none of them dealt with geodetic data. In this study, we report that a high strain rate is concentrated along the seismicity lineament from cGNSS observations. We propose to call this deformed zone “the San-in shear zone”.\nThe GNSS data used in this study are from the GEONET data operated by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan. We estimate interseismic velocities by fitting a linear function to daily GNSS coordinates estimated with both Bernese and GIPSY software. We recognize the following characteristics in the velocity distribution in the San-in region and its vicinity (Fig. 1). First, a northern limit of the observed northwestward velocity due to interplate coupling on the subducting Philippine Sea plate locates in and around the Seto Inland Sea. Second, the inland San-in region does not significantly deform though the northern coast of the San-in regions moves eastward with a velocity of 4 mm/yr relative to the inland region. The observed right-lateral shear deformation is generally localized along the lineament of seismicity and continues more than 200 km long along the coast of the Japan Sea. Velocity profile across the shear zone is roughly reproduced by a 2-dimensional dislocation model for a vertical strike-slip fault with a locking depth of 5~15 km.\nThe San-in shear zone can be interpreted as strain portioning to accommodate strike slip component of oblique subduction along the Nankai Trough. The Median Tectonic Line (MTL) is a famous example of such a strain portioning. The San-in shear zone may be the second and parallel fault system 150 km north of the MTL, which accommodates a half of dextral component of the MTL.",

Currently, the German-French methane mission MERLIN (Methan Remote Lidar Mission) is prepared. At the same time CHARM-F, an aircraft installed system has been developed at DLR as an airborne demonstrator for a spaceborne greenhouse gas mission. Both use e.g. optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) in a double-pulse mode as the transmitter. Of particular importance for both instruments are the sub-modules required for the frequency stabilization of the transmitter wavelength and, since the IPDA technique, in contrast to DIAL, requires the exact knowledge of the energy ratio of outgoing on-line. The coherence of the lidar transmitter gives rise to speckle effects which have to be considered for the monitoring of the energy ratio of outgoing on- and off-line pulses. For the frequency reference of CHARM-F, a very successful stabilization scheme has been developed which will also serve as the reference for MERLIN. In Spring 2015, CHARM-F was flown aboard the German HALO aircraft for the first time which enables a detailed view on the performance of both the energy calibration and frequency reference subsystems under real flight conditions. As an initial quality check we will compared the airborne results to previous lab measurements which have been performed under stable environmental conditions. ",

Based on long-term GNSS observations, we observed the abnormal deformations occurred around the active faults in Yunnan area before the earthquakes of magnitude MW³5.0. We constructed the regional strain fields with networks filtering, and extracted the abnormal deformations of each grid before each strong coming earthquake. Such special deformations of the GNSS observation are able to serve for short-impending earthquake prediction. The SIA-GPS method includes three steps. Firstly, Yunnan region is divided into multiple grids using interpolation calculation，and the uniform displacement field is created. The area velocity field is obtained based on the continuous GNSS observations using GAMIT/GLOBK software. Next, the earthquake response capacity of each grid is evaluated in time-series analysis focusing on strains, and the short-term anomalies are easily extracted. Lastly, all the abnormal signals are carefully diagnosed in the considerations of tectonic movements. As examples, we predicated 19 earthquakes using the (SIA-GPS) method. 14 earthquakes of them are successful within the tolerable special and time misfits, and 5 of them do not occurred. The code of predication for short-impending earthquake requires that all the coming earthquakes of Mw³5 must be predicated, the maximum time error for coming event is three months, and the corresponding spatial misfit allows 5 grids. Following this role, 14 earthquakes of Mw³5 are predicted using SIA-GPS indicators with success rate 73.6%. For such experiences, SIA-GPS method has been utilized as a benefit tool to predicate the potential coming earthquakes in Earthquake Administration of Yunnan Province.\nKeywords：Short-impending anomaly of GPS, SIA-GPS, time series of analysis, GNSS observation, earthquake prediction, surface deformation, strain, Yunnan area.",

            "abstract": "Not only aerosol’s direct effect on climate by scattering and absorbing the incident solar radiation, but also they indirectly perturbs the radiation budget by influencing microphysics and dynamics of clouds. Aerosols also have a significant adverse impact on human health. With an importance of aerosols in climate, considerable research efforts have been made to quantify the amount of aerosols in the form of the aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD is provided with ground-based aerosol networks such as the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET), and is derived from satellite measurements. However, these observational datasets have a limited areal and temporal coverage. To compensate for the data gaps, there have been several studies to provide AOD without data gaps by assimilating observational data and model outputs. In this study, AODs over East Asia simulated with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and derived from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) observation are interpolated via different data assimilation (DA) techniques such as Cressman’s method, Optimal Interpolation (OI), and Kriging for the period of the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON) Campaign (March – May 2012). Here, the interpolated results using the three DA techniques are validated intensively by comparing with AERONET AODs to examine the optimal DA method providing the most reliable AODs over East Asia.",

            "abstract": "Mass-wasting on the NE Atlantic margin is commonly attributed to Cenozoic glaciations. Using high-quality and high-resolution seismic dataset, this study investigates the types and mechanisms driving mass-wasting in the Sørvestsnaget Basin, Southwestern Barents. Seven mass-transport deposits (MTDs) ranging in age from Late Miocene to Holocene are interpreted on seismic profiles. The MTDs are vertically stacked from about 1900 ms TWTT to the present seabed. MTD 5 (area ca.1.22 x 103 km2, volume ca.3.4 x 103 km3) is the largest deposit in the study area and is composed largely of debrites and rafted blocks underlain by thin layers of hemipelagic sediments. Miocene and Early Pliocene MTDs in the basin demonstrate tendency for initial translation through canyons and channels. The youngest MTDs in the area are composed of glacigenic sediments remobilized by ice streams during Late Neogene and Quaternary glaciations. In the southern part of the study area, deep-water sediments fed through V-shaped canyons and channels are widespread signifying the Stappen High as the main sediment source area prior to the Late Pliocene. The prevalence of shallow marine successions in the northern part of the study area is linked to the southwesterly propagation of the shelf break from Miocene to Recent times. In this study, the shelf break trajectory is important for reconstructing paleo-sediment routes and dispersal pattern. The older non-glacial MTDs are separated farther from their paleo-shelf break. Mass-wasting is a recurrent process in the Sørvestsnaget Basin. Triggering mechanisms for slope failure in the basin may include increased pore pressure as a result of sea level fall and high sedimentation rate, over-steepened slope, glaciation, volcanism, and gas hydrate dissociation. Mass-wasting in the study area occurred through progressive, retrogressive and whole body or coherent downslope failures.",

            "abstract": "Globally, soil is vital to the mitigation of climate change. In tropical forests, the soil contains an estimated 216 Gt of carbon, equivalent to half of the total carbon in the tropical forest ecosystem. Little is known regarding changes in soil carbon following land use changes in tropical regions. We examined the differences in carbon dynamics in a chronosequence of Acacia mangium plantations established on grasslands following the deforestation of natural forest in north-eastern Thailand. The study site was located at the Sakaerat Silvicultural Research Station (14º28′06.1″N, 101º54′15.0″E; altitude 420 m asl), Nakhon Rachasima Province, north-eastern Thailand. Mean annual air temperature was 26ºC, and annual precipitation was 1,100 mm, with a dry (November–April) and wet (May–October) season. Soil carbon and the stable carbon isotope ratio (d13C) in the surface soil (0–5 and 5–10 cm deep) were determined at 12 and 24 years following establishment of A. mangium plantations, as well as for secondary forest and grassland. Using the stable carbon isotope mixing model based on differences in the natural abundance of d13C in plants with C3 (i.e., trees) and C4 (i.e., grasses) pathways for CO2 fixation, the amount of soil carbon derived from the plantations, forest, and grassland was calculated. Soil carbon at a depth of 10 cm was higher in the secondary forest (1,929 gCm-2) and grassland (2,508 gCm-2) than in the plantations (1,703 gCm-2 at 12 years, 1,673gCm-2 at 24 years). Soil carbon derived from A. mangium was 67% (0–5 cm deep) and 62% (5–10 cm deep) of total soil carbon at 12 years, and was 100% (0–5 cm deep) and 90% (5–10 cm deep) at 24 years in the plantations. We found that most of the soil carbon at a depth of 0–5 cm in the young plantation changed from grass-derived to tree-derived carbon within a relatively short period of 24 years. Because of changes in soil carbon, exotic, fast growing plantations like those of A. mangium are needed to quickly convert back to an indigenous forest.",

However, obtaining reliable projections of water resources remains a challenge in the wake of large uncertainties in projections of climate and land use change. Thus, alternative assessment criteria independent of projections of climate and land use change would be useful in providing decision makers with an approximate evaluation of vulnerability of a watershed to change. Here, we present an analysis to ascertain the vulnerability of watersheds to climate and land use change independent of future projections. Using a recently developed bottom up approach, we first identify critical thresholds of climate and land use change across 78 watersheds of United States. Then, we explore the relationship between critical climate thresholds and watershed characteristics to identify characteristics that are correlated to these thresholds. We perform this analysis for various streamflow indicators that capture the magnitude, frequency, and duration of flows. We find significant negative correlation between soil properties like average percentage sand and critical threshold of precipitation change causing vulnerability of indicator representing water availability – mean annual streamflow. This indicates that higher amounts of sand content in soils may be related with reduced vulnerability to climatic changes. We also find significant positive correlation between urban land use and critical threshold of precipitation change across the watersheds for mean annual streamflow. This suggests that watersheds with higher urban land use may be more vulnerable to precipitation change.",

            "abstract": "The kinetic, semi-implicit, adaptive Multi-Level Multi-Domain (MLMD) method is used to simulate, at realistic mass ratio, the development of turbulence generated by the Lower Hybrid Drift Instability (LHDI) in the terrestrial magnetotail over a large range of wavenumbers. The MLMD method reduces the cost of Particle in Cell (PIC) simulations by using higher temporal and spatial resolution only in a small part of the entire domain [Innocenti13, Beck14, Innocenti15]. This reduction in computational cost allows to increase the range of wavenumber simulated with respect to “traditional” PIC simulations and makes the MLMD method a useful approach to explore the multi scale nature of turbulent processes.\nThe power spectra of the fluctuations of the perpendicular electric field and of the magnetic field are studied at wavenumbers and times that allow to appreciate the onset of the electrostatic and electromagnetic LHDI branches and of the ion-ion kink instability. The coupling between electric and magnetic field fluctuations observed in Norgren [2012] for high wavenumber LHDI waves in the terrestrial magnetotail is verified. A break in the magnetic field fluctuation spectra at kdi ∼ 30, with di the ion skin depth and k the perpendicular wavenumber, is observed at early simulated times, Ωcit < 6, with Ωci the ion cyclotron frequency. It is explained with the initial decoupling of electric and magnetic field fluctuations at intermediate and low wavenumbers prior to the development of the electromagnetic LHDI branch. It is observed that the coupling is mediated by the electron current in the electrostatic and electromagnetic LHDI wavenumber range and by the ion current in the kink instability wavenumber range.\nM.

            "abstract": "Stresses within the oceanic plate in trench axis and outer-rise region have been characterized by shallow extension and deep compression due to the bending of the plate subducting into the trench. The stress state within the incoming/subducting oceanic plate is an important factor not only for the occurrence of shallow intraplate normal-faulting earthquakes in the trench-outer rise region but also the hydration of the oceanic plate through the shallow normal faults cutting the oceanic lithosphere. We investigate seismic velocity structure and stress state within the incoming/subducting Pacific Plate in the Japan Trench based on the OBS aftershock observations for the December 2012 intraplate doublet, which consists of a deep reverse faulting (Mw 7.2) and a shallow normal faulting (Mw 7.2) earthquake, in the Japan Trench off Miyagi. Hypocenter locations and seismic velocity structures were estimated from the arrival time data of about 3000 earthquakes by using double-difference tomography method (Zhang and Thurber, 2003). Also, focal mechanisms were estimated from first motion polarities by using the program HASH by Hardebeck and Shearer (2002). The results show that the earthquakes occurred mainly within the oceanic crust and the uppermost mantle. The deepest event was located at a depth of about 60 km. Focal mechanisms of the earthquakes shallower than a depth of 40 km indicate normal-faulting with T-axis normal to the trench. On the other hand, first motion polarities of the events at depths between 50 and 60 km can be explained a reverse faulting. The results suggest that the neutral plane of the stress between shallow extension and deep compression locates at 40 to 50 km deep. Seismic velocity structures indicate velocity decrease in the oceanic mantle toward the trench. Although the velocity decrease varies with locations, the results suggest the bending-related structure change could extend to at least about 15 km below the oceanic Moho in some locations.",

            "abstract": "Among the physical processes that affect the amplitude of seismic waves, attenuation is one of the most poorly understood and undetermined factor. Two basic mechanisms control seismic attenuation in the crust: scattering by small-scale heterogeneities, and absorption of seismic energy by inelastic and irreversible processes. A number of techniques have been devised to retrieve attenuation information from the modeling of direct seismic waves emitted by earthquakes. However, a major issue with the use of ballistic signals lies in the fact that their amplitude is affected by multiple factors that are difficult to disentangle in practice: radiation pattern, focussing/defocussing or site effects. Moreover, since both scattering and absorption manifest themselves as an approximately exponential decay of direct wave amplitude with distance, it is not possible to separate their effects from attenuation measurements based on ballistic waves only. In this work, we propose a multiple scattering approach to map independently scattering and absorption properties of the crust using seismic coda waves. To this end, we introduce a model of energy transport of seismic energy known as radiative transfer and use perturbation theory to derive sensitivity kernels for the intensity detected in the coda. Numerical evaluation of these kernels demonstrates that coda waves possess distinct spatial sensitivities to absorption and scattering. These results pave the way for the development of a genuine tomographic approach to the mapping of absorption and scattering in the crust. Preliminary results on the absorption structure of the Alps in the 1-32 Hz frequency reveal some interesting correlations with the geology at spatial scales ranging from a few tens to a few thousand kilometers. Regions of high absorption delineate sedimentary structures such as basins, grabens and alluvial valleys while localized zones of weak absorption correlate with mantellic or plutonic intrusions such as the Ivrea body or the Adamello intrusive complex (see Figure). It is suggested that the frequency-dependent attenuation structure bears information on the stratification of absorption in the crust.",

            "abstract": "Understanding bedload transport processes in steep mountain streams is essential for disaster mitigation as well as predicting reservoir capacity and restoration of river ecosystem. Despite various monitoring methods proposed previously, precise bedload monitoring in steep streams still remains difficulty. This study aimed to develop a bedload monitoring system by continuous measurement of thickness and porosity of sediment under water that can be applicable to retention basins and pools in steep streams. When a probe of TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) measurement system is inserted as to penetrate two adjacent layers with different dielectric constants, analysis of TDR waveform enables us to determine position of the layer boundary and ratio of materials in the layer. Methodology of analyzing observed TDR waveforms were established based on results of a series of column experiment, in which a single TDR probe with length of 40 cm was installed in a column filled with water and, then, sand was supplied gradually. Flume experiment was performed to apply the TDR system on monitoring sediment volume under flowing water conditions. Eight probes with lengths of 27 cm were distributed equally in a model retention basin (i.e., container), into which water and bedload were flowed from a connected flume. The model retention basin was weighed by a load cell and the sediment volume was calculated. A semi-automatic waveform analysis was developed to calculate continuously thicknesses and porosities of the sediment at the eight probes. Relative errors of sediment volume and bedload (=time differential of the volume) were 13 % at maximum, suggesting that the TDR system proposed in this study with multiple probes is applicable to bedload monitoring in retention basins of steep streams. Combination of this system and other indirect bedload monitoring method (e.g., geophone) potentially make a breakthrough for understanding sediment transport processes in steep mountain streams.",

            "abstract": "Two alluvial profiles showing evidences of tectonic movements were discovered along the right bank of the Niger River at Bamako. The first profile of 25 meters thick is composed of a laminated silt layer of about 22 meters, of a gray sand layer of 25 cm and a pebble layer of 2 meters. A layer of 80 cm wide, an intrusive body, crosscuts the silt layers. The Grain size and heavy minerals analysis showed that this vertical layer is different in structure, texture and composition from the other layers. The second profile of about 20 meters is composed of interbedded fluvial gravel and sand deposits.\nThe tectonic evidences found on those layers are of three types: faults and fractures, folds and the intrusion between silts deposits of the sand layers previously presented. The faults and fractures are located mainly on the fluvial gravel and sand deposits, whereas the silts deposits are folded and show some microfaults. The intrusion of a sand layer between the silt layer is a geological process that is not yet well understood but it is believed that this phenomena occurs during earthquakes as the sand layer during such event behave as a liquid. The discovery of such layer testifies that earthquakes used to happen in the area. As they concern only the alluvial deposits, their age should be no more than the Quaternary period.\nThe presence of such tectonic evidences is surprising as Bamako like all the Republic of Mali is located on the west African craton that is supposed to be tectonically stable and their occurrence on Quaternary unconsolidated sediments shows that tectonic movements used to occur on that area during the last 2 millions years or may be less whereas people continue to build houses and other social infrastructures on them without any caution.",

            "abstract": "Jellyfish can be asexual and sexual reproduction depending on the environment, and it has excellent environmental adaptability and reproduction than other sea creatures. If the marine environment become worse, jellyfish can take advantage in the competition for survival. Marine environmental changes caused by rapid climate change, dyke construction and land reclamation will increase the amount of jellyfish and as a result can lead to a various social and economic problems.\nIn this study, jellyfish were observed in coastal area using a low-altitude Helikite remote sensing system for the first time. Helikite is a type of helium balloon plus a kite that can get the data with optical sensors for the desired spatial resolutions by adjusting the altitudes. In addition, it has an advantage that can monitor any objects for a long time at one place as long as the electric power and helium last. In this study, we observed the jellyfish patches using a digital camera in the Chesapeake Bay and estimate populations and size of jellyfish patches through image processing. Research results suggests that we can have long-term real-time observations for not only jellyfish, but also other harmful marine creatures.",

            "abstract": "We attempt to understand borehole tensor strainmeter signals in terms of stress changes associated with earthquake occurrence. Several borehole strainmeters installed in Anza, southern California were measuring borehole strains when two earthquakes (>M5) occurred nearby in 2010: M7.2 Baja California (BC) earthquake and M5.4 Southern California (SC) earthquake. We first calculate the principal strain tensor from noise-filtered strains in three azimuths, which may represent crustal deformation around the strainmeters. Then the strains are transformed into stress tensor based on a simple assumption of elastic crust, which gives changes in stress orientations and magnitudes as a function of time. We observed that changes in the orientations and the magnitudes of stresses were captured in the strainmeter signals when the two earthquakes occurred. The pre-earthquake stresses can be characterized by subtle increases in stress magnitudes predominantly in N-S direction, which is consistent with the focal mechanisms of the two earthquakes. When the earthquakes hit, sudden stress drops took place in approximately N-S direction, after which stresses were stabilized within 1 hour. The evaluated stress drops at the strainmeter site were at an order of 10-2 MPa for the BC earthquake and 10-3 MPa for the SC earthquake, which are lower by two order and three order of magnitude, respectively, than the maximum stress drops associated with the two earthquakes. Coulomb stress transfer models show that the modelled stresses transferred to the strainmeter locations are similar to, or an order lower than the strainmeter data. Our study demonstrates that the strainmeter data can be utilized for stress analysis, if strainmeters are installed in a way to capture representative crustal deformation.",

Given the suddenness and the unpredictability of the location of natural hazards as well as the actual demands for hazards work, this article proposes an evaluation model for remote sensing detecting of natural hazards based on crowdsourcing. Firstly, using crowdsourcing model and with the help of the Internet and the power of hundreds of millions of Internet users, this evaluation model provides visual interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing images of hazards area and collects massive valuable disaster data; secondly, this evaluation model adopts the strategy of dynamic voting consistency to evaluate the disaster data provided by the crowdsourcing workers; thirdly, this evaluation model pre-estimates the disaster severity with the disaster pre-evaluation model based on regional buffers; lastly, the evaluation model actuates the corresponding expert system work according to the forecast results. The idea of this model breaks the boundaries between geographic information professionals and the public, makes the public participation and the citizen science eventually be realized, and improves the accuracy and timeliness of hazards assessment results.",

            "abstract": "Calbuco is a 2015m high, glacier capped, stratovolcano in the heavily populated Los Lagos district of southern Chile with a history of large volcanic eruptions in 1893–95, 1906–7, 1911–12, 1917, 1932, 1945, 1961 and 1972. Calbuco experienced a powerful 90 minute eruption at 18:04h on 22 April, 2015 followed by additional major eruptions at 01:00h and 13:10h on 23 & 30 April, respectively, resulting in the evacuation of 6500 people and the imposition of a 20 km radius exclusion zone. Pyroclastic flows descended into several river catchments radiating from the volcano with lahars travelling distances of up to 14 km, reaching populated areas. We present preliminary findings regarding the causes, dynamics and impacts of lahars generated by the April 2015 eruption. Pyroclastic flows melted glacier ice and snow generating the largest lahars in the Rio Este and Rio Blanco Sur on the southern flanks of the volcano. Lahar deposits in the Rio Blanco Norte were buried by pyroclastic flow deposits with measured temperatures of up to 282°C three months after emplacement. Lahar erosional impacts included bedrock erosion, alluvial channel incision, erosion of surficial deposits and the felling of large areas of forest. Depositional landforms included boulder run-ups on the outsides of channel bends, boulder clusters and large woody debris jams. Lahars deposited up to 8m of sediment within distal reaches. Deposits on the southern flanks of Calbuco indicate the passage of multiple pulses of contrasting rheology. Lahar occurrence and magnitude was controlled by the pre-eruption distribution of snow and ice on the volcano. Pre-existing lahar channels controlled flows to lower piedmont zones where routing was determined by palaeo lahar geomorphology. Ongoing erosion of proximal pyroclastic flow and lahar deposits provides large volumes of sediment to distal portions of fluvial systems radiating from Calbuco.",

            "abstract": "During the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiments (NanTroSEIZE) of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), the advanced piston corer temperature (APC-T) tool was used to determine in situ formation temperatures while piston coring down to ~200 m below sea floor. When the corer is fired into the formation, temperature around the shoe abruptly increases due to the frictional heating. The temperature rise due to the frictional heat at the time of penetration is 10 K or larger. We found that the frictional temperature rise (=maximum temperature) increases with increasing depth, and that its intersection at the seafloor seems non-zero.\nFrictional heat energy is proportional to the maximum temperature rise, which is confirmed by a FEM numerical simulation of 2D cylindrical system. Here we use the result of numerical simulation to convert the observed temperature rise into the frictional heat energy. The frictional heat energy is represented as the product of the shooting length D and the shear stress (τ) between the pipe and the sediment. Assuming a coulomb slip regime, the shear stress is shows as: τ= τ0 + μ*(Sv-Pp), where τ0 is the cohesive stress, μ the dynamic frictional coefficient between the pipe and the sediment, Sv the normal stress at the pipe, and Pp the pore pressure. This can explain the non-zero intersection as well as depth-dependent increase for the frictional heating observed in the APC-T data. Assuming a hydrostatic state and by using the downhole bulk density data, we estimated the friction coefficient for each APC-T measurement. For comparison, we used the vane-shear strength measured on core samples to estimate the friction coefficients.\nThe frictional coefficients μ were estimated as ranging 0.01 – 0.06, anomalously lower than expected for shallow marine sediments. They were lower than those estimated from vane-shear data, which range 0.05 to 0.2. Still, both estimates exhibit a significant increase in the friction coefficient at Site C0012, which dominates in the hemipelagic sediment in the Shikoku Basin. The anomalously low values suggest either fluid injection between the pipe and the sediment during the measurement, or some other uncertainties in converting the observed temperature rise to the frictional heat generation.",

            "abstract": "Huang et al (2010) found that Fe, Ca and Mg isotope fractionations of high-temperature silicate melts are only associated with the temperature gradients in thermal diffusion processes and are independent of compositions and mean temperatures [1]. Richter et al (2010) doubted that the existing data are sufficient to obtain such conclusion [2]. A few theoretical models have been proposed for explaining isotopic fractionations in these processes under high temperatures [3, 4]. However, molecular-level mechanisms and theoretical treatments of these processes are still under debating.\nHere we provide a unified theory based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium treatment (LTE) of statistical mechanics for evaluating thermal isotopic fractionations under a wide range of temperatures. Under high temperatures, our theory however can be reasonably approximated to this equation:\nwhere A and B are constants which are related to specific isotope systems and chemical compositions of silicate melts. If the thermal gradient is not very large and the mean temperature is high, the second part of the above equation can be safely neglected and obtain an extremely simple equation which is linearly depended on temperatures, agreeing with what Huang et al (2010) concluded. Based on this terse equation, we can not only easily provide isotope fractionation data for almost all kinds of isotope systems, but also can provide the mechanisms of isotope fractionation in thermal diffusion processes.\n[1] Huang et al (2010) Nature 464, 396-400.\n[2] Richter et al (2010) Nature 472, E1-E1.\n[3] Dominguez et al (2011) Nature 473, 70-73.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we present a new method for forecasting arrival times and speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at any location in the inner heliosphere. This new approach assumes a highly adjustable geometrical shape of the CME front with a variable CME width and a variable curvature of the frontal part, i.e. the assumed geometry is elliptical. An elliptic conversion (ElCon) method is applied to observations from STEREO’s heliospheric imagers to convert the angular observations into a unit of radial distance from the Sun. This distance profile of the CME apex is then fitted using the drag-based model (DBM) to comprise the deceleration or acceleration CMEs experience during propagation. The outcome of both methods is then utilized as input for the Ellipse Evolution (ElEvo) model, forecasting the shock arrival times and speeds of CMEs at any position in interplanetary space. We introduce the combination of these three methods as the new ElEvoHI method. To demonstrate the applicability of ElEvoHI we present the forecast of 20 CMEs and compare it to the results from other forecasting utilities. Such a forecasting method is going to be useful when STEREO Ahead is again observing the space between the Sun and Earth, or when an L4/L5 space weather mission is in operation.",

We currently know little of such information for the north China craton which is also one of the oldest Archean cratons in the world that experienced dramatic reactivation during the Mesozoic. We present here comparison of water content and deformation microstructure in lower crustal rocks before and after craton reactivation revealed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. Our results revealed a significant dehydration of constituent minerals of lower crustal rocks before and after craton reactivation. There is a significant amount of water in the Archean felsic granulite (135 ppm in plagioclase, 885 ppm in orthopyroxene and 50 ppm in quartz) and mafic granulite (290 ppm in plagioclase, 903 ppm in clinopyroxene and 1038 ppm in orthopyroxene) from the Manjingtou of the Huaian terrane. In contrast, the water contents in the lower crustal mafic granulites (277 ppm in plagioclase, 120 ppm in clinopyroxene and 24 ppm in orthopyroxene) and garnet pyroxenites (123 ppm in Cpx and 7 ppm in Opx) of the Mesozoic mantle xenoliths from the Damaping is far less. Water is known to have an unproportional significant effects on the rheology of crustal and mantle minerals. The EBSD results suggest that pyroxenes are the strain accommodation phases in ‘wet’ granulites comparing to plagioclase being the weakest phase in ‘dry’ granulites. These results provide direct evidence for not only a low viscosity Precambrian lower crust which might facilitate thickening and delamination before the reactivation of the North China Craton but also a strengthened restabilized lower crust after reactivation.",

Here we use the rupture geometry constrained by the aftershocks and new geodetic data (levelling, InSAR and GPS measurements) to estimate an improved coseismic slip distribution of the two main events. In addition, we use post-seismic displacements, described and analyzed here for the first time, to infer a brand new post-seismic slip distribution of the May 29 event in terms of afterslip on the same coseismic plane. In particular, in this study we use a catalog of precisely relocated aftershocks to explore the different proposed geometries of the proposed thrust segments that have been published so far and estimate the coseismic and post-seismic slip distributions of the ruptured planes responsible for the two main seismic events from a joint inversion of the geodetic data.Joint inversion results revealed that the two earthquakes ruptured two distinct planar thrust faults, characterized by single main coseismic patches located around the centre of the rupture planes, in agreement with the seismological and geological information pointing out the Ferrara and the Mirandola thrust faults, as the causative structures of the May 20 and May 29 main shocks respectively.The preferred post-seismic slip distribution related to the 29 May event, yielded to a main patch of afterslip (equivalent to a Mw 5.6 event) located westward and up-dip of the main coseismic patch, suggesting that afterslip was triggered at the edges of the coseismic asperity. We then use these co- and post-seismic slip distribution models to calculate the stress changes on adjacent fault.",

            "abstract": "To mitigate sediment related disaster triggered by rainfall event, it is necessary to predict a landslide occurrence and subsequent debris flow behavior. Many landslide analysis method have been developed and proposed by numerous researchers for several decades. Among them, distributed slope stability models simulating temporal and spatial instability of local slopes are more essential for early warning or evacuation in area of lower part of hill-slopes. In the present study, a distributed, physically based landslide analysis method consisting of contour line-based method that subdivide a watershed area into stream tubes, and a slope stability analysis in which critical slip surface is searched to identify location and shape of the most instable slip surface in each stream tube, is developed. A target watershed area is divided into stream tubes using GIS technique, grand water flow for each stream tubes during a rainfall event is analyzed by a kinematic wave model, and slope stability for each stream tube is calculated by a simplified Janbu method searching for a critical slip surface using a dynamic programming method. Comparing to previous methods that assume infinite slope for slope stability analysis, the proposed method has advantage simulating landslides more accurately in spatially and temporally, and estimating amount of collapsed slope mass, that can be delivered to a debris flow simulation model as a input data. We applied this method to a small watershed in the Izu Oshima, Tokyo, Japan, where shallow and wide landslides triggered by heavy rainfall and subsequent debris flows attacked Oshima Town, in 2013. Figure shows the temporal and spatial change of simulated grand water level and landslides distribution. The simulated landslides are correspond to the uppermost part of actual landslide area, and the timing of the occurrence of landslides agree well with the actual landslides.",

            "abstract": "The Radar for Icy Moon Exploration (RIME) is one of the main instruments included in the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) ESA mission. It is a radar sounder designed for studying the subsurface geology and geophysics of Galilean icy moons (i.e., Ganymede, Europa and Callisto) and for detecting possible subsurface water. RIME is designed for penetration of the icy moons up to a depth of 9 km. Two main operation scenarios are foreseen for RIME: i) flyby observations of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (from a distance of 1000 km to the closest approach of about 400 km); and ii) circular orbital observations around Ganymede at 500 km of altitude. According to these scenarios, RIME is designed to explore the icy shell of the Galilean icy satellites by characterizing the wide range of compositional, thermal, and structural variation found in the subsurface of these moons. RIME observations will profile the ice shells of the Galilean icy satellites with specific focus on Ganymede given the circular orbital phase. The acquired measures will provide geological context on hemispheric (thousands of km), regional (hundreds of km with multiple overlaps), and targeted (tens of km) scales appropriate for a variety of hypothesis tests.\nRIME will operate in a single frequency band, centred at 9 MHz. The frequency was selected as the result of extensive study of penetration capabilities, surface roughness of the moons, Jovian radio noise, antenna accommodation, and system design. The 9 MHz frequency provides penetration capabilities and mitigation of surface scattering (which can cause signal loss and clutter issues), at the expense of mapping coverage, as it is likely to obtain high SNR observations only on the anti-Jovian side of the target moons. The RIME antenna is a 16 m dipole. The chirp pulse bandwidth is up to 3 MHz, which provides vertical resolution of about 50 m in ice after side lobe weighting. RIME will also operate with 1 MHz bandwidth to reduce data volume when observing deep sounding targets. This corresponds to a vertical resolution of about 140 m in ice. Within the high and low resolution modes, parameters can be adjusted to change the output data rate. RIME can downlink raw data for on-ground focusing or pre-processed data by a presuming operation for data rate reduction.",

            "abstract": "It is known that a variety of microscale instabilities get excited in the foot of a quasi-perpendicular shock. Two of the major instabilities which have been extensively studied for the parameters of typical heliospheric shocks are the electron cyclotron-drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream instability (MTSI). They have been often discussed separately, because of the large difference in dominant wave frequency between them. Although only a few of the past studies tried to examine the nonlinear evolutions and competing processe of them, the physical parameters used in numerical simulations were not realisitic. The relative importance of the instabilities may be a function of ion-to-electron mass ratio as well as the ratio of electron plasma to cyclotron frequiencies, while these two ratios are hard to be simultaneously realistic in a full particle-in-cell simulation due to the limited computational resources. In this study we perform a number of local simulations representing a part of the foot region with systematically changing the two ratios by using two-dimensional full particle-in-cell code. The foot plasma is assumed to be consist of incoming ions, electrons, and reflected ions. Typically, the system size is smaller than ion gyro radius in X, which is parallel to the shock normal, and a few times ion inertial length in Y, which is along a perpendicular shock surface and the ambient magnetic field. The boundary conditions are periodic in both directions. We will report the results of the simulations in which the mass ratio and the frequency ratio are systematically varied with fixing the local Alfven Mach number, plasma beta, and relative density of the reflected ions.",

            "abstract": "The GNSS buoy system for tsunami early warning has been developed in Japan. The system has been implemented as a national wave monitoring system and its record was used to update the tsunami warning at the 3.11 Tohoku-oki earthquake. The lessons learned in this experience was that the buoys are placed only less than 20km from the coast, which was not far enough for effective evacuation of people. We thus tried to improve the system for putting the buoy much farther from the coast. First, we tried to implement, different from current baseline mode RTK-GPS, a real-time PPP analysis strategy for positioning. In addition, we tried to use a two-way satellite data transmission in contrast with current surface radio system. We have made a series of experiments for this purpose in 2013 and 2014. A buoy of about 40km south of Shikoku, southwest Japan, was used for this purpose. GEONET data were used to obtain precise orbits and clocks of satellites. Then, the information was transferred to the GNSS buoy using LEX signal of QZSS satellite system. The received information on the buoy were used for real-time PPP analysis for every second. The obtained buoy position was then transmitted to the ground base, through an engineering test satellite, ETS-VIII. The received data was then disseminated to public through the internet. Both filtered short-term and long-term waves, were separately shown on the webpage.\nThe success of these experiments indicates that the GNSS buoy can be placed at least more than 1,500 km from the ground based tracking network. Given this success, we would now be able to deploy a new GNSS buoy array system in the wide ocean. An array in the ocean can be used for ionospheric and atmospheric research in the same region as well as tsunami or ocean bottom crustal deformation monitoring through an application to the GNSS-acoustic system. We are now designing a regional GNSS buoy array in the western Pacific as a synthetic natural hazard mitigation system.",

            "abstract": "A unique high-temperature apparatus was developed to trigger chaotic mixing at high-temperature (up to 1800 °C). This new apparatus, which we term ChaOtic Magma Mixing Apparatus (COMMA), is designed to carry out experiments with high-temperature and high-viscosity (up to 106 Pas) natural silicate melts. The instrument represents an extraordinary advance because allows us to follow in time and space the evolution of the mixing process and the associated modulation of chemical composition. This is essential to understand the dynamics of magma mixing and related chemical exchanges in the volcanic environment. The COMMA device is tested at extreme conditions by mixing natural melts from Aeolian Islands (Italy). The experiment was performed at 1170°C, with melts of shoshonitic and rhyolitic composition, resulting in a viscosity ratio of more than three orders of magnitude. This viscosity ratio is close to the maximum possible ratio of viscosity between high-temperature natural silicate melts. Results indicate that the generated mixing structures are topologically identical to those observed in natural volcanic rocks highlighting the enormous potential of the COMMA to replicate, as a first approximation, the same mixing patterns observed in the natural environment. We anticipate the COMMA to become a state-of-the-art apparatus for detailed investigations of magma mixing processes providing unprecedented information about this fundamental petrological and volcanological process that would be impossible to investigate by direct observations. Among the potentials of this new experimental device is the construction of empirical relationships relating the mixing time, obtained through experimental time series, and chemical exchanges between the melts to constrain the mixing-to-eruption time of volcanic systems, a fundamental topic in volcanic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "The AL index is a measure of the strength of the westward electrojet flowing along the auroral oval. It has two components: one from the global DP-2 current system and a second from the DP-1 current that is more localized near midnight. It is generally believed that the index a very poor measure of these currents because of its dependence on the distance of stations from the source of the two currents. In fact over season and solar cycle the coupling strength defined as the steady state ratio of the output AL to the input coupling function varies by a factor of four. There are four factors that lead to this variation. First is the equinoctial effect that modulates coupling strength with peaks (strongest coupling) at the equinoxes. Second is the saturation of the polar cap potential which decreases coupling strength as the strength of the driver increases. Since saturation occurs more frequently at solar maximum we obtain the result that maximum coupling strength occurs at equinox at solar minimum. A third factor is ionospheric conductivity with stronger coupling at summer solstice as compared to winter. The fourth factor is the definition of a solar wind coupling function appropriate to a given index. We have developed an optimum coupling function depending on solar wind speed, density, transverse magnetic field, and IMF clock angle which is better than previous functions. Using this we have determined the seasonal variation of coupling strength and developed an inverse function that modulates the optimum coupling function so that all seasonal variation is removed. In a similar manner we have determined the dependence of coupling strength on solar wind driver strength. The inverse of this function is used to scale a linear prediction filter thus eliminating the dependence on driver strength. Our result is a single linear filter that is adjusted in a nonlinear manner by driver strength and an optimum coupling function that is seasonal modulated. Together this procedure predicts as much as 75% of AL variance. We will examine the prediction residuals to determine if they are random or occur in certain phases of the substorm.",

            "abstract": "Values of scalar, vectorial and second-order tensorial parameters of the Earth’s gravitational field have been collected by various sensors in geodesy and geophysics. Such observables have been widely exploited in different parametrization methods for the gravitational field modelling. Moreover, theoretical aspects of these quantities have extensively been studied and are well understood. On the other hand, new sensors for observing gravitational curvatures, i.e., components of the third-order gravitational tensor, are currently under development. This fact may be documented by the terrestrial experiments Dulkyn and Magia, as well as by the proposal of the gravity-dedicated satellite mission called OPTIMA. As the gravitational curvatures represent new types of observables, their exploitation for modelling of the Earth’s gravitational field is a subject of this study. Firstly, we derive integral transforms between the gravitational potential and gravitational curvatures, i.e., we find analytical solutions of the boundary value problems with gravitational curvatures as boundary conditions. Secondly, properties of the corresponding Green kernel functions are studied in the spatial and spectral domains. Thirdly, the correctness of the new analytical solutions is tested in a simulation study. The presented mathematical apparatus reveal important properties of the gravitational curvatures. It also extends the Meissl scheme, i.e., an important theoretical paradigm that relates various parameters of the Earth’s gravitational field.",

This study is the first study of using borehole seismograph in earthquake early warning in Taiwan. Since 2007, Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has been installing the borehole seismometers; currently, there are 47 operating borehole seismometers in Taiwan. We selected the inland and offshore earthquakes with ML larger than 4.0 occurring between 2012 and 2014. We investigated the Pd attenuation relationship as a function of hypocentral distance (R) and magnitude, and obtained the following equation: log(Pd)=0.812×MPd−0.905×log(R)−4.795±0.322. Once the earthquake location is determined, we could use this regression equation to quickly define earthquake magnitude (MPd). According to the new regression equation specifically for the borehole observation in Taiwan, our result shows that the standard deviation of MPd is about 0.22 related to ML. This small standard deviation of 0.22 compared to that of the free-surface one might be attributed to the neglect of the near surface effect. We propose a new robust Pd regression equation for the Taiwan borehole seismic network.",

            "abstract": "In the Mediterranean area, significant changes on temperature and precipitation are expected throughout the century. These trends could exacerbate the existing conditions in regions already vulnerable to climatic variability, reducing the water availability. Improving knowledge about plausible impacts of climate change on water cycle processes at basin scale, is an important step for building adaptive capacity to the impacts in this region, where severe water shortages are expected for the next decades. RCMs ensemble in combination with distributed hydrological models with few parameters, constitutes a valid and robust methodology to increase the reliability of climate and hydrological projections. For reaching this objective, a novel methodology for building Regional Climate Models (RCMs) ensembles of meteorological variables (rainfall an temperatures), was applied. RCMs ensembles are justified for increasing the reliability of climate and hydrological projections. The evaluation of RCMs goodness-of-fit to build the ensemble is based on empirical probability density functions (PDF) extracted from both RCMs dataset and a highly resolution gridded observational dataset, for the time period 1961-1990. The applied method is considering the seasonal and annual variability of the rainfall and temperatures. The RCMs ensembles constitute the input to a distributed hydrological model at basin scale, for assessing the runoff projections. The selected hydrological model is presenting few parameters in order to reduce the uncertainties involved. The study basin corresponds to a head basin of Segura River Basin, located in the South East of Spain. The impacts on runoff and its trend from observational dataset and climate projections, were assessed. Considering the control period 1961-1990, plausible significant decreases in runoff for the time period 2021-2050, were identified.",

For site simulations for four GRENE-TEA sites (i.e., Fairbanks/AK, Kevo/Finland, Tiksi and Yakutsk/Siberia), we needed to prepare continuous, site-fit forcing data ready to drive the models. Due to scarcity of site observations in the region, however, it was difficult to make such data directly from the observations. Therefore, we decided to create a backbone dataset (Level 0 or Lv0) first by utilizing the reanalysis data to derive the site-specific data (Level 1 or Lv1).\nFor selection of the best dataset for our purpose, we compared four atmospheric reanalysis datasets, i.e., ERA Interim, JRA-55, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1, and NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2, in terms of the climatic reproducibility (w.r.t. temperature at 2 m and precipitation) in the region north of 60°N. CRU for temperature and GPCP for precipitation were also used for monthly-mean ground-level climate. As we will show ERA-Interim showed the smallest bias for both the parameters in terms of RMSE. Especially, air temperature in the cold period was reproduced better in ERA-Interim than is in JRA-55 or other reanalysis products. Therefore, we created Lv0 from ERA-Interim. Comparison between the site observations and Lv0 showed good agreement except for wind speed at all sites and air temperature at Tiksi, a coastal site in the eastern Siberia. Air temperature of ERA-Interim showed significantly continental characteristics while the site observation more coastal. The 34-year-long, hourly, site-fit continuous data (Lv1) for each of the GRENE-TEA sites was then created from the Lv0 values at the grid point closest to the site, by merging with the observations.",

            "abstract": "The Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) is a dramatic event that took place ~ 5.9 Ma ago, resulting in deposition of 1-3 km thick evaporites at the Mediterranean seafloor. A considerable, long-lasting controversy existed on the modes of their formation, including the observed shallow gypsum versus deep dolostone deposits for the early phase of MSC.\nThe onset of MSC is marked by deposition of gypsum/sapropel-like alternations, thought to relate to arid/humid climate conditions at a precessional rhythm. Gypsum precipitation only occurred at marginal- and dolomite formation at deeper settings. A range of potential explanations was given, most of which cannot satisfactorily explain all observations. Biogeochemical processes during MSC are commonly neglected but may explain that different deposits formed in shallow vs deep environments without exceptional physical boundary conditions for each.\nA unifying mechanism is presented in which gypsum formation occurs at all shallow water depths but its preservation is limited to shallow sedimentary settings. In contrast, ongoing deep-basin anoxic organic matter (OM) degradation processes result in dolomite formation.\nGypsum precipitation in evaporating seawater takes place at 3-7 times concentrated seawater; seawater is always oversaturated relative to dolomite but its formation is inhibited by the presence of dissolved sulphate. Thus conditions for formation of gypsum exclude those for formation of dolomite and vice versa. Another process linking the saturation states of gypsum and dolomite is that of OM degradation by sulphate reduction. In stagnant deep water, ongoing OM-degradation may result in reducing the sulphate and enhancing the dissolved carbonate content. Such low-sulphate / high carbonate conditions in MSC deepwater are. unfavorable for gypsum preservation and favorable for dolomite formation, and always coincide with anoxic, i.e. oxygen-free conditions.\nIncluding dynamic biogeochemical processes in the thusfar static interpretations of evaporite formation mechanisms can thus account for the paradoxal, isochronous formation of shallow gypsum and deep-dolomite during the early MSC (1).\n (1) De Lange G.J. and Krijgsman W.

With data combined from TIMED/GUVI and DMSP/SSUSI observations, we first separate the effects of geomagnetic activity from those of solar flux on the auroral precipitation. Our results showed that, the solar flux dependence of both the diffuse and discrete auroral power, changed with the geomagnetic activity. This phenomenon might be associated with increasing background ionospheric ionization as the geomagnetic activity increases, which consequently changes the ionospheric conductivity and limites the plasma density gradient along the magnetic field line. Different solar activity dependent rate is also found between pre-midnight and post-midnight diffuse auroral precipitation. All these results indicate effects from conjugate summer hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "The use of a 1D velocity model for seismic event location is often associated with significant travel-time residuals. Particularly for regional stations in subduction zones, where the velocity structure strongly deviates from the assumed 1D model, residuals of up to <span\" serif\"=\"Serif\"\">±10 seconds are observed even for clear arrivals, which leads to strongly biased locations. In fact, due to mostly regional travel-time anomalies, arrival times at regional stations do not match the location obtained with teleseismic picks, and vice versa. If the earthquake is weak and only recorded regionally, or if fast locations based on regional stations are needed, the location may be far off the corresponding teleseismic location. In this case, implementation of travel-time corrections may leads to a reduction of the travel-time residuals at regional stations and, in consequence, significantly improve the relative location accuracy. Here, we have extended the source-specific station terms (SSST) technique to regional and teleseismic distances and adopted the algorithm for probabilistic, non-linear, global-search earthquake location. The method has been applied to specific test regions using P and pP phases from the GEOFON bulletin data for all available station networks. By using this method, a set of timing corrections has been calculated for each station varying as a function of source position. In this way, an attempt is made to correct for the systematic errors, introduced by limitations and inaccuracies in the assumed velocity structure, without solving for a new earth model itself. In this presentation, we draw on examples of the application of this global SSST technique to relocate earthquakes from the Tonga-Fiji subduction zone and from the Chilean margin. Our results have been showing a considerable decrease of the root-mean-square (RMS) residual in earthquake location final catalogs, a major reduction of the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the travel-time residuals at regional stations and sharper images of the seismicity compared to the initial locations.",

In the second region, we observed the presence of westward propagating instability waves centered at 5°N between 30°W and 10°W. The third region, around the Equator, is characterized by the presence of eastward propagating Kelvin waves at the Equator, and westward propagating Rossby waves centered at 5°S and 5°N.\nThe eddies linked to the NECC show a strong annual cycle: their number varies from ~4 per year in October to ~9 per year in March. The more powerful eddies occur in October around 40°W. Their diameter varies from 5° of longitude at 40°W to 2.5° at 60°W, and their speed is 18 cm/s. The instability waves also shows a strong seasonal cycle with maximum amplitude around August. They are generated by meridional winds at the African coast and by zonal winds at the Equator.\nThe Kelvin waves at the Equator are generated by zonal wind anomalies at the Equator at 30°W with a 2.6 weeks delay, and their speed is 175 cm/s (2nd order baroclinic).

            "abstract": "Using a dense seismic network we have imaged the plumbing system beneath Askja, a large central volcano in the Northern Volcanic Zone, Iceland. Local and regional earthquakes have been used as sources to solve for the velocity structure beneath the volcano. We find a pronounced low-velocity anomaly beneath the caldera at a depth of ~7 km around the depth of the brittle-ductile transition. The anomaly is ~10% slower than the initial best fitting 1D model and has a Vp/Vs ratio higher than the surrounding crust, suggesting the presence of increased temperature or partial melt. We use relationships between mineralogy and seismic velocities to estimate that this region contains ~10% partial melt, similar to observations made at other volcanoes such as Kilauea. This low-velocity body is deeper than the depth range suggested by geodetic studies of a deflating source beneath Askja. Beneath the large low-velocity zone a region of reduced velocities extends into the lower crust and is coincident with seismicity in the lower crust. This is suggestive of a high temperature channel into the lower crust which could be the pathway for melt rising from the mantle. This melt either intrudes into the lower crust or stalls at the brittle-ductile boundary in the imaged body. Above this, melt can travel into the fissure swarm through large dikes or erupt within the Askja caldera itself.\nWe generate travel time tables using a finite difference technique and the residuals used to simultaneously solve for both the earthquake locations and velocity structure. The 2014-15 Bárðarbunga dike intrusion has provided a 45 km long, distributed source of large earthquakes which are well located and provide accurate arrival time picks. Together with long-term background seismicity these provide excellent illumination of the Askja volcano from all directions.hhhh",

            "abstract": "Mantle xenoliths from the island of El Hierro, the youngest of the Canary Islands, have been studied to characterize fluxes of carbon in the lithosphere of an OIB volcanism region. Fifteen xenoliths (4-10 cm in diameter) were collected in a rift lava flow (15-41 ka) at a new xenolith locality in El Julan cliff (S-SW of the island). Peridotites consist of protogranular to porphyroblastic spinel harzburgites, lherzolites, and subordinate dunites. One spinel clinopyroxenite, and one olivine-websterite were also analyzed. Ultramafic xenoliths were classified as HEXO (harzburgite and dunite with exsolved orthopyroxene), HLCO (harzburgite and lherzolite containing orthopyroxene without visible exsolution lamellae), and HTR (transitional harzburgite with exsolved orthopyroxene porphyroclasts, and poikilitic orthopyroxene) following [1]. While HLCO and HTR peridotites contain mostly CO2 fluid inclusions, HEXO peridotites preserve an early association of melt/fluid inclusions containing dominantly carbonate/sulfate/silicate glass, evolving to carbonate/sulfate/phosphate/spinel aggregates, with exsolved CO2 (± carbonates, anhydrite and H2O). Chemical and Raman analyses identify dolomite, Mg-calcite, anhydrite, sulfohalite [Na6(SO4)2FCl] (± other anhydrous and hydrous alkali-sulfates), apatite, and Cr-spinel in the inclusions. Sulfides are noticeably absent. The microstructure and chemical composition of the metasomatic fluids indicate that the peridotites were infiltrated by a carbonate-sulfate-silicate melt/fluid enriched in CO2, H2O, and P. A mantle origin for this fluid is supported by high densities of CO2inclusions (> 1g/cm3), determined by Raman microspectroscopy and cross-checked by microthermometry. Consequently, El Julan peridotites provide the first evidence for liberating oxidized C and S fluxes from the Earth lithosphere in an OIB source region, and suggest that oxidation of sulfide to sulfate can occur during small-degree partial melting of the upper mantle. \n[1] Neumann et al.

The SVP is determined by a device. Because of the high sampling rate of the modern device, the operational time of ray tracing and beam footprint reduction will increase, lowering the overall efficiency. To promote the timeliness of multi-beam surveys and data processing, redundant points in the original SVP must be screened out and at the same time, errors following the streamlining of the SVP must be evaluated and controlled.\n We presents a new streamlining and evaluation method based on the Maximum Offset of sound Velocity (MOV) algorithm. Based on measured SVP data, this method selects sound velocity data points by calculating the maximum distance to the sound-velocity-dimension based on an improved Douglas-Peucker Algorithm to streamline the SVP (Fig. 1). To evaluate whether the streamlined SVP meets the desired accuracy requirements, this method is divided into two parts: SVP streamlining, and an accuracy analysis of the multi-beam sounding data processing using the streamlined SVP. Therefore, the method is divided into two modules: the streamlining module and the evaluation module (Fig. 2). The streamlining module is used for streamlining the SVP. Its core is the MOV algorithm.To assess the accuracy of the streamlined SVP, we uses ray tracing and the percentage error analysis method to evaluate the accuracy of the sounding data both before and after streamlining the SVP (Fig. 3). By automatically optimizing the threshold, the reduction rate of sound velocity profile data can reach over 90% and the standard deviation percentage error of sounding data can be controlled to within 0.1% (Fig. 4). The optimized sound velocity profile data improved the operational efficiency of the multi-beam survey and data post-processing by 3.4 times(Fig. 5), indicating that this algorithm has practical value for engineering applications.",

The advantage of the convergent flow tracer tests is the possibility of achieving high tracer mass recovery. Analytical solutions are useful for interpreting the results of the field tracer test. Currently available solutions are mostly limited to semi-analytical solutions. This study develops an explicit analytical solutions for solute transport in a convergent flow tracer test.

Multiple spacecraft measurement makes it possible to study observationally the structure of the reconnection region. In this paper we improve the fitting-reconstructing method developed by He et al.

The reconnection site was encountered when the constellation traversed the dayside magnetopause at z~5.3Re, with spacecraft separations less than 400km. The reconstructing results clearly revealed the asymmetric geometry of the reconnection region. The orientation of the X-line, which was reproduced as the separator linking a pair of magnetic null points, was shown to be ~60° away from the M-direction in the local LMN coordinate. Bipolar and unipolar Hall fields were both seen by different spacecraft, implying that the reconnection regime was 3D in nature, and the difference in Hall fields could be related to the existence of two null points which restricted the length of the separator. In addition, electromagnetic lower hybrid waves are found to be enhanced on the magnetospheric side of the reconnection region. The reconstructing results are helpful for providing a 3D picture of the asymmetric reconnection region, and the improved reconstructing method can be applied to analyze the data from MMS which is deployed with small separations of satellites.",

            "abstract": "Global energy systems models have largely ignored the impacts of water scarcity on the energy sector and the related implications for climate change mitigation. However, significant water is required in the production of energy, including for thermoelectric power plant cooling, hydropower generation, irrigation for bioenergy, and the extraction and refining of liquid fuels. With a changing climate and expectations of increasing competition for water from the agricultural and municipal sectors, it is unclear whether sufficient water will be available where needed to support water-intensive energy technologies in the future. Thus, it is important that water use and water constraints are incorporated into energy systems models to better understand energy sector adaptation to water scarcity. The global energy systems model, MESSAGE, has recently been updated to quantify the water consumption and withdrawal requirements of the energy sector and now includes several cooling technologies for addressing water scarcity. This study introduces water constraints into the model to examine whether and how the energy sector can adapt to water scarcity over the next century. In addition, the implications for climate mitigation are evaluated under a scenario in which warming is limited to 2˚C over the pre-industrial level. Given the difficulty of introducing meaningful water constraints into global models, we use a simplistic approach and evaluate a series of scenarios in which the water available to the energy sector is systematically reduced. This approach allows for the evaluation of energy sector adaptations under various levels of water scarcity and can provide insight into how water scarcity, whether from climate change or competing demands, may impact the energy sector in different world regions. This study will provide insight into the following questions:\nHow does the energy sector adapt to water scarcity in different regions?\nWhat are the costs associated with adaptation to water scarcity?\nHow do adaptations to constraints on water withdrawal and consumption differ?\nIs climate mitigation limited under water scarcity (esp. with low deployment of wind/ solar)?\nHow important are dry cooling and seawater cooling for addressing water scarcity and climate mitigation?",

            "abstract": "In order to continue to improve our understanding of the dynamics of underground explosions, we analyse blast data from the recent expansion of the Wookey Hole cave system in Somerset, UK (July 2015). Such data has clear relevance and implication to the work of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) and for verification of suspicious seismic events.\nWe first analyse the pre- and post-blast seismic noise in order to characterize the resonant modes of the cave systems and identify any sources of persistent noise in the data. An unexpectedly high persistent noise source at 119.47Hz is thought to relate to electrical noise from machinery near to the recording site.\nWith only a single three-component seismometer, ascertaining variations in the radiation patterns from the explosions was impossible. However by rotating the seismograms into their radial and transverse components, we were able to determine that both P- and S-waves were generated during the blasting. The source of these S-waves is under ongoing investigation, but scattering close to the source caused by the impedance contrast between the cavity and the surrounding bedrock, or fracturing of the bedrock during blasting, are both possibilities[1].\nFrequency analysis on a sample of the data collected shows that for each blast, the dominant recorded frequency on the East component was around 35-40Hz for both the P- and S-arrivals. Dominant frequencies on the N and Z components was much more variable, up to 120Hz. For each blast, spectrograms show significant energy up to high frequencies across the duration of the recording, up to 125Hz, showing that little attenuation has occurred.\n[1] - Imhof, M.

            "abstract": "3D modelling of BQ-DC measurements can show a rather strong directional distortion of the electric current density for an inhomogeneous subsurface. Anisotropic structures increase this effect. Depending on the anisotropy direction, current density might vary by 90° between the interior and exterior of an anisotropic body. In combination with 3D effects currents might even flow into the opposite direction compared to those expected for a homogeneous half space. This effect can produce negative potential differences (in combination with positive geometry factors) at the surface which cannot be explained by an isotropic resistivity distribution and thus those data cannot be used by an isotropic inversion. Consequently, anisotropic forward modelling is necessary to explain such observations.\nIn nature anisotropic resistivity can appear in the context of strongly foliated structures. Such structures exist in the Rhenish Massif, Germany, where extensive shallow greywacke shales with different strength of foliation are found. In this area a field campaign was performed in 2014 to provide evidence for the existence of anisotropic resistivity structures. Two perpendicular bipole current injections at 15 locations produced individual potential distributions. The potential differences were recorded for two orthogonal directions each at 30 positions for an array set up within the survey area.\nWe use the apparent resistivity tensor after Bibby 1986 to display the BQ-DC data. It uses the hypothetical current densities of each of the two bipole sources calculated for an equivalent homogenous half space at the location of the quadrupole measurement to derive a resistivity tensor. The spatial behavior of modelled tensors gives evidence of the anisotropic body although the structure is covered by an isotropic layer.\nThe data are explained by a 3D anisotropic resistivity distribution using a 3D isotropic inversion scheme combined with 3D anisotropic forward-modelling.",

This paper reports a promising numerical analysis of the complex CH4 flow in the fracture network of coal using Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The flow properties of CH4 flow, including viscosity distribution, average flow speed, permeability coefficient, are derived using the LBM model.

In this aim we compare these statistical components to the internal components of a conceptual precipitation/discharge model based on the physical knowledge of the site studied. We used the conceptual modeling software KARSTMOD developed by the INSU/CNRS National Karst Observatory to model discharge at a small karst spring in Normandy (France).\nThe model comprised four reservoirs E, L, M and C (interpreted as epikarst, high- inertia/highly capacitive matrix, fissure network and conduits), consistent with previous works showing the existence of a triple porosity in chalk of Normandy. KARSTMOD internal flow components were analyzed with correlation and Fourier spectral analysis, and compared to statistical components extracted from spring discharge by wavelet multiresolution analysis and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). We could also analyze how the hydrological signal acquired its red noise statistical characteristics while water flow propagates into the conceptual model. The trend of the discharge signal, given by the residue of EEMD, appeared quite similar to the variation in reservoir L and well correlated to the variation of the water level within the aquifer. Exchanges between fissured matrix and conduits (reservoirs M and C) could be also investigated: a high frequency pressure pulse-controlled flow from C to M (intermittent recharge from the conduits) was identified, as well as fissured matrix flow likely to take place in the surroundings of the conduit network. Flow from reservoir M to reservoir C could be recovered by recombining wavelet components of spring discharge.\nThis study demonstrated that statistical components extracted from a discharge signal of a karst spring can provide meaningful hydrological information. Comparison with a physics-based model would however be required in order to complement this study.",

            "abstract": "Herein, fast climate system responses to CO2, aerosol and sulfate aerosol forces are studied based on simulations of CMIP5 atmospheric models. We demonstrated that the fast climate adjustments caused by CO2 forcing lead to decreases in global mean cloud fractions, evaporation and precipitation, and to increases in the net radiative forcing and atmospheric water vapor content. The inhibition of rainfall is primarily contributed from the reduced oceanic precipitation. Regionally, Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Australia exhibit pronounced increases in rainfall, which are presumably attributed to the strengthened summer monsoon caused by the increased land-sea thermal contrast. Aerosol and sulfate forcing exhibit only a slight effect on the global hydrological cycle before global surface temperature changes. However, by affecting the land-sea thermal contrast, they can have profound effects on regional-scale hydrological cycles, such as those over southern Africa, South Asia and East Asia in the boreal summer. Moreover, the cloud fast feedback under the aerosol forcing is highly associated with the way of dealing with aerosols in the atmospheric model.",

            "abstract": "Ozone (O3) on Mars is a product of the CO2 photolysis by ultraviolet radiation. It is destroyed with a timescale of less than ~1 hour during the day by the H, OH, and HO2 radicals. This tight coupling between O3 and HOx species makes ozone a sensitive tracer of the odd hydrogen chemistry that stabilizes the CO2 atmosphere of Mars, and ozone measurements offer a powerful constraint for photochemical models. Ozone is also expected to be anti-correlated to water vapour, the source of hydrogen radicals HOx. At high latitudes in winter, the absence of H2O prevents the production of HOx and the chemical lifetime of ozone may increase up to several days. In these conditions, the ozone column abundance usually reaches its largest values of the Martian year and ozone turns into a measurable tracer of the polar vortex dynamics.\nThe Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) is one of nine science instruments aboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile and Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. In the apoapse imaging phase, the spacecraft motion carries the IUVS lines-of-sight across the Martian disk while the scan mirror is used to make transverse swaths. This observation mode allows mapping the ozone vertically-integrated column from its signature in the solar ultraviolet flux backscattered by the surface and the atmosphere.\nThis paper will present an overview of the first year of ozone mapping by IUVS. We will describe in particular the last Mars northern winter (2015) when the largest ozone columns have been observed since the beginning of the MAVEN mission. The data will be compared to prior Earth-based observations and to the SPICAM and MARCI ozone datasets. We will also test our quantitative understanding of the Martian ozone by comparing the IUVS observations to our three-dimensional model with photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Seismic structure of the upper mantle discontinuities is important for understanding the thermal structure, composition of the mantle, and scales of mantle circulation as well. Northeast Asia is located at the front edge of the subducting Pacific slab, which is an ideal place to study the interaction between the upper mantle discontinuities and the subducting slab. Seismic tomography images have revealed different morphologies of slabs in the deep mantle. A prominent stagnant slab is trapped in the MTZ beneath Japan Sea and southern Kuril trench; while the slabs penetrate into the lower mantle directly beneath the northern Kuril and southern Izu-Bonin trench. Due to the sparse distribution of seismic stations in the sea, investigation of the deep mantle structure beneath the broad sea regions is very limited. In this study, we applied the multiple-ScS reverberations analysis to waveforms recorded by the Chinese Regional Seismic Network and F-net. We took advantage of the dense distribution of stations and spatial clusters of intermediate and deep earthquakes occurred beneath Okhotsk Sea, Russia and Northeast China, and conducted a common-reflection-point (CRP) stacking to the data, that allows us to map the topography of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities beneath Japan Sea, Kuril, and adjacent regions in detail. We also compiled previous results obtained from the high frequency receiver function and S-to-P converted wave analyzes, and compared the results in the overlapping island or continental margin regions. The comparison shows that the array stacking technique to long-period signals is effective in extracting the robust features of the upper mantle discontinuities. It can be used not only as a complimentary method to short-period waveform analysis, but also as an independent way which can be applied to regions with limited station coverage. This is the first time to show systematically a complete view of the topography of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities beneath the broad sea regions in the Northwestern Pacific Subduction zone. A broad depression of the 660-km discontinuity and local complex pattern of uplift and depression of the 410-km discontinuities are observed, and a thermal structure and composition of the upper mantle are investigated based on this map.",

The researchers can access the service at https://prognocean.plgrid.pl/. Although the system is science-oriented, we wish to discuss herein its potentials to enhance ocean management studies carried out routinely by public stakeholders. The system produces the short- and medium-term predictions of global altimetric gridded Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) time series, updated daily. The spatial resolution of the SLA forecasts is 1/4° x 1/4°, while the temporal resolution of prognoses is equal to 1 day. The system computes the predictions of time-variable ocean topography using five data-based models, which are not computationally demanding, enabling us to compare their skillfulness in respect to physically-based approaches commonly used by different sea level prediction systems. However, the aim of the system is not only to compute the predictions for science purposes, but primarily to build a user-oriented platform that serves the prognoses and their statistics to a broader community. Thus, we deliver the SLA forecasts as a rapid service available online. In order to provide potential users with the access to science results the Web Map Service (WMS) for Prognocean Plus is designed. We regularly publish the forecasts, both in the interactive graphical WMS service, available from the browser, as well as through the Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard. The Prognocean Plus system, as an early-response system, may be interesting for public stakeholders. It may be used for marine navigation as well as for climate risk management (delineate areas vulnerable to local sea level rise), marine management (advise offered for offshore activities) and coastal management (early warnings against coastal floodings).",

            "abstract": "Vertical borehole heat exchangers (BHE) represent the most common applications by far in the field of shallow geothermal energy. They are typically operated for decades for energy extraction from the top 400 m of the subsurface. During this lifetime, thermal anomalies are generated in the ground and surface-near aquifers. These anomalies often grow over the years and compromise the overall performance of the geothermal system. As a basis for prediction and control of the developing energy imbalance in the ground, the focus is often set on the ground temperatures. This is reflected, for instance, in regulative temperature thresholds. As an alternative to temperature, we examine the temporal and spatial variability of heat fluxes and power sources during geothermal heat pump operation. The underlying idea is that knowledge of the primary heat sources is fundamental for the control of ground temperature evolution. For analysis of heat fluxes, an analytical framework for BHE simulation based on Kelvin’s line source is re-formulated. This is applied to a synthetic study and for modelling a long-term application in the field.\nOur results show that during early operation phase, energy is extracted mainly from the underground. Local depletion at the borehole enhances the vertical fluxes with the relative contribution from the bottom reaching a limit of 24 % of the total power demand. The relative contribution from the ground surface becomes dominant for Fourier numbers larger than 0.13. For the full life cycle, vertical heat flux from the ground surface dominates the basal heat flux towards the BHE and it provides about two thirds of the demanded power. Finally, we reveal that the time for ground energy recovery after BHE shutdown may be longer than what is expected from simulated temperature trends.",

Market volatility and the growing number of operational constraints for flood control, navigation, environmental obligations and ancillary services (including load balancing requirements for renewable resources) further the need to quantify sources of uncertainty.\nThis research presents an integrated framework to handle several sources of uncertainty. Main focus is on the meteorological forecast uncertainty represented by a probabilistic Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP), its consistent propagation through load and streamflow forecasts, and the generation of scenario trees with multi-dimensional distance metrics. The short-term management approach adapts to this forecast uncertainty and its resolution by the use of multi-stage stochastic optimization.\nThe Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS), managed by the Bonneville Power Administration, the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, serves as a large-scale test case for the application of the new framework. It is used to quantify the operational flexibility of the hydropower system and to propagate the forecast uncertainty through the system. Objectives and constraints enable the operating staff to shape and direct the system such that variability remains in the hydropower system or gets absorbs by the energy market.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic interfaces are generally characterized by steep gradients of physical, chemical and biological properties due to the contrast between the two adjacent environments. Innovative measurement techniques are required to study the spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable processes. Especially the different spatial and temporal scales are a large challenge. Due to the steep biogeochemical gradients and the intensive structural and compositional heterogeneity, enhanced biogeochemical processing rates are inherent to aquatic interfaces. Nevertheless, the effective turnover depends strongly on the residence time distribution along the flow paths and in sections with particular biogeochemical milieus and reaction kinetics. Thus, identification and characterization of the highly complex flow patterns in and across aquatic interfaces are crucial to understand biogeochemical processing along exchange flow paths and to quantify transport across aquatic interfaces. Hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes are closely coupled at aquatic interfaces. However, interface processing rates are not only enhanced compared to the adjacent compartments that they connect; also completely different reactions might occur if certain thresholds are exceeded or the biogeochemical milieu differs significantly from the adjacent environments. Single events, temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity might increase overall processing rates of aquatic interfaces and thus, should not be neglected when studying aquatic interfaces. Aquatic interfaces are key zones relevant for the ecological state of the entire ecosystem and thus, understanding interface functioning and controls is paramount for ecosystem management. The overall aim of this contribution is a general conceptual framework for aquatic interfaces that is applicable to a wide range of systems, scales and processes.",

            "abstract": "Crop simulation models are efficient tools for simulating crop growth processes and yield. Running crop models requires data from various sources as well as time-consuming data processing, such as data quality checking and data formatting, before those data can be inputted to the model. It makes the use of crop modeling limited only to crop modelers. We aim to make running crop models convenient for various users so that the utilization of crop models will be expanded, which will directly improve agricultural applications. As the first step, we had developed a prototype that runs DSSAT on Web called as Tomorrow's Rice (v. 1). It predicts rice yields based on a planting date, rice’s variety and soil characteristics using DSSAT crop model. A user only needs to select a planting location on the Web GUI then the system queried historical weather data from available sources and expected yield is returned. Currently, we are working on weather data connection via Sensor Observation Service (SOS) interface defined by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Weather data can be automatically connected to a weather generator for generating weather scenarios for running the crop model. In order to expand these services further, we are designing a web service framework consisting of layers of web services to support compositions and executions for running crop simulations. This framework allows a third party application to call and cascade each service as it needs for data preparation and running DSSAT model using a dynamic web service mechanism. The framework has a module to manage data format conversion, which means users do not need to spend their time curating the data inputs. Dynamic linking of data sources and services are implemented using the Service Component Architecture (SCA). This agriculture web service platform demonstrates interoperability of weather data using SOS interface, convenient connections between weather data sources and weather generator, and connecting various services for running crop models for decision support.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat island effect has been assessed using Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF v3.5) coupled with urban canopy model (UCM) focusing on air temperature and surface skin temperature in the sub-tropical urban Indian megacity of Delhi. The estimated heat island intensities for different land use/land cover (LULC) have been compared with those derived from in-situ and satellite observations. There is a significant improvement in model performance with inclusion of UCM both for meteorological parameters (T and RH) and the UHIs. Overall, RMSEs for near surface temperature improved from 1.63°C to 1.13°C for urban areas and from 2.89°C to 2.75°C for non-urban areas with inclusion of urban canopy model in WRF. Similarly, index of agreement and RMSEs for mean urban heat island intensities (UHI) improved from 0.77 to 0.88 and 1.91°C to 1.60°C respectively with WRF-UCM. Hit rate from the model simulated mean heat island intensities using WRF model are 72 % for urban areas and 58 % for non-urban areas such as green areas and riverside areas. The corresponding values improved in WRF-UCM with a hit rate of 75% for urban areas and 72 % for non-urban areas. In general, model is able to capture the magnitude of UHI well though it performs better during night than during the daytime. High UHI zones and top 3 hotspots are captured well by the model.\nThe relevance of selecting a rural reference point for UHI estimation near the urban area is examined in the context of rapidly growing cities where nearby rural areas are transforming fast into built-up areas themselves and reference site may not be appropriate for future years. Both WRF and WRF-UCM simulated UHI shows satisfactory performance against benchmarks for the statistical measures with classical methodology using rural site as a reference point. Using an alternate methodology of considering a green area within the city having minimum temperature as a reference site worked satisfactorily only with WRF- UCM. In general, WRF-UCM always shows a better performance than WRF. Hence, inclusion of appropriate representation of urban canopies and landuse-landcover are important for improving predictive capabilities of the mesoscale models.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model is combined with various vertical distributions of canopy source to investigate the flux footprint estimation for tall canopies under different atmospheric stabilities. For understanding the contributions of scalar sources/sinks under the canopy to the scalar flux, the canopy is divided into multi-layers (source from the ground is included in the lowest layer). Three kinds of vertical source profiles, including: uniform distribution, distribution by leaf area density (LAD), and distribution by photosynthesis rate, are considered to test how multi-layers of sources influence the vertical-integrated flux footprint.\nWe found that under all atmospheric stability conditions, it is less necessary to divide the canopy into multi-layers of sources as the measurement height (Zm) is increased to 5 times of the canopy height (h). Also, when the atmosphere is unstable, the importance of dividing the canopy into multi-layers is reduced at all tested measurement heights. When the source/sink distribution is non-uniform, the footprint contribution depends on the source strength of each layer. The source profiles by the LAD and photosynthesis rate we selected concentrate on 0.4h and 0.5h respectively, and consequently the middle source layers of the canopy contribute to the flux mostly. We also compared our results with an analytical model (Lee, 2004) predictions in neutral condition. We found that the locations of the vertical-integrated footprint peaks of these two models get closer when Zm is increased to 5h. Based on the results, we suggest that the vertical source profile of tall canopies should be considered when conducting the flux footprint estimations.",

In the Sahel, depending to scale of analysis and methods and data used, the trend documented have not been consistent across authors and science disciplines. The assessment of land degradation and the quantification of its effects on land productivity have been assessed for many decades, but little agreement has been gained on the magnitude and direction in the Sahel. This lack of consistency amid science outputs can be related to many methodological underpinnings and data used for various scales of analysis.\nAssessing biophysical trends on the ground requires long-term ground-based data collection to evaluate and better understand the mechanisms behind land dynamics. The Sahel is seen as greening by many authors? Is that greening geographically consistent? These questions enquire the importance of scale analysis and related drivers. The questions addressed are not only factors explaining loss of tree cover but also regeneration of degraded land. The picture used is the heuristic cycle model to assess loss and damages vs gain and improvements of various land use practices.\nThe presentation will address the following aspects\n- How much we know from satellite data after 40 years of remote sensing analysis over the Sahel? That section discuss agreement and divergences of evidences and differentiated interpretation of land degradation in the Sahel.\n- The biophysical factors that are relevant for tracking land degradation in the Sahel. Aspects such detangling human to climate factors and biophysical factors behind land dynamics will be presented\n- Introduce some specific cases of driver of land architecture transition under the combined influence of climate and human factor.\n- Based on the above we will conclude with some key recommendations on how to improve land degradation assessment in the Arid region of the Sahel.",

            "abstract": "Precise estimates of the present-day rates and accelerations of ice-mass loss from the polar ice-sheets are important for predicting potential changes in sea level. Current predictions of 21st century sea level change are limited by, among other things, their ability to precisely capture the effects of global warming on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). One method for constraining the mass loss on the GrIS is to make measurements of vertical crustal uplift rates from bedrock around the edge of the ice sheet. Using only GPS observations of crustal displacement, it is impossible to separate the uplift driven by present day mass changes from that due to ice mass changes in the past, e.g. the extensive retreat of the ice sheets since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) or even ice sheet changes during the Little Ice Age. By making measurements of both gravity and surface motion at a bedrock site, the viscoelastic effects could be removed from the observations and we would be able to constrain present day ice mass changes. In this presentation we discuss the results of an experiment to collect surface displacement and absolute gravity observations from southeast Greenland to separate the elastic and viscoelastic signals. We find that the glacial isostatic adjustment signal in this region is positive, contrary to the negative signal predicted by all existing viscosity and ice history models.",

            "abstract": "Historically, geologists have used drawing as a tool not only to record observations but also to engage with the landscape and the materials from which it is constructed. Although geology students are still taught to keep field notebooks, the emphasis on drawing has given way to training in digital tools such as photography and GIS. Has this change altered our perception of our environment, and, thereby, affected the ways that we pursue scientific questions? We address this question through conversations – in the laboratory, studio and field – between artists and scientists that show that we (1) engage with the landscape both rationally and emotionally, (2) are attracted to earth materials because of their form, color, physical qualities and origin/history, (3) overcome technical challenges to realize an end result from an initial idea, (4) struggle to achieve a balance between critical faculties and creative insight, and (5) must communicate ideas, often before they are fully formed, to potential funders. Importantly, we find that the act of rendering (in 2D or 3D), and the ways in which the trace of the hand on paper (or manipulation of clay) engages a part of the brain that is not used in computer-based activities. At the same time, a geological understanding of earth materials enhances their metaphorical applications in the arts. Taken together, these conversations lead us to suggest that more cross-disciplinary training – training scientists in art and artists in science – would not only allow us to explore common themes from different perspectives, but could also create new ways of doing both art and science. Here we provide some examples, such as (1) the importance of drawing for moving from looking to seeing (observation to understanding), (2) ways of engaging perceptions through experimentation, (3) how to reveal the hidden by combining microscopic and macroscopic views of earth materials, and (4) using art as both a language and an interpretive tool. Viewed pragmatically, these examples address the scientific challenge of sketching conceptual ideas in a way that is convincing to both ourselves and to others. More broadly, we explore what may have been lost to earth science by eliminating formal training in drawing, and what might be gained by re-introducing the arts into the earth science curriculum.",

In this study, we use high-frequency observations acquired across the Sahel over five years or more to assess the ability of atmospheric models to simulate the observed surface wind events that are critical to wind erosion. These notably includes morning wind speed maxima resulting from convective mixing of the nocturnal low-level jet and wind gusts associated with deep convective events. The surface wind fields provided by three global reanalyses, ERA-interim, MERRA and NCEP-CFSR are first assessed. The strongest wind speeds, observed in the morning and during deep convective events, are systematically underestimated in reanalyses (Largeron et al., Geophys. Res. Lett. 2015). As analyzed wind fields are one of the main inputs of many dust emission models, their too low fraction of high wind speeds is expected to lead to major errors and/or compensating errors in dust emission simulations. The results of eight 30-year long CMIP5 climate simulations which provided high-frequency outputs (namely for each model time step at a few Sahelian sites, cfSites) are then compared to observations in more details. After comparing diurnal cycles and probability distributions of surface wind speeds and nocturnal low level jets, we further make use of composites centered on convective events, both in observations and models. Large differences are also found among climate simulations and between simulations and observations, and these differences again are found to matter for the simulation of dust emission in the Sahel. Finally, based on the analyses of observations and high-resolution convection-permitting simulations (CASCADE), we present a new parametrization which aims to improve the representation of surface wind speeds during convective events in coarse-resolution atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "Currently, a major challenge in aquifer characterization is the determination of hydraulic parameters with high-spatial resolution. Since the mid-90’s, various working groups have developed numerical evaluation approaches for hydraulic tomography: the inversion of hydraulic tests that have been recorded using tomographic arrangements. The practical application is often associated with long test times, complex evaluations, and prolonged computation times.\nIn our study, a hydraulic tomographical data set consisted of 450 drawdown curves produced by a series of short term pumping tests conducted over 4 working days. Data was collected by two scientists without a technical staff. The tests were performed at the test site “Stegemühle”, Göttingen, Germany in a confined sand and gravel aquifer with a thickness of 2-3 m.\nFor the inversion, an approach has been used, which is based on the transformation of the groundwater flow equation into a form of Eikonal equation (Vasco et al., 2000). Utilizing this approach, the hydraulic data can be inverted using an Eikonal solver e.g. SIRT. This Eikonal solver is considerably computationally efficient and allows hundreds of draw down curves to be inverted on a standard laptop within minutes. Following the methodology described in Brauchler et al. 2013, 3D distribution of diffusivity and specific storage were directly reconstructed, and subsequently their product: the hydraulic conductivity.\nThis study exemplifies that the required data can be recorded and analyzed efficiently in the field, which is a vital precondition for the in-situ field aquifer characterization with hydraulic tomography.\nLiterature\nVasco, D.W., Keers, H., Karasaki, K.

RICEN sampled the investigated area with passive and active seismic. For the active part, acquisition was performed by shooting the area with the MiniVIB and recording the ground motion at 240 seismic stations, placed on a regular in front of the Fangaia. Additional two 1D orthogonal profiles were acquired with sensors located at 2m distance. Ambient noise was instead recorded in the area for several days, including also the active part.\nData from the first experiment and from the two profiles were processed and analysed. We obtained 3D P and S wave tomographic models of the subsoil covered by the grid. The P wave velocity model was obtained from a linearized inversion of P wave first arrivals, manually picked on cross-correlated minimum phase traces. The S model was obtained through the inversion of the phase and group velocities dispersion curves, measured on 96 overlapping sub-grids and for each of them assuming a 1D propagation medium. Dispersion curves were also available from ambient noise analysis. Moreover a 2D long profile was analysed to retrieve a tomographic 2D model of the area and the section migrated at depth to retrieve the bottom of the crater in the area. Finally statistical properties of the scattered field, such as the mean free path, were obtained from the analysis of the coherent vs incoherent wavefield and the enhanced backscattering.\nVelocity contrasts and the properties of the scattered field indicate a clear separation between gas rich and water rich regions.",

            "abstract": "The major difficulty in detecting the aerosol signal from visible and near-infrared remote sensing observations is to reach the proper separation of the components related to the atmosphere and the surface. A method is proposed to circumvent this issue by exploiting the directional and temporal dimensions of the satellite signal through the use of a semi-empirical kernel-driven model for the surface/atmosphere coupled system. This algorithm was implemented by the ICARE Data Center (http://www.icare.univ-lille1.fr), which operationally disseminates a daily AOD product at 670 nm over the MSG disk since 2014. The proposed method referred to as AERUS-GEO (Aerosol and surface albEdo Retrieval Using a directional Splitting method - application to GEO data) is applied to three spectral bands (0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.6 mm) of MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) observations, which scan Europe, Africa, and the Eastern part of South America every 15 minutes. The daily AOD estimates at 0.63μm has been extensively validated. In contrast, the Angstrom coefficient is still going through validation and we will show the differences between the MSG derived Angstrom exponent with that of CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) near-real time aerosol product. The impact of aerosol type on the aerosol radiative forcing will be presented as a part of future development plan.",

            "abstract": "Fluid overpressure has been often proposed as one of the primary mechanisms that facilitate earthquake slip along faults. However, elastic dislocation theory combined with rate- and state- friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes, by reducing the critical rheological fault stiffness, kc. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for seismic hazard and human-induced seismicity. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies on the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be measured.\nWe have used a biaxial rock deformation apparatus within a pressure vessel, in order to allow a true triaxial stress field, in a double direct shear configuration. We tested carbonate fault gouge, Carrara marble, sieved to a grain size of 125 microns. Normal stresses and confining pressure were held constant throughout the experiment at values of 5 to 40 MPa, and the pore fluid pressure was varied from hydrostatic up to near lithostatic values. Shear stress was induced by a constant displacement rate and sliding velocities varied from 0.1-100 microns/s, in order to evaluate slip stability via rate- and state- dependent frictional parameters, such as (a-b), Dc. With increasing fluid pressure we observe an evolution of (a-b) from slightly velocity strengthening to velocity neutral and a reduction in Dc from about 100 to 20 microns. Our analysis on carbonate fault gouges indicates that the increase in fluid pressure not only favour fault reactivation but it also makes the fault more prone to generate earthquake instabilities.",

Significant wave growth at relatively small wave numbers occurs for both H+-band and He+-band EMIC waves at the magnetic equator. We find that the growth of H+-band and He+-band EMIC waves remains strong when they propagate to higher latitudes (< 30 degrees). The full hot plasma dispersion relation and cold plasma dispersion relation are used individually to quantify the quasi-linear bounce-averaged pitch angle diffusion rates for radiation belt electrons and ring current protons due to H+-band and He+-band EMIC waves. The results demonstrate considerable differences in the rates of pitch angle scattering caused by He+-band EMIC waves between the use of hot and cold plasma dispersion relation. He+-band EMIC waves can also resonate with lower energies particles (electrons and protons) when the impact of hot plasma is included. In contrast, much smaller differences are seen in the resonant scattering rates for H+-band EMIC waves. Our study strongly suggests that the effect of hot plasmas should be carefully taken into account to approach improved understanding of the exact role that EMIC waves plays in driving the dynamical evolution of radiation belt electrons and ring current protons.",

            "abstract": "A lot of evidence indicates that fluid flows exist in the subduction interface, including seismic observation, magnetotelluric imaging, heat flow modeling, etc. Fluid percolation should strongly modify rock deformation affected by fluid-induced weakening within the subduction interface. Hence, we study the fluid-rock interaction along the subduction interface using a visco-plastic hydro-mechanical model, in which rock deformation and fluid percolation are self-consistently coupled. Based on a series of 2D numerical experiments, we found two typical hydro-mechanical regimes of deforming subduction interface: (1) coupled and (2) decoupled. In the case of the coupled regime, the tectonic movement of the subduction interface is divided into blocks; newly generated faults are distributed uniformly , say fault band; fluid activity concentrates inside the faults. In the case of the decoupled regime, the upper layer of the subduction interface stops moving while the lower layer continues moving along with the subduction slab; a primary fault is generated at the centre of the subduction interface, or namely decoupled interface. Available observations suggests that both coupled and decoupled regimes can be observed in the nature at different scales. Systematic parameter study suggests that it is mainly the magnitude of the yield strength of subducted rocks depending on their cohesion and friction coefficient, which control the transition between the coupled and decoupled subduction interface regimes.",

Generally, can be obtained from direct measurements, remotely sensed data, or reanalysis and general circulation models (GCMs) data. Each type of product has advantages and limitations: the surface direct measurements provide accurate but sparse spatial coverage, whereas other global products may have large uncertainties. Ground measurements have been normally used for validation and occasionally calibration, but transforming their “true values” spatially to improve the satellite products is still a new and challenging topic. In this study, an improved thin-plate smoothing spline approach is presented to locally “calibrate” the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) ISR product using the reconstructed ISR data from surface meteorological measurements. The influences of surface elevation on ISR estimation was also considered in the proposed method. The point-based surface reconstructed ISR was used as the response variable, and the GLASS ISR product and the surface elevation data at the corresponding locations as explanatory variables to train the thin plate spline model. We evaluated the performance of the approach using the cross-validation method at both daily and monthly time scales over China. We also evaluated estimated ISR based on the thin-plate spline method using independent ground measurements at 10 sites from the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Network (CEON). These validation results indicated that the thin plate smoothing spline method can be effectively used for calibrating satellite derived ISR products using ground measurements to achieve better accuracy.",

(2012) and Savage and Simpson (2013) have conducted cluster analyses of GNSS velocity field in the San Francisco Bay Area and Mojave Desert, respectively. They have successfully found velocity discontinuities. They also showed an advantage of cluster analysis for classifying GNSS velocity field. Since in western United States, strike-slip events are dominant, geometry is simple. However, the Japanese Islands are tectonically complicated due to subduction of oceanic plates. There are many types of crustal deformation such as slow slip event and large postseismic deformation.\nWe propose a modified clustering method of GNSS velocity field in Japan to separate time variant and static crustal deformation. Our modification is performing cluster analysis every several months or years, then qualifying cluster member similarity. If a GNSS station moved differently from its neighboring GNSS stations, the station will not belong to in the cluster which includes its surrounding stations. With this method, time variant phenomena were distinguished.\nWe applied our method to GNSS data of Japan from 1996 to 2015. According to the analyses, following conclusions were derived. The first is the clusters boundaries are consistent with known active faults. For examples, the Arima-Takatsuki-Hanaore fault system and the Shimane-Tottori segment proposed by Nishimura (2015) are recognized, though without using prior information.\nThe second is improving detectability of time variable phenomena, such as a slow slip event in northern part of Hokkaido region detected by Ohzono et al. (2015).\nThe last one is the classification of postseismic deformation caused by large earthquakes. The result suggested velocity discontinuities in postseismic deformation of the Tohoku-oki earthquake. This result implies that postseismic deformation is not continuously decaying proportional to distance from its epicenter.",

We employ high-resolution magmatic-thermomechanical models of the interaction between a mantle plume and thick continental crust to investigate the causes of the spatial and temporal jumps that occur between these eruptive centers, using a stress implementation of magmatic processes, nonlinear temperature-dependent melting, and progressive depletion the rocks from which magmas are extracted. We investigate two possible mechanisms of these jumps in active centers. First, the spacing between eruptive centers is a function of the longevity of amagma conduit in beneath each eruptive center, which must be abandoned when the crust moves too far away from the center of the hotspot, with the distance traveled by the plate in this time determining the spacing between eruptive centers. Alternatively, the cessation of activity at a given eruptive center is controlled by the formation of geochemically depleted “dead zones” which force any new silicic volcanism to occur in a new area of less depleted crust, with the spacing between centers controlled by the size of these dead zones. By varying the speed of the crust over the hotspot, the thickness and composition of the crust, we can determine the relative importance of these two processes for volcanism along the Yellowstone hotspot track has likely changed over time, with implications for changes in average eruptive volumes and repose times between large eruptions over the last 12 Ma. Early results suggest that heating of the crust causes areas of melt accumulation to move upward with time before resetting to a deeper level as the crust moves over the hotspot, a possible additional source of discrete behavior along the hotspot track. We check our results using existing geochemical constraints. ",

            "abstract": "Spectral induced polarization method (SIP) or complex resistivity method is increasing its application in metalliferous ore exploration, hydrocarbon exploration, underground water exploration, monitoring of environment pollution, and the evaluation of environment remediation. And the measurement of complex resistivity or complex impedance of rock/ore sample and polluted water plays a fundamental role in improving the application effect of SIP and the application scope of SIP. However, current instruments can’t guaranty the accuracy of measurement when the resistance of sample is less than 10Ω or great than 100kΩ. A lot of samples, such as liquid, polluted sea water, igneous rock, limestone, and sandstone, can’t be measured with reliable complex resistivity result. Therefore, this problem projects a shadow in the basic research and application research of SIP. We design a high precision measurement system from the study of measurement principle, sample holder, and measurement instrument. We design input buffers in a single board. We adopt operation amplifier AD549 in this system because of its ultra-high input impedance and ultra-low current noise. This buffer is good in acquiring potential signal across high impedance sample. By analyzing the sources of measurement error and errors generated by the measurement system, we propose a correction method to remove the error in order to achieve high quality complex impedance measurement for rock and ore samples. This measurement system can improve the measurement range of the complex impedance to 0.1 Ω ~ 10 GΩ with amplitude error less than 0.1% and phase error less than 0.1mrad when frequency ranges as 0.01 Hz ~ 1 kHz. We tested our system on resistors with resistance as 0.1Ω ~ 10 GΩ in frequency range as 1 Hz ~ 1000 Hz, and the measurement error is less than 0.1 mrad. We also compared the result with LCR bridge and SCIP, we can find that the bridge’s measuring range only reaches 100 MΩ, SCIP’s measuring range only reach 50MΩ. But our measurement system can obtain accurate measurement results until 10 GΩ. We also carried out a test on core samples with low resistance, high resistance, and medium resistance, the measure error was less than 0.1 mrad in most conditions and the measurement results can be very good correspondence with characteristics of sample.",

Its detailed properties, such as its shape, the density jump across it or its topography are key for understanding the dynamics of the core and, ultimately, the generation and sustained character of the Earth’s magnetic field. The determination of the ICB topography and its variation with time could also enhance our understanding of the inner core growth and its past history.\nSeismology makes use of two phases to study the shallow inner core : the PKiKP, reflected at the ICB and the PKIKP, refracted into the inner core. The PKiKP/PKIKP amplitude ratio and the travel time residual of these phases characterize the vicinity of the ICB and may help constrain ICB topography. Different studies propose various wavelengths for this topography: from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers.\nSeveral parameters can affect PKiKP/PKIKP amplitude ratios and the corresponding differential travel time, such as the quality factor of the shallow inner core, the density jump at the ICB, the geometry of the ray paths or even the reflection coefficient at the ICB. We present a global map of PKiKP/PKIKP amplitude ratios and differential travel times filtered in different pass-bands, with regional densification based, in particular, on the relatively short wavelength sampling afforded by large aperture broadband arrays, such as USArray, and discuss their spatial variability and interpretation in terms of ICB topography, as appropriate.\nWe also have assembled a catalog of high quality doublets which provide a reference for the stability of the measurements, and point to possible time variability of the topography.

            "abstract": "Stratospheric sulfate geoengineering has been proposed to reduce the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. If it is ever used, it would change agricultural production, and so is one of the future climate scenarios for the third phase of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison. As an example of those impacts, we use the Community Land Model (CLM-crop 4.5) to simulate how climate changes from the G4 geoengineering scenario from the Geoengineering Modeling Intercomparison Project. The G4 geoengineering scenario specifies, in combination with RCP4.5 forcing, starting in 2020 daily injections of a constant amount of SO2 at a rate of 5 Tg SO2 per year at one point on the Equator into the lower stratosphere. Eight climate modeling groups have completed G4 simulations. We use the crop model to simulate the impacts of climate change (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) on the global agriculture system for five crops – rice, maize, soybeans, cotton, and sugarcane. In general, without irrigation, compared with the reference run (RCP4.5), global production of cotton, rice and sugarcane would increase significantly due to the cooling effect. Maize and soybeans show different regional responses. In tropical regions, maize and soybean have a higher yield in G4 compared with RCP4.5, while in the temperate regions they have a lower yield under a geoengineered climate. Impacts on specific countries in terms of different crop production depend on their locations. For example, the United States and Argentina show soybean production reduction of about 15% under G4 compared to RCP4.5, while Brazil increases soybean production by about 10%.",

            "abstract": "The current Exceptional Drought (US Drought Monitor) over the western United States warrants an in-depth investigation of possible causes of decreased precipitation and surface hydrology. Black carbon (BC), being the most radiatively-absorptive of any aerosol species, has the potential to semi-directly influence atmospheric physics and dynamics. Aloft, BC can exacerbate the aridity in some areas while increasing precipitation in other locations. On the surface, BC can also alter surface hydrology parameters such as surface runoff and snow water equivalent. In this study, we examine the role of BC and its possible effect on spatial precipitation redistribution and surface hydrology west of and over the Rocky Mountains from an online and coupled meteorological and chemical perspective. In particular, we utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model at the horizontal resolution of 30 km, employing the Fu-Liou-Gu plane-parallel radiation scheme and a three-dimensional radiation parameterization over mountainous areas to account for BC feedback with clouds, radiation, local circulation, and precipitation. Preliminary results of a January 2005 low pressure system show the inclusion of BC increases (decreases) precipitation on the windward (leeward) side of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, and the Sierra Nevada. Results also show BC contributes to an increase in surface runoff on the windward side of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, the Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, but a decrease in snow water equivalent over Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains.",

            "abstract": "In foothills, the propagation of faults within incompetent bed is potentially accompanied by the development of oblique cleavage. This is particularly demonstrated in the Southern Pyrenees where the out-of-sequence propagation of a flat thrust imposed the development of oblique cleavage within the flat-lying Pamplona marls. Over hundreds of meters, it is possible to trace step by step the cleavage development. The horizontal bedding is gradually superimposed by oblique cleavage (dip ~60°N). At the end of the studied outcrop, a pervasive ~mm spaced cleavage is observed. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a classic tool for study the deformation in shales. In the Pamplona marls, AMS is essentially controlled by clays fabric. AMS shows that the degree of anisotropy Pj is not the best parameter to highlight the degree of deformation of marls. This parameter is positively correlated to the bulk magnetic susceptibility Km (~10-4 SI). On the contrary, the shape parameter T is more consistent with the degree of deformation: higher is the degree of deformation observed in outcrop (occurrence of pervasive cleavage), lower is the T parameter. As m-spaced cleavage starts to develop, the shape parameter T decreases linearly from ~0.8 to ~0.2, reflecting a gradual disorganization of clay particles. Despite the development of mm-spaced cleavage, the magnetic fabric remains oblate and is still dominated by the sedimentary fabric. This means that the bulk fabric of clay particles remains parallel to the bedding plane. Our study demonstrates that AMS is a powerful tool to trace the deformation of clay rocks and that the study of the shape parameter T is a robust and fast gauge of clays fabric. .",

Due to leveling of intensity was roughly divided into seven grades according to peak ground acceleration (PGA) in Taiwan, the intensity warning message is not applicable for many other EEW end users, the accuracy of the estimated PGA still need to improve.\nThe earthquake data used in this study is recorded by Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) from 1991 to 2012 in Ilan, Taiwan. A total of 1945 records were used for this study. Earthquake sorting threshold was set as focal depths less than 35 km and magnitude Mw ≥5.0 in this study. First 3 seconds window were used after P waves arriving, and applied two kind of filtering including a 0.075Hz high pass and a 0.2~5Hz band pass Butterworth filter to remove the low-frequency drift and possible high frequency noise. We computed τc and Pd from the above mentioned filtering displacement signals after the P arrival.\nTwo pairs of linear relations had showed in each station between τc, Pd, magnitude (Mw), and hypocenter distance (R) that could be corrected individually. Regional results were applied in first step base on Wu (2005, 2006). Due to site responses are varies for different stations, it’s not suitable using same linear relations. Correction of individual stations was used in second step to improve accuracy of prediction of Mw and R. Third, PGA prediction from site correction based ground motion prediction equation (Jean et al., 2006) indicated that the corrected parameters of EEW in this study had improved the accuracy of ground motion (PGA) prediction. Finally, one target event (2002 Hualien earthquake, Mw=7.1) was used for verification of this correction method.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the permafrost carbon (C) feedback it is important to synthesize our current knowledge, and knowledge gaps, of how permafrost thaw can cause in situ mineralization or downstream mobilization of aged soil organic carbon (SOC) and the rate of this release. This potential loss of old SOC may occur via gaseous flux of CO2 and CH4 exchanged between soil and the atmosphere and via waterborne flux as DOC, POC (and their subsequent decomposition and release to the atmosphere). Carbon isotope (14C and 13C) approaches have been used to estimate both rates and pathways for permafrost C mobilization and mineralization. Radiocarbon (14C) has been used to estimate the contribution of aged C to overall respiration or waterborne C export. We aim to contrast results from radiocarbon studies, in order to assess differences between ecosystems (contrasting wet and dry ecosystems), thaw histories (active layer deepening or thermokarst landforms), greenhouse gas considered (CO2 and CH4) and seasons. We propose to also contrast methodologies used for assessing the contribution of aged C to overall C balance, and include studies using 13C data. Biological fractionation of 13C during both uptake and decomposition has been taken advantage of both in order to aid the interpretation of 14C data and on its own to assess sources and mineralization pathways. For example, 13C data has been used to differentiate between CH4 production pathways, and the relative contribution of anaerobic CO2 production to overall respiration. Overall, carbon isotope research is proving highly valuable for our understanding of permafrost C dynamics following thaw, and there is a current need to synthesize the available literature.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we explore the use of exogenous snow-related information for enhancing the operation of water facilities in snow dominated watersheds. Traditionally, such information is assimilated into short-to-medium term streamflow forecasts, which are then used to inform water systems operation. Here, we adopt an alternative model-free approach, where the policy is directly conditioned upon a small set of selected observational data able to surrogate the snow-pack dynamics. In snow-fed water systems, the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) stored in the basin often represents the largest contribution to the future season streamflow. The SWE estimation process is challenged by the high temporal and spatial variability of snow-pack and snow properties. Traditional retrieval methods, based on few ground sensors and optical satellites, often fail at representing the spatial diversity of snow conditions over large basins and at producing continuous (gap-free) data at the high sample frequency (e.g. daily) required to optimally control water systems. Against this background, SWE estimates from remote sensed radar products stand out, being able to acquire spatial information with no dependence on cloud coverage. In this work, we propose a technique for retrieving SWE estimates from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Cosmo SkyMed X-band images: a regression model, calibrated on ground SWE measurements, is implemented on dry snow maps obtained through a multi-temporal approach. The unprecedented spatial scale of this application is novel w.r.t. state of the art radar analysis conducted on limited spatial domains. The operational value of the SAR retrieved SWE estimates is evaluated based on ISA, a recently developed information selection and assessment framework. The method is demonstrated on a snow-rain fed river basin in the Italian Alps. Preliminary results show SAR images have a good potential for monitoring snow conditions and for improving water management operations.",

Historically, hydrologic simulations have not accounted for feedback looks between the GW system and other hydrologic processes. Integrated SW-GW modelling can provide a comprehensive and coherent understanding on basin-scale water cycle and better manage the water resources for sustainable usage. At Yi-lan area, hydrological modelling has been performed for both the entire SW and GW systems along, but fully integrated SW-GW modeling has not been attempted for this area. In order to enhance the efficiency of water useage, a coupled GW and SW flow model (GSFLOW), developed by U.S. Geological Survey, is selected as the numerical model to simulate the major processes of the hydrologic cycle. GSFLOW integrated PRMS with MODFLOW-2005 which perform surface hydrology simulation and 3-D groundwater simulation, respectively. The data of solar radiation, land use, precipitation, temperature, river stage, stream flow rate, groundwater level, and digital elevation model were collected from 2004-2012 to develop the simulation model. The coupled GSFLOW model is calibrated by automatic parameter estimation approach of using streamflows and groundwater levels. The singular value decomposition (SVD) method is performed to avoid the instability of solution during the model calibration. The calibrated results show that the state variables and fluxes in basin-scale water cycle can be simulated with high spatial and temporal resolutions, and all the important hydrologic processes can be characterized simultaneously in an integrated framework. The scenarios with different precipitation distributions and temperature patterns are conducted on the calibrated model to forecast the dynamic variations of hydrologic processes in the entire water basin. This study clearly demonstrated the benefits of using a physically based integrated SW-GW model, instead of a more conceptual one, in addressing complex real-world systems.",

            "abstract": "A major link between climate and humans in Northern Africa, and the Sahel in particular, is land use and associated land cover change, mainly where subsistence farming prevails. Here we assess possible feedbacks between the type of land use and harvest intensity and climate by analyzing a series of idealized GCM experiments using the MPI-ESM.\nThe base line for these experiments is a simulation forced by the RCP8.5 scenario which includes strong greenhouse gas emissions and anthropogenic land cover changes. The anthropogenic land cover changes in the RCP8.5 scenario include a mixture of pasture and agriculture. In subsequent simulations, we replace the entire area affected by anthropogenic land cover change in the region between the Sahara in the North and the Guinean Coast in the South (4°N to 20°N)by either pasture or agriculture, respectively. In a second setup we vary the amount of harvest in case of agriculture. The RCP8.5 base line simulation reveals strong changes in mean agriculture and monsoon rainfall. In comparison with these changes, any variation of the type of land use in the study area leads to very small, mostly insignificantly small, additional differences in mean temperature and annual precipitation change in this region. If it comes to climate extremes, we notice that strong anthropogenic land use change may impact climate extremes. Within the uncertainty of the representation of land use in current ESMs, our study suggests marginal feedback between land use changes and climate changes triggered by strong greenhouse gas emissions. Hence as a good approximation, climate change can be considered as external driver in models of land-use — conflict dynamics when seasonal or mean values are used as external driver.",

            "abstract": "Detecting the influence of solar activity on snow is of very meaningful for understanding global change. However, the previous studies in this field were quite limited. Using statistical tools, this paper tries to detect correlation between solar activity (including Solar Radiation Flux SRF, Total Solar Irradiance TSI and Solar Sunspot Number SSN) and winter/spring snow (including winter/spring snow depth and snow day number) over the Tibetan Plateau with gauge data for 1961-2011. This paper also detects the connection between solar activity and East Asian atmospheric circulation. We studied the correlation between solar activity and Arctic Oscillation and the East Asian winter monsoon, which are typical winter modes of the atmospheric circulation in East Asian. The result shows that on interdecadal time scale the correlation between solar activity and snow is more significant than raw data, especially after removing 11-yr solar cycle. It indicates that the sun leads and modulates interdecadal change of winter/spring snow over the Tibetan Plateau and East Asian atmospheric circulation. We find that comparing to winter snow, spring snow has closer relationship to solar activity, especially spring snow day number has significant simultaneous and lag time correlation with three parameters of solar activity no matter on short or long time scales. At the first (third) 11-yr lag years, the correlation coefficients between spring snow day number and SRF, SSN (TSI) have passed 0.01 significance level using Monte-Carlo test method. Our study exposes that winter/spring snow over the Tibetan Plateau has significant simultaneous and lag time correlation with Arctic Oscillation and the East Asian winter monsoon on interdecadal time scale. With more snow, the Arctic Oscillation is in positive phase, and East Asian winter monsoon is weak; vice versa. In 2012/2013 winter, the fact of less snow over the Tibetan Plateau, negative phase of Arctic Oscillation and strong East Asian winter monsoon is an example. Finally, we try to explore the physical mechanism of connecting solar activity to snow over the Tibetan Plateau, and give some reasonable explanation for the results obtained above.\nKeywords: solar activity； correlation analysis； snow over the Tibetan Plateau； Arctic Oscillation；East Asian winter monsoon",

            "abstract": "The Porcupine Basin is a narrow V-shaped failed rifted basin located offshore SW Ireland. It is of Permo-Triassic to Cenozoic age, with the main rifting phase in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. Porcupine Basin is a key study area to learn about the processes of continental extension and to understand the thermal history of this rifted basin. Previous studies show increasing stretching factors, from less than 1.5 to the North to more than 6 to the South. A ridge feature, the Porcupine Median Ridge, has been identified in the middle of the southernmost part of the basin. During the last three decades, this ridge has been successively interpreted as a volcanic structure, a diapir of partially serpentinized mantle, or a block of continental crust. Its nature still remains debated today. In this study, we use arrival times from refractions and wide-angle reflections in the sedimentary, crustal and mantle layers to image the crustal structure of the thinnest part of the basin, the geometry of the continental thinning from margin to margin, and the Porcupine Median Ridge. The final velocity model is then compared with coincident seismic reflection data. We show that (1) the basin is asymmetric, (2) P-wave velocities in the uppermost mantle are lower than expected for unaltered peridotites, implying upper-mantle serpentinisation, (3) the nature of Porcupine Median Ridge is probably volcanic, and (4) the amount of thinning is greater than shown in previous studies. We discuss the thermal implications of these results for the evolution of this rift system and the processes leading to the formation of failed rifts. This project is funded by the Irish Shelf Petroleum Studies Group (ISPSG) of the Irish Petroleum Infrastructure Programme Group 4.",

Its main purpose is to reveal the subsurface structure and the geodynamical framework of one of the least studied areas in Africa and the world between the Kaapvaal Craton and the Congo Craton. The first one year of data from 15 NARS-Botswana stations in addition to one Africa-Array station and one permanent GSN station was used to make first inferences on the shear wave velocity structure of the crust and the upper mantle.\nThe data used for this study are Rayleigh wave dispersion curves obtained by two-station and ambient noise analysis for periods between 5-40 s and 10-150 s, respectively. In the two-station analysis, the dispersion curves were estimated using frequency-time analysis of vertical-component cross-correlations of all earthquakes recorded with the same back azimuth at each seismometer pair. In the ambient noise analysis, the dispersion curves were estimated from frequency-time analysis of the empirical Green’s functions generated from the stacked cross-correlations of daily seismic records between all seismometer pairs. Finally, a tomographic inversion scheme will be applied using the LSQR algorithm on the dispersion curves to produce phase velocity maps for each period for the studied area.\nThe first results show interesting variations that indicate strong lateral variations in geodynamics and earth composition throughout the central and southern part of Botswana.",

            "abstract": "Extreme event attribution has increasingly received attention in the scientific community. It may also serve decision-making at the regional level where much of the climate change impact mitigation takes place. Nevertheless, there is, to date, little known about the requirements of regional actors in terms of extreme event attribution. We have therefore analysed these at the example of regional decision-makers for climate change-related activities and/or concerned with storm surge risks at the German Baltic Sea and heat wave risks in the Greater Paris area. In order to explore if stakeholders find scientific knowledge from extreme event attribution useful and how this information might be relevant to their decision-making, we consulted a diverse set of actors engaged in the assessment, mitigation and communication of storm surge, heat wave, and climate change-related risks. Extreme event attribution knowledge was perceived to be most useful to public and political awareness-raising, but was of little or no relevance for the consulted stakeholders themselves. It was not acknowledged that it would support adaptation planning as sometimes argued in the literature. The consulted coastal protection, health, and urban adaptation planners rather needed reliable statements about possible future changes in extreme events than causal statements about past events. To enhance salience, a suitable product of event attribution should be linked to regional problems, vulnerabilities, and impacts of climate change. Given that the tolerance of uncertainty is rather low, most of the stakeholders also claimed that a suitable product of event attribution is to be received from a trusted “honest broker” and published rather later, but with smaller uncertainties than vice versa. Institutional mechanisms, like regional climate services, which enable and foster communication, translation and mediation across the boundaries between knowledge and action can help fulfill such requirements. This is of particular importance for extreme event attribution which is often understood as science producing complex and abstract information attached to large uncertainties. They can serve as an interface for creating the necessary mutual understanding by being in a continuous dialogue with both science and stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial and erosional discharge of the thawing permafrost in the East Siberian Arctic delivers large quantities of terrigenous organic carbon (Terr-OC) into marine waters. The fate of the remobilized Terr-OC shelf export needs to be better constrained as it impacts the potential for a climate-carbon feedback. In the present study, the composition of the cross-shelf exported organic carbon in different marine pools is evaluated.\nThe results show DOC values (737-3598 μg/L) one order of magnitude higher than POC (20-356 μg/L) with higher concentrations closer to the Lena River, particularly for the DOC. δ13C and Δ14C signatures and lignin phenols present good correlations with DOC levels. In contrast, POC may have a preferential marine origin, as concentrations do not correlate with isotope and terrestrial biomarker proxies. The δ13C signatures in the three carbon pools vary from -23.9±1.9‰ in the SOC, -26.1±1.2‰ in the DOC and -27.1±1.9‰ in the POC. And the Δ14C values range between -356±64‰ (SOC), -226±92‰ (DOC) and -113±122‰ (POC). Those stable and radiocarbon isotopes also present contrasting offsets between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea. DOC and POC show a depleted and younger trend off the Lena River plume. The older and enriched signatures in the outer-shelf of the ESS suggest the influence of the sea ice coverage and the Pacific inflow from the East.\nLignin phenols exhibit higher concentration in the SOC (0.1-2.3 mg/g OC) and DOC (0.1-2.4 mg/g OC) than in the POC (0.03-1.1 mg/g OC). The good correlation between lignin and Δ14C signatures in the DOC confirms that a significant fraction of the outer-shelf DOC comes from Terr-OC. On the other hand, lignin phenols in the POC do not correlate with Δ14C values suggesting a predominant marine origin of this carbon pool. Ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols increase in DOC suggesting either molecular degradation or fractionations during leaching. Regarding lignin provenance, syringil/vanillyl and cinnamyl/vannillyl phenols ratios present clear boundaries showing that SOC, DOC and POC come from different Terr-OC sources. Overall, it seems that terrigenous DOM is just partially removed by microbial degradation along the shelf transport and most of the terr-OC in the Siberian Arctic is exported off-shelf within this carbon pool.",

            "abstract": "The broad shelf areas of the Russian Arctic Ocean are purported to be substantial and increasing sources of atmospheric methane that are particularly sensitive to warming climate. I report here an overview of an extensive continuous record of ambient CH4 mixing ratios and surface water concentrations made during the SWERUS-C3 expedition and how these observations might fit into the conversation about Arctic CH4 emissions.\nDuring Jul and Aug 2014 continuous high-resolution measurements of CH4 were made in the atmosphere and the surface ocean as the Swedish I/B Oden crossed the middle and outer shelf areas of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas and into the Chukchi Sea. Air and water samples were analyzed with independent CRDS laser systems. Air was continuously sampled from four heights 9 to 35 m above the sea surface. Heights were switched every 2 minutes and target gases of ca. 1.800 and 4.000 ppm were run every two hours. Surface seawater was collected from 8 m below the surface. The counter flow of the equilibration sampler was analyzed with a CRDS laser. Two standards of 15 and 150 ppm were used in addition to the ambient air targets.\nIn the Laptev Sea the air burden ranged from 1.865 to 1.908 ppm and the water 1.976 to 105 ppm. In the ice covered East Siberian Sea the range was 1.874 to 1.996 ppm in air and 2.132 to 210 ppm in water (83% were <10 ppm). Calculated fluxes ranged from 1.6 to 7.7 mg m-2d-1 (including regions with sea ice where flux calculations are problematic).\nThe air and water data were combined with wind data to calculate wind driven fluxes. Our mean flux of 3.1 mg m-2d-1 leads to a shelf-wide extrapolated flux of ca. 2.4 Tg yr-1. This is much higher than reported fluxes from many shelf seas but consistent with previous reports from these regions from monitoring, shipboard and aircraft data. These observations, integrated with terrestrial data, contribute to an emerging quantitative picture of Arctic CH4 dynamics and its role in the global budget.",

In the last three years, we have conducted gravity and magnetic survey in the eastern segment of the China–Mongolia border along the profile, hoping to get a detailed characterization of the subsurface of this area. In this study, we conducted lithology identification in this area with measured gravity and magnetic data.\nIn our work, topological calculations were performed on inversion data and physical property data for lithology identification. Our work can be summarized into the following steps: Firstly, the rock density and magnetic susceptibility near the survey profiles were summarized by field reconnaissance, and the lithology was divided into several types. Thus, a correspondence between lithology and physical properties was defined to some extent. Secondly, different mapping equations were established according to the physical properties for each lithology.Then, inversion of the gravity and magnetic data have been performed to get the physical properties (density and susceptibility) below the profile. Lastly, the lithology was identified through gravity and magnetic inversion result and the mapping equations mentioned above.\nIn our study, the magmatic rocks within 50 km of the lower half space can be divided into four major types based on the identification result. The lithology varies significantly from north to south below this profile. Moreover, the lithology distribution trend and the formation age of the lower half space is summarized based on characteristics of the gravity and magnetic fields and the tectonic setting.\nFor lithology identification with different types of data, we think that identify lithology information by one of the data can be conducted firstly, such as magnetic susceptibility, and then bring the results to lithology identification among the inversion of other data , which greatly improves the accuracy of identification of lithology. In addition, for the physical properties, we must fully consider the relationship between the location of rock outcrops and the study area, if outcrop with the measured area is too far away, there is no use value, and we must fully consider the impact of weathering for outcrops.",

            "abstract": "The gravity and magnetic models are constructed for three areas along the Peruvian margin between 7.25°S and 16.75°S and are based on the all available wide-angle seismic velocity models. The gravity and magnetic models image nearly the whole margin which has been only partly resolved with geophysical methods up to now. The continental margin is characterized by positive free-air anomalies of varying amplitudes, indicating that the margin has been shaped by the subduction of different features on the Nazca Plate. In the Yaquina Area (7.25°S to 11°S) gravity anomalies caused by the Trujillo Trough and the Mendaña Fracture Zone are successfully modelled with remarkable undulations in the layer geometry of the oceanic crust. Along the continental margin, especially in the Lima Area (10.50°S to 14.40°S), strong undulations of the lower continental crust influence the upper sedimentary layers and support the development of basins along the Peruvian margin. The theory stating that the Peruvian margin is uplifted by the subducting Nazca Ridge is supported by gravity modelling. Consequently the buoyant Nazca Ridge is, at least partly, responsible for the extended region of flat subduction. The thickened and slightly asymmetrical crust of the Nazca Ridge is envisaged in gravity modelling. In the Nazca Ridge Area (14.25°S to 16.75°S) no accretionary prism is modelled. We conclude that the ridge is eroding the continental margin; furthermore the subduction of eroded sediments is probable. Gravity modelling suggests that the Nazca Ridge has fractured the continental margin. North of the ridge, in the Lima Area, a rather uniform accretionary complex is observed. This indicates that, after the margin was eroded by the southwards moving Nazca Ridge, the prism rapidly reached its stable size. In the Yaquina Area an accretionary prism is modelled in the whole research area but local variations of its location and structure indicate the former erosive influence on the continental margin of subducting features on the Nazca Plate. The layers of the oceanic crust show increasing densities implying they possess an originally high degree of porosity before actually subducting.",

            "abstract": "The investigated sample was dredged in the Kahouanne basin during the research cruise SO-154 (RV Sonne) in the Lesser Antilles Island Arc between the islands of Guadeloupe and Montserrat (Halbach et al., 2002). The Kahouanne basin represents the southern extension of the large Kallinago intra-arc basin and has a length of approximately 40 km and a width of 15 km. The western margin of the basin is dominated by the Shoe-Rock-Spur fault zone. Previous research cruises found indications for low-temperature hydrothermal fluid-flow along the fault zone (Polyak et al., 1992). The sample 18CD is a sediment with grain- sizes of 0.25-0.63 mm, cemented by a Nontronite-Manganese matrix, partly displaying layer-like texture. The groundmass is composed of feldspar, pyroxenes, glass- and rhyodacitic fragments, as well as pelagic carbonates in clasts of different size. Often, ignimbritic textures are visible, pointing to volcanic ejection products. A detailed analysis was carried out on the sample 18CD, starting with the preparation of thin-sections, followed by XRD, XRF, ICP-OES, AAS, SEM (EDX-ZAF). In addition, we analyzed the sample with bi-directional reflectance and emission measurements conducted in the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), as well as visible/near-infrared reflectance using an ASD spectrometer at the SETI Institute. The results of the spectroscopic measurements show striking similarities to Martian nontronites, detected by orbiting instruments. Furthermore, the in-depth analyses of the hydrothermally altered sediment reveals reasonable processes and products for past and present Mars.\n",

            "abstract": "Multiphase flow modeling studies below the ground surface is very essential for designing suitable remediation strategies for contaminated aquifers and for the development of petroleum and geothermal reservoirs. Presence of fractured bedrock beneath the ground surface will make multiphase flow process more complex due to its highly heterogeneous nature. A major challenge in modeling flow within a fractured rock is to capture the interaction between the high permeability fracture and the low permeability rock-matrix. In some instances, weathering and mineral depositions will lead to formation of an additional layer named fracture-skin at the fracture-matrix interface. Porosity and permeability of fracture-skin may significantly vary from the adjacent rock matrix and this variation will result in different flow and transport behavior within the fracture-skin. In the present study, an attempt has been made to model simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases (water and LNAPL) in a saturated coupled fracture-skin-matrix system. A fully-implicit finite difference model has been developed to simulate the variation of pressure and saturation of fluid phases along the fracture and within the rock-matrix. Sensitivity studies have been done to analyze the effect of change of various fracture-skin parameters such as porosity, diffusion coefficient and thickness on pressure and saturation distribution of both wetting and non-wetting fluid phases. It can be concluded from the study that the presence of fracture-skin is significantly affecting the fluid flow at the fracture-matrix interface and it can also be seen from the study that the flow behavior of both fluid phases is sensitive to fracture-skin parameters.",

Comparison of the simulated soil temperature and moisture, surface energy flux, and upper−lower atmospheric circulation showed that the regional climate can be influenced by the freeze−thaw process of soil. The results indicate that the freeze−thaw process is a buffer to the seasonal changes in soil and near-surface temperatures and strengthens the energy exchange between the soil and the atmosphere. During the freeze (thaw) process, releasing (absorbing) of phase change energy retards the cooling (heating) effect of air temperature on soil. The soil freeze−thaw process increases (decreases) the surface heat source of the plateau in winter (summer), which increases (decreases) the near-surface temperature in winter (summer). Promoted by atmospheric circulation, the soil freeze−thaw process influences climate at the high and low altitudes of the plateau; this may also contribute to the maintenance of the South Asia High. In the early stages of permafrost degradation, the regional climate effects of freezing and thawing may accelerate the degradation of permafrost.",

            "abstract": "Detrital thermochronology has become an important tool to quantify the erosional history of mountainous regions. Despite an increasing number of studies utilizing detrital records, it remains unclear how the record of spatially variable erosion of upstream drainage basins is preserved in the thermochronologic signal contained in the sediments. This important spatiotemporal problem is a first-order unknown that limits the interpretation of the geological significance of the detrital signal. To improve our understanding of detrital records in terms of spatiotemporal erosion rates, we use a three-step approach to study modern fluvial sediments from the Bhutan Himalaya. First, based on a preferred tectonomorphic scenario extracted by inversion of in situ multi-thermochronological ages, we predict apatite fission-track (AFT) age distributions in 18 catchments using the Pecube software. Second, we compare AFT age distributions from modern sand bars collected at each catchment outlet to distributions extracted from Monte Carlo sampling of the predicted catchment ages. We find that observed and predicted age distributions are statistically equivalent for only ~75% of the catchments. Third, we calculate predicted detrital age distributions by scaling the prevalence of ages in the catchment in proportion to topographic and climatic metrics (e.g., local relief, steepness index, specific stream power weighted by precipitation rate) or landslide-driven erosion to quantify their effects and relationships to the observed detrital AFT age distributions. Preliminary results suggest erosion in proportion to the topographic metrics cannot reproduce the observed age distributions, but bedrock landsliding may provide sufficient age variability to reproduce the observations. Ongoing work is determining whether variable target mineral concentrations in bedrock geological units or non-uniform sediment sourcing from moraine- or glacier-covered regions can reproduce the observed ages.",

            "abstract": "Storm events are hot moments of emission for several dissolved and particulate chemical species at major stake for water quality (e.g. dissolved organic carbon DOC, suspended sediments, phosphorus, NH4). During such events, the solutes or particles are exported from heterogeneous sources through various pathways to stream or are possibly stored in retention hot spots temporary. This leads to specific integrated signals at the outlet at the scale of storm events. The dynamics of such events are also very short especially in headwater catchments where their total duration ranges over 10h to 3 days, with very quick variations in stream flow and concentrations at the outlet occurring in a few hours. Thus for investigating properly event processes, high frequency monitoring of flow and water quality is required. We analysed 103 storm events in a 5 km2 agricultural headwater catchment, part of the AgrHys Observatory, on the basis of a 3-year-long data set which combined meterological (Rainfall), hydrological (flow and piezometry), and water quality (turbidity, conductivity, DOC and NO3 concentrations) data recorded at very high frequencies (from 1 to 20 min) thanks to dedicated sensors. We described the storm events using simple (1 variable) and combined (2 variables) descriptors for characterizing level and dynamics of flow (Q), groundwater levels, and concentrations (C) but also the C-Q relationships. Three intra annual periods have been previously defined for base flow dynamic according to shallow groundwater table variations so that they correspond to different connectivity status in the catchment. The seasonal and inter-annual variability of the storm events have been analysed using the descriptors and based on these predefined periods. Principal component analysis based on storm chemical descriptors led to discriminate these three seasons while storm hydrological descriptors are less variable between them. Finally we used a clustering method to build a typology of storm events based on the descriptors.",

            "abstract": "We expect that the interiors of terrestrial planets look somewhat like our own - with a crust, a mantle hosting a range of mineralogical transformations and an iron alloy core. Data from existing geophysical observations of Mars, including its moment of inertia and mass, together with mineralogical, cosmochemical, geodynamical and meteorite information and modeling have lead to the creation of a variety of models of the density profile of the martian interior. A number of these density models are accompanied by seismic profiles in the planet. The presence of liquid layer in the outer core is supported by geodetic information; the presence of a solid inner core has not been conclusively ruled out by previous studies though it is unlikely. Some models predict jumps in seismic velocity in the mantle as steadily increasing pressure changes the stable phase assemblage, while other models instead show smooth increases in velocity. Attenuation in the martian mantle has been estimated by considering the tidal dissipation observed as Phobos orbits Mars. \nWe investigate a range of models of Mars' density and velocity structure, using both simulations of Mars' normal mode oscillations and calculations of body wave travel times, ray paths and synthetic waveforms. For several features of the martian interior, from the presence of sharp boundaries in the mantle, to probable core sizes, we seek seismically observable signatures. Probing Mars' interior using seismic techniques is a key aim of the upcoming InSight mission to Mars; if seismic sources are sufficiently numerous and energetic then the presence of known seismic signatures for characteristics of the martian interior will help us to understand what lies beneath the surface of Mars.

However, no active seismic characterization has been presented, nor published. The Multi­channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) offers an useful tool to estimate vertical and horizontal velocity changes of the shallow subsurface. This can correlate to variations on rock elastic properties and/or fluid content, and represents the subsurface-layering.\nSurface waves were stimulated using a sledgehammer as source, and were measured with 48 vertical geophones with spacing of 1 m and the roll along method with a setup dis­placement of 2 m. Two source offsets, 10 m and 30 m, were used to increase the data quality and the resolution.\nThe analysis of propagation velocities leads to dispersion curves from which 1D shear wave velocity profiles can be inverted. Those will be interpolated to create a 2D ground stiffness map. The measurements were taken in the NW area of the main degassing zone and are partially in the same spot of former investigations, i.e. CO2 concentration and gas flux measurements, electric and gravimetric surveys and continuous seismic noise mea­surements.\nChanges in the structure of the 2D velocity maps can be explained potentially with the oc­currence of fluid paths and their diffusion in the subsurface or the existence of the Počatky-Plesná fault zone, which position is not fully understood yet or both features in combination.",

            "abstract": "We study the radiated energy and rupture duration for more than 500 deep and intermediate depth earthquakes (depth>50km and M>5.5). The average source time function is obtained by stacking broadband P-wave pulses recorded globally and used to measure the rupture durations, by comparing alternative versions of the same waveform. The radiated energy is obtained by integration of velocity spectrum observed at each station and corrected for radiation pattern and propagation effects.\nThe global analysis of the rupture duration show how beyond the scattering of the scaled duration seen on the data, the depth reduction of the duration can principally be explained by incremental shear velocity with depth. Furthermore, the duration to moment comparison shows how 1/3 scaling is not valid for deep seismicity, suggesting a difference in dynamic for small and large events. The existence of a different scaling law is further corroborated by the analysis of scaled energy, which is not constant as function of moment.\nThe radiated energy and rupture duration are combined to derive stress drop, apparent stress, efficiency and other parameters of the rupture. The global analysis of these parameters suggests how deep and intermediate depth events are systematically different from shallow earthquakes. We further derive rupture velocity for some of the studied events, to get further information on the dynamic properties of the rupture process.\nCoherent variation of the derived rupture parameters are seen when along strike events are analyzed by clusters, suggesting how deep earthquakes cannot be reduced in a single group, while a diversity of deep and intermediate depth earthquakes should exists. Comparison of our measures with independent geophysical properties of slabs as plate age, thermal parameter and convergence rate is done, in order to unravel any possible relation between the subudction zone style and its associated seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Many mantle-derived magmas may originate through partial melting of complex, mixed mantle rocks including not only peridotite, but also oceanic crust recycled into the mantle [1,2]. There is, however, little detailed knowledge concerning how such material is produced, how it melts, the types of liquids produced and how they are extracted from the mantle.\nWe have conducted a series of peridotite/basalt layered experiments using an average altered mid-ocean ridge basalt GA2 [3] and fertile peridotite HZ1 [4] doped with Ir to act as a redox sensor [5,6]. Experiments were performed at 3-10 GPa, 1235-1660°C, using a multi anvil apparatus.\nThe compositions of minerals and melts were analysed using an electron microprobe. Fourier-transform infrared and Mössbauer spectroscopy were also employed to determine the concentrations of small amounts of volatiles and the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio, respectively.\nExperiments yielded well-crystallised heterogeneous mantle assemblages. Similar to previous studies [3,7], ‘dry’ eclogite starts to melt at higher depths than ambient ‘dry’ mantle along adiabatic paths. Highly siliceous melts produced through near-adiabatic ascent freeze into ambient peridotite, forming distinct orthopyroxene-rich reaction zones [8].\nWe demonstrate that impregnating partial melts of eclogite in an upwelling mantle differ in their metasomatic effects depending on the particular adiabatic path, as suggested previously [7]. Thus, melt compositions formed by subsequent re-melting of such metasomatic assemblages strongly depend on potential temperature of the adiabat [7].\n[1] Hofmann et al.

The Physical Properties Measuring System from Quantum Design is a new relaxation calorimetric technique that allows for Cp measurements on samples weighing just milligrams.

The vibrational part of the third-law entropy, So, of a substance at 298.15 K can be determined via: , where ΔStrans is any entropy change resulting from a phase transition and Sr is the residual entropy incorporating all quenchable contributions such as frozen-in structural disorder (often referred to as configurational entropy). The Cp integral is generally the most important contribution to the entropy and it is accessible for measurement (combined with ΔStrans,) and may be termed the calorimetric entropy Scal298.15.\nTwo important aspects of our Cp measurements on garnet solid solutions are in investigating the nature of low-temperature magnetic contributions to Cp and vibrational ΔSmix behavior. Following this, Cp of a series of well-characterized synthetic grossular-andradite garnets [(Ca3(Al, Fe3+)2Si3O12] was measured between 3 and 300 K using relaxation calorimetry and between 300 and 900 K using DSC methods. The garnets show a λ-type anomaly at low temperatures (< 10 K) resulting from a paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition.

Under the long-term compressive tectonic loading, a series ramps will initiate and propagate along the wedge. How do the ramps initiate? What are the timing and spacing intervals between the ramps? How many patterns are there for the ramp propagation? These questions are basic for the study of ramp initiation and propagation. Many scholars used three different methods, critical coulomb wedge theory, analogue sandbox models, and numerical simulation to research the initiation and propagation of the ramps, respectively. In this paper, we set up a 2-D elastic-plastic finite element model, with a frictional contact plane, to simulate the initiation and propagation of the ramps. In this model, the material in upper wedge is homogenous, but considering the effects of gravity and long-term tectonic loading. The model is very simple but simulated results are very interesting. The simulated results indicate that the cohesion of upper wedge and dip angle of detachment plane have strong effects on the initiation and propagation of ramps. There are three different patterns of ramp initiation and propagation for different values of the cohesion. The results are different from those by previous analogue sandbox models, and numerical simulation, in which there is usually only one pattern for the ramp initiation and propagation. The results are consistent with geological survey for the ramp formation in an accretionary wedge. This study will provide more knowledge of mechanism of the ramp initiation and propagation in Tibetan Plateau and central Taiwan.",

Due to the influence of solar heating at the surface, the aerosol distribution is inhomogeneous and variation with time. Lidar is proven to be a powerful tool in the application of remote sensing of atmospheric properties (Klett 1981). However, the existing of overlap function in lidar equation limits the fine detection of aerosol optical properties in the lower troposphere by vertical measurement, either by Raman lidar (Whiteman 2003) or by high spectral resolution lidar (Imaki 2005). Although the multi-angle method can succeed the aerosol measurement from the ground, the homogeneous atmospheric is needed (Pahlow 2004). Aiming to detect the inhomogeneous aerosols in the lower troposphere and to retrieve the aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients in the lidar equation, a novel method for accuracy remote-sensing of aerosol properties based on twin scanning lidars has been proposed. In order to realize the fine detection of the aerosol spatial distribution from the ground to the height of interest of atmosphere, the scanning lidar is utilized as the remote sensing tool combined with the cross scanning by the twin systems, which makes the exact solutions of those two unknown parameters retrievable. Figure shows the detection method for aerosol spatial distribution using twin scanning lidars. As two lidar equations are provided simultaneously, the aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients are retrievable. Moreover, by selecting the transmitting laser wavelength, the presented method can realize the fine detection of aerosol at any spectrum, even the theoretical and technical analysis of the aerosol characteristics by applying multi-spectra.",

In this study, high resolution simulations were conducted in the highly instrumented Wüstebach catchment with the TERENO observatory Eifel/Rur. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with a resolution of 1, 5, 10, and 20m were used to calculate information loss of profile curvature by spatial aggregation. An amplification factor was applied to upscale interpolated hydraulic conductivity to compensate for the loss of information content of curvature distribution caused by spatial aggregation from high resolution case (1m) to lower resolution cases (5m, 10m, and 20m). Four different cases with respect to the use of the amplification factor were analyzed and discussed: 1) no amplification factor applied, 2) amplification factor applied to all aggregated grid cells, 3) amplification factor applied to aggregated grid cells where high standard deviation of slopes exist in the 1m DEM, and 4) amplification factor applied to aggregated grid cells with low values of average slope over maximum slope within each 10x10 block in the 1m DEM. Our results indicate that the introduction of an amplification factor can effectively compensate the information loss leading to significantly improved model performances in different resolution cases. Furthermore, by utilizing cases 3) and 4) that apply the amplification factor only to specific aggregated grid cells, we effectively solved the problem of overcompensation for effective Ks that led to overestimate runoff and underestimate soil water content in case 2), and improved model performance in terms of both soil water content and runoff simulation.",

            "abstract": "It is important to know how surface evapotranspiration and change in inundated areas are correlated, especially in flat Arctic wetlands such as the tundra region near Barrow, Alaska, as their underlying frozen ground and low hydrological gradient due to flat relief confine the lateral runoff of their standing water. Moreover, knowledge regarding seasonal dynamics of inundated areas is expected to be an essential and controlling factor in modeling regional energy and hydrological balance, which are related closely to frozen ground stability, in Arctic wetlands. However, the seasonal change and spatial distribution of inundated areas have not yet been well explored and quantified.\nHere we’ve deployed high spatial resolution (WorldView2 and QuickBird) images of Barrow area on eight dates from 2006-2014, to investigate seasonal change of inundated areas for a 4700 ha wetland, including the Barrow Ecosystem Observatory. Inundation dynamics were measured in the field in 2014 using DGPS. These ground truth data was used to develop a classification algorithm for discriminating between open water, overgrown water (mixed vegetation and standing water), and dry surfaces in the high-resolution images. The inundation index is created by combining NIR band, NDVI, and stack mean of BGR and NIR bands, and shown to be capable for mapping the extent of open water, dry, and overgrown water surfaces. In order to explore the relationship between water balance and changes in the inundated area, the estimated seasonal change in the inundated areas was compared with the daily surface water balance (rainfall – evaporation) calculated using available micrometeorological data for the years 2006-2014.\nOur results suggest that inundation dynamics correlated with the surface water balance during mid-late summer (July-September), though this relationship was not valid in the early summer (June), when surface hydrology is governed mainly by surface runoff above the shallow thawing front of the ground. With the inundation index developed and relationship between inundation index and surface water balance quantified in this study, it will become possible to automatically estimate inundation dynamics, which will improve our understanding of Arctic wetlands hydrology and support the scaling of local measurements to regional scales.",

            "abstract": "We devised a technique to locate local earthquakes using single 3-component broadband seismograph and analyze the factors governing the accuracy of our result. The need for devising such a technique arises in regions of sparse seismic network. In state-of-the-art location algorithms, a minimum of three station recordings are required for obtaining well resolved locations. However, the problem arises when an event is recorded by less than three stations. This may be because of the following reasons: (a) down time of stations in a sparse network; (b) geographically isolated regions with limited logistic support to setup large network; (c) regions of insufficient economy for financing multi-station network and (d) poor signal-to-noise ratio for smaller events at most stations, except the one in its closest vicinity. Our technique provides a workable solution to the above problematic scenarios. However, our methodology is strongly dependent on the velocity model of the region. Our method uses a three step processing: (a) ascertain the back-azimuth of the event from the P-wave particle motion recorded on the horizontal components; (b) estimate the hypocentral distance using the S-P time; and (c) ascertain the emergent angle from the vertical and radial components. Once this is obtained, one can ray-trace through the 1-D velocity model to estimate the hypocentral location. We test our method on synthetic data, which produces results with 99% precision. With observed data, the accuracy of our results are very encouraging. The precision of our results depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and choice of the right band-pass filter to isolate the P-wave signal. We used our method on minor aftershocks (3 < mb < 4) of the 2011 Sikkim earthquake using data from the Sikkim Himalayan network. Location of these events highlight the transverse strike-slip structure within the Indian plate, which was observed from source mechanism study of the mainshock and larger aftershocks.",

            "abstract": "The chemical effects of silicate ash particles ejected by explosive volcanic eruptions on biotic and abiotic systems are fundamentally mediated by ash particle surfaces. Ash surface properties can be presumed to be functions of magmatic state and fragmentation processes, as well as in-plume and atmospheric alteration by volcanic and/or environmental gases and liquid aerosols. Recently, attention has been focussed on the capacity of alteration processes to shape ash surfaces, with the chemistry and mineralogy of the pre-existing ash surface presumed to be equivalent to those of the bulk particle, or even of the ash deposit. Here we present findings which highlight the influence of magma composition and fragmentation mechanisms on ash surfaces. We conducted rapid decompression experiments at varying temperature and pressure conditions on porous andesitic rocks to produce fragmented ash materials, untouched by secondary alteration. These materials were compared to samples produced by crushing of clasts from the same experiments. The bulk chemistry and surface mineralogy of ash particles from a selected size fraction (63-90 µm) was determined via XRF, SEM-BSE, and EPMA, while the surface chemistry (<10 nm) was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We identify similar disparities between whole-rock and surface chemistry as identified in previous ash studies, demonstrating ash surface chemistry to be a product of surface generation mechanisms, in addition to alteration. We observe dependences on both fragmentation pressure and temperature of ash surface chemistry. The mechanisms, pressure and temperature of magma fragmentation may thus influence ash surface chemistry and mineralogy, and subsequently, the post-eruptive alteration of ash particles and their reactivity within biotic and abiotic systems.",

            "abstract": "The eastern boundary of the Southern Cascades (Hat Creek Graben), California, USA is an extensively faulted volcanic corridor with spectacular, high, steep scarps in a bedrock of late Tertiary and Quaternary volcanic and sedimentary deposits. The morphology of the graben is a result of the plate motions associated with multiple tectonic provinces, faulting, and recurring volcanic activity from more than 500 vents, over the past 7 my. The graben is at the boundary between two distinct geologic and geomorphic areas -- the Cascade Range on the west and the Modoc Plateau on the east -- between Mt. Shasta and Medicine Lake Highlands volcano, and Lassen Volcanic Center on the north and south, respectively. This study describes the geomorphological and tectonic features, their alignment and distribution, to understand the volcano-tectonic and geomorphology relationships in the Hat Creek Graben.\nWe interpret topographic models generated from satellite images to create a database of volcanic centers and structures, and analyze the spatial distribution of the volcanic centers in the Hat Creek Graben. Poisson Nearest Neighbor analysis reveals a clustered distribution of volcanic centers, implying continuous or recurrent activity of magma sources as it propagates to the surface. Volcanic centers in the Hat Creek Graben have multiple preferred alignments, typical for extensional tectonic environments because of competing regional and local stress field influences and the presence of pre-existing, near-surface fractures. Most small stratovolcanoes (“lava cones”) on the west are influenced by normal regional stress, and have crater amphitheater openings perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress (σHmax), while those on the east, in a transcurrent regional stress regime, are at an acute angle. These results can be used as an indicator of the degree of impingement of the Walker Lane shear zone on the Cascades region.",

We explore the hypotheses that the great variation of bar and shoal morphologies are explained by similar factors as river bars, namely channel aspect ratio, sediment mobility and limits on bar erosion and chute cutoff caused by cohesive sediment. Here we use remote sensing data and a novel tidal flume setup, the Metronome, to create estuaries or short estuarine reaches from idealized initial conditions, with and without mud supply at the fluvial boundary. Bar width-depth ratios in estuaries are similar to those in braided rivers. In unconfined (cohesionless) experimental estuaries, bar- and channel dynamics increase with increasing river discharge. Ebb- and flood-dominated channels are ubiquitous even in entirely straight sections. The apparent stability of ebb- and flood channels is partly explained by the inherent instability of symmetrical channel bifurcations as in rivers.",

The finer spatio-temporal resolution of IMERG rainfall products has great potentials for the improvement of regional hydrology studies related to flood forecast and water resources management, especially over regions with sparsely gauged observations, e.g., mountainous regions. However, previous studies found large discrepancy among satellite rainfall products over regions with high altitudes. The main objective of this study is to provide a first evaluation of IMERG products (Final run, with a latency of 18 hours) over mountainous region and its inter-comparison with its predecessor TMPA 3B42 (V7). We center this study over Yarlung Tsangbo River Basin in Tibetan Plateau region (with mean altitude exceeding 4600m). Over 500 rain gauges are distributed over the basin, constituting an ultra-high density network of rain gauges, which enables us to evaluate the performance of satellite rainfall products (IMERG and TMPA) in capturing space-time rainfall structure in this region. We focus on the warm season (May to October) in 2014. Preliminary results show that IMERG resemble TMPA in spatial rainfall distribution over downstream region, whereas IMPEG present a remarkable smaller estimation than TMPA over upstream region. IMERG outperforms TMPA in all statistical indices (mean bias, correlation coefficient, root mean square error, etc.) used in this study. There is a general dependency of IMERG performance on altitude. The consistency (correlation coefficient) between IMERG and rain gauge improves with increased altitude (over 5000 m.a.s.l), but at the cost of increasing mean bias in the meantime. We evaluate the conditional bias of IMERG products on rainfall intensity and time of the day (daytime and nighttime). Results in this study provide useful reference for the improvement of IMERG rainfall calibration algorithm over high-altitude regions.",

I will show two recent examples of \"stacking\" geotemporal information to support land use decision making in the Brazilian Amazon and Kenya, involving data-constrained predictive models and empirically derived datasets of road development, deforestation, carbon, agricultural yields, water purification and poverty alleviation services and will show how we use trade-off analyses and constraint reasoning algorithms to explore the costs and benefits of different decisions. For the Brazilian Amazon we explore tradeoffs involved in different deforestation scenarios, while for Kenya we explore the impacts of conserving forest to support international carbon conservation initiatives (REDD+). I will also illustrate the cloud-based software tools we have developed to enable anyone to access geotemporal information, gridded (e.g. climate) or non-gridded (e.g. protected areas), for the past, present or future and incorporate such information into their analyses (e.g.\nwww.fetchclimate.org\n), including how we train new predictive models to such data using Bayesian techniques: on this latter point I will show how we combine satellite and ground measured data with predictive models to forecast how crops might respond to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Mapping Titan’s surface albedo is a necessary step to give reliable constraints on its composition. However, surface albedo maps of Titan, especially over large regions, are still very rare, the surface windows being strongly affected by atmospheric effects (absorption, scattering). A full radiative transfer model is an essential tool to remove these effects, but too time-consuming to treat systematically the ~40000 hyperspectral images VIMS acquired since the beginning of the mission.\nWe developed a massive inversion of VIMS data based on lookup tables computed from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model (Hirtzig et al. 2013), updated with new aerosol properties coming from our analysis of the Emission Phase Function observation acquired recently by VIMS. Once the physical properties of gases, aerosols and surface are fixed, the lookup tables are built for the remaining free parameters: the incidence, emergence and azimuth angles, given by navigation; and two products (the aerosol opacity and the surface albedo at all wavelengths). The lookup table grid was carefully selected after thorough testing. The data inversion on these pre-computed spectra (opportunely interpolated) is more than 1000 times faster than recalling the full radiative transfer at each minimization step.\nWe present here the results from selected flybys. We invert mosaics composed by couples of flybys observing the same area at two different times. The composite albedo maps do not show significant discontinuities in any of the surface windows, suggesting a robust correction of the effects of the geometry (and thus the aerosols) on the observations. Maps of aerosol and albedo uncertainties are also provided, with the absolute error on the albedo being approximately between 1 and 3% (depending on the surface window considered). We are thus able to provide for the first time ever reliable surface albedo maps at pixel scale for the whole VIMS spectral range.",

We do this based on cores from three parallel swales along a transect from the shoreline inland. Stratigraphy, together with geochemical and mineralogical analyses was used to correlate between tsunami and paleotsunami layers at these sites. Using element biplots (Ti-Zr, Ti-Y and Zr-Y) and mineralogical constraints, source signatures of each of the tsunami and paleotsunami layers were used to correlate between sand layers representing the 2004 tsunami and sand layers representing at least three paleotsunamis. Based on our correlations between these swales, we predict different inundation distances and directions for these paleotsunamis. Our study shows that a combination of geochemical and mineralogical analysis provides a powerful tool for correlation between tsunami and paleotsunami layers.",

FREEWAT main result will be an open source and public domain GIS integrated modelling environment for the simulation of water quantity and quality in surface water and groundwater with an integrated water management and planning module. FREEWAT aims at promoting water resource management by simplifying the application of the Water Framework Directive and related Directives. Specific objectives of the project are: to coordinate previous EU and national funded research to integrate existing software modules for water management in a single environment into the GIS based FREEWAT and to support the FREEWAT application in an innovative participatory approach gathering technical staff and relevant stakeholders (policy and decision makers) in designing scenarios for application of water policies. The open source characteristics of the platform allow to consider this an initiative \"ad includendum\", as further institutions or developers may contribute to the development.\nCore of the platform is the SID&GRID framework (GIS integrated physically-based distributed numerical hydrological model based on a modified version of MODFLOW 2005; Rossetto et al. 2013) in its version ported to QGIS desktop.\nActivities are carried out on two lines: (i) integration of modules to fulfill the end-users requirements, including tools for producing feasibility and management plans; (ii) a set of activities to fix bugs and to provide a well-integrated interface for the different tools implemented. Further capabilities to be integrated are:\n- module for water management and planning;\n- calibration, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis;\n- module for solute transport in unsaturated zone;\n- module for crop growth and water requirements in agriculture;\n- tools for groundwater quality issues and for the analysis, interpretation and visualization of hydrogeological data.\nThrough creating a common environment among water research/professionals, policy makers and implementers, FREEWAT main impact will be on enhancing science- and participatory approach and evidence-based decision making in water resource management, hence producing relevant and appropriate outcomes for policy implementation. Large stakeholders involvement is thought to guarantee results dissemination and exploitation.",

Using reservoir management to reduce the nutrient load to downstream areas can be of great importance for aquatic habitats in recipient waters as well as the overall health of coastal areas. In this study the regulation of a network of reservoirs in River Dalälven, Sweden, is simulated using a multi-objective approach that accounts for both the nutrient export and power production. The optimization model is used to derive the Pareto front for the two objectives; the hydropower production and water quality objectives. The effect of regulation of River Dalälven on the nutrient transport is examined as a possible control method for limiting nutrient transport from the watershed. The cost in the form of loss of hydroelectric power is quantified. Optimization of a large-scale river network is done at great computational expense and the additional states (concentration of nutrient) increase the computational load significantly, for this reason several simplifications of the system dynamics are made. It is shown that a 50% reduction of the nutrient discharge can be achieved to a limited loss of power production (<5 – 10%), but that additional reduction is associated with a significant loss in power production.",

            "abstract": "It is now acknowledged that representing model uncertainty in atmospheric simulators is essential for the production of reliable probabilistic ensemble forecasts, and a number of different techniques have been proposed for this purpose. Stochastic convection parameterization schemes use random numbers to represent the difference between a deterministic parameterization scheme and the true atmosphere, accounting for the unresolved sub grid-scale variability associated with convective clouds. An alternative approach varies the values of poorly constrained physical parameters in the model to represent the uncertainty in these parameters. This study presents new perturbed parameter schemes for use in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) convection scheme. Two types of scheme are developed and implemented. Both schemes represent the joint uncertainty in four of the parameters in the convection parametrisation scheme, which was estimated using the Ensemble Prediction and Parameter Estimation System (EPPES). The first scheme developed is a fixed perturbed parameter scheme, where the values of uncertain parameters are changed between ensemble members, but held constant over the duration of the forecast. The second is a stochastically varying perturbed parameter scheme. The performance of these schemes was compared to the ECMWF operational stochastic scheme, Stochastically Perturbed Parametrisation Tendencies (SPPT), and to a model which does not represent uncertainty in convection. The skill of probabilistic forecasts made using the different models was evaluated. While the perturbed parameter schemes improve on the stochastic parametrisation in some regards, the SPPT scheme outperforms the perturbed parameter approaches when considering forecast variables that are particularly sensitive to convection. Overall, SPPT schemes are the most skilful representations of model uncertainty due to convection parametrisation.\n",

            "abstract": "Anisotropic images of the upper-mantle are usually obtained by analyzing different types of seismic observables, such as surface wave dispersion curves or waveforms, SKS splitting data, or receiver functions. These different data types sample different volumes of the earth, they are sensitive to separate length-scales, and hence are associated with various levels of uncertainties. They are traditionally interpreted separately, and often result in incompatible models.\nWe present a Bayesian inversion approach to jointly invert these different data types. Seismograms for SKS and P phases are directly inverted, thus avoiding intermediate processing steps such as numerical deconvolution or computation of splitting parameters. Probabilistic 1D profiles are obtained with a transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, in which the number of layers, as well as the presence or absence of anisotropy in each layer, are treated as unknown parameters. In this way, seismic anisotropy is only introduced if required by the data.\nThe algorithm is used to resolve both isotropic and anisotropic layering down to a depth of 350 km beneath two seismic stations in North America in two different tectonic settings: the stable Canadian shield (station FFC), and the tectonically active southern Basin and Range Province (station TA-214A). In both cases, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is clearly visible, and marked by a change in direction of the fast axis of anisotropy. Our study confirms that azimuthal anisotropy is a powerful tool for detecting layering in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have modeled the tsunami source of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake using different types of data. These studies show that the similar locations of large slip, but the details and the maximum slip amounts are different. Satake et al. (2013, BSSA) performed tsunami waveform inversion using offshore and coastal tsunami data to estimate spatial slip distribution and temporal process. Their result shows a very large slip occurred near the trench about 3 minutes after the rupture, then it propagated northward along the trench. This delayed slip is considered as the reason of large runup on the coast of Iwate, about 100 km of the maximum slip on the fault. On the other hand, Tappin et al. (2014, Marine Geology) claimed that a submarine landslide occurred offshore Iwate around 2 minutes after the earthquake, and it caused high runup on the coast.\nIn this study, we followed and expanded the method of Satake et al. (2013 BSSA) to estimate the sea surface displacement rather than the slip on the fault plane. Sea surface displacement can be caused either by fault slip or other sources such as submarine landslide. In this approach, all sea surface units are 34 km-square. Total duration is set to 240 sec, which is divided into 4 windows, each 60 sec long. In order to cover the secondary sources which are not related to slip on the fault, we used a faster rupture speed of 4 km/sec, and assumed that every unit can move in the entire process.\nOur preliminary result shows that a 2 m water elevation first occurred between the epicenter and the trench, and then it propagated along the trench. About 3 minutes after the origin time, a large elevation occurred between 38°N and 39°N along the trench. This result is similar to Satake et al. (2013, BSSA). However, our result shows longer duration of sea surface elevation in the vicinity of the epicenter.\nFig. Sea surface elevation at each minute after the earthquake origin time.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is likely to push many species to the limits of their ecological niches and lead to mismatches between species ranges and local environmental conditions. Forested ecosystems in particular may have difficulty tracking climate change due to slow growth and dispersal rates. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs), commonly used to predict the response of species distributions to climate change, relate species occurrences to climate to describe the present niche; however they often project into the future without accounting for slow processes that might produce lags in the response to climate change. An alternative type of model that analyzes patch-scale colonization and extinction (C-E) rates along an environmental gradient has been successful in describing species range limits in theoretical studies. Because the model is stochastic and dynamic, it is more robust to changes in the environmental gradient than static SDMs. We applied such a model to 40 of the most abundant trees in eastern North American forests, using repeated observations across multiple decades to parameterize the C-E rates. We show that C-E rates for many species respond to climate in a manner that generates predicted range limits when the species is at equilibrium with the environment. Moreover, current distributions of many species are significantly out of equilibrium with the present climate, with predicted range limits shifted 10s to 100s of km northward from the present distribution. These results suggest that present warming has already exceeded the thermal tolerance at the southern range limits for the dominant trees of eastern North American forests, producing millions of ha of newly suitable areas north of the present distribution of these species that have not yet been colonized, as well as large southern regions where species are present but expected to be lost in the long-term as dead trees are not replaced, even if no further climate warming occurs.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have revealed that the ice sheet mass loss in Antarctica has been accelerating in recent years. It is mainly due to the large-scale ice sheet melting or runoff in West Antarctica. In the meantime, recent investigations using GRACE, Envisat/IceSat, and other geodetic and/or glociological measurements show that the ice sheet mass is slightly increasing in East Antarctica, particularly in the region from Dronning Maud Land to Enderby Land, where a Japanese Antarctic station, Syowa, is located. In the same area, there is Shirase Glacier, one of the major glaciers in Antarctica. While Shirase Glacier is expected to control the ice sheet floor or runoff of the drainage area, a significant surface mass increase has been observed in the downstream area of the glacier.\nTo sketch out the ice mass changes of Shirase Glacier, we firstly estimated regional average of inter-annual mass variations using GRACE data from March 2002 to March 2014. The result showed that the mass increase was +23.7 Gt/yr, which was mainly caused by surface ice sheet mass changes, because the GIA mass trend in the region was expecdted to be small. Next, in order to investigate the mechanism of the mass changes, we compared the GRACE-derived surface mass change with the ones estimated from the altimeter data and RACMO SMB data. The results showed that the surface mass changes have mainly been controled by the surface winds and the surface/basement topography, althought the melting or the runoff process have not been clear yet. The peak of the positive trend was observed near Syowa station at the mouth of the Shirase Glacier (38.6E, 70.5S). Therefore, we also report GNSS buoys, gravity measurements, and other in-site observations planed by Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) for investigating the mass changes.",

            "abstract": "The radio signature of a shock travelling through the solar corona is known as a type II solar radio burst. In rare cases, these bursts can exhibit a fine structure known as ‘herringbones’ which are a direct indicator of particle acceleration occurring at the shock front. However, few studies have been performed on herringbones and the details of the underlying particle acceleration processes are unknown. Here, we use an image processing technique known as the Hough transform to statistically analyse the herringbone fine structure in a radio burst at 20–90MHz observed from the Rosse Solar–Terrestrial Observatory on 2011 September 22. We identify 188 individual bursts which are signatures of bi-directional electron beams continuously accelerated to speeds of 0.16 c. This occurs at a shock acceleration site initially at a constant altitude of 0.6 Rsun in the corona, followed by a shift to 0.5 Rsun. The anti-sunward beams travel a distance of 170 Mm (and possibly further) away from the acceleration site, while those travelling toward the sun come to a stop sooner, reaching a smaller distance of 112 Mm. We show that the stopping distance for the sunward beams may depend on the total number density and the velocity of the beam. Our study concludes that a detailed statistical analysis of herringbone fine structure can provide information on the physical properties of the corona which lead to these relatively rare radio bursts.",

            "abstract": "The zeta potential is a measure of the electrical potential of the mineral surfaces in water-saturated rocks. In many subsurface settings the rocks are at elevated temperature, yet the temperature dependence of the zeta potential remains poorly understood. There are few previous experimental studies and these report inconsistent and contradictory behaviour; some studies have found that the zeta potential increases in magnitude with increasing temperature while others have found that it decreases in magnitude. Moreover, few studies have investigated salt concentrations relevant to natural systems; most used de-ionised water or NaCl/KCl electrolytes at low ionic strength (10-3M). Natural groundwater is typically more saline than this.\nWe report measurements of the zeta potential of natural sandstones saturated with NaCl brines of varying ionic strength at temperatures up to 150°C. We find that the zeta potential is always negative, but decreases in magnitude with increasing temperature at in 0.01M NaCl brine (comparable to potable water) and is independent of temperature in 0.5M brine (comparable to seawater). In unbuffered experiments, the pH also decreases with increasing temperature at low ionic strength, but remains constant at higher ionic strength. The temperature dependence of the zeta potential can be explained by the temperature dependence of the pH.\nOur findings are consistent with published models of the zeta potential, so long as the temperature dependence of the pH at low ionic strength is accounted for. Moreover, they explain the hitherto contradictory results reported in previous studies that used low ionic strength electrolytes. In unbuffered experiments, the pH decreases with increasing temperature and the zeta potential decreases in magnitude. In experiments with fixed pH, the zeta potential increases in magnitude with increasing temperature. The results have broad application to deep sandstone reservoirs and hydrothermal fields.",

            "abstract": "The Toba Caldera Complex is the largest Quaternary caldera on Earth, and has generated three voluminous and compositionally similar rhyolitic tuffs, viz. the Oldest (OTT, 800 ka), Middle (MTT, ~500 ka) and Youngest Toba Tuffs (YTT, 75 ka). These tephra deposits are widespread across Indonesia, Malaysia, South China Sea, Sea of Bengal, India and Indian Ocean and provide useful stratigraphic markers in oceanic, lacustrine and terrestrial environments. Single shard trace element analysis of these deposits reveals the changing availability of different batches of magma through time, with Sr, Ba and Y contents defining 5 discrete magma populations in YTT, 4 populations in MTT and only a single, low Ba population in OTT. Within an individual eruption these populations are clearly distinct, but between eruptions (e.g. MTT and YTT) some of these populations overlap while others do not, indicating both the longevity (and/or continuous supply of fresh material) and evolution of these magma batches in the Toba Complex. Major element compositions of the different groups show equilibration at different pressures (based on Q’-Ab’-Or’), with the equilibration of low Ba populations at ~160 MPa, increasing to depths of ~210 MPa for the highest Ba population.\nThe proportions of different populations of glass in distal YTT shows that relatively little of the high Ba population makes it into the distal record across India, and that this population appears to be over-represented in the proximal free glass and pumice from the caldera walls. This data may shed light on magma availability and tephra dispersal during the YTT eruption. Similarly, the glass composition of individual pumices from proximal deposits record regional, compositional and temporal differences in the erupted products. These show, for example, the apparent mingling of some of the magma batches and also that the high Ba population appears early (i.e. stratigraphically lower) in the northern caldera wall.",

            "abstract": "The Larsen-B ice shelf was the second largest component of the Larsen ice shelf system in the Antarctic Peninsula. It collapsed in 2002, losing an area more than double the size of London (~3200 km2) to the sea. The collapse of Larsen-B has been attributed to a range of factors, although the dominant control over the fidelity of the ice shelf is thought to be climatological (melting on the ice shelf was three times higher in 2002 than the 1998-2001 average). Supraglacial lakes in particular have been implicated in the collapse; by repeatedly filling and draining, they likely weaken an ice shelf and precondition it for disintegration. However, abundant supraglacial lake coverage has been observed on Larsen-B for many years prior to its break-up and, in fact, surface conditions have been conducive to lake formation for several decades. Here, we use satellite observations and a hydrological model forced with estimates of melting and runoff from a regional climate model in order to investigate the response of supraglacial lakes to extreme melting in 2002 specifically, in contrast with typical supraglacial lake evolution in previous years. We also use state-of-the-art observations of ice shelf topography acquired by CryoSat-2 to examine the potential role of supraglacial lakes on the fate of the Larsen remnant, currently thought to be at risk of collapse by 2020.",

            "abstract": "The Mozambique Ridge (120-140 Ma old) is a submarine plateau located in the southwest Indian Ocean. The relationship between plateau formation and the break-up of the Gondwana supercontinent is still unclear. Different models for the origin of this plateau include: 1) a continental fragment split off of Africa or Antarctica during Gondwana break-up and 2) an oceanic Large Igneous Province (LIP) formed by a mantle plume involved in Gondwana break-up. On the R/V SONNE (cruise SO232), we carried out bathymetric mapping, seismic reflection studies and rock sampling of the plateau basement, which confirmed the volcanic nature of at least the upper parts of the plateau. By reconstructing the spatial and temporal evolution in geochemistry of volcanic samples, we hope to gain new insights into the origin of the plateau. The recovered samples are mainly basaltic (SiO2 = 47-52 wt. %). On the Nb/Yb versus Th/Yb diagram, the samples overlap the field for enriched-mid-ocean-ridge basalts (EMORB) and extend towards the field for ocean island basalts (OIB). Most of the samples have relatively flat REE patterns, similar to EMORB or LIP type lavas. Initial Sr-Nd-Hf isotope ratios form tight correlations, excluding late alteration effects. The samples overlap and extend to slightly more radiogenic values than age-corrected SW Indian and South Atlantic MORB and OIB, indicating a two-component mixing between depleted (NMORB source) and enriched (OIB-type) mantle. Similar to some early Kerguelen plateau basalts, some of our samples have low Nd isotope and (Nb/La)n (< 1) ratios suggesting involvement of continental lithosphere and/or lower crust. On the 206Pb/204Pb versus 207Pb/204Pb isotope diagram, the samples extend to higher Δ7/4 than the South West Indian array, overlapping with Kerguelen lavas. Bathymetric data show numerous small cones scattered on the plateau, which are thought to represent a reactivation of volcanism after formation of the plateau basement. Moreover, seismic refraction data show evidence for a thick oceanic lower crust. Together with our new geochemical data, it favors a LIP origin for the Mozambique Ridge.",

            "abstract": "Typically the term “induced seismicity” is used to refer minor earthquakes and tremors caused by human activities that alter the stresses and strains on the Earth's crust. In the last years, the interest in the induced seismicity related to fluids (oil and gas, and geothermal resources) extraction or injection is increased, because it is believed to be responsible to enucleate earthquakes. Possible sources of induced seismicity are not only represented by the oil and gas production but also, i.e., by changes in the water level of artificial lakes.\nThe aim of this work is to show results from two different sources, wastewater injection and changes in the water level of an artificial reservoir (Pertusillo lake), that can produce induced earthquakes observed in the Val d’Agri basin (Italy) and to compare them with variation in crustal elastic parameters.\nVal d’Agri basin in the Apennines extensional belt hosts the largest oilfield in onshore Europe and is bordered by NW-SE ­trending fault systems. Most of the recorded seismicity seems to be related to these structures.\nWe correlated the seismicity rate, injection curves and changes in water levels with temporal variations of Vp/Vs and anisotropic parameters of the crustal reservoirs and in the nearby area. We analysed about 983 high-quality recordings occurred from 2002 to 2014 in Val d’Agri basin from temporary and permanent network held by INGV and ENI corporate. 3D high-precision locations and manual-revised P- and S-picking are used to estimate anisotropic parameters (delay time and fast direction polarization) and Vp/Vs ratio. Seismicity is mainly located in two areas: in the SW of the Pertusillo Lake, and near the Eni Oil field (SW and NE of the Val d’Agri basin respectively).\nOur correlations well recognize the seismicity diffusion process, caused by both water injection and water level changes; these findings could help to model the active and pre-existing faults failure behaviour.",

            "abstract": "Despite the marked increase in hydraulic fracturing for unconventional natural gas production over the past decade, reactions between hydraulic fracturing fluids (HFF) and shale reservoirs remain poorly reported in the scientific literature. Shale-HFF interaction could cause mineral dissolution, releasing matter from the shale, or mineral precipitation that degrades reservoir permeability. Furthermore, data are limited on whether scale inhibitors are effective at preventing mineral precipitation and whether these inhibitors adversely affect reservoir fluid chemistry and permeability.\nTo investigate HFF-rock interaction within shale reservoirs, we conducted flow-through experiments exposing Marcellus Shale to synthetic HFF at reservoir conditions (66oC, 20MPa). Outcrop shale samples were cored, artificially fractured, and propped open with quartz sand. Synthetic HFFs were mixed with chemical additives similar to those used for Marcellus Shale gas wells in Ohio and Southwestern Pennsylvania (FracFocus.org). We evaluated differences between shale reactions with HFF made from natural freshwater and reactions with HFF made from synthetic produced water (designed to simulate produced water that is diluted and re-used for subsequent hydraulic fracturing). We also compared reactions with HFFs including hydrochloric acid (HCl) to represent the initial acid stage, and HFFs excluding HCl. Reactions were determined through changes in fluid chemistry and X-ray CT and SEM imaging of the shale before and after experiments.\nResults from experiments with HFF containing HCl showed dissolution of primary calcite, as expected. Experiments using HFF made from synthetic produced water had significant mineral precipitation, particularly of barium and calcium sulfates. X-ray CT images from these experiments indicate precipitation of minerals occurred either along the main fracture or within smaller splay fractures, depending on fluid composition.\nThese experiments suggest that HFF reaction with shale may significantly alter reservoir mineralogy and could damage reservoir permeability with secondary mineral precipitation. This topic deserves further study as gas production rates and ultimate recovery may be suboptimal, with consequential increases in the footprint of natural gas extraction.",

            "abstract": "Samples retrieved by shallow drilling into two principal slip zones of the central Alpine Fault, New Zealand, offer an excellent opportunity to investigate clay formation, fabric development and fluid-rock interaction in an active fault zone. Here, we provide lithological and structural observations of five samples from borehole DFDP-1B, drilled during Phase 1 of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP-1) in 2011. Each sample’s mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the preferred orientation of the clays was analyzed by x-ray texture goniometry (XTG).\nThe dominant clay mineral phases are illite and chlorite/kaolinite. Newly formed smectitic clays are observed solely in the cm-thick zones of fault gouge, indicating that these mineral reactions are restricted to the fault zone. We observe that smectite forms by transformation of very fine-grained material produced by cataclasis during slip. Clay fabric intensity of both illite and chlorite reveal that relatively strong fabrics are present in the cataclasites above the principal slip zone, but that the clay minerals in the gouge have a very weak preferred orientation. The weak fabric supports the notion that clay orientation is a result of authigenic mineral growth and not of strain-induced particle reorientation. It also indicates that fluids are able to pass through the gouge, presumably along variably spaced and interconnected fracture networks or between particle boundaries. Our analysis of samples retrieved by DFDP-1 drilling and sampling demonstrates intimate association of localized shear, comminution, and rapid fluid-rock interaction. It thus contributes to a growing body of evidence that alteration processes, particularly formation of frictionally weak smectitic clay minerals, may be a significant weakening mechanism within active shallow faults.",

Setting a study plot (400 m2) in a secondary mixed deciduous forest, dominated by Quercus crispula and Abies firma in canopy layer in August and November 2014, we sampled the souk from surface to 5 cm in depth of soils and measured 137Cs in every 2 m grids and at tree stem bases. The total estimated activity of 137Cs in soil within the study plot was approximately 210 kBq/m2, but showed large spatial heterogeneity showing 30 times of difference between the lowest and highest activities. The activity decreased with increasing distances from tree stem bases. High activity around tree stem bases was presumably due to the stemflow containing 137Cs seeped into soil only around tree stem bases that raised radioactivity in soil locally in the areas. Relatively low activity away from trees (outside canopies) may be due to small effects of stemflow and throughfall. Activity of 137Cs around bases of deciduous broadleaf trees increased with increasing the tree size. Because larger trees have higher potentials to capture larger amount of 137Cs on the tree surface, cumulative activity of 137Cs included in stemflow may increase with increasing the tree size. However evergreen coniferous tree species (Abies firma) did not show such a pattern relating to the tree size. The difference is assumed to be affected by phenological characteristics as the accident happened in winter and deciduous broadleaf trees did not have leaves and 137Cs deposited on tree bodies, while evergreen coniferous tree had leaves and 137Cs was intercepted by the canopies.",

            "abstract": "Pull-apart basins reflect basic interaction between two faults and have been studied in detail during the last decades. However, the true three-dimensional geometry of pull-apart basins is seldom known. We therefore present a new study focused on the architecture of a pull-apart basin and the associated stresses. We analyze the structure of a ~250 m long pull-apart basin developed in carbonate rocks at the Galilee heights, Israel. The reconstruction of the basin geometry is based on detailed mapping and LiDAR measurements of fault scarps. The architecture of faults is then used as a boundary condition for calculating the stress pattern in the vicinity of the basin, using a dislocation model. The basin is found to be an asymmetrical structure bordered by two longitudinal oblique right lateral strike-slip faults. The strike of one of the faults is bent at the eastern edge of the basin, generating a transverse boundary fault which joins the second boundary fault orthogonally. The overall lateral displacement is smaller than the basin length and no transverse or diagonal fault is observed in the western end of the basin. The deformation around the basin is mostly displayed by fractures. Yet, folds and fault branches are observed near the tips of the boundary faults and near kink points of fault segments.\nWe found that the interaction of the two subparallel strike-slip segments observed in the outcrop is expressed by a V-shaped basin structure. Therefore, a subsurface bending in the main fault is expressed by step-over and by subsidence close to the upper surface. The geometry of the basin deviates from the typical rhomb shape even in map view, as the basin is not bordered by transverse or diagonal faults on its western edge. The lateral displacement along the basin is localized on oblique bordering strike-slip faults with less slip partitioning than observed in larger pull-apart basins. 3D modeling of the stress field around the basin demonstrated that the pull-apart structure affects the stress pattern and that the stress tensor is rotated locally to a variety of orientations near the faults. These calculations explain the abrupt variations of fracture orientations near the borders of the basin and the intensive deformation near the tips of the faults.",

            "abstract": "Desert varnish is a dark and thin (< 250 µm) layer on rock surfaces mainly consisting of Mn and Fe oxides as well as clay minerals. Its unknown age information, however, is one of the major drawbacks for its use as a paleoclimate archive. In this respect, meteorites with known terrestrial ages fallen in deserts are helpful for paleoclimate reconstruction. Therefore, we investigated the structure at the nm - µm scale of varnish on two chondrites from the al Hamra desert (Libya), which have terrestrial ages of 4400 (DA011) and 35000 years (DA119), respectively. Thin 5 – 10 µm layers of varnish overlay parts of different degrees of weathering depending on the terrestrial age of these meteorites. To study major and trace element concentrations from the surface of the varnish coating to the underlying weathering layer and the fresh bulk meteorite, we generated 1 µm thin lines using a fast scan speed of 80 µm/s. Whereas - as expected - the fresh bulk meteorite shows a flat REE pattern, the varnish layers have a positive and the weathering parts a negative Ce anomaly.\nSpecial settings of the femto- and nanosecond LA-ICP-MS systems have to be applied for high resolution Mn/Fe measurements, such as a small fluence of about 0.2 J cm-2 for low sample ablation and the Escan mode of the mass spectrometer for fast measurements, a mass resolution of 2000 for the separation of interferences from the ions of interest using a flat top peak. Using these settings it was possible to measure Mn/Fe ratios with a precision better than 1 - 3 % (RSD) at a resolution of 10 nm in the samples. Our results demonstrate significant variations of Mn/Fe ratios in varnish with depth (age) - in particular for the 35000 years old DA119 L4 chondrite (between less than 0.01 at the surface and 0.1 in the interior), probably caused by microlamination of Mn- and Fe-rich layers. The low and high Mn/Fe ratios can be related to dry and wet climate [1].\n[1] Liu and Broecker (2013) Geomorphology 187, 38-60.",

An exception to this is the occurrence of barite deposits in the Palaeoarchean (3.5-3.2 Ga) which indicate spatial or temporal increases in sulfate concentration. The origin and extent of these enrichments remains controversial and has been difficult to assess due to limited and highly variable data. Here we compile an extensive new database of SIMS multiple sulfur isotope data for pyrite and barite from across the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa in order to further investigate the extent and origin of any sulfate enrichment. Individual pyrites were measured with good stratigraphic and petrographic control. Pyrite δ56Fe was used to further delineate pyrite populations and pathways of pyrite formation. Our new sulfur isotope data support conventional models where a positive Δ33S was derived from heterogeneous photolytic elemental S, with negative Δ33S capturing a homogenized marine sulfate reservoir. Pyrite multiple S isotope data closely track the abundance of barite, suggesting that marine sulfate levels were generally low and that sulfate increases were sporadic and localized. We speculate that the subsequent Neoarchean scarcity was controlled by biological evolution.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian inverse modelling is very widely used for estimating trace gas flux fields using atmospheric observations. For reasons of computational expense, and to avoid under-determination, these high-dimensional fields are usually partitioned into a set of basis functions, or are estimated subject to some choice of correlation between grid cells. This partitioning or smoothing of the space is typically based on some set of subjective decisions made by the investigator. However, both the derived flux estimates, and their uncertainties, can be strongly dependent on these choices. Furthermore, traditional approaches do not allow for the uncertainty surrounding these choices to be propagated through to the derived fluxes. We outline a method whereby the number of basis functions, and therefore resolution at which fluxes are estimated, are determined using the data. A priori, we consider the number of flux basis functions and their configuration in the inversion domain to be unknown. In such a framework, the dimensionality of the inverse problem can change, and is therefore referred to as a “transdimensional” inversion. Reversible-jump Markov Chain-Monte Carlo tools to perform such dimension changing were first devised over two decades ago, but their uptake within atmospheric science has been limited. We present a novel application of this method for regional emissions estimation, also incorporating hierarchical Bayesian methods for the quantification of model-related and prior uncertainties. We show that, since the arrangement and geometry of the flux basis functions is no longer fixed, a relatively sparse, and therefore computationally efficient, partitioning can achieve a high effective spatial resolution of fluxes, where permitted by the data. We present an example of this new system for estimating fluxes in the UK, using data from the Deriving Emissions Related to Climate Change (DECC) network. This transdimensional, hierarchical approach is of particular relevance for the rapidly growing field of national emissions verification, where the use of fixed regions may result in the incorrect attribution of emissions, or correlated uncertainties, across country borders.",

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the joint probabilistic characteristics and tendencies for bivariate and trivariate precipitation and temperature indices across the plateau, based on copula theory. The results show that the southeast region of the plateau had a higher potential for flooding: the 10-year return levels for the number of days with heavy and very heavy precipitation (R10mm, R20mm) and for the maximum 5-day precipitation value (RX5day) were higher in this region. The northwest region of the plateau, however, had a higher potential for drought, as reflected in the high and increasing 10-year return levels for the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) and the number of days with low precipitation (R1mm). In a joint analysis of precipitation indices, large areas of the Loess Plateau showed a relatively high risk of concurrent extreme precipitation events. However, the risk of concurrent extreme wet and dry events did not increase over the past half century, as demonstrated by nonsignificant changes in the probability of concurrently long CDD and long consecutive wet days (CWD). A trivariate copula analysis showed that some grid locations in the southeast of the plateau had an increasing risk of extreme precipitation events occurring at a high frequency and a high intensity, and forming a large percentage of the annual precipitation. Joint analysis of precipitation and temperature indices showed that the risk of higher temperatures and longer spells of consecutive dry days had increased over the past 50 years in grid locations scattered in the northern and southeast regions: there were negative trends in the bivariate return periods for warm days (TX90p) and CDD. In addition, there was a decreased probability of concurrent long spells of consecutive wet days and colder temperatures, as demonstrated by the positive trends in the bivariate return periods for cold days (TX10p) and CWD across large areas of the plateau. Overall, the risk of severe floods and droughts over the Loess Plateau increased over the period 1961-2011.",

            "abstract": "Field measurements of magnetic susceptibility were carried out on regular grid, resulting in 101 data points at Brumovice and 65 at Vidim locality. Mass specific magnetic susceptibility χ and its frequency dependence χFD was used to estimate the significance of SP ferrimagnetic particles of pedogenic origin in topsoil horizons. The lowest magnetic susceptibility was obtained on the steep valley sides. Here the original topsoil was eroded and mixed by tillage with the soil substrate (loess). Soil profiles unaffected by erosion were investigated in detail. The vertical distribution of magnetic susceptibility along these “virgin” profiles was measured in laboratory on samples collected with 2-cm spacing. The differences between the distribution of susceptibility in the undisturbed soil profiles and the magnetic signal after uniform mixing of the soil material as a result of erosion and tillage are fundamental for the estimation of soil loss in the studied test fields. Maximum cumulative soil erosion depth in Brumovice and Vidim is around 100 cm and 50 cm respectively. The magnetic method is suitable for mapping at the chernozem localities and measurement of soil magnetic susceptibility is in this case useful and fast technique for quantitative estimation of soil loss caused by erosion. However, it is less suitable (due to lower magnetic differentiation with depth) in areas with luvisol as dominant soil unit.

Different from previous studies, we simultaneously observed and measured pore-scale fluid behavior and three-phase constitutive relationships with digital image acquisition/analysis, fluid pressure control, and permeability assays. Our results showed that the fluid layers significantly influenced pore-scale, three-phase fluid displacement as well as water relative permeability. At low water saturation, water relative permeability not only depended on water saturation but also the distributions of air and diesel. A simple capillary-tube based model showed that the water relative permeability is proportional to the number of apparently continuous water paths before the critical stage in which no apparently continuous water flow path can be found.

            "abstract": "Climate warming has caused unprecedented changes in the vegetation cycle of forests. In return, forests play a substantial role on climate by directly modifying the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Besides the shifts occurring in forest architecture and diversity, the climate pressure influences the canopy structure and the leaf physiological characteristics. A direct consequence is the modification of reflectivity properties of the whole canopy. This study examines the evolution of the direct radiative forcing due to the evolution of reflectivity properties of the canopy (canopy albedo). We restrict our analysis to the albedo trends occurring in stationary forest covers over France during the last decade (2001-2013). Satellite surface albedo, LAI (leaf area index), and FCOVER (fraction of vegetation cover) from MODIS (on Terra and Aqua satellites) and BioPar (Bio-geophysical Parameter) projects are used in order to 1/ isolate stationary forest covers, and 2/ detect local tendencies in their canopy albedo. First, the statistical tests were applied to LAI, FCOVER, and surface albedo data over the areas that are classified as forest by ESA-CCI land cover database. In case of temporal break in LAI or FCOVER data series, we assume that the forest was managed at least once during the last decade or the vegetation cover has changed. This hypothesis was verified over the Landes forest in southwestern France, where a major storm damaged 300000 hectares in 2009. This work allowed to isolate relative stationary forest covers that were not managed. Secondly, we show that the visible surface albedo has decreased due to the gradual closing and increase in greenness of some of these forest covers. Finally, we quantified the change in direct radiative forcing due to this shift of surface albedo by using ERA-Interim incoming solar radiation data. The next step will be to better characterize the physiological and structural factors that drive these albedo changes.",

            "abstract": "We propose application of the amplitude source location (ASL) method to characterize source and wave propagation effects of volcano-seismic events and tremor observed at different volcanoes. We used this method to estimate the source location and source amplitude from high-frequency (5-10 Hz) seismic amplitudes under the assumption of isotropic S-wave radiation. We estimated the cumulative source amplitude (Is) as the offset value of the time-integrated envelope of the vertical seismogram corrected for geometrical spreading and medium attenuation in the 5-10 Hz band. We studied these parameters of tremor signals associated with eruptions and explosion events at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador; long-period (LP) events at Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador; and LP events at Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia. We identified two types of eruption tremor at Tungurahua; noise-like inharmonic waveforms and harmonic oscillatory signals. We found that Is increased linearly with increasing source amplitude for explosion events and LP events, and that Is increased exponentially with increasing source amplitude for inharmonic eruption tremor signals. The source characteristics of harmonic eruption tremor signals differed from those of inharmonic tremor signals. The Is values we estimated for inharmonic eruption tremor were consistent with previous estimates of volumes of tephra fallout. The linear relationship between the source amplitude and Is for LP events can be explained by the wave propagation effects in the diffusion model for multiple scattering assuming a diffusion coefficient of 105 m2/s and an intrinsic Q factor of around 50. The resultant mean free path is approximately 100 m. Our results suggest that Cotopaxi and Nevado del Ruiz volcanoes have similar highly scattering and attenuating structures. Our approach provides a systematic way to compare the size of volcano-seismic signals observed at different volcanoes. The scaling relations among source parameters that we identified are useful to our understanding of the source processes associated with eruptions and wave propagation characteristics beneath volcanoes.",

The origin of rhythmic layering has been hotly debated in the literatures. Proposed mechanisms include gravity differentiation, double-diffusive convection, oscillatory crystallization of magma, repeated injection and supplement of magma, etc. Here we provide detailed FTIR and EBSD studies on the water content and deformation microstructure of gabbros from the Panzhihua intrusion and experimentally deformed synthetic gabrros and magnetite aggregates with a volume ratio of 6:4. The FTIR analyses revealed a significant amount of hydroxyls in both clinopyroxene (411-775 ppm) and plagioclase (328-716 ppm), suggesting a high water content mantle plume source. The EBSD analyses show similar fabrics in constitutent minerals of natural and experimental specimens: a weak clinopyroxene fabric of (100) parallel to foliation and [001] parallel to lineation; a strong plagioclase fabric of (010) parallel to foliation and [100] parallel to lineation, a weak ilmenite fabric of (001) parallel to foliation and [hk0] parallel to lieantion; and a near random magnitite fabric. There is an obvious rhythmic layering in sheared gabrros and magnetite aggregates similar to natural observations. Our results revealed strong layer-parallel shearing deformation during the formation of the Panxi layered intructions. There is a significant strength contrast between gabbro and Fe-Ti oxides. We propose that the formation of the rhythmic layering in mafic-ultramafic intrusions is caused mainly by rheological stratification of Fe-Ti oxides and gabbros.",

Based on the last 50 years data, sea level variations responded to the local and general atmospheric circulation in the perspective of barotropic and baroclinic modes. Our study had shown that the dynamic process resulted from the atmosphere circulation, especially the wind field anomaly, could explain the discrepancy of sea level. Compared to the local ekman pumping effect, the remote Rossby wave, originated by wind field anomaly, accounted for nearly two third of the atmospheric influence. Sea level was manifested the correlation at 5-8 years lag with the basin mean wind stress curl anomalies. The typical oceanic processes associated with the regional sea level variation were described as the thermosteric effect and water mass changes in this study. Migration and redistribution of water mass induced by ocean current acted as the comparable contributor, according to the simultaneous thermosteric effect. Ocean transports of west boundary current varied robustly, which indicated the variability of the north Pacific subtropical gyre related to PDO and ENSO, and established the dynamic background of sea level variations in NW Pacific.",

The isotopic composition and concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) has been used to determine carbon sinks and sources in river systems. The Vantaanjoki River, in southern Finland, is located in one of the most densely populated areas in Finland. Previous studies have shown the river having a considerable amount of groundwater - surface water interaction which leads to local groundwater being vulnerable to any contaminants released into the river. The catchment of the river has six water purification facilities, and during times of high discharge some of the waste water is released into the river without treatment. Other possible sources of contamination are urban areas, agriculture and a saw mill. In this study the isotopic composition of DIC was studied, along with the concentration of DIC in the river water, to determine the major influences in carbon balance in the river water, to see if human induced changes in the environment are affecting the carbon cycle. The highest δ13CDIC values were found in the summer, and the lowest ones in the spring. Locations of the water purification facilities or fields along the flow path did not show on the δ13CDIC values, nor in the DIC contents of the water. Similar trends in δ13CDIC values related to the variations between warm and cold seasons have been reported in other studies as well and are likely due to organic material forming and decaying in and around the river channel.",

Observed changes in hydrological variables, agriculture, biodiversity and the built environment have been attributed to a changing climate, whether these changes are the result of natural variability or external forcings (Cramer et al., 2014). While the research community represented in WGI assesses whether, and to what extent, recent extreme weather events can be attributed to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, the research community of impact specialists asks how climatic changes lead to different impacts largely independent of the causes of such changes.\nThis distinction becomes potentially very relevant with respect to the 2013 established the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) to address loss and damage from the impacts of climate change in developing countries under the UNFCCC climate change negotiations. Currently there is no discussion what consists of loss and damage and the reasons for this inexistence of a definition are not primarily scientific but political however, the absence of a definition could potentially lead to absurd consequences if funds in the context of loss and damage would be redistributed, as e.g. suggested, for all low risk high impact events. Here we present the implications of discussed definitions of loss and damage (Huggel et al. 2015) and how scientific evidence could be included.\nCramer et al.

            "abstract": "We summarize the spatial and temporal pattern of climate change through the Holocene in Arctic Canada and Greenland. Our synthesis includes 47 records from a recent database of highly resolved, quantitative Holocene climate records from the Arctic (Sundqvist et al., 2014). We plot the temperature histories represented by the records in the database and compare them with paleoclimate information based on 53 additional records. Combined, the records include a variety of climate proxy types that range from ice (ice cores), land (lake and peat sequences) and marine (ocean sediment cores and coastal sediments) environments. The temperature-sensitive records indicate more consistent and earlier Holocene warmth in the north and east, and a more diffuse and later Holocene thermal maximum in the south and west. Principal components analysis reveals two dominant Holocene trends, one with early Holocene warmth followed by cooling in the middle Holocene, the other with a broader period of warmth in the middle Holocene followed by cooling in the late Holocene. The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0±1.0°C on average (n=11 records). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka, consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time. The spatial pattern of temperature change through the Holocene was likely driven by the decrease in northern latitude summer insolation through the Holocene, the varied influence of waning ice sheets in the early Holocene, and the variable influx of Atlantic Water into the study region.",

Various ensemble-mean estimates of the forced variability were derived from 18 independent ensembles of these simulations, each using a single model with fixed physics package and an identical forcing history. It was shown that the residual intrinsic variability time series over the total of 116 simulations considered are statistically independent. The 18 estimates of the forced signal were further used for semi-empirical attribution of the observed climate variability. The model uncertainty results in a fairly broad range of the “intrinsic” multidecadal variability so estimated. Furthermore, the observed surface temperature “intrinsic” residuals exhibit the levels of multidecadal variance overwhelmingly exceeding those of the simulated intrinsic multidecadal variability. This may reflect the climate models’ consistently underestimating the true amplitude of the forced multidecadal variability, and/or be indicative of the lack of multidecadal intrinsic dynamics in these models.",

            "abstract": "Characteristics of heavy snowfall and snow crystal habits have been investigated in the campaign of Experiment on Snow Storms At Yeongdong (ESSAY) using radiosonde soundings, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and a digital camera with a magnifier for taking a photograph of snowfall crystals. The analysis period is mainly both winters of 2014 and 2015.\nThe synoptic situations are similar to those of the previous studies such as the Low pressure system passing by the far South of the Korean peninsula along with the Siberian High extending to northern Japan, which eventually results in the northeasterly or easterly flows and the long-lasting snowfall episodes in the Yeongdong region. The snow crystal habits observed in the ESSAY campaign were mainly dendrite, consisting of 70% of the entire habits. The rimed habits were frequently captured when two-layered clouds were observed, probably through the process of freezing of super-cooled droplets on the ice particles. The homogeneous habit such as dendrite was shown in case of shallow clouds with its thickness of below 500 m whereas various habits were captured such as graupel, dendrites, rimed dendrites, aggregates of dendrites, plates, rimed plates, etc in the thick cloud with its thickness greater than 1.5 km. The dendrites appeared to be dominant in the condition of cloud top temperature specifically ranging -12~-16℃. Interestingly temporal evolutions of snow crystal habits were consistently shown for several snowfall events such as changes from rimed particles to dendrites(or aggregated dendrites).\nThe association of snow crystal habits with temperature and super-saturation in the cloud will be in detail examined. However, better understandings of characteristics of snow crystal habits would contribute to preventing breakdown accidents such as a greenhouse destruction and collapse of a temporary building due to heavy snowfall, and traffic accidents due to snow-slippery road condition, providing a higher-level weather information of snow quality for skiers participating in the winter sports, and estimating more accurate snowfall amount, location, and duration with the fallspeed of solid precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Extreme events linked with human induced climate change have now been reported around the globe. Among the most troublesome impacts are increased wild fires, failed crop yields, extreme flooding and increase human mortality (Hansen and Cramer, 2015). Many of these impacts are predicted to increase into the future. Non-industrialised communities around the world will be the least capable of adapting, while the industrial communities, who are often responsible for historical carbon emissions, will find adaptation easier. Such a situation lends itself to the issue of responsibility. In order to assess responsibility, it must first be established where the major carbon and methane emissions are originating. It must then be estimated how these emissions project onto localised climate, which is often the primary indicator behind impacts on society.\nIn this study, we address this question using a 25 km regional climate model capable of simulating climate thousands of times under the Weather@home citizen science project. The use of this framework allows us to generate huge data sample sizes, which can be put in the context of very low sample sizes of observational data. We concentrate on the 2003 heat wave over Europe, but show how this method could be applied to less data rich regions, including the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.",

Hydrogeological and geophysical data are collected to characterize the site, prior to conducting CO2 injection experiment at the CO2 environmental monitoring site at Eumseong, Korea. The geophysical data were acquired from borehole electromagnetic flowmeter tests, while the hydraulic data were obtained from pumping tests, slug tests, and falling head permeability tests. Total of 13 wells to perform hydraulic and geophysical test are established along groundwater flow direction in regular sequence, revealed by the results of borehole electromagnetic flowmeter test. The results of geophysical tests indicated that hydraulic gradient is not identical with the topographic gradient. Groundwater flows toward the uphill direction in the study area. Then, the hydraulic tests were conducted to identify the hydraulic properties of the study site. According to the results of pumping and slug tests at the study site, the hydraulic conductivity values show ranges between 4.75 x 10-5 cm/day and 9.74 x 10-5 cm/day. In addition, a portable multi-level sampling and monitoring packer device which remains inflated condition for a long period developed and used to isolate designated depths to identify vertical distribution of hydrogeological characteristics. Hydrogeological information obtained from this study will be used to decide the injection test interval of CO2-infused water and gaseous CO2.\nAcknowledgement: Financial support was provided by \"R&D Project on Environmental Mangement of Geologic CO2 Storage\" from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003).",

However, due to an apparently diffuse seismicity pattern defining a broad region of distributed deformation west of Gibraltar Strait, the question of the location, dimension and geometry of such structures is still open to debate. We recently developed a new algorithm for earthquake location in 3D complex media with laterally varying interface depths, which allowed us to relocate 2363 events having occurred from 2007 to 2013, using P- and S-wave catalog arrival times obtained from the Portuguese Meteorological Institute (IPMA, Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera), for a study area lying between 8.5˚W and 5˚W in longitude and 36˚ and 37.5˚ in latitude. The most remarkable change in the seismicity pattern after relocation is an apparent concentration of events, in the North of the Gulf of Cadiz, along a low angle northward-dipping plane rooted at the base of the crust, which could indicate the presence of a major fault. If confirmed, this would be the first structure clearly illuminated by seismicity in a region that has unleashed large magnitude earthquakes. Here, we present results from the joint analysis of focal mechanism solutions and waveform similarity between neighboring events from waveform cross-correlation in order to assess whether those earthquakes occur on the same fault plane.",

Recently, drilling cores sampled from Japan Meteorological Agency’s (JMA’s) borehole type volcanic monitoring stations [Group for Drilling Core Analysis, Coordinating Committee for the Prediction of Volcanic Eruption, 2011] offers an opportunity for studying the thermal regime at 42 volcanoes in Japan. Thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and density were measured on 122 samples obtained from these JMA’s boreholes. Thermal conductivity shows good correlation with density. We also investigated continuous temperature profiles from JMA’s boreholes up to about 100 m in depth. Although less precise, these data provide most of the estimates of heat flux at volcanic areas in Japan.\nOn the other hand, the depth of magnetic sources based on spectrum analysis of magnetic anomaly data [e.g., Spector and Grant, 1970] can be used to estimate regional thermal structures. This analysis is still controversial, however, this depth may reflect the broad average temperature and they have been used to estimate the thermal structure in various regions.\nWe discuss some of the limitations and possible uses for both data sources.",

Here, we present an observation-based study based on the time period 1964 to 2010, which is unique in that it does not rely on global climate models (GCMs) in any way. The study uses surface observations of temperature and incoming solar radiation from approximately 1300 surface sites, along with observations of the equivalent CO2 concentration (CO2,eq) in the atmosphere, to produce a new best estimate for the transient climate sensitivity of 1.9K (95% confidence interval 1.2K – 2.7K). This is higher than other recent observation-based estimates, and is better aligned with the estimate of 1.8K and range (1.1K – 2.5K) derived from the latest generation of GCMs. The new estimate is produced by incorporating the observations in an energy balance framework, and by applying statistical methods that are standard in the field of Econometrics, but less common in climate studies. The study further suggests that about a third of the continental warming due to increasing CO2,eq was masked by aerosol cooling during the time period studied.",

            "abstract": "Substantial improvements have been made to the cloud microphysical schemes used in the latest generation of global climate models (GCMs), however, an outstanding weakness of these schemes lies in the arbitrariness of their tuning parameters. Despite the growing effort in improving the cloud microphysical schemes in GCMs, most of this effort has not focused on improving the ability of GCMs to accurately simulate phase partitioning in mixed-phase clouds. Getting the relative proportion of liquid droplets and ice crystals in clouds right in GCMs is critical for the representation of cloud radiative forcings and cloud-climate feedbacks. Here, we first present satellite observations of cloud phase obtained by NASA’s CALIOP instrument, and report on robust statistical relationships between cloud phase and several aerosols species that have been demonstrated to act as ice nuclei (IN) in laboratory studies. We then report on results from model intercomparison projects that reveal that GCMs generally underestimate the amount of supercooled liquid in clouds. For a selected GCM (NCAR ‘s CAM5), we thereafter show that the underestimate can be attributed to two main factors: i) the presence of IN in the mixed-phase temperature range, and ii) the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process, which converts liquid to ice once ice crystals have formed. Finally, we show that adjusting these two processes such that the GCM’s cloud phase is in agreement with the observed has a substantial impact on the simulated radiative forcing due to IN perturbations, as well as on the cloud-climate feedbacks and ultimately climate sensitivity simulated by the GCM.",

            "abstract": "Since measurements of Ganymede’s induced magnetic field suggest a salty water layer underneath the satellite’s icy crust [1], we studied the perspectives for the Ganymede Laser Altimeter (GALA) onboard ESA’s JUICE mission to infer the ice-I thickness by measuring the dynamic response of Ganymede's ice shell to tidal forces exerted by Jupiter. We found that the uncertainties in the determination of the tidal Lover number h2 is 2% and we will demonstrate that this will constrain the ice-I thickness to ± 20 km.\nOur model also includes a detailed analysis of the instrument performance taking account of Ganymede's rough small-scale topography. The model is combined with the current mission scenario and spacecraft performance expectation of the JUICE mission giving an estimate for the accuracy of the range measurements in Ganymede orbit.\nHowever, the determination of the resulting ice thickness further depends on the tidally effective rheology of the outer ice shell [2]. Laboratory measurements of ice I (e.g. [3]) suggest that the rigidity can be constrained, however, the less well known viscosity can play a major role when inferring the thickness of the outer ice shell. As a consequence we further investigated under which conditions the ice I viscosity could be constrained by measuring the phase-lag of Ganymede’s tidal response using laser altimetry.\n[1] Kivelson et al. 2002.\n[2] Moore and Schubert, 2003.\n[3] Sotin et al., 1998",

            "abstract": "Evolution of North Atlantic passive margins has been profoundly influenced by the Iceland mantle plume over the past 60 Ma. Residual depth anomalies of oceanic lithosphere, long wavelength gravity anomalies and seismic tomographic models show that upwelling mantle material extends from Baffin Bay to Western Norway. At fringing passive margins such as Northwest Scotland, there is evidence for present-day dynamic support of the crust. The Iceland plume is bisected by the Reykjanes Ridge ridge, which acts as a tape-recorder of the temporal variability of the plume. We present regional seismic reflection profiles that traverse the oceanic basin between northwest Europe and Greenland. A diachronous pattern of V-shaped ridges and troughs are imaged beneath marine sediments, revealing a complete record of transient periodicity that can be traced continuously back to ~55 Myrs. This periodicity increases from ~3 to ~8 Ma with clear evidence for minor, but systematic, asymmetric crustal accretion. V-shaped ridges grow with time and reflect small (5–30°C) changes in mantle temperature, consistent with episodic generation of hot solitary waves triggered by growth of thermal boundary layer instabilities within the mantle. Our continuous record of convective activity suggests that the otherwise uniform thermal subsidence of sedimentary basins, which fringe the North Atlantic Ocean, has been punctuated by periods of variable dynamic topography. This record can explain a set of diverse observations from the geologic record. Paleogene unconformities in the Faroe-Shetland Basin, the punctuated deposition of contourite drifts and variations in deep-water current strength can all be explained by transient mantle plume behavior. These signals of convective activity should lead to improved insights into the fluid dynamics of the mantle, and into the evolution of volcanic passive margins.",

            "abstract": "Recent trends in ambient concentrations of NOx in the UK (and other European countries) have shown a general decrease over the period 1990 to 2002, followed by largely static concentrations from 2004 – present. This is not in line with the decreases predicted based on bottom up emission inventories and has lead to widespread non-compliance with EU Air Quality Directives. We present a method to quantify the geographic variability of emission of NOx and selected VOCs at a city scale (London) using an aircraft platform. High frequency observations of NOx and VOCs (10 Hz and 2 Hz, respectively) were made using low altitude flights across London and combined with 20 Hz micro-meteorological data to provide an emission flux using the aircraft eddy covariance technique. A continuous wavelet transformation was used to produce instantaneous fluxes along the flight transect and a parameterisation of a backward Lagrangian model used to calculate the flux footprint, attributing emission rates to specific areas in Greater London (see figure). The observed flux was compared to the UK National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI), which takes a “bottom up” approach to calculating emissions, involving estimates from different source sectors to produce yearly emission estimates. These were then modified using factors specific to each source to reflect the actual month, day and time of the flight, to provide a more meaningful comparison to the observation. A significant underestimation in the inventory NOx was observed ranging from 150–200% in outer London, to 300% in the central area. Potential reasons for this are discussed, including the poor treatment of real world emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles in the inventory. We also compare measurements to the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI), which provides a more explicit treatment of the traffic emissions specific to London and which shows better agreement with the measurements.",

            "abstract": "We present a novel technique for the precise measurement of absolute local gravity based on cold atom interferometry. Atom interferometry utilizes the interference of matter waves interrogated by laser light to read out inertial forces. Today's generation of these devices typically operate with test mass samples, that consists of ensembles of laser cooled atoms. Their performance is limited by the velocity spread and finite-size of the test masses that impose systematic uncertainties at the level of a few µGal. Rather than laser cooled atoms we employ quantum degenerate ensembles, so called Bose-Einstein condensates, as ultra-sensitive probes for gravity. These sources offer unique properties in temperature as well as in ensemble size that will allow to overcome the current limitations with the next generation of sensors. Furthermore, atom-chip technologies offer the possibility to generate Bose-Einstein condensates in a fast and reliable way. We show a lab-based prototype that uses the atom-chip itself to retro-reflect the interrogation laser and thus serving as inertial reference inside the vacuum. With this setup it is possible to demonstrate all necessary steps to measure gravity, including the preparation of the source, spanning an interferometer as well as the detection of the output signal, within an area of 1 cm3 right below the atom-chip and to analyze relevant systematic effects. In the framework of the center of excellence geoQ a next generation device is under construction at the Institut für Quantenoptik, that will allow for in-field measurements. This device will feature a state-of-the-art atom-chip source with a high-flux of ultra-cold atoms at a repetition rate of 1-2 Hz. In cooperation with the Müller group at the Institut für Erdmessung the sensor will be characterized in the laboratory first, to be ultimately employed in campaigns to measure the Fennoscandian uplift at the level of 1 µGal.\nThe presented work is part of the center of excellence geoQ (SFB 1128), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

            "abstract": "Numerical simulation of monochromatic, finite-amplitude surface waves propagating over an initial quiescent flow field is conducted to reveal the potential impact of non-breaking waves on turbulence production. The numerical model solves the primitive equations subject to the fully nonlinear boundary conditions on the exact water surface. The simulation result predicts growth rates of turbulent kinetic energy consistent with previous measurements and modeling. It also validates the observed horizontal anisotropy of the near-surface turbulence that the spanwise turbulent intensity exceeds the streamwise component. Such a flow structure is found to be attributed to the formation of an array of streamwise vortices with alternating orientations near the water surface, which also induce elongated surface streaks. These characteristic flow structures suggest mechanism akin to that induces Langmuir turbulence. The proposition is confirmed by stability analysis employing Craik-Leibovich phase-averaged equation: The spanwise wavelength of the most unstable disturbance is found to be close to the average spacing between adjacent counter-rotating vortex pairs.",

            "abstract": "The Sørvestsnaget Basin is a Cenozoic depocenter in Southwestern Barents Sea formed along the North-South Senja fault. Previous research works in this area have identified a thick succession of Tertiary wedges sourced potentially from the Stappen High. This study is aimed at evaluating the evolution of the Tertiary deposits in the Sørvestsnaget Basin using sequence stratigraphic approach. Five sequences were interpreted from recently acquired high-resolution 2D seismic reflection data. Lithology and biostratigraphic information was obtained from two boreholes in the study area, 7316/5-1 and 7216/11-1S. The sequences were separated into maximum flooding surface, condensed section, and a sequence boundary that correlate from wells to seismic for hundreds of kilometers. The first sequence is the base of the Paleogene unit revealed as low and high basement configuration. This sequence is succeeded by a transgressive system tract (TST) dominated by deposition of deep marine shale after a relative sea-level rise. Biostratigraphy data from well 7216/11-1S revealed stratigraphic breaks on the Late Eocene to Miocene age condensed section. Uplift of the marginal high in Oligocene to Miocene times influenced the development of an early highstand system tract (EHST) during Neogene age. This is followed by deposition of shallow marine sediments and emergence of a late highstand system tract (LHST) in early Quaternary. The LHST developed in a glacio-marine environment. Relatively low sea-level fall during middle Quaternary forced the development of a shelf margin towards the south. The top of the shelf margin system tract (SMST) was eroded by the Upper Regional Unconformity (URU). In Late Quaternary, the Sørvestsnaget Basin witnessed a relatively sea-level rise evidenced by the back-stepping sequences above the URU on seismic section. This is the last transgressive system tract (TST). This work has shown that the Sørvestsnaget Basin has recorded fluctuating sea-level rise since approximately 34 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow and tracer transport in fractured rock controls many natural and engineered processes in the geosciences, and therefore has been extensively studied. Geologic fractures, however, are always under significant overburden stress. While confining stress has been shown to impact fluid flow through rough-walled fractures in a fundamental way, studies of anomalous tracer transport at the scale of individual fractures have so far ignored the potential role of confining stress.\nHere, we report the emergence of anomalous (non-Fickian) transport through a rough-walled fracture as a result of increasing the normal stress on the fracture. We generate fracture surfaces with fractal roughness, and solve the elastic contact problem between the two surfaces to obtain the 3D fracture geometry for increasing levels of normal stress. We then simulate fluid flow and particle transport through the stressed rough fracture. We observe a transition from Fickian to anomalous transport as the normal stress on the fracture increases.\nWe show that the origin of this anomalous transport behavior can be traced to the self-organization of the flow field into a heterogeneous structure dominated by preferential channels and stagnation zones, as a result of the larger number of contacts in a highly stressed fracture. We also propose a spatial Markov model that reproduces the transport behavior at the scale of the entire fracture with only three physical parameters. Our results point to a heretofore unrecognized link between geomechanics and anomalous particle transport in fractured media. Finally, we show preliminary laboratory experiment results that confirm our findings.\n(a) Magnitude of the volumetric flux at each discretization grid block at low stress.

The starting material is a natural hydrothermally grown single crystal that was crushed to a powder with grain size d < 100 µm.\nCoesite (coe) is found if the maximum principle stress (σ1) is in the coe stability field. In general Pc and the mean stress (Pm) of these samples are below the quartz-coesite phase transition (QCT). Coe is not found if σ1 is below the QCT. At T = 600 °C, σ1is always in the coe stability field. But coe is only present in the high strain experiment, indicating slow transformation kinetics.\nIn one sample we observed that σ1crosses the QCT during the loading part and after progressive weakening crosses the QCT back into the qtz stability field. The microstructure of this sample shows the formation of coe and the reverse transformation from coe to qtz.\nThe coe growth penetrates the sample and coe grows around and in between larger qtz clasts. At high stresses, where Pm is also above the QCT, coe often forms radiating aggregates. At lower stresses, where only σ1 lies in the stability field of coe, and at low strain the coe grains have a preferred orientation of the b-axes (sub-) parallel to σ1. With increasing strain, the rigid coe grains rotate and align with the preferred qtz fabric.\nFor coe to be found, it is sufficient that σ1 reaches values above the transformation pressure. If σ1 drops back into the qtz stability field during an experiment, a back-reaction from coe to qtz is observed. It appears therefore that the pressure that defines the QCT is not Pc or Pm, but σ1.",

            "abstract": "Long-term thermal changes at the land surface can be backtracked from borehole temperature profiles. The main focus so far has been on past climate changes, assuming perfect coupling of surface air and ground temperature. In many urbanized areas, however, temperature profiles are heavily perturbed. We find a characteristic bending of urban profiles towards shallow depth, which indicates strong heating from the ground surface during recent decades. This phenomenon is generally described as subsurface urban heat island (UHI) effect, which exists beneath many cities worldwide. Major drivers are land use changes and urban structures that act as long-term heat sources that artificially load the top 100 m of the ground.\nWhile variability in land use and coverage are critical factors for reliable borehole climatology, temperature profiles can also be inverted to trace back the combined effect of past urbanization and climate. We present an analytical framework based on the superposition of specific Green’s functions for simulating transient land use changes and their effects on borehole temperature profiles. By inversion in a Bayesian framework, flexible calibration of unknown spatially distributed parameter values and their correlation is feasible. The procedure is applied to four temperature logs which are around 200-400 m deep from the city and suburbs of Zurich, Switzerland. These were recorded recently by a temperature sensor and data logger introduced in closed borehole heat exchangers before the start of geothermal operation. At the sites, long-term land use changes are well documented for more than the last century. This facilitated focusing on a few unknown parameters, and we selected the contribution by asphalt and by basements of buildings. It is revealed that for three of the four sites, these two factors dominate the subsurface UHI evolution. At one site, additional factors such as buried district heating networks may play a role. It is demonstrated that site-specific conditions at the ground surface are mirrored in the form of the temperature profiles. Site-specific land use changes appear to be more crucial in general for the near surface temperature evolution than long-term climatic changes.",

            "abstract": "In seismic interferometric (SI) studies, the empirical Green's functions are retrieved by stacking a number of correlograms of a prescribed length. When processing SI data, the choice of the correlation window length and the number of correlograms are based on some empirical or pre-stablished values based on experience. Here, we present an analytical approach to jointly estimate the correlation window length and number of correlograms to stack in ambient noise correlation studies to statistically ensure that noise cross-terms cancel out to within a chosen threshold. These estimates provide the minimum amount of data necessary to extract coherent signals in ambient noise studies using noise sequences filtered in a given frequency bandwidth. The estimation relies on two quantities extracted from the data itself: (a) variance of the cross-correlation energy density calculated over an elementary time length equal to the largest period present in the filtered data and (b) the threshold below which the noise cross-terms will be in the final stacked correlograms. Our approach is also able to explain how to tune the required correlation window length and number of stacks when changing from one frequency bandwidth to another. A bonus from our approach is that we are also able to monitor noise stationarity. The validity of the expressions from our theory have been demonstrated with numerical cross-correlation tests using synthetic and field data.",

Here we use it for an event attribution of the 2014 record temperatures and to calculate the time of emergence of an anthropogenic signal.\nLast year, Central England experienced its warmest year in a record extending back to 1659. Using both state-of-the-art climate models and empirical techniques, our analysis shows a substantial and significant increase in the likelihood of record-breaking warm years, such as 2014, due to human influences on the climate. It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings on the climate have increased the chances of record warm years in Central England by at least 13-fold. This study points to a large influence of human activities on extreme warm years despite the small region of study and the variable climate of Central England. Our analysis shows that climate change is clearly visible on the local-scale.\nThe time of emergence of an anthropogenic signal in the CET series was also calculated. Earlier emergence was found in mean temperatures than extreme indices and also at longer temporal scales, such as annual values when compared with individual months or dates. This is due to reduced interannual variability on these timescales. Emergence of an anthropogenic signal could be detected in daily and monthly CET values in late summer and early autumn.",

            "abstract": "Civil engineering structures founded in fractured crystalline rock, such as the Fennoscandian Shield (Norway-Sweden-Finland) requires allowance for both stability and/or deformations of the rock mass and groundwater ingress and groundwater pressure changes. Coupling these issues could be the key to solving the challenges that arise from construction of e.g. hydropower dams, road and railroad tunnels, and most certainly the construction of nuclear waste repositories within fractured crystalline rock, all of which are currently planned in Sweden.\nExcavation related deformation in fractures may cause groundwater leakage even from the most elaborate pre-excavation grouting works. A better understanding on hydraulically (or grouting) induced deformations in the near-field of tunnels, where the stress field is re-distributed due to the opening may both provide a basis for more accurate numerical modelling and grouting or excavation procedures that minimize the damage on the completed grouting fans.\nSubjects of this study were experiments conducted as measurement of deformations in boreholes close to tunnels due to stepwise injection tests, and laboratory hydromechanical experiments conducted as flow and normal deformation measurements in a permeameter during cycles of up to 2.5 MPa confining pressure, and subsequent surface scanning of the samples for coupling of HM-results to geometric appearance, aperture and contact geometry.\nWhen expressed in terms of hydraulic aperture (b) and fracture normal stiffness (kn) the results of both in situ and lab experiments support a previously suggested relationship based on field data where kn is inversely proportional to roughly b2. The relationship was assumed to be valid for low compressive stress across fractures with limited previous deformation. One important data set used to establish the relationship was transmissivity and storage coefficients from hydraulic interference tests previously performed at Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory.",

            "abstract": "We present data from our dense seismic network which captured in unprecedented detail the micro-seismicity associated with the 2014 dike intrusion from the subglacial Bárðarbunga volcano in central Iceland. Over 30,000 automatically located earthquakes delineate a complex 46 km dike propagation during the days preceding the onset of effusive magmatism at the Holuhraun lava field on 29 August 2014. Approximately 1.5 km3 of lava was erupted, making this the largest eruption in Iceland for over 200 years.\nMicro-seismicity tracks the lateral migration of the dike, with a concentration of earthquakes in the advancing tip where stresses are greatest, and trailing zones of lesser or no seismicity behind. Onset of an initial 4 hour fissure eruption was accompanied simultaneously by a backward retreat in seismic activity, followed by a gradual re-advance prior to the onset of a second, sustained fissure eruption in the same location on 31 August. Rock fracture mechanisms are determined from fault plane solutions of these seismic events. At the tip of the advancing dike, left-lateral strike-slip faulting parallel to the propagation is dominant, utilising pre-existing lineations and releasing stress accumulated in the brittle layer from rift zone extension. Behind the dike tip, both right-lateral and left-lateral strike-slip earthquakes are found, marking failure of solidifying magma plugs within the dike conduit. Contrary to many models of dike propagation, both normal faulting and failure at high angles to the dike are rare. Furthermore, a distinct lack of seismicity is observed in the 3-4 km region beneath the surface rupture. This suggests that opening is occuring aseismically, with earthquakes focused at the base of the dike near the brittle-ductile boundary.",

            "abstract": "Mixing and dispersion in coastal aquifers are controlled by concentration gradients, which are influenced by temporal fluctuations on multiple time-scales caused by waves and tides, as well as seasonal pumping, recharge and droughts. We study effective mixing and solute transport in temporally fluctuating one-dimensional flow for a stable stratification of two fluids of different density. Previous studies have demonstrated that temporal flow fluctuations parallel to the main flow directions have an impact on mixing and solute dispersion (see, e.g., Kinzelbach and Ackerer, 1986; Goode and Konikow, 1990). Most of these findings were obtained under the pseudo steady state assumption, that is, a storativity of zero, which implies an instantaneous flow response to hydraulic perturbations and spatially-uniform flow. However, a finite storativity induces a spatially non-uniform flow distribution in response to temporal head fluctuations, which in turn perturbs concentration gradients, leading to enhanced spreading and mixing of solutes. In this study, we derive explicit expressions for the concentration distribution and variance to identify the controls of the coupling between mixing and oscillatory density-dependent flow. We find a sizeable increase of the effective dispersion coefficients as a function of the hydraulic diffusivity and the initial interface location. We identify an effective boundary condition which is given by the attenuation distance of the head signal. This boundary explains the sublinear growth of the width of the mixing zone determined at intermediate times. At long times the concentration profile assumes a non-symmetric shape that is controlled by the spatial dependence of the effective dispersion coefficient. Sand column experiments under well-controlled laboratory conditions are presented to validate the theoretical effective model defined.\n",

            "abstract": "To date, satellite instruments such as SCIAMACHY and GOSAT-TANSO-FTS have largely focused on regional scale methane output (Kort, A. E., et al. 2014), in order to gain insight into significant methane source regions (such as the Four Corners). However, such an approach does not tackle the root of the issue; the individual sources of methane that account for the total global methane budget, e.g. oil wells and marshland. In this study we aim to use existing satellite sensors onboard Metop and GOSAT to locate point sources of methane from space.\nWe use nine years of global methane measurements from Metop-IASI A/B in order to exploit the exceptionally high global coverage of the instruments (total coverage of the Earth twice a day), and its relatively small spatial footprint in order to accurately identify these methane source regions. Using these data we show which regions have persistent sources (such as the Four Corners), and which are fugitive (methane bubbles in the Arctic), changing from one month to the next.\nFollowing the identification of significant source regions using IASI, we increase the resolution by cross-referencing with the higher spatial resolution (but patchy) GOSAT data, in order to answer the question of whether individual gas sources can be identified from space. This study partially follows the method proposed by Kort, who used SCIAMACHY to identify general areas of high methane release in the USA, focusing on the oilrigs in the Four Corners region. This study takes Kort’s work further and attempts to identify individual sources (both natural and anthropogenic) using the GOSAT/IASI combination, backed up with ground-based knowledge of sources, such as the FrackTracker database and known natural sources such as the “Door to Hell” in Turkmenistan.\nFinally we show validation by comparing the individual footprints against methane measurements from the TCCON (Wunch, D., et al. 2010), thus providing confidence in the use of individual satellites footprints as accurate measurement tools.\n",

            "abstract": "In the long term, captured CO2 will most likely be stored in large saline formations and it is highly likely that CO2 from multiple operators will be injected into a single saline formation. Understanding CO2 behaviour within the reservoir is vital for making operational decisions and often uses geochemical techniques. Furthermore, in the event of a CO2 leak, being able to identify the owner of the CO2 is of vital importance in terms of liability and remediation. Addition of geochemical tracers to the CO2 stream is an effective way of tagging the CO2 from different operators, but may become prohibitively expensive at large scale storage sites. Here we present results from a project assessing whether the natural isotopic composition (C, O and noble gas isotopes) of captured CO2 is sufficient to distinguish CO2 captured using different technologies and from different fuel sources from each other and from likely baseline conditions.\nResults include analytical measurements of CO2 sampled from a number of different CO2 capture plants and a comprehensive literature review of the known and hypothetical isotopic compositions of captured CO2 and baseline conditions.\nKey findings from the literature review suggest that the carbon isotope composition will be most strongly controlled by that of the feedstock, but significant fractionation is possible during the capture process; oxygen isotopes are likely to be controlled by the isotopic composition of any water used in either the industrial process or the capture technology; and noble gases concentrations will likely be controlled by the capture technique employed. Preliminary analytical results are in agreement with these predictions.\nComparison with summaries of likely storage reservoir baseline data and shallow or surface leakage reservoir baseline data suggests that C-isotopes are likely to be valuable tracers of CO2 in the storage reservoir, while noble gases may be particularly valuable as tracers of potential leakage.",

Our goal was to build a new reference 3D seismic velocity model for the region at unprecedented high resolution, constrained by a large number of observed full seismic waveforms. To this purpose, we used recorded data of dense seismological networks together with extremely efficient numerical techniques and an enormous computational power provided by European Tier-0 systems.\nWe exploited the powerful combination of a spectral-element method (code SPECFEM3D), for high-resolution numerical simulations of seismic wave fields, and an adjoint method, for tomographic inversion and imaging based on misfit reduction between observed and synthetic full waveforms.\nThe earthquakes and stations considered in the inversion procedure homogeneously cover the Italian peninsula and neighbouring zones. All the 3D heterogeneities that characterize the region are implemented in the simulations, also accounting for wave attenuation.\nWe expect that the results of the study will have an important impact in increasing our knowledge of geophysical processes and in addressing societal issues. Creating a refined geological model of the lithosphere in Italy will enhance the capability of analysing seismic effects.

Such uncertainties are expected to be of particular importance in the tropical UTLS, a region that receives significant surface emissions and moisture via deep convection and upwelling, and experiences large amounts of lightning production of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Accurately simulating UTLS composition and its variability is of utmost importance as both could have a significant effect on the region’s temperature and circulation, as well as on surface climate and the amount of UV radiation entering the troposphere.\nIn this presentation, we will present a collection of results focusing on the role of clouds on UTLS composition, based on composition-climate model output from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). We will examine the key cloud processes which are expected to have an influence on UTLS composition with a particular focus on their role in modifying solar radiation and photolysis rates of trace gases through the backscattering of shortwave radiation. The role of such processes on seasonal, interannual and multi-decadal time-scales will be examined. Furthermore, we will utilize CCCM, a unique 3-D cloud data product merged from multiple A-Train satellites (CERES, CloudSat, CALIPSO, and MODIS) developed at the NASA Langley Research Center to evaluate the cloud fields and their vertical distribution in a selected CCMI model (HadGEM3), to adjust the cloud fields where appropriate, and to examine the impacts of this adjustment on tropospheric chemistry, with a focus on oxidants in the UTLS.",

            "abstract": "In Sweden, spatially explicit approaches have been applied in various disciplines such as landslide modelling based on soil type data and flood risk modelling for large rivers. Regarding flood mapping, most previous studies have focused on complex hydrological modelling on a small scale whereas just a few studies have used a robust GIS-based approach integrating most physical catchment descriptor (PCD) aspects on a larger scale. This study was built on a conceptual framework for looking at SedInConnect model, topography, land use, soil data and other PCDs and climate change in an integrated way to pave the way for more integrated policy making. The aim of the present study was to develop methodology for predicting the spatial probability of flooding on a general large scale. This framework can provide a region with an effective tool to inform a broad range of watershed planning activities within a region. Regional planners, decision-makers, etc. can utilize this tool to identify the most vulnerable points in a watershed and along roads to plan for interventions and actions to alter impacts of high flows and other extreme weather events on roads construction. The application of the model over a large scale can give a realistic spatial characterization of sediment connectivity for the optimal management of debris flow to road structures. The ability of the model to capture flooding probability was determined for different watersheds in central Sweden. Using data from this initial investigation, a method to subtract spatial data for multiple catchments and to produce soft data for statistical analysis was developed. It allowed flood probability to be predicted from spatially sparse data without compromising the significant hydrological features on the landscape. This in turn allowed objective quantification of the probability of floods at the field scale for future model development and watershed management. ",

            "abstract": "We present the first discovery of charnockite and A-type Granitoid rocks from the basement rocks in Bangladesh. These lie within the Dinajpur block, located between the Indian Craton to the southwest and the Shillong Massif to the east. There are no surface outcrops and the rocks were intersected by drill holes. They consist of a suite of monzogranite and granitic rocks. The core samples encountered between the depths of 2897 ft to 3510 ft of drillhole GDH-31, Dariapur, Gaibandha district. They consist of a suite of charnockite, monzogranite and granitic rocks. Megascopic study of structure and fabric of rocks suggest that the basement rocks are largely felsic massive igneous with a minor gneiss. The microscopic study reveals that the monzogranite and granite contain plagioclase feldspar, quartz and K-feldspar as predominant mineral constituents and zircon, garnet, rutile, apatite, and opaque minerals as common accessories. In most of the felsic rocks, antiperthite, perthite, myrmekite, graphic, granophyric and micrographic intergrowth textures are seen. The basement rocks in Gaibandha therefore, are considered to have formed as a part of a granitoid, that belongs to a pluton overall displays metaluminous to peraluminous, high K calc-alkaline, ferroan, A2 subtype for the rocks of A-type suite. The rocks are enriched in large Ion Lithophile elements, such as Ba, Sr and moderate to low averaging Ni, Cr, Co, V contents as well as the Zr, Y, Ce, Ga/Al, SiO2, Na2O+K2O and REE content is relatively high. Primitive Mantle–normalized incompatible trace element patterns are also broadly similar for all the rocks with moderate negative Th, Nb and Ti anomalies. The major and trace elements illustrate a post/late-collisional tectonic setting for the granitoid samples. In the first stage, partial melting in a collisional setting with mantle wedge influence and by assimilation of country rocks, the calc-alkaline felsic rocks were formed. Crustal thickening and delamination occurred, as the collision progressed resulting in invading of high-temperature mantle upwelling on the bottom of the thickened felsic crust. The high heat flux caused granulite facies metamorphism on the lower part of the A-type granitoid and eventually generated charnockite.",

            "abstract": "Treatment efficiency of selenium and nitrate in acid mine drainage (AMD) by two types of reactive mixtures, i.e., organic carbon-limestone (OC-LS) and organic carbon-zero valent iron (OC-ZVI), was evaluated through column experiments. The influent AMD, collected at an abandoned metal mine site in Korea, had pH of 2.9 and contained 1600 mg/ L of SO42- and elevated concentrations of metals (e.g., Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Zn). Selenium (40 mg/L) and nitrate (100 mg/L as NO3-N initially and 10 mg/L as NO3-N after 55 days) were spiked into the AMD. The columns were operated for a total of 90 days. The results showed the increase of pH from 2.9 to 7.0 and the decreases in concentrations of most of major ions including selenium and nitrate in both the OC-LS and OC-ZVI columns. The OC-ZVI column had higher removal rates of selenium and nitrate and created a more reduced environment than the OC-LS column due to the abiotic reactions of ZVI. However, a notable amount of ammonia was produced as a reaction product in the OC-ZVI column, while the OC-LS produced a minimum amount of ammonia, suggesting formation of N2 by denitrification. In both columns, removal rates of selenium were substantially increased when the influent NO3-N concentration was changed from 100 mg/L to 10 mg/L. Sulfate was reduced as much as 390 mg/L, as indicated by detection of hydrogen sulfide. The reduction of most metals is considered to be due to precipitation of metal-containing secondary minerals (e.g., sulfides, hydroxides, carbonates). This study shows that treatment of selenium and nitrate in AMD can be achievable using organic carbon-based reactive mixtures through reduction of selenium and nitrate. However, the use of ZVI is not recommended when selenium and nitrate coexist in AMD because of production of ammonia by abiotic reaction between ZVI and nitrate. This study also shows that concentration of nitrate in AMD is an important factor to determine the rate of selenium removal.",

            "abstract": "Rain gauges provide direct and continuous observations of rain accumulation with a high time resolution (up to 1min). However the representativeness of these measurements is restricted to the funnel where rainwater is collected. Due to the high spatial heterogeneity of rainfall, this poor spatial representativeness is a strong limitation for the detailed reconstruction of rain intensity fields.\nHere we propose a geostatistical framework that is able to generate an ensemble of simulated rain fields based on data from a dense rain gauge network. When the density of rain gauges is high (sensor spacing in the range 500m to 1km), the spatial correlation between precipitation time series becomes sufficient to identify and track the rain patterns observed at the rain gauge sampling rate. Rain observations derived from such networks can thus be used to reconstruct the rain field with a high resolution in both space and time (i.e. 1min in time, 100m in space).\nOur method produces an ensemble of realizations that honor the rain intensities measured throughout the rain gauge network and preserve the main features of the rain intensity field at the considered scale, i.e.: the advection and morphing properties of rain cells over time, the intermittency and the skewed distribution of rainfall, and the decrease of the rain rate near the rain cell borders (dry drift). This allows to image the observed rain field and characterize its main features, as well as to quantify the related uncertainty. The obtained reconstruction of the rainfall are continuous in time, and therefore can complement weather radar observations which are snapshots of the rain field. In addition, the application of this method to networks with a spatial extent comparable to the one of a radar pixel (i.e. around 1km2) could allow exploration of the rain field within a single radar pixel.",

            "abstract": "Recent radar and optical observations have revealed that localized fast flows in the polar cap can closely relate to disturbances within the nightside auroral oval. However, how commonly this connection occurs has been difficult to examine due to limited coverage of radar flow measurements and diffuse and dim nature of airglow patches. This question can now be addressed by using polar cap arcs, which are also associated with fast flows and appear much brighter than patches, allowing evaluation of the interaction between polar cap flows and nightside aurora more definitively. Utilizing an array of high-resolution 630.0 nm all-sky imagers, we have selected quasi-steady polar cap arcs lasting >1 h from six winter seasons. Thirty four arcs are found and for the majority (~85%) of them, as they extend equatorward from magnetic pole, their contact with the nightside auroral poleward boundary is associated with new and substantial intensifications within the oval, in contrast to the otherwise quiet oval. These intensifications are localized (<~1 h MLT) and statistically occur within 10 min and ±1 h MLT from the contact. They appear as poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) in a thick auroral oval or an intensification of the only resolvable arc in a thin oval, and the latter can also exhibit substantial poleward expansion. When radar echoes are available, they corroborate the association of polar cap arcs with localized enhanced anti-sunward polar cap flows. That the observed oval intensifications are major disturbances that only occur after and initiate near the impingement of polar cap arcs suggest that they are triggered by localized fast flows coming from deep in the polar cap. Such observation suggests that meso-scale fast flows in the lobe can traverse the open-closed field line boundary through enhanced magnetic reconnection and closely couple with disturbances in the plasma sheet.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing development of continuous GPS networks allows to better describe the diversity of slip modes on subduction interfaces. The description of aseismic processes sheds a new light on the fault dynamics and provokes new questions, particularly about the interplay between seismic and aseismic processes. Exploring new slow slip detection methods at the GPS noise level is a key challenge to complete the catalog of aseismic events.\nThe Mexican subduction zone exhibits a wide range of rupture phenomena, from classic earthquakes, low frequency earthquakes (LFEs), and tremors to the largest magnitudes slow slip events (SSEs) in the world. SSEs have been observed both in Guerrero and Oaxaca regions, with larger magnitudes and recurrence times in Guerrero than in Oaxaca. A singular feature of this subduction zone is that in both regions, SSEs are located up-dip compared to tremor locations.\nWe take advantage of the Mexican continuous GPS network (40 stations) within these two regions to attempt to detect low amplitude slow slip events. We first build synthetic templates of small amplitude events that we cross-correlate with the GPS time-series. We then stack all correlation functions across the GPS network. Positive detections on the stacked correlation function are strengthened by the coincidence of tremors and LFEs bursts. Spatially, positive detections correspond to clustered source template locations. We group all the detections of a given location in what we call a family and then we stack all the events, aligned at detection times, in order to reduce the signal to noise ratio.\nWe detect several families that present a motion compatible with previously observed slow slip events in both the Guerrero and Oaxaca regions. While some families include events within previously observed large SSEs that seem to highlight small asperities located within large SSEs contours, other families are situated outside of these contours, some of them coincident with tremor and LFEs locations.",

How drainage density varies with erosion rate controls the transit time of water and sediment through catchments, influencing the rate of flood response and biogeochemical cycling. This relationship also has profound implications for landscape response to transient forcing. We extract drainage density for five field sites in the USA with a wide range of climatic and lithological characteristics: Feather River, CA; San Gabriel Mountains, CA; Boulder Creek, CO; Guadalupe Mountains, NM; and Haddington Creek, ID. We find that there is a significant positive relationship between drainage density and erosion rate across every field site. These relationships suggest a non-linear relationship between erosion rates and channel slope with an exponent greater than 1. These results are supported by numerical modeling using the Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model. Our modeling results also suggest that non-linear sediment transport fundamentally affects the dominant length scales forming ridges and valleys.",

            "abstract": "Including a land nitrogen (N) cycle in current Earth system models has led to substantial attenuation of predicted land-climate feedbacks, but the magnitude of this N effect remains highly uncertain. The current magnitude and global change responses of major land N cycle processes are still not well understood. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is one particularly important process, being the largest natural land input of N. However, global terrestrial BNF rates are highly uncertain and models lack observations on which to base their predictions. The current variety of terrestrial biosphere models use a wide array of differing, largely untested BNF representations. We tested the six most widely used formulations within the O-CN model and examined the resulting differences in model predictions both under current atmospheric [CO2], as well as under future scenarios of elevated atmospheric [CO2]: a prescribed global map of static BNF rates, two simple empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net primary production and evapotranspiration), two process-based formulations based on plant N status, and an approach following a basic form of optimality of plant N acquisition. We found that the predicted global BNF rates for current conditions were fairly comparable, ranging from 93 to 134 Tg N yr-1 (median 118 Tg N yr-1). However, at 587 ppm atmospheric [CO2], model responses in BNF rates ranged from -5 Tg N yr-1 (-4 %) to 113 Tg N yr-1 (+88 %) (median 14 Tg N yr-1 (+15 %)). As a consequence, future projections of global net primary productivity and carbon storage (increases of different magnitudes), as well as N2O emission (negative responses or unchanged) differed significantly across the different model formulations. Our results emphasize the importance of better understanding the nature and magnitude of BNF responses to change induced perturbations; particularly through new empirical perturbation experiments.",

We derive samples of all natural and interval variability from observations and a recent proxy reconstruction to investigate the likelihood that these two sources of variability could produce a hiatus or rapid warming in surface temperature. The likelihood is found to be consistent with that calculated previously for models and exhibits a similar spatial pattern, with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation-like structure, although with more signal in the Atlantic than in model patterns. The number and length of events increases if natural forcing is also considered, with volcanic forcing acting as a pacemaker for both fast and slow warming rates in model simulations of the last millennium, and, to a smaller extent, from observations. Big eruptions, such as Mount Tambora in 1815, or clusters of eruptions, may result in a hiatus of over 20 years. A striking finding is the smaller influence of volcanism on surface temperature warming rates in instrumental and proxy data than in climate models. This talk will discuss the possible reasons of this discrepancy.",

One common approach is to combine these multiple objectives into one single objective function and allow the use of a single-objective algorithm. Another strategy is to consider the different objectives separately and apply a Pareto-optimizing algorithm. Both methods are challenging in the choice of appropriate multiple objectives with either conflicting interests or the focus on different model processes.\nA first aim of this study is to compare the two approaches employing the mesoscale Hydrologic Model mHM at several distinct river basins over Europe and North America. This comparison will allow the identification of the single-objective solution on the Pareto front. It is elucidated if this position is determined by the weighting and scaling of the multiple objectives when combing them to the single objective.\nThe principal second aim is to guide the selection of proper objectives employing sensitivity analyses. These analyses are used to determine if an additional information would help to constrain additional model parameters. The additional information are either multiple data sources or multiple signatures of one measurement. It is evaluated if specific discharge signatures can inform different parts of the hydrologic model. The results show that an appropriate selection of discharge signatures increased the number of constrained parameters by more than 50% compared to using only NSE of the discharge time series. It is further assessed if the use of these signatures impose conflicting objectives on the hydrologic model. The usage of signatures is furthermore contrasted to the use of additional observations such as soil moisture or snow height. The gain of using an auxiliary dataset is determined using the parametric sensitivity on the respective modeled variable.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 Mw 6.2 (MJMA 6.7) Northern Nagano, central Japan, earthquake occurred on 22 November, 2014 which broke a northern part of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic line active fault system. One of the features of this earthquake is the occurrence of foreshock sequence from four days before the mainshock (about 50 events in JMA catalogue), which were captured by a dense permanent seismic observation. In particular, a 632-m deep borehole station (Hakuba of NIED Hi-net) located about 5 km west of the foreshock region provides us an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the detail of the foreshock sequence. The double-difference relocation of events listed in the JMA catalogue reveals that the foreshocks were located at a depth of 3-4 km and distributed on a NNW dipping 1 km x 1 km plane (plane A) distinct from the aftershock distribution. By a visual identification of running spectra at the Hakuba station, we newly detected about 400 foreshocks. We determined their locations and magnitudes on the basis of a waveform cross-correlation between newly detected foreshocks and DD relocated events. Our new catalogue indicates that the foreshock sequence started at the deeper part of the plane A, migrated to the shallower part, and then jumped to a N-S striking vertical plane (plane B) 1 day before the mainshock. The feature is also supported by the foreshock focal mechanisms determined by P-wave polarities as well as body-wave amplitudes. It is noted that the plane B is consistent with one of nodal planes of the P-wave first-motion mechanism of the mainshock. We further estimated stress drops of the fore- and aftershocks based on the Multi-Window-Spectral-Ratio method, showing that both sequences have stress drops ranging approximately from 0.1 to 10 MPa. The foreshock sequence shows the size-dependent stress drops, while the aftershocks have scale-invariant stress drops as often seen in ordinary earthquakes. This may suggest different rupture properties in the foreshocks, compared with the aftershocks and other ordinary earthquakes.\nAcknowledgements: Seismograph stations used in this study include permanent stations operated by NIED Hi-net, JMA, ERI, and DPRI.",

            "abstract": "In the 8-6 Ma interval, the late Miocene is characterised by a long-term –0.3 ‰ reduction in benthic foraminiferal δ18O and distinctive short-term δ18O cycles, possibly related to dynamic Antarctic ice sheet variability. In addition, the late Miocene carbon isotope shift (LMCIS) marks a permanent long-term –1 ‰ shift in oceanic δ13CDIC, which is the largest, long-term perturbation in the global marine carbon cycle since the mid Miocene Monterey excursion.\nAccurate age control is crucial to investigate the origin of the δ18O cyclicity and determine the precise onset of the LMCIS. The current Geological Time Scale in the 8-6 Ma interval is constructed using astronomical tuning of sedimentary cycles in Mediterranean outcrops. However, outside of the Mediterranean, a comparable high-resolution chemo-, magneto-, and cyclostratigraphy at a single DSDP/ODP/IODP site does not exist. Generating an accurate astronomically-calibrated chemo- and magneto-stratigraphy in the 8-6 Ma interval became possible with retrieval of equatorial Pacific IODP Sites U1337 and U1338, as both sites have sedimentation rates ~2 cm/kyr, high biogenic carbonate content, and magnetic polarity stratigraphies.\nHere we present high-resolution correlation of Sites U1337 and U1338 using Milankovitch-related cycles in core images and X-ray fluorescence core scanning data. By combining inclination and declination data from ~400 new discrete samples with shipboard measurements, we are able to identify 14 polarity reversals at Site U1337 from the young end of Chron C3An.1n (~6.03 Ma) to the onset of Chron C4n.2n (~8.11 Ma). New high-resolution (<1.5 kyr) stable isotope records from Site U1337 correlate highly with Site U1338 records, enabling construction of a high-resolution stack. Initial orbital tuning of the U1337-U1338 records show that the δ18O cyclicity is obliquity driven, indicating high-latitude climate forcing. The LMCIS starts ~7.55 Ma and is anchored in Chron C4n.1n, which is comparable to the north and equatorial Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "The catchment representative root zone storage capacity (Sr), i.e. the plant available soil water, is an important parameter of hydrological systems. It does not only influence the runoff from catchments, by controlling the partitioning of water fluxes but it also influences the local climate, by providing the source for transpiration. Sr is difficult to observe at catchment scale, due to heterogeneities in vegetation and soils. Sr estimates are traditionally derived from soil characteristics and estimates of root depths. In contrast, a recently suggested method allows the determination of Sr based on climate data, i.e. precipitation and evaporation, alone (Gao et al., 2014). By doing so, the time-variable size of Sr, is explicitly accounted for, which is not the case for traditional soil based methods. The time-variable size of Sr  reflects root growth and thus the vegetation’s adaption to medium-term fluctuations in the climate. Thus, we tested and compared Sr  estimates from this 'climate based method' with estimates from soil data for 32 catchments in New Zealand. The results show a larger range in climate derived Sr than in soil derived Sr. Using a model experiment, we show that a model using the climate derived Sr is more accurately able to reproduce a set of hydrological regime signatures, in particular for humid catchments. For more arid catchments, the two methods provide similar model results. This implies that, although soil information has some predictive power for Sr, climate has a similar or greater control on Sr, as climate affects the evolving hydrological functioning of the root zone at the time scale of hydrological interest. In addition, Sr represents the plant available water and thus root surface, volume and density, and is therefore a more complete descriptor of vegetation influence on water fluxes than mere root depth. On balance, the results indicate that climate has a higher explanatory power than soils for catchment representative Sr.",

            "abstract": "In Taiwan two subduction zones (Manila trench and Ryukyu trench) come together in a quasi-orthogonal, kinematically stable configuration. Subduction is ongoing in both trenches, even though the tectonic setting in the Manila trench is that of an arc-continent collision. The upper crust of Eurasia (EU) is decoupled from the rest of the lithosphere by a detachment horizon, which is the main subduction interface between EU and Philippine Sea plate (PSP). The interface is visible in both seismicity and crustal tomography at shallow depths, and it can be followed into the mantle to 450-500 km depth with global tomography. Shortening across the plate boundary is accomplished by a combination of subduction of EU lithosphere, folding and thrusting in the Eurasian upper crust, and a secondary subduction zone within the PSP. We hypothesize that: (1) once arc-continent collision occurs, subduction of Eurasian continental lower crust and upper mantle can continue by lithospheric delamination and by continuity with the much larger Eurasian slab to the south; (2) the upper crust of EU deforms by faulting and folding; (3) the present convergence rate of about 90 mm/yr is limited at most to the last 2 Ma, whereas the long-term rate is about 30 mm/yr and in Taiwan the difference is being taken up by secondary subduction within the PSP margin; (4) a margin-parallel STEP (Subduction-Transform-Edge-Propagator) fault forms the northern limit of Eurasian subduction, which allows the whole system to propagate self-similarly southwestward. No slab breakoff is required for the kinematics of the margin, and none is observed in geophysical or geological data either. This kinematics is consistent with geologic observations: from timing of opening of the southern Okinawa trough, to geometry of geologic boundaries within the Taiwan mountain belt, to geographic distribution, geochemical character, and timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Taiwan volcanic zone. We constrained the long-term convergence rate by combining tomographic images with data from foreland basin migration in western Taiwan.",

Problematically, once in the natural environment, NPs can have a wide range of toxic effects. To protect groundwater from detrimental NPs we must be able to predict nanoparticle movement within the aquifer. The often complex transport behavior of nanoparticles ensures the development of NP transport models is not a simple task. To enhance our understanding of NP transport processes, we utilize novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which enables us to look inside the rock and image the movement of nanoparticles within. For this, we use nanoparticles that are paramagnetic, making them visible to the MRI and enabling us to collect spatially resolved data from which we can develop more robust transport models.\nIn this work, a core of Bentheimer sandstone (3 x 7 cm) was saturated with water and imaged inside a 7Tesla Bruker Biospec MRI. Firstly the porosity of the core was mapped using a MSME MRI sequence. Prior to imaging NP transport, the velocity of water (in absence on nanoparticles) was mapped using an APGSTE-RARE sequence. Nano-magnetite nanoparticles were then pumped into the core and their transport through the core was imaged using a RARE sequence. These images were calibrated using T2 parameter maps to provide fully quantitative maps of nanoparticle concentration at regular time intervals throughout the column (T2 being the spin-spin relaxation time of 1H nuclei). This work demonstrated we are able to spatially resolve porosity, water velocity and nanoparticle movement, inside rock, using a single technique (MRI). Significantly, this provides us with a unique and powerful dataset from which we are now developing new models of nanoparticle transport.",

            "abstract": "Lake Tanganyika, in western Tanzania, spans a large section of the Western rift yet there are very few constraints on bulk crustal and upper mantle structure. The Western rift system has no surface expression of magmatism, which is in stark contrast to the Eastern branch. This observation is difficult to reconcile with the approximately coeval initiation of rifting of the two branches. The variation in the nature of rifting provides a perfect setting to test current hypotheses for the initiation of continental breakup and early-stage development of continental rifts. The deployment of a seismic network of 13 broadband instruments on the south eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, for 16 months, between 2014 and 2015 provides a unique opportunity to investigate extensional processes in thick continental lithosphere. We present here results from a P to S receiver function study that provides information on bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratio along the rift; a property that is sensitive to the presence of magmatic intrusions in the lower crust. Additionally this method allows us to map variations in crustal thickness both parallel and perpendicular to the rift axis. These results thus provide unprecedented insight into the large-scale mechanics of early-stage continental rifting along the non-volcanic Western rift.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms in subduction zones are likely to be related with slow slip events (SSEs) and locking on the plate interface. In the Boso-Oki region in central Japan, swarms repeatedly occur accompanying SSEs (e.g, Hirose et al., 2012). It is pointed out that ruptures of great earthquakes tend to terminate in regions with recurring swarm activity because of reduced and heterogeneous locking there (Holtkamp and Brudzinsiki, 2014). Given these observations, we may be able to infer aseismic slips and spatial variations in locking on the plate interface by investigating swarm activity in subduction zones.\nIt is known that swarms do not follow Omori’s law and have much higher seismicity rates than predicted by the ETAS model (e.g., Llenos et al., 2009). Here, we devised a statistical method to detect unexpectedly frequent earthquakes using the space-time ETAS model (Zhuang et al., 2002). We applied this method to subduction zones around Japan (Tohoku, Ibaraki-Boso-oki, Hokkaido, Izu, Tonankai, Nankai, and Kyushu) and detected swarms in JMA catalog (M ≥ 3) from 2001 to 2010.\nWe detected recurring swarm activities as expected in the Boso-Oki region and also in the Ibaraki-Oki region (see Figures), where intensive foreshock activity was found by Maeda and Hirose (2011). In Tohoku, regions with intensive foreshock activity also appear to roughly correspond to regions with recurring swarm activity. Given that both foreshocks and swarms are triggered by SSEs (e.g., Bouchon et al., 2013), these results suggest that the regions with foreshock activity and swarm activity such as the Ibaraki-Oki region are characterized by extensive occurrences of SSEs just like the Boso-Oki region. Besides Ibaraki-Oki and Boso-Oki, we detected many swarms in Tohoku, Hokkaido, Izu, and Kyushu. On the other hand, swarms are rare in the rupture areas of the 1944 Tonankai and 1946 Nankai earthquakes. These variations in swarm activity may reflect variations in SSE activity among subduction zones.\nFigures show hypocenters of swarms (left) and ratio of the number of swarm events to all events near each point (< 30km) in Ibaraki-Boso-oki (right). In the right figure, red and black colors mean regions with intensive swarm activity.",

This monsoon system comprises smaller regional components, including the Indian monsoon and East Asian monsoon. These components are linked to one another through large scale circulation. The impacts of rapidly increasing anthropogenic aerosols over Asia on the monsoon have been widely studied. However, most studies consider only regional impacts, and not the subsequent effects on other geographical components of the system. We use observational and modelling methods to investigate the links between the regional components of the Asian monsoon and how they are affected by aerosols. Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth are used in conjunction with precipitation and atmospheric reanalysis data to investigate the problem at interannual timescales. Modelling experiments using HadGEM2-ES and GFDL CM3 are used to look at longer timescales and the potential influence of long term feedbacks. The HadGEM2 experiments use three time-evolving future anthropogenic aerosol emissions scenarios with the same time-evolving greenhouse gases. The GFDL CM3 experiments are forced by historical regional anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Using these methods, we look at the separate impact that South and East Asian aerosols have on monsoon onset and withdrawal. We focus on impacts in regions non-local to the aerosol source. We will also present proposed mechanisms for the apparent effects based on analysis of large scale circulation and atmospheric heating.",

The mean and 99th percentile concentrations of OC and EC were 2.0±1.4μg/m3, 6.7μg/m3, 0.7±0.5μg/m3, and 2.6μg/m3, respectively. Most of higher concentrations were observed upon haze incident. For haze events, the mean and 90th percentile concentrations of OC and EC were 4.0±3.0μg/m3, 6.9μg/m3, 1.5±0.9μg/m3, and 2.7μg/m3, respectively. In particular, the OC to EC ratio and their correlation was different from season to season. While the correlation was the best in winter from Dec. to Feb. (r=0.9), the ratio of OC to EC was the highest (3.2) in fall from Oct. to Nov. These results suggest OC and EC are robust indicator for haze occurrence and deliver its source signature that is different in each season.",

            "abstract": "Explosive activity at Stromboli (Italy), believed to be caused by the burst of gas pockets through a shallow lava surface in the volcanic conduit, can be classified by the frequency and the amount and size of pyroclasts ejected into the atmosphere. While frequent (>1000 per hour), weak gas bursts (usually without the ejection of pyroclasts) define puffing activity, classical Strombolian explosions (1-10 per hour) can either erupt dominantly lapilli- to bomb-sized pyroclasts at initial velocities up to 400 m/s or be ash-rich. The latter are usually less energetic, and occur at less active vents.\nTo better constrain the controls on the different eruption styles, we collected a large database of thermal infrared and visible-light highspeed videos representative of twelve vents over three field campaigns in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Puffing occurred in eight cases, at rates between 0.4 and 1.5 Hz, ejection velocities of ~10 m/s, and temperature anomalies from 1 to 500K. In two cases, the puffing activity was associated with the ejection of pyroclasts at intermediate velocities (15–30 m/s). Strombolian explosions occurred in six cases, two of them simultaneously presenting a puffing activity, at rates never exceeding 10 per hour and ejection velocities up to 200 m/s.\nIn some cases, transient phenomena preceded the classical Strombolian explosions by 1 to 10 seconds. Before ash-rich explosions, both inflation of the visible vent surface and the release of hot gas at the center or the edge of the crater can be observed. Ash-poor classical explosions that occur on persistently puffing vents are preceded by a significant increase in the volume and the apparent temperature of the gas pockets. We relate these observations in both cases to the presence of a high-viscosity plug at the top of the magma column, which modulates the rise, accumulation, and release of the gas pockets. We hypothesize that the contrasts between the various kinds of Strombolian explosions and their associated precursors may arise by the thickness and nature of the plug.",

            "abstract": "The development of the Himalayan orogen induced a major change in continental distribution, topography and climate that impacted the global biogeochemical cycles. The development of the highest mountain range coupled to the intense monsoonal precipitation regime generated an intense erosional flux that enhanced both organic carbon burial and silicate weathering. The largest part of the sediment flux was exported to the Bengal Fan, accumulating a long-term archive of this erosion. These sediments record the nature of eroded formations in the Himalaya and allow the documentation of weathering as well as organic carbon fluxes.\nIn February-March 2015, IODP Expedition 354 drilled an E-W transect in the middle fan at 8°N to investigate interactions between the growth of the Himalaya, the development of the Indian monsoon, and processes affecting the carbon cycle. This expedition obtained a comprehensive record of turbiditic deposition since the Late Oligocene. Shipboard results reveal that the chemical and mineralogical compositions of turbiditic sediments cored across the transect are relatively stable throughout the Neogene. They reveal a weak regime of chemical weathering with no significant variation through time. This differs from the distal fan record (Leg 116) where from ~7 to 1 Ma, weathered and smectite rich sediments dominated. This difference implies that the distal fan record is not related to a direct evolution of the erosion regime but rather is controlled by a change in sediment transport within the fan. Shipboard estimates of organic carbon loading and behavior resemble observations made in the modern Ganga-Brahmaputra river sediments, suggesting efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial in the Bengal Fan [1]. Preliminary observations support the idea that Himalayan erosion has consumed atmospheric CO2 through the burial of organic carbon, more than by silicate weathering.\n[1] http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06273",

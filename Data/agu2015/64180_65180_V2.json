The ICME onset is observed on October 17th 2014 at 23:00, closely coinciding with the arrival of Comet Siding Spring, and is followed by a compression of the magnetosheath and ionosphere. After the apparent passage of the ICME, on October 18th at 09:00 the magnetosheath drastically expands relative to nominal conditions prior to the ICME arrival. Data availability is only limited during the expansion phase of Mars’ ionospheric environment. These phenomena have been previously observed using MEX data (e.g. Opgenoorth et al., 2013 and Dubini et al., 2009), which also show an increase of ion outflow from the upper atmosphere. We will use MAVEN data, together with its high resolution and magnetic field measurements, to expand upon these results.",

            "abstract": "We will discuss oxidation capacity in the boundary layer of the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) by analyzing a comprehensive field observational datasets of trace gases, radicals, and radical precursors. Two intensive field observations will be discussed. From mid-May to mid-June of 2015, we conducted a field observation in the middle of Seoul, representing a region with high anthropogenic emissions and photochemistry near the source region. We deployed an identical suite of instrumentation (i.e., CO, NOX, O3, SO2, VOCs, ClNO2, HONO, and PANs) at Taehwa Research Forest (TRF), ~ 50 km from the center of Seoul in early September of 2015. The site has been characterized as an ideal region in probing roles of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) in a moderately polluted regional background. Therefore, the comparisons between two datasets will allow us to assess regional oxidation capacity of a megacity surrounded by forests, which is a typical set-up in the East Asian region. The main focus of the discussion was to investigate the following: (i) relative impact of nighttime radical reservoirs (i.e., HONO and ClNO2) in the morning radical budget in the urban and suburban environments and (ii) relative importance of unconstrained primary and recycling (e.g., BVOC oxidation) OH production at the isoprene dominated TRF region. An observationally constrained box model with detailed VOC chemical oxidation schemes (e.g., MCM) will be used for the comprehensive evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural land use change substantially affects terrestrial water and carbon cycles, and it is also significant for food security. Rice is an important food crop in South Korea, and its planting area has changed over the past years due to climate change and social development. However, the paddy rice maps in South Korea with high spatial, temporal resolutions and quality are still unavailable. In this study, annual paddy rice planting areas in South Korea during 2001-2015 were extracted using the phenology-based and artificial neural networks(ANN)-based method according to the availability of Landsat images. Three types of vegetation indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), were calculated for both methods. For the phenology-based method, we calculated difference and ratio of the vegetation indices from the Landsat images before and after the inundating/transplanting phase, and set the extraction thresholds for rice paddy using the training samples. For the ANN-based method, using the vegetation indices of the Landsat image after inundation, slope and soil type data of the training samples as input, an ANN was established for rice paddy identification. The resultant maps of paddy rice were evaluated using validation samples and agricultural statistics. Finally, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of South Korea's rice paddy during 2001-2015, and investigated the possible reasons.",

            "abstract": "The Shikoku Basin is a back arc basin located westside of the Izu-Ogasawara (Bonin) arc, spreading was from 25 to 15 Ma. The drilling of the DSDP, ODP and IODP recovered the backarc basin basalt (BABB) of the Shikoku Basin. Site C0012, south of the Kii Peninsula, was operated during the IODP Exp 333, and BABB was recovered 100m thickness under the 520m of sediment. This BABB is divided into upper aphyric pillow (Unit 1) and lower massive flow (Unit 2) divided at the 560 mbsf, and show variable degree of alteration, clay mineral and zeolite depositions. SiO2 and MgO contents of these basalts are 47-55 and 5-8 wt%. These basalts show wide variation of enrichment of alkali elements, 2.3-7.5 and 0.4-4.2 wt% of Na2O and K2O. Na2O+K2O contents show 3.2-8.0 wt%, and 2 wt% higher trends than other BABBs in the Shikoku Basin at the same SiO2 contents. Na2O and K2O show proportional and anti-proportional trends with increasing LOI. Therefore, both alkali element enrichments in these rocks are caused by secondary mineralization, and host phase of Na2O is hydrous and that of K2O is anhydrous minerals.\nSecondary mineral phases was mainly identified by XRD. The identified host phases of Na are analcime and thomsonite. Analcime is observed in rocks of more than 4 wt% of Na2O. Chlorite and smectite are identified to clay minerals. This mineral assemblage indicates the high-temperature zeolite facies alteration. The host phases of K are mainly identified into K-feldspar. We assume that secondary mineralization of K-fd is associated with low-temperature albitization.\nCompared to the lithostratigraphy, the Na enrichment is prominent in the Unit 1 and upper 20 m of the Unit 2, and the K enrichment is prominent in lower part of the Unit 2. We consider that the Na enrichment associated with zeolite depositions occurred under high water/rock ratio with active hydrothermal circulation because of high water permeability of pillow lava, and K enrichment associated with albitization occurred under low water/rock ratio with circulation of restricted water because of low water permeability of massive flow. The recent hydrothermal activities in the backarc basin are reported from the Manus Basin. We assume that the hydrothermal circulation was active during the spreading of the Shikoku Basin, and drilled the ancient hydrothermal area at the Site C0012.",

            "abstract": "The Yellow River flows through nine provinces and provides water for 30% of China’s population. It is the largest sandy river in the world and its annual transport capacity is about 1.6 billion tons. Water availability and soil erosion in this basin have continuously obtained great concern. The upper Yellow River basin (UYRB) above the Tangnaihai hydrological station contributes over one-third water discharge to the entire Yellow River basin. This contribution and hydrological regime may have been substantially altered over the past decades due to climate change and human activities. Understanding the streamflow regime and sediment transport in the UYRB, especially in the context of climate change, is crucial for sustainable water resource management and soil-water conservation.\nIn this study, we attempt to quantify the responses of water and sediment discharge to climate change in the UYRB. We employed a distributed hydrological model, i.e., the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to simulate the runoff and sediment load under different scenarios, including climate change and detrended climate conditions. To predict the future trend, we designed scenarios with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) down scaled forcing data.\nThe results indicate that the SWAT model successfully reproduced the historical patterns of water and sediment dischargewith calibration and validation. As a response to the decreased precipitation and increased temperature during 1966-2009, annual runoff and sediment load have significantly decreased with the trends of -11.6 mm/decade and -1.3 million ton/decade, respectively. But precipitation plays a dominate role in reshaping these trends, with the contribution over four times larger than that of temperature. In the near future (2049-2064), however, runoff and sediment load wouldrise to some degree. Especially in the A2 scenario, runoff and sediment load exceed more than double in summer relative to current climate conditions. This may be a good news for water availability but bad news for water-quality control for the entire Yellow River basin.",

            "abstract": "Calderas are among the most active and dangerous volcanoes. Caldera unrest is defined by enhanced seismicity, gravity changes, surface deformation and degassing. Although much caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, every eruption is preceded by an unrest episode. Therefore, the proper description of unrest and the forecast of its possible outcome is a timely and challenging task. Here we review the best known unrest at calderas from 1988 to 2014, building on previous work and propose an updated database. Where established, the root cause for unrest is always magmatic; none was purely hydrothermal or tectonic. An interpretive classification of unrest invokes two spectra – compositional (mafic to felsic) and the state of magma conduits feeding from the magma reservoir(s) to the surface (from fully plugged, through semi-plugged, to open). Magma and gas in open conduits can rise and erupt freely; magma in semi-plugged conduits erupts less frequently, yet still allows some gas to escape; plugged conduits allow neither magma nor gas to escape. Unrest in mafic calderas is subtler, less pronounced and repeated, especially with open systems, ensuring the continuous, aseismic and moderate release of magma. Plugged felsic calderas erupt infrequently, anticipated by isolated, short and seismically active unrest. Semi-plugged felsic calderas also erupt infrequently and are restless over decades or centuries, with uplift, seismicity and degassing and, on the longer-term, resurgence, suggesting repeated stalled intrusions. Finally, the expected advances in better understanding caldera unrest are discussed.",

            "abstract": "A large amount of radioactivity was discharged by the accident of FDNPP. The long half-life radionuclide, 137Cs was transported through the atmosphere mainly as the aerosol form and deposited to the forests in Fukushima prefecture. After the dry deposition of the 137Cs, the foliar uptake process would occur. To evaluate environmental transfer of radionuclides, the dry deposition and following foliar uptake is very important. There are some pioneering studies for radionuclide foliar uptake with attaching the solution containing stable target element on the leaf, however, cesium oxide aerosols were used for these deposition study [1]. In the FDNPP case, 137Cs was transported in sulfate aerosol form [2], so the oxide aerosol behaviors could not represent the actual deposition behavior in this accident. For evaluation of whole behavior of 137Cs in vegetation system, fundamental data for deposition and uptake process of sulfate aerosol was desired. In this study, we developed aerosol generation system for simulating the dry deposition and the foliar uptake behaviors of aerosol in the different chemical constitutions. In this system, the method of aerosol generation based on the spray drying. Solution contained 137Cs was send to a nozzle by a syringe pump and spraying with a high speed air flow. The sprayed mist was generated in a chamber in the relatively high temperature. The solution in the mist was dried quickly, and micro size solid aerosols consisting 137Cs were generated. The aerosols were suctioned by an ejector and transported inside a tube by the dry air flow, then were directly blown onto the leaves. The experimental condition, such as the size of chamber, chamber temperature, solution flow rate, air flow rate and so on, were optimized. In the deposition experiment, the aerosols on leaves were observed by a SEM/EDX system and the deposition amount was evaluated by measuring the stable Cs remaining on leaf. In the presentation, we will discuss the detail results of aerosol deposition behavior using the developed system.\n[1]C.Madoz-Escande, et al., Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, 73 pp49-71, (2004)\n[2] N.

            "abstract": "We have developed a low-power, surface towed electric dipole-dipole system suitable for mapping seafloor geology in shallow water and deployable from small boats. The transmitter is capable of up to 50 amps output using 12 VDC from a 110/240 VAC power supply, and can generate an arbitrary GPS stabilized ternary waveform. Transmitter antennas are typically 50 to 100 m long. Receivers are built around the standard Scripps seafloor electrode, amplifier, and logging systems but housed in floating PVC cases and equipped with GPS timing and positioning, pitch/roll/heading sensors, and accelerometers. Receiver dipoles are 1.5 m long rigid booms held 1 m below the surface. As with the Scripps deep-towed Vulcan system, rigid antennas are used to avoid noise associated with flexible antennas moving across Earth's magnetic field. The tow cable is a simple floating rope up to 1000 m long. Water depth and conductivity are sampled continuously in order to provide constraints for apparent resistivity calculations and inversion, and moored seafloor recorders can be used to extend transmitter/receiver offsets. The entire system can be air freighted and transported in one utility vehicle. We will present results from a study to map permafrost in shallow water off Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.",

            "abstract": "From 2009 to 2014, more than 300 water samples of 52 sites from the five lakes and seven inflow rivers of Yumzhog Yumco Basin, South Tibet have been collected, and the hydrochemical types, sources of ions, and the spatial-temporal variation in waters analyzed annually. The basin waters are slightly saline or fresh because of the different sources of water replenishment, and are hardest water with weak alkalinity. The hydrochemical types of Yamzhog Yum Co, Puma Yum Co, Bajiu Co, Kongmu Co, and Chen Co are SO42--HCO3--Mg2+-Na+, HCO3--SO42--Mg2+, SO42--Mg2+-Na+, SO42--HCO3--Ca2+, and SO42--Na+-Mg2+-Ca2+, respectively. As for rivers, HCO3- together with SO42- is the major anion, and Ca2+ is the dominant cation. The weathering of evaporites and carbonatites, along with the evaporation-crystallization plays a significant role in the difference of hydrochemical compositions. In addition, anthropogenic impacts, such as the rapid tourism development and the utilization of Yamzhog Yumco hydropower should not be ignored. Compared with the salinity in 1984, Puma Yum Co has been desalinated obviously during 2009-2014 as a result of the accelerated glacier melt caused by the global warming. Furthermore, the Cl- concentration has decreased consequently with the increased evaporation from 2009 to 2014. Yamzhog Yum Co, the largest lake in this basin with a complex zigzag bank and a different inflow river system, exhibits remarkable spatial variation for its surface waters. The mineralization degree, and the concentration of Mg2+ and (Na++K+) are low with high concentration of Ca2+ in the river mouth entering into Yamzhog Yum Co. Moreover, the irregular changes in vertical direction can be attributed to the strong wind and comparatively abundant rainfall during the sampling period. To sum up, the combined impacts of environmental changes and human activities can account for the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of hydrochemical characteristics in Yamzhog Yumco Basin.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have argued that the extreme precipitation intensities are increasing in many regions across the globe due to atmospheric warming. This argument is based on the principle of Clausius-Clapeyron relationship which states that the atmosphere can hold more moisture in warmer air temperature (~7%/°C). In our study, we have investigated the precipitation extremes linked to temperature in current climate (1981-2000) and their projected changes in late 21st century (2081-2100, RCP4.5) over Japan from multi-model ensemble downscaling experiments by three RCMs (NHRCM, NRAMS, WRF) forced by JRA25 as well as three GCMs (CCSM4, MIROC5, MRI-GCM3). To do this, the precipitation intensities of wet days (defined as ≥ 0.05 mm/d) are stratified to different bins with 1°C temperature interval. We have also identified the occurrences of precipitation extremes in different spell durations and associated peak intensities exceeding various thresholds in two climate periods. We found that extreme precipitation intensities are increased by 5 mm/d in future climate for temperatures above 21°C (Fig. 1). Precipitation extremes of higher percentiles are projected to have larger increase rates in future climate scenarios (3-5%/°C in the current climate and 4-6%/°C in the future climate scenarios). The joint probability distribution of wet hours (≥1mm/h) with various peak intensities under future climate scenarios (RCP4.5) of the late 21st century suggests an increase of long-lived (>10hr) and short-lived (1-2hr) events. On the other hand, a relatively decrease of medium-lived events (3-10hr) are noticed in future climate scenario. The increase of extreme precipitation intensities in future climate is due to the increase in temperature under RCP4.5 (~2°C). Increase in temperature causes more evapotranspiration and subsequently increases the water vapor in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "This paper synthesizes currently available data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from African natural and agricultural lands, outlines the knowledge gaps and suggests future directions and strategies for GHG emission studies. GHG emission data were collected from 42 studies conducted in 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Soil GHG emissions from African natural terrestrial systems ranged from 3.3 to 57.0 Mg carbon dioxide (CO2) ha–1 y–1, -4.8 to 3.5 kg methane (CH4) ha–1 y–1 and -0.1 to 13.7 kg nitrous oxide (N2O) ha–1 y–1. Soil physical and chemical properties, rewetting, vegetation type, forest management and land-use changes were all found to be important factors affecting soil GHG emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from African aquatic systems ranged from 5.7 to 232.0 Mg CO2 ha–1 y–1, -26.3 to 2741.9 kg CH4 ha–1 y–1 and 0.2 to 3.5 kg N2O ha–1 y–1 and were strongly affected by amount of discharge. Soil GHG emissions from African croplands ranged from 1.7 to 141.2 Mg CO2 ha–1 y–1, -1.3 to 66.7 kg CH4 ha–1 y–1 and 0.05 to 112.0 kg N2O ha–1 y–1 and N2O emission factor (EF) ranged from 0.01 to 4.1%. Soil GHG emissions in vegetable gardens ranged from 73.3 to 132.0 Mg CO2 ha–1 y–1 and 53.4 to 177.6 kg N2O ha–1 y–1 and N2O EFs ranged from 3 to 4%. Throughout agricultural lands, N2O emissions slowly increased with N inputs below 150 kg N ha–1 y–1 and exponentially with N application rates up to 300 kg N ha–1 y–1. The lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions were reported with N application rates ranging between 100 and 150 kg N ha–1. Overall, total CO2 eq. emissions in African natural and agricultural lands were 56.9 ± 12.7 Pg CO2 eq. y–1 and natural and agricultural lands contribute 76.3% and 23.7%, respectively. Additional GHG emission measurements throughout Africa agricultural and natural lands are urgently required to quantify annual GHG emissions and identify major control factors and mitigation options on emissions.",

            "abstract": "Mount Meager is a strato-volcano massif in the Northern Cascade Volcanic Arc (Canada) that erupted in 2350 BP, the most recent in Canada. To study the stability of the Massif an international research project between France ( Blaise Pascal University), Italy (University of Turin) and Canada (Simon Fraser University) and private companies (TRE - sensing the planet) has been created. A complex history of glacial loading and unloading, combined with weak, hydrothermally altered rocks has resulted in a long record of catastrophic landslides. The most recent, in 2010 is the third largest (50 x 106 m3) historical landslide in Canada. Mount Meager is a perfect natural laboratory for gravity and topographic processes such as landslide activity, permafrost and glacial dynamics, erosion, alteration and uplift on volcanoes. Research is aided by a rich archive of aerial photos of the Massif (1940s up to 2006): complete coverage approximately every 10 years. This data set has been processed and multi-temporal, high resolution Orthophoto and DSMs (Digital Surface Models) have been produced. On these digital products, with the support on field work, glacial retreat and landslide activity have been tracked and mapped. This has allowed for the inventory of unstable areas, the identification of lava flows and domes, and the general improvement on the geologic knowledge of the massif. InSAR data have been used to monitor the deformation of the pre-2010 failure slope. It will also be used to monitor other unstable slopes that potentially can evolve to catastrophic collapses of up to 1 km3 in volume, endangering local communities downstream the volcano. Mount Meager is definitively an exceptional site for studying the dynamics of a glaciated, uplifted volcano. The methodologies proposed can be applied to other volcanic areas with high erosion rates such as Alaska, Cascades, and the Andes.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost soils store twice as much carbon (C) as is contained in the atmosphere and about one-third of global soil C. Under a warmer future climate, permafrost is expected to thaw and decompose, releasing C to the atmosphere, further amplifying global warming. However, studies show that warmer arctic temperatures promote plant growth, in addition to stimulating losses from the soil C pool. Using delta 13C of ecosystem respiration (Reco) during the seasonal cycle of active layer thaw, we seek to understand the effect of permafrost thaw on the relative contributions from microbial decomposition of soil C and more recently fixed, plant-dominated C.\nWe measured weekly CO2 flux rates and delta 13C of Reco from experimentally warmed plots with rapid permafrost thaw and control thaw. Vegetation removal plots, in un-warmed tundra, were monitored to isolate the seasonal contributions from soil alone. We expected delta 13C to be dominated by plant activity in vegetated plots, particularly in areas with greater permafrost thaw because they have highest plant biomass. In vegetation removal plots we expected to see greater contribution from deep soil as seasonal thaw progressed.\nFrom May to July delta 13C was extremely variable early in the growing season, but became more uniform as vegetation greened and thaw deepened. In vegetated plots CO2 fluxes doubled, but remained constant in vegetation removal plots. This indicates that, with thaw, microbes had access to a more spatially uniform C substrate, but this had little effect on the magnitude of CO2 flux. Overall delta 13C in rapidly thawed plots was least enriched (-29.4 ‰), control plots intermediate (-28.9 ‰), and vegetation removal plots were most enriched (-28.5 ‰). This suggests that in vegetation removal plots microbes used more decomposed soil C as substrate, and much of the increase in CO2 flux in vegetated plots was the result of C recently fixed and contributed by plants.",

            "abstract": "Carbon isotope ratios of soil/paleosol organic matter (δ13CSOM) have been used to reconstruct abundance of C3-C4 plants survived in the landscape as the δ13C value of C3 (-27‰) and C4 (-12.5 ‰) plants are distinctly different. In an attempt to reconstruct the abundance of C3 and C4 plants, δ13CSOM have been measured from three soil profiles developed on flood plain of the Gangetic plain, Mohanpur, West Bengal, India. Satellite images reveal that the investigated sediments have been deposited in an oxbow lake setting of the river Ganges. The total organic carbon content of the profile ranges from 0.9% to 0.1%. The δ13CSOM values mostly range from -19.2‰ to -22‰ except a rapid positive excursions of ~5‰ at 1.5 m depth showing enriched value (-14.2‰) in all the three profiles. Based on mass balance calculation using the δ13C values of C3 and C4 plants, the δ13CSOM in the Gangetic plain indicate presence of both C3 and C4 plants in the floodplain. However, characterization of alkanes separated from lipids extracted from the same soil organic matter reveals dominant preferences in short carbon chain (C14, C16, C18, C20) with a little preferences for higher chain (C29, C31, C33). Interestingly, n-alkanes at 1.5 m depth shows very high concentration in short chain n-alkanes. Since the lower chain n-alkane represents aquatic productivity or intense bacterial decomposition and higher chain indicates the contribution from C3-C4 plants, the data from the investigated sedimentary profile shows contribution mostly from aquatic vegetation with a little contribution from terrestrial plants. This implies that before using bulk δ13CSOM value for reconstruction of C3-C4 plants from soil/paleosol, characterization (molecular level) of soil organic matter is required",

            "abstract": "How large-scale, active strike-slip fault systems are defined can sometimes be ambiguous, especially when viewed at different timescales (geodetic vs longer term measurements). Does every kilometer of the fault system need to be visible in the morphology (offset geomorphic features, fault trace, etc) to be considered as currently active? Does every segment of the fault need to have a unique and consistent kinematics along the entire fault system (normal, strike-slip, reverse)? Does all segments need to be physically connected at the surface to be considered part of the same fault system? To illustrate our arguments against such statements, we use the example of the right-lateral strike-slip Karakorum fault, located in western Tibet, along which lively debates have been taking place in the last ~20 years. These concern its initiation age, total geologic offsets, slip-rates, and more recently, even the location and current activity of the northern half of the fault. In particular, whether the active Kongur Shan extensional system, located in the Chinese Pamir, belongs to the Karakorum fault system remains controversial. Here, we argue that both systems are connected and that they both play a significant role in accommodating deformation at the western Himalayan syntaxis, under the form of extensional displacement in the Chinese Pamir.

            "abstract": "The rapidly growing records of microwave based precipitation data made available from various earth observation satellites have instigated a pressing need towards evaluating the associated uncertainty which arise from different sources such as retrieval error, spatial/temporal sampling error and sensor dependent error. Pertaining to microwave remote sensing, most of the studies in literature focus on gridded data products, fewer studies exist on evaluating the uncertainty inherent in orbital data products. Evaluation of the latter are essential as they potentially cause large uncertainties during real time flood forecasting studies especially at the watershed scale. The present study evaluates the uncertainty of precipitation data derived from the orbital data products of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite namely the 2A12, 2A25 and 2B31 products. Case study results over the flood prone basin of Mahanadi, India, are analyzed for precipitation uncertainty through these three facets viz., a) Uncertainty quantification using the volumetric metrics from the contingency table [Aghakouchak and Mehran 2014] b) Error characterization using additive and multiplicative error models c) Error decomposition to identify systematic and random errors d) Comparative assessment with the orbital data from GPM mission. The homoscedastic random errors from multiplicative error models justify a better representation of precipitation estimates by the 2A12 algorithm. It can be concluded that although the radiometer derived 2A12 precipitation data is known to suffer from many sources of uncertainties, spatial analysis over the case study region of India testifies that they are in excellent agreement with the reference estimates for the data period considered [Indu and Kumar 2015].\n",

We have now developed protocols to enable electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in of fine-grained water ice with a very high (>95%) success rate and have quantified the microstructures of >50 confined medium experiments.\nThe indium jackets of many confined media experiments have an irregular rumpled surface after deformation. The “rumples” have wavelengths and amplitudes larger than the starting grain size. EBSD maps show anastomosing traces along which fine recrystallised grains are developed. The traces follow some of the original grain boundaries – the scale of connectivity of the network of recrystallized grains is on the scale of several grains (or larger) and broadly corresponds to the wavelength of the rumples on the jacket. In some samples the original grains are kinked and recrystallized grains occur along kink traces. In samples where such recrystallisation is well-developed, these bands contribute of the anastomosing network. Recrystallised grain size describes a broad piezometer relationship that is consistent with much coarser recrystallized grain sizes from higher temperature, lower stress unconfined experiments.\nWe suggest that the dynamic recrystallisation process is a mechanism that enables localization and weakening in ice. The high stress confined media experiments give some insight into processes that may occur in terrestrial ice sheets and cannot be accessed at natural conditions. Some preliminary modeling shows that a dynamic recrystallisation process is consistent with the magnitude of weakening on ice-stream margins in Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "We present in situ evidence for MHD-scale kink-mode waves propagating earthward in the Earth’s magnetotail. The event occurred on 11 October 2014 when the Geotail spacecraft, situated at the GSM position (–26, 9, 0) Re, observed earthward reconnection jets almost continuously for a few hours under stably southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions. The reconnection jets had a speed of ~700 km/s, comparable to the lobe Alfven speed, and concurred with quasi-periodic crossings of the tail current sheet with a period of 2-3 min. Two of the THEMIS spacecraft, located in the pre-midnight sector at X ~ –10 Re, observed no significant flows, and the cross-polar cap potential estimated from SuperDARN remained more than 50 kV and roughly constant, signatures expected for a steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) interval. The Grad-Shafranov reconstruction of the oscillatory current sheet indicates that kink-mode waves propagated roughly earthward, with a wavelength of ~15 Re and amplitude of order 1 Re. The ions observed off the center of the tail current sheet consisted of field-aligned ion beams and cold lobe ions, characteristic of the plasma sheet boundary layer, which led to parallel ion temperature being higher than the perpendicular temperature. We interpret the observed kink-mode waves as being due to the streaming kink instability (SKI) excited in the reconnection jet and in the presence of temperature anisotropy. Since the SKI can generate Alfvénic waves or turbulence, the observed field fluctuations may be an energy source for auroral activities during SMC intervals. Our observations show that the tail plasma sheet can be dynamic even under a globally steady magnetospheric condition.",

This study aims to investigate the performance of various cover systems and designs for the North Waste Rock Storage Area in Kışladağ Gold Mine located in Uşak in Western Turkey. SEEP/W and VADOSE/W softwares are used to model the flow in unsaturated and saturated zones and to assess the performance of various cover systems. The soil water characteristics and parameters used in the model for saturated and unsaturated conditions were taken from field tests and literature. Accuracy of input data is checked during calibration for steady state conditions with SEEP/W. Then, bedrock, waste rock and cover alternatives are modeled under transient conditions for 20 years using daily climatic data. The effectiveness of the various cover systems for minimizing the ingress of water and air that cause acid rock drainage is evaluated and recommendations are made so that the impacts to groundwater from the waste rock storage areas during closure period are minimized.",

            "abstract": "River flow can show strong disparity with meteorological conditions; precipitation events do not necessarily lead to streamflow response, while in many cases rivers continue to flow in periods without precipitation. Although water storage is an obvious explanatory factor, it remains difficult to decipher the role of water storage for streamflow conditions across a diverse set of catchments. Here, we use data from several hundred catchments located in different climatic regions and show how water storage strongly controls hydrologic extremes on both ends of the flow spectrum. For high flow conditions the majority of the study catchments depend on antecedent wetness conditions to generate annual maximum flows, leading to distinct regional patterns in the seasonality of annual maximum flow conditions. For low flow conditions, evaporation-dominated storage depletion postpones annual low flow conditions by several weeks to months, and depending on the sensitivity of streamflow to water storage changes, the inter-annual variability of low flow conditions can vary orders of magnitude between places. The resulting process understanding of floods and low flow conditions can improve the prediction of streamflow and identify those regions where hydrologic regimes are most sensitive to short and long-term perturbations of water storage.",

We use remote seismic and infrasound sensors to reconstruct the eruptive sequence. The first explosions were relatively weak seismic and infrasound events. A major stratospheric ash injection occurred a few minutes later and produced long-lasting atmospheric and ground-coupled acoustic waves that were detected as far as 11,000 km by infrasound sensors, and up to 2,300 km away on seismometers. A seismic event followed ~12 minutes later and was recorded 7,000 km away by seismometers. We estimate a volcanic intensity [Pyle,2000] around 10.9, placing the 2014 Kelud eruption between the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1991 Pinatubo eruptions intensities. We demonstrate how remote infrasound and seismic sensors are critical for the early detection of volcanic explosions, and how they can help to constrain and understand eruptive sequences.",

As the most populous country in the world, China has been experiencing a remarkable urbanization process since the initialization of the reform and opening-up policies in the late 1970s. During the past several decades, the coastal zone undergone the highest urbanization and motst rapid economic development in China. Accurately understanding the characteristics of the spatial-temporal urban sprawl is helpful for urban planning on optimal land use in the future. Ocelet is an interactive visual interpretation and dynamic coding method that has been designed for studying issues related to space, time and multiple scales that are raised when dynamic landscapes are modelled. Using Ocelet, we aim to study the characteristics of the spatial-temporal urban sprawl in thirteen major Chinese coastal cities and how urban sprawl affects the surrounding land changes. Landsat MSS/TM/ETM/OLI, the China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) and Chinese HJ-1A data are adopted to acquire urban built-up areas and their dynamic changes from 1979 to 2013. The results show that the urban built-up area increased gradually from 1979 to 2002 (~105 km²/yr), then accelerated about four times from 2002 to 2010 (~396 km²/yr) in thirteen major Chinese coastal cities. Although the expansion slowed down since 2010, the urban built-up area still increased at a fairly high rate (~210 km²/yr) from 2010 to 2013. The urban sprawl speed and pattern in each coastal city has also been analyzed, and has been grouped in three costal zones geographically. As a result of urban sprawl, large areas of arable land, rural settlements and forests were lost in these coastal cities. The lost non-urban land types and areas are different in the three costal zones and quantified respectively.",

            "abstract": "After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FD1NPS) accident on March 11, 2011, many datasets have been available of deposition density of radionuclides in soils in eastern Japan. By contrast, no time-series data of atmospheric radionuclides has been measured in the Fukushima prefecture (FP), although very limited data is available in the Tokyo metropolitan area (TMA) located more than 170 km southwest of the FD1NPS. As a result, atmospheric transport models simulating the atmospheric concentrations and surface deposition of radionuclides have large uncertainty, as well as the estimate of release rate of source terms and of internal exposure from inhalation. One year after the accident, we collected the used filter-tapes installed in Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) monitors with beta-ray attenuation method operated by local governments in the air pollution monitoring network of eastern Japan. By measuring radionuclides in SPM on the filter-tapes, we retrieved hourly atmospheric Cs-134 and Cs-137 concentrations during March 12-23, 2011, when atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial environments were seriously suffered in most of eastern Japan. Until now, we measured hourly radiocesium at around 100 SPM sites in the southern Tohoku region (ST) including the FP and in the TMA. By analysing the dataset, nine major plumes with Cs-137 concentrations higher than 10 Bq m-3 were found, and some plumes were newly found in this study. A local area of relatively high Cs-137 deposition density in the TMA by precipitation on the morning of March 21, was consistent with an area where the time-integrated atmospheric Cs-137 concentrations were also high due to the transport of a plume on the morning of March 21. In the FP, however, the correlation was not so clear. High radionuclides trapped in a cloud layer might be transported to the ST with relatively high Cs-137 deposition densities, because the atmospheric Cs-137 concentrations were under the detection limit.",

The scheme models anthropogenic groundwater exploitation and consumption, which are then divided into agricultural irrigation, industrial use and domestic use. A group of 41-year ensemble groundwater exploitation simulations with six different initial conditions, and a group of ensemble control simulations without exploitation are conducted using the developed model CESM1.2_GW with water supplies and demands estimated. The results reveal that the groundwater exploitation and water consumption cause drying effects on soil moisture in deep layers and wetting effects in upper layers, along with a rapidly declining groundwater table in Central US, Haihe River Basin in China and Northern India and Pakistan where groundwater extraction are most severe in the world. The atmosphere also responds to anthropogenic groundwater exploitation. Cooling effects on lower troposphere appear in large areas of North China Plain and of Northern India and Pakistan. Increased precipitation occurs in Haihe River Basin due to increased evapotranspiration from irrigation. Decreased precipitation occurs in Northern India because water vapor here is taken away by monsoon anomalies induced by anthropogenic alteration of groundwater. The local reducing effects of anthropogenic groundwater exploitation on total terrestrial water storage evinces that water resource is unsustainable with the current high exploitation rate. Therefore, a balance between slow groundwater withdrawal and rapid human economic development must be achieved to maintain a sustainable water resource, especially in over-exploitation regions such as Central US, Northern China, India and Pakistan.",

In this context, an ecosystem service trade-off framework in hydropower development was proposed in this paper. It aims to identify the ecological cost of river ecosystem and serve for the ecological compensation during hydropower development, for the hydropower services cannot completely replace the regulating services of river ecosystem. The valuing trade-offs framework was integrated by the influenced ecosystem services identification and ecosystem services valuation, through ecological monitoring and ecological economic methods, respectively. With a case study of Pondo hydropower project in Tibet, China, the valuing trade-offs of river ecosystem services in large hydropower development was illustrated. The typical ecological factors including water, sediment and soil were analyzed in this study to identify the altered river ecosystem services by Pondo hydropower project. Through the field monitoring and valuation, the results showed that the Lhasa River ecosystem services value could be changed annually by Pondo hydropower project with the increment of 5.7E+8CNY, and decrement of 5.1E+7CNY. The ecological compensation for river ecosystem should be focus on water and soil conservation, reservoir dredging and tributaries habitat protection.",

The yearly variation is assumed to benefit plants by avoiding environmental stresses such as frost damage, and/or utilizing more efficiently environmental resources and conditions. However, it is often difficult to assess quantitatively the benefit due to timing change of phenology events. In this study, we examined 10060 time series of first leaf-unfolding day (FLD) in 8 species from PEP725 in comparison with a set of simulated phenological data by removing the temperature effects. Our results show that 49.3% individuals gain more thermal energy (accumulated temperature) without suffering more frost risk, while a proportion of 25.3% individuals lost thermal energy but also without avoiding frost risk. More importantly, we found that the benefit by responding yearly temperature change increased with the increase of the temperature predictability during the phenological period. This study suggests that the year-to-year variation of phenological timing in responding temperature change benefits plants, in particular under the environments with high predictability of the temperature in the phenological period.",

            "abstract": "Salinity occurs in the drier and flatter Australian landscapes because there is insufficient rain to flush salts from critical zone. Changes in land use due to agriculture and urbanisation can accelerate salinity effects, leading to soil and water degradation and threatening infrastructure and ecosystems.\nThe dominant lithology in the salt affected regions of North-east Tasmania is dolerite. The geochemistry of dolerite regolith has been examined in order to understand the association between salinity and weathered dolerite. The electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil-waters is higher in the more weathered material (maximum 4.9 dS/m). This confirms field observations that highly weathered dolerite can serve as a significant store for salt in the landscape. However, the clay content and salinity varies, depending on the local geomorphic context.\nDolerite weathering on well-drained slopes has favoured the formation of 1:1 kaolinite clays, and sometimes bauxite formation. Kaolinite-bearing regolith can store salt via matrix diffusion processes. However, there are fault-bounded pockets of colluvium and highly-weathered in situmaterial, where the supply of cations has not been diminished and 2:1 montmorillonite clays dominate. These regions have the capacity to store large volumes of salts.\nThe geomorphology also affects the volume of rain and flux of salt from windblown dust and oceanic aerosols. The chemistry of rainwater from an array of bulk deposition collectors was studied from Spring 2013 to Winter 2014. The average salt flux was 79± 10 kg/ha/yr in the study region, ranging from 170± 12 kg/ha/yr in the north to 42 ± 6 kg/ha/yr inland.\nTo assist in understanding why salt is found in certain parts of the landscape but not in others, it is essential to model how water moves through the critical zone and geological structures. By exploring the complex interactions of geomorphology and other biophysical parameters the study area has been divided into Hydrogeological Landscape units. Associated conceptual models describe the regolith distribution, how and where salt is stored and how water moves through the critical zone. This multi-disciplinary analysis forms a framework to assist natural resource managers to identify management priorities in North-east Tasmania and in other dolerite dominated landscapes.",

Located 160km south of Seoul, this site represents an urban site surrounded by residential, commercial area and an 8-lane road cross section which is one of the most crowed main roads in this area. This site also plays a significant role especially in tracing air pollutants flowing through the West Sea from China.\nDuring Korus-AQ(Korea-US Air Quality Study) pre-campaign conducted from 18th May to 12th June, PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentration using BAM1020 (MetOne), PM2.5bounded ion concentration using AIM (URG), metal concentrations using XRF (Cooper), organic and elemental carbon contents using SOCEC (Sunset), light scattering coefficient using Nephelometer (TSI) and meteorological parameters were continuously measured at this super site.\nPM2.5 and PM10 average concentrations were 31 and 49 ug/m3 with 0.63 fine to course ratio, which were relatively lower than those of annual average concentration of 2014 (39 and 58 ug/m3, respectively). The chemical composition of PM2.5 were determined as ion(46%), TC(37%), CM(2%), TM(0.1%) and unknown(15%). The average concentration of organic and elemental carbon were 5.6 and 1.8 ug/m3 which were similar lever to average of 2014 (5.9 ug/m3, 1.71 ug/m3, respectively). And the metal concentration including Pb(12.5 ng/m3), Fe(151.7 ng/m3), Ca(26.2 ng/m3), Ti(5.2 ng/m3), Cd(4.1 ng/m3) were significantly lower than those of 2014(31.4 ng/m3, 242.1 ng/m3, 167.9 ng/m3, 13.0 ng/m3, 8.3 ng/m3, respectively). However, the average concentration of sulfate was 6.3 ug/m3 which was 43% higher than that of 2014 (4.4 ug/m3).\nOverall aerosol and its component’s concentrations except for secondary sulfate have been decreased since it was late spring and early summer in Korea during pre-campaign and usually in this season aerosol level is comparatively lower than winter and fall season. And there was only one mild yellow dust episode originated from north china in this period. For the 2016 KORUS-AQ main campaign, it is highly recommended to choose difference time period from pre-campaign in order to investigate the effect of various high PM episodes.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between solar tides (STs) and gravity waves (GWs) is studied via a fully coupled system of a three-dimensional ray-tracer model and a linear tidal model.\nThe tidal model describes the propagation of STs on a monthly mean climatology, allowing STs to interact with stationary planetary waves. The tidal model has been obtained by linearization of the primitive equations about the climatology. STs are being forced by a\nclimatological diurnal heating and by the (instantaneous) GWs flux convergences of momentum and buoyancy. The GW forcing is calculated (at each time step) by the ray tracer model.\nThe ray tracer model describes GW dynamics on a spatially and time dependent background formed by a monthly mean climatology and STs, the last being calculated (at each time step) by the linear tidal model. It does not suffer from typical simplifications of conventional GW parameterizations, where horizontal GW propagation is neglected, as are the effects of horizontal background gradients on GW dynamics. The ray tracer model uses a variant of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) theory where a spectral description in position-wavenumber space is helping to avoid numerical instabilities otherwise likely to occur in caustic like situations.\nNotwithstanding the simplicity of the employed GW source many aspects of observed tidal dynamics are reproduced. Under the conventional ``single-column'' approximation, GW impacts are shown to be significantly overestimated. Those overestimated GW\nflux convergences lead to significant changes in ST amplitudes and phases, pointing at a sensitive issue of GW parameterizations in general. Non-diurnal STs, whose existence is in this model set-up exclusively due to the GW forcing, are studied and shown to be more important near the poles, giving a partial explanation of STs amplitudes in these latitudes.",

            "abstract": "After the collision between the Indian and Asian plates, during early Cenozoic several south propagating thrusts were active and the sediments deposited at the northern tip of the Greater India have been reworked, recycled and metamorphosed, and were subsequently exhumed and transported to the foreland basin. Petrography, detrital zircon (DZ) dating and Lu-Hf isotope analysis, and trace element analysis were conducted from two sections of Nepal Himalaya for the determination of change in provenance, and constrain the possible timing of Indo-Asiacollision.\nThe U-Pb ages of the DZ grains from Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene Amile Formation are older than early Mesoproterozoic with dominant number of grains showing ƐHf (t) value between 0 to +10. The trace element data shows that the sediments are from passive margin with northward paleoflow direction. These finding conclude that the sediments during this time was sourced from northern margin of Indian Plate that elucidate the possibility of the Ind0-Asia collisionsomewhere between late Paleocene to early Eocene (~58-50 Ma).The U-Pb ages from the marine Eocene Bhainskati Formation dominantly clusters between ~1000 and 500 Ma and the ƐHf (t) values ranges from -10 to +10. The trace element result shows that the sediments were from both the passive and active continental margin. The transition of deposition from marine Bhainskati Formation to continental Dumri Formation is marked by 3-4 m thick Oxisol layer with a ~10-15 Mya deposition gap during the Oligocene. The U-Pb ages of detritus from Early to mid-Miocene Dumri Formation have a wide range of detritus ranging from Archean to Mesozoic age with dominant numbers resembling the age of the Tethys Himalaya (TH) and Upper Lesser Himalaya (ULH). The presence of younger grains of Cenozoic age (~80-50 Ma) put the possibility of the Gangdase arc source deposited directly in Dumri Formation or first deposited in the TH and later transported to it. The ƐHf (t) value ranges between +20 and -40 and the result of trace element shows the sediments are from active continental margin. The sediments are entirely source from the rising Himalaya, possibly due to the activation of Main Central Thrust. The petrographic result of Dumri sandstone falls in “recycled orogeny” field.",

            "abstract": "The surface height above active subglacial lake (SGL) varies in accordance with the water storage of lake beneath ice-sheet. Thus, satellite altimeters accurately measuring the ice surface height have discovered numbers of SGLs. In this study, we detect Antarctic SGLs using Cryosat-2 without any auxiliary data. The SARin mode of Cyrosat-2 is designed to retrieve the elevation over steep slope regions, such as margin of ice-sheet or ice-stream. The high-resolution processing of SARin mode yielding the elevation change rate (=Δh/Δt) enables us to verify the specific 2-D boundary of lake and even the small-scale uncategorized lakes. In the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams (WIS and MIS), drainage or refilling events of 9 SGLs are apparent in Cyrosat-2 era, and one of those is likely an uncategorized lake. In addition, the ice thickening upstream of WIS and MIS, which might be provoked by the deceleration downstream of WIS, alternates between high and low rate. It might be associated with massive drainage event of lake “Conway”. In the Kamb Ice Stream (KIS), most of previously known SGLs are not observed except for only one (Kamb trunk1) due to the limited spatial coverage of SARin mode operation. However, two additional lakes (located in 82.304S/147.980W and 82.477S/150.585W, respectively) are discovered at the downstream of Kamb trunk 1 lake. Similar approach is applied at slightly rugged terrain, which is located on the upstream of David Glacier. The drainage event of David 1 SGL is apparent, but the precise location of the lake is significantly (about twenty kilometers) different from previous ICESat measurement. Since ICESat measurements have limited temporal/spatial resolutions, we expect that Cryosat-2 have more optimal performance for measuring Antarctic Marginal SGLs.",

Examples of the applications empowered by ALTIGAPS are discussed. In particular, the role of vertical land motions in relative sea level variations is explored to better understand the natural hazards associated with sea level rise in coastal areas. Global evidence for the local variability in vertical land motions is provided, which may either amplify or attenuate the apparent rise of the sea at the coast. A set of 182 potential vulnerable localities are identified by large coastal subsidence which increases by several times the effects of climate-induced sea level rise.

            "abstract": "In regions with frequent water stress and large aquifer systems, groundwater is often used as an additional fresh water source. For many regions of the world groundwater abstraction exceeds groundwater recharge and persistent groundwater depletion occurs. The most direct effect of groundwater depletion is declining of water tables, leading to reduced groundwater discharge needed to sustain base-flow to e.g. rivers. Next to that, pumping costs increase, wells dry up and land subsidence occurs. These problems are expected to increase in the near future due to growing population and climate changes. This poses the urgent question of what the limits are of groundwater consumption worldwide.  \nWe simulate global water availability (5 arc-minute resolution, for 1960-2050) using the hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB (van Beek et al. 2011), coupled to a groundwater model based on MODFLOW (de Graaf et al. 2015), allowing for groundwater – surface water interactions. The groundwater model includes a parameterization of world’s confined and unconfined aquifer systems needed for a realistic simulation of groundwater head dynamics. Water demands are included (from Wada et al. 2014). We study the limits to water consumption, focusing on locally attainable groundwater and groundwater levels critical to rivers to sustain low flows.  \nWe show an increasing trend (1960-2050) in groundwater head declines, due to increase in groundwater demand. Also, stream flow will decrease and low flow conditions will occur more frequent and will be longer in duration in the near future, especially for irrigated areas. Next to that, we provide a global overview of the years it takes until groundwater gets unattainable for e.g. a local farmer (100 m below land-surface used as a proxy), and estimate the increase in pumping cost for the near future. The results show where and when limits of groundwater consumption are reached globally.",

            "abstract": "Flat subduction is a common process in subduction zones, causing crustal shortening and thickening and possibly subduction erosion. These processes can lead to the contamination of asthenospheric melts either by lithospheric assimilation (e.g. MASH) or by subduction erosion of lithosphere into the asthenospheric source. We present new major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-O-Os isotope data for a transect of Quaternary volcanic rocks across the Northern Southern Volcanic Front (NSVZ) of Chile at ~33.5°S, just south of the area of flat subduction, extending from the volcanic front (VF) to the rear arc (RA). The newly discovered calc-alkaline to alkaline RA rocks are more mafic (MgO~4-9wt.%) than the VF rocks (MgO~2.0-4.5wt.%). Both groups have overlapping Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions that are more enriched than lavas from further south in the SVZ with two RA trachybasalts displaying extreme 87Sr/86Sr (0.710), eNd (-6) and eHf (-9). The RA samples, however, have less radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions with the two extreme RA trachybasalt samples having the least radiogenic Pb. The 207Pb/204Pb vs. Nd/Pb, Ce/Pb and Nb/U form good inverse linear correlations extending from subducted sediments to a mantle-like component. Mesozoic/Paleozoic crust and Grenvillian Argentinian lower crust do not fall on or along an extension of these arrays. The ol, plag and groundmassd18O (normalized to melt) of samples covering the full range in Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic composition lie within the mantle range (5.5-5.9). High Os abundances (~330ppt) in radiogenic Os (187Os/188Os=0.18) samples are not consistent with derivation from a mantle plume or continental crust. eNd and eHf increase to the south along the VF, e.g. eHf ranges from -9 to +10, forming an excellent linear correlation (r2=0.99), indicating that the enriched component is present in the source for >1000km to at least ~43°S. We propose that flattening of the Pampean slab 1) triggered subduction erosion of enriched Proterozoic subcontinental lithospheric mantle and 2) squeezed the eroded lithosphere radially away from the region of flat subduction. Therefore, flat subduction could be a major mechanism for transferring continental lithosphere into the upper mantle asthenosphere, and for distributing this enriched material laterally over 1000s of kilometers.",

            "abstract": "Climate-induced sea-level fluctuations can have impacts on groundwater flow regimes, especially in coastal areas. A sea level decline leads to a seaward movement of the discharge area of regional groundwater flow system, accompanying increased hydraulic heads in aquifers that enhances deeper groundwater flow. It also brings drastic changes in shorelines and associated topography of coastal areas, which potentially affect groundwater flow regimes. Therefore, an assessment of the influence of sea-level change on groundwater system is especially important.\nIn this study, we focus on several sedimentary basins in Japan, including the Ishikari Plain, the Tsugaru Plain, and the Kanto Plain. Saline groundwater samples were collected from deep boreholes located over the plains, and analyzed for 36Cl/Cl ratios. Several rock samples taken from each area were measured for whole-rock chemical compositions to determine the secular equilibrium 36Cl/Cl ratios in deep aquifers. The obtained 36Cl ages are generally greater than 100 kyr, and tend to become older in inland areas. These age distribution patterns for each area are compared with the locations of past shorelines. The results may show some factors, including topography and geology, which may control the influence of sea-level change on groundwater systems in coastal sedimentary areas.\nAcknowledgement: Main part of this research project has been conducted as the regulatory supporting research funded by the Secretariat of the Nuclear Regulation Authority, Japan.",

The Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) of ambient aerosol was widely used in previous studies to attribute light absorption of brown carbon at shorter wavelengths, with a theoretical assumption that the AAE of black carbon (BC) aerosol equals to unit. In this study, the AAE method was improved by statistical extrapolation based on ambient measurements in the polluted seasons in typical urban and rural areas in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. A three-wavelength photoacoustic soot spectrometer (PASS-3) and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were used to explore the relationship between the ambient measured AAE and the ratio of organic aerosol to BC aerosol, in order to extract the more realistic AAE by pure BC aerosol, which were found to be 0.86, 0.82 and 1.02 at 405nm and 0.70, 0.71, and 0.86 at 532nm in the campaigns of urban-winter, urban-fall, and rural-fall, respectively. Roadway tunnel experiment results further supported the effectiveness of the obtained AAE for pure BC aerosol. In addition, biomass burning experiments proved higher spectral dependence of more-BrC environment and further verified the reliability of the instruments’ response. Then, the average light absorption contribution of BrC aerosol was calculated to be 11.7, 6.3 and 12.1% (with total relative uncertainty of 7.5, 6.9 and 10.0%) at 405nm and 10.0, 4.1 and 5.5% (with total relative uncertainty of 6.5, 8.6 and 15.4%) at 532nm of the three campaigns, respectively. These results indicate that the brown carbon contribution to the aerosol light absorption at shorter wavelengths is not negligible in the PRD region, with a rough magnitude of 10%.\nKey words: Light absorption, Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE), Brown carbon (BrC), Black carbon (BC)",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) aerosol is one of the most important aerosols, affecting the Earth’s radiative budget both directly through light absorption and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. Microphysical parameters of soot aerosols are important to assess their roles in atmosphere. A single particle soot photometer (SP2, Droplet Measurement Technologies Inc.) can be used to detect and quantify the mass of refractory BC (rBC) in a soot-containing particle. We conducted ground-measurements of rBC-containing particles using the SP2 at Yokosuka (near industrial sources, early summer of 2014, Fig1) and at Fukue island (outflow from Asian continent, spring of 2015, Fig1). During Fukue observation, we measured carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratio (by 48C, Themo Scientific, Inc.) which is useful for investigating polluted air masses. Air mass histories were analyzed with backward trajectories from the sampling point and precipitation along the trajectory calculated using the NOAA Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model with the meteorological data sets from NCEP’s GDAS. We analysed number-/mass-size distributions and mixing states of rBC-containing particles considering the differences in air mass characteristics and history. The observed rBC mass concentrations (at STP) were ranging from ~50 ng m-3 at Fukue island to ~2000 ng m-3 near industrial sources. The size distributions of rBC-containing particles were systematically changed depending on the sites and air mass histories. Modal mass-equivalent diameters of the observed mass-size distributions showed minima (~0.16 μm) near source area and maxima (~0.21 μm) at Fukue island for Asian outflow period without wet removal. In the presentation, we synthetically discuss the relationship between rBC microphysics and air mass characteristics and histories.",

            "abstract": "Iwojima is an active volcanic island located within a 10 km wide submarine caldera about 1250 km to the south of Tokyo, Japan. The volcanic activity is characterized by intensive earthquake activity associated with an island-wide uplift with high uplift rate (30~40 cm/year) and hydrothermal activity. In the last 10 years, phreatic eruptions took place in and near the island in 2012, 2013, and 2015. In such restless volcano, predictions and detections of occurrence points of phreatic eruptions are important for ensuring safety of residents. In the previous studies, we found that the earthquake activity of Iwojima highly correlates with the island wide large uplift, but the precursory activity of the phreatic eruption in 2012 was deviated from the correlation (Ueda et al. 2013 AGU Fall Meeting). For prediction of occurrence points of phreatic eruptions and investigation of the eruption mechanism, we began observation by seismic arrays at two areas in December 2014. The seismic arrays enable to locate epicenters of volcanic tremors, which are not well located by existing seismic stations. In May and June 2015, Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force stayed in Iwojima and a live camera of Japan Meteorological Agency found very small phreatic eruptions occurred at the northern beach. Existing seismic stations could not detect seismic signals related with the eruptions. The seismic array could detect weak seismic signals related with the eruptions. Although the seismic arrays could not detect precursory signals because of too small eruption, we expect the seismic arrays can detect precursory seismic signals suggesting occurrence points of small or medium-sized phreatic eruptions. The seismic arrays also detected epicenters of harmonic and monotonic tremors took place at an active fumarolic field in the north earthen part of Iwojima. The apparent velocity of seismic waves (~1km/s) strongly suggests that the tremors relate with hydrothermal activity near ground surface.",

            "abstract": "The variations in crustal thickness and topography may affect the travel time anomalies and hence attribute significant contributions in the travel time delays into mantle. The delayed arrivals in Tibet and Himalaya are expected due to the thick crust and low average crustal velocities whereas the arrivals are early in the regions of Indian shield compared to IASP 91 and need significant crustal correction term to decipher an exact tomographic model of the whole region. As the near vertical arrivals of teleseismic P waves (distance range 30-900) make it difficult to resolve crustal scale features for their inability to cross at crustal depths, station terms along with crustal corrections can be used to incorporate the effects of unresolved features of crust and upper mantle and to avoid the mapping of crustal travel time anomalies into the mantle. Keeping in view that these corrections using 3D models are as good as their resolution, we prefer CRUST1.0 over CRUST 2.0 to modify IASP91 for the crustal part and the modified velocity model has been used to obtain the travel time delays which may happen due to changes in velocity and thickness. The corrections are obtained for each event-station pair (ray or ray path) used in tomography and the times are subtracted from the input delay time vectors prior to inversion to prepare a modified tomographic model.",

Thousands of earthquakes are recorded in this area every year. The Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) is an active fault zone which is located from north to the southern end of LV. During the time period from October to December in 1951, lots of large earthquakes occurred between Hualien and Taitung area, which included four major earthquakes (M > 7.1) and thousands of aftershocks were recorded, named the Longitudinal Valley earthquake sequence. Coseismic surface ruptures with a total length of approximate 90 km were observed along LV. In this study, we reconstructed the source model and strong ground motion time history of this earthquake sequence. The LVF is separated into three segments according to segmental characteristics. A source inversion by using the geodetic data was analyzed first. The coseismic displacement of Longitudinal Valley earthquake sequence was taken from the triangulation datasets and interseismic GPS data. The inverted source model showed that the synthetic coseismic displacement had small deviation from the observed data. We took the inversion results to simulate the strong ground motion based on spectral-element method. The simulation results showed that large PGA values distributed mostly in eastern Taiwan along LV and the maximum PGA value was observed in Hualien downtown area which were resulted from the ruptures of northern and central segments. Finally, we reconstructed the numerical earthquake model, including models of source rupture and wave propagation for the 1951 Longitudinal Valley earthquake sequence.",

A number of studies have shown that transition metals, quinones, as well as other unknown organics in particles, may contribute to ROS formation. North China Plain (NCP) is one of the most populated and polluted areas in the world, where Beijing, the capital of China, is located. NCP have been suffering from severe air pollution, and health effects of fine PM have drawn great attentions of both the government and the public. To study the chemical characterization and ROS generation of PM, airborne PM2.5 was collected at two sites, with one urban site on the campus of Peking University in Beijing and one suburban site in Wangdu, Hebei Province, which is located in the south of Beijing and was significantly influenced by biomass burning during the study period. Previous studies have shown that Beijing can be more influenced by regional transport when the prevailing wind is from the south. PM2.5 samples were collected on 47 mm Teflon filter and Quartz filter using the four-channel low-volume sampler, and organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), soluble ions and trace metals have been analyzed. The formation of ·OH induced by PM2.5 was also measured to characterize the chemical generation of ROS from ambient particles in a cell-free solution. Preliminary analysis showed that during biomass burning periods, OC and EC concentrations in Wangdu were significantly higher than that in Beijing. The average concentration of WSOC in Beijing was comparable to that in Wangdu, while during biomass burning period, that in Wangdu was much higher than that in Beijing. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify the major contributing sources of PM2.5. More detailed information about chemical compositions, sources and ROS generation of PM2.5 will be discussed.",

Covering an area of about 10×104 km2 in China, there are medium and small intermontane basins, Burqin-Fuhai, Tacheng, Hefeng and Hoxtolgay, distributing inside the orogen.\nTectonically West Junggar Orogen lies in the middle section of the Palaeo-Asian tectonic domain where the Siberia, Kazakhstan and Tarim Plates converge, and is the only orogen trending NE-SW in the Palaeo-Asian tectonic domain. Since the Paleozoic, the orogen experienced pre-Permian plate tectonic evolution and post-Permian intra-plate basin evolution. Complex tectonic evolution and multi-stage structural superimposition not only give rise to long term controversial over the basin basement property but also complex basin-mountain coupling relations, structures and basin superimposition modes. According to analysis of several kinds of geological and geophysical data, the orogen was dominated by compressive folding and thrust napping from the Siberia plate in the north since the Late Paleozoic. Compressive stress weakened from north to south, corresponding to subdued vertical movement and enhanced horizontal movement of crustal surface from north to south, and finally faded in the overthrust-nappe belt at the northwest margin of the Junggar Basin. The variation in compressive stress is consistent with the surface relief of the orogen, which is high in the north and low in the south. There are two kinds of basin-mountain coupling relationships, i.e. high angle thrusting and overthrusting and napping, and two kinds of basin superimposition modes, i.e. inherited and progressive, and migrating and convulsionary modes.\nWest Junggar orogen has rich oil and gas shows.

            "abstract": "There is much concern about a potentially “accelerated” hydrologic cycle, with associated extremes in weather and climate-related phenomena. Whether this translates into wetter or drier conditions across arctic landscapes remains an open question. Arctic ecosystems differ substantially from those in temperate regions, largely due to the interactions of extremes in climate and land surface characteristics. Ice-rich permafrost prevents percolation of rainfall or snowmelt water, often maintaining a moist to saturated active layer where the permafrost table is shallow. Permafrost may also block the lateral movement of groundwater, and act as a confining unit for water in sub- or intra-permafrost aquifers. However, as permafrost degrades, profound changes in interactions between groundwater and surface water occur that affect the partitioning among the water balance components with subsequent impacts to the surface energy balance and essential ecosystem processes.\nMost simulations of arctic climate project sustained increases in temperature and gradual increases in precipitation over the 21st century. However, most climatic models do not correctly represent the essential controls that permafrost exerts on hydrological, ecological, and climatological processes. If warming continues as projected, we expect large-scale changes in surface hydrology as permafrost degrades. Where groundwater gradients are downward (i.e. surface water will infiltrate to subsurface groundwater), as in most cases, we may expect improved drainage and drier soils, which would result in reduced evaporation and transpiration (ET). In some special cases, where the groundwater gradient is upward (as in many wetlands or springs) surface soils may become wetter or inundated as permafrost degrades. Further, since soil moisture is a primary factor controlling ecosystem processes, interactions between ecosystems, GHG emissions, and high-latitude climate must also be considered highly uncertain. These inter-dependent processes will exert primary controls on several important feedback processes and vary across space and time in some as yet, unknown way.",

            "abstract": "ENSO is the most predominant interannual climate variability in Earth and how the ENSO properties would be changed under global warming is a central issue in climate community. In particular, it is necessary to understand how the internal variability, which rises from atmospheric, oceanic, land, and cryospheric processes and their coupled interactions, contributes to the uncertainties of ENSO in a changing climate. By using CESM large ensemble runs, we analyze the relationship of ENSO amplitude and internal variability under global warming. The CESM large ensemble contains 30 members using the same model and the same external forcing from the historical run to the RCP8.5 run. It is found that the change in the ENSO amplitude due to internal variability is large, in addition, such a contribution of internal variability is not much changed under global warming. We further found that a possible reason why the ENSO amplitude changes under global warming is so diverse among climate models might be associated with the amplitude in the internal variability in the historical period.",

In this study, discharge variations associated with the Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP) types of El Niño are contrasted for the world's eighteen largest rivers. Maps are constructed to identify the rivers that produce opposite-sign (i.e., asymmetric response) or same-sign (i.e., symmetric response) variations to these two types of El Niño. The mapping shows that the strongest asymmetric response occurs in rivers of North America whereas the strongest symmetric response occurs in rivers in Australia and Europe. Rivers in Asia and Africa alter their response patterns through various phases of El Niño. The response patterns are linked to precipitation variations within the river basins. The mapping offers an overview of which rivers may need new projection and management strategies in response to the changing El Niño type (from EP to CP) in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "The movement of sea bottom or ground sediment material by tsunami cause erosion, deposition and hence bathymetry and topogrphy changes. The unexpected depth decrease at some parts of the enclosed basins and harbors may result in lack of movements of vessels. In order to understand the sediment movement inside the enclosed basins, Haydarpasa port in the sea of Marama is selected as a case study to understand the motion of tsunamis inside the port and identify their effects on harbor functions. The highest populated mega city Istanbul, located at north coast of the Sea of Marmara is one of the main centers of major economic activities in the region. In the study, the spatial and temporal changes of main tsunami parameters are investigated and their adverse effects on harbor performance are identified by analyzing the critical tsunami parameters (water elevation, current speed and momentum fluxes) in the port. Furthermore, the morphological changes due to tsunami induced flows are also considered. The morphological changes due to tsunamis can be governed by bathymetry and topography, tsunami current and the characteristics of ground material. Rouse number is one of the indicators to describe the initiation of sediment motion and transport modes under the flow. Therefore the morphological changes can be monitored by monitoring the change of the Rouse number. In this study the spatial and temporal change of Rouse number and hence modes of sediment transport in Haydarpasa port during a tsunami is investigated. Finally the functional loss of the port and the necessary strategies for reduction of tsunami impact and increase of resilience are also discussed.\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)\".",

Our analysis benefits from the use of the recently launched weather@home Australia-New Zealand distributed computing citizen science project to generate very large ensembles of regional climate model simulations over Australia.

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of space weather – analogous to terrestrial weather which describes the changing pressure, temperature, wind, and humidity conditions on Earth – is essentially a description of the changes in velocity, density, magnetic field, high-energy particles, and radiation in the near-Earth space environment including the effects of such changes on the Earth’s magnetosphere, radiation belts, ionosphere, and thermosphere. Space weather can be considered to have two main strands: (i) scientific research, and (ii) applications. The former is self-explanatory, but the latter covers operational aspects which includes its forecasting. Understanding and forecasting space weather in the near-Earth environment is vitally important to protecting our modern-day reliance (militarily and commercially) on satellites, global-communication and navigation networks, high-altitude air travel (radiation concerns particularly on polar routes), long-distance power/oil/gas lines and piping, and for any future human exploration of space to list but a few. Two ground-based radio-observing remote-sensing techniques that can aid our understanding and forecasting of heliospheric space weather are those of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) and heliospheric Faraday rotation (FR). The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a next-generation ‘software’ radio telescope centered in The Netherlands with international stations spread across central and northwest Europe. For several years, scientific observations of IPS on LOFAR have been undertaken on a campaign basis and the experiment is now well developed. More recently, LOFAR has been used to attempt scientific heliospheric FR observations aimed at remotely sensing the magnetic field of the plasma traversing the inner heliosphere. We present our latest progress using these two radio heliospheric-imaging remote-sensing techniques including the use of three-dimensional (3-D) modeling and reconstruction techniques using other, additional data as input (such as IPS data from the Solar Terrestrial Environment Laboratory – STELab) to support and better-interpret the LOFAR results.",

What is crucial for electron enhancements at GEO are sustained south-oriented or north-south fluctuating IMF Bz that drives sufficiently large substorm activity and small solar wind density Nsw that likely leads to low loss rate of relativistic electrons to the ionosphere and/or to the magnetopause for an extended time period. Specifically, almost all the abrupt, large electron increases in our data set took place under the condition of average AE > 235 nT and average Nsw ≤ 5 cm-3. Examination of detailed time profiles clearly shows that electron flux at GEO starts to increase quite immediately with arrival of the right IMF and solar wind conditions, regardless of a magnetic storm, leaving the accompanied magnetic storms merely co-incident, while the prolonged, intense substorms are critical.",

            "abstract": "Large river flows can damage adjacent flood-prone areas, by exceeding river channel and levee capacities. Particularly large floods are difficult to contain in leveed river banks alone. Flood bypasses often can efficiently reduce flood risks, where excess river flow is diverted over a weir to bypasses, that incur much less damage and cost. Additional benefits of bypasses include ecosystem protection, agriculture, groundwater recharge and recreation. Constructing or expanding an existing bypass costs in land purchase easements, and levee setbacks. Accounting for such benefits and costs, this study develops a simple mathematical model for optimizing flood bypass capacity using benefit-cost and risk analysis. Application to the Yolo Bypass, an existing bypass along the Sacramento River in California, estimates optimal capacity that economically reduces flood damage and increases various benefits, especially for agriculture. Land availability is likely to limit bypass expansion. Compensation for landowners could relax such limitations. Other economic values could affect the optimal results, which are shown by sensitivity analysis on major parameters. By including land geography into the model, location of promising capacity expansions can be identified.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show major uncertainties about the magnitude and key drivers of global freshwater change, historically and projected for the future. The tackling of these uncertainties should be a societal priority to understand: 1) the role of human change drivers for freshwater availability changes, 2) the global water footprint of humanity and 3) the relation of human freshwater consumption to a proposed planetary boundary. This study analyses worldwide hydroclimatic changes, as observed during 1900-2009 in 99 large hydrological basins across all continents. We test whether global freshwater change may be driven by major developments of flow regulation and irrigation (FRI) occurring over this period. Independent categorization of the variability of FRI-impact strength among the studied basins is used to identify statistical basin differences in occurrence and strength of characteristic hydroclimatic signals of FRI. Our results show dominant signals of increasing relative evapotranspiration in basins affected by flow regulation and/or irrigation, in conjunction with decreasing relative intra-annual variability of runoff in basins affected by flow regulation. The FRI-related increase in relative evapotranspiration implies an increase of 4,688 km3/yr in global annual average water flow from land to the atmosphere. This observation-based estimate extends considerably the upper quantification limits of both FRI-driven and total global human consumption of freshwater, as well as the global water footprint of humanity. Our worldwide analysis shows clear FRI-related change signals emerging directly from observations, in spite of large change variability among basins and many other coexisting change drivers in both the atmosphere and the landscape. These results highlight the importance of considering local water use as a key change driver in Earth system studies and modelling, of relevance for global change and human consumption of freshwater.",

Information on the planetary boundary layer characteristics are important in various aspects. Analyses presented in the study are mainly carried out using Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data products. Hourly values of PBL height, soil moisture, fluxes, cloud cover, and atmospheric stability in the region 5-38° N, 60 – 100o E are used. The MERRA PBL heights are validated with PBL heights calculated using GPS RO atmospheric profiles during 2007-09 and radiosonde observations in order to assess the suitability of MERRA data for the PBL analysis. The radiosonde data used are from two sources: (i) routine radiosonde observations conducted by India Meteorological Department over the Indian subcontinent and (ii) additional radiosonde observations conducted by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology as a part of the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment during theSW monsoon, 2009. Spatio-temporal variations of PBL height in relation to different phases of monsoon and intra-seasonal variations are investigated in detail. Seasonal variations show a deeper premonsoon boundary layer and a shallower monsoon boundary layer, with large spatial variations. The PBLH variations over inland locations are found to be in good agreement with onset and progress of monsoon rainfall and associated soil moisture variations. The active and break spell monsoon PBL heights analyzed using 20-year PBL data showed deeper PBLHs during break periods compared to active period. Based on the maximum PBLH and growth characteristics, different regimes are identified which are mainly controlled by soil moisture/ evaporative fraction, but further influenced by stability of the surface, cloudiness, wind shear, etc. resulting in complex PBL regimes in relation to monsoon. The maximum PBLH, growth rate, time of occurrence of maximum PBLH, duration of large PBLHs, and their relation to surface fluxes are found to be significantly different for wet and dry periods, and for inland and coastal locations. Temporal scales associated with PBLH variation and their relationships with different controlling factors are investigated with the help of wavelet analysis.",

These data are available from Ocean Networks Canada which operates the NEPTUNE observatory with power and communications to gas hydrate sites on the continental slope, allowing 24/7 monitoring of the dynamic gas hydrate activity. Clayoquot Slope at Cascadia's Bullseye Vent and Bubbly Gulch, is equipped with a variety of sensors including a 270 kHz Imagenex 100 m range multibeam sonar, as well as Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) sensors, high precision Bottom Pressure Recorders (BPR), current meter and Ocean Bottom Seismograph (OBS). This enables statistically meaningful correlation of these data.\nHourly sonar data were collected showing venting activity in the form of gas plumes of various strengths. For four years the sonar was located at what appears to be a transient gas site, with longer periods of absolutely no venting observed activity. Here, the strongest correlation of gas bubbling is with rapid decreasing tidal pressure, where subsequent increasing tidal pressure is shutting down the degassing.\nIn May 2014, the sonar was moved by 500 m to a more actively venting site termed Gastown Alley, over a zone of seismic blanking interpreted as having high subsurface gas content. This site is continuously emitting gas bubbles albeit with varying numbers of plumes and intensities. The strongest correlation of gas discharge is with absolute pressures, with maximum flows at higher tidal pressures, hinting at a steady subsurface rise of gas that is squeezed out stronger at high tides, partially emptying the shallow reservoirs, and with subsiding tidal pressure the venting activity also decreases again. Thus, the two sonar sites, though only 500 m apart, show a different behavior in degassing, however, both reacting most strongly to tidal pressure changes.",

            "abstract": "This work presents the development of an atmospheric N2O isotopocule model based on a chemistry-coupled atmospheric general circulation model (ACTM). We also describe a simple method to optimize the model and present its use in estimating the isotopic signatures of surface sources at the hemispheric scale. Data obtained from ground-based observations, measurements of firn air, and balloon and aircraft flights were used to optimize the long-term trends, interhemispheric gradients, and photolytic fractionation, respectively, in the model. This optimization successfully reproduced realistic spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric N2O isotopocules throughout the atmosphere from the surface to the stratosphere. The very small gradients associated with vertical profiles through the troposphere and the latitudinal and vertical distributions within each hemisphere were also reasonably simulated. The results of the isotopic characterization of the global total sources were generally consistent with previous one-box model estimates, indicating that the observed atmospheric trend is the dominant factor controlling the source isotopic signature. However, hemispheric estimates were different from those generated by a previous two-box model study, mainly due to the model accounting for the interhemispheric transport and latitudinal and vertical distributions of tropospheric N2O isotopocules. Comparisons of time series of atmospheric N2O isotopocule ratios between our model and observational data from several laboratories revealed the need for a more systematic and elaborate intercalibration of the standard scales used in N2O isotopic measurements in order to capture a more complete and precise picture of the temporal and spatial variations in atmospheric N2O isotopocule ratios. This study highlights the possibility that inverse estimation of surface N2O fluxes, including the isotopic information as additional constraints, could be realized.",

Accuracy is assessed relative to observationally validated reference models for fluxes under present-day conditions and forcing (flux changes) from quadrupled concentrations of carbon dioxide. Agreement among reference models is typically within 1 W/m2, while parameterized calculations are roughly half as accurate in the longwave and even less accurate, and more variable, in the shortwave. Absorption of shortwave radiation is underestimated by most parameterizations in the present day and has relatively large errors in forcing. Error in present-day conditions is essentially unrelated to error in forcing calculations. Recent revisions to parameterizations have reduced error in most cases. A dependence on atmospheric conditions, including integrated water vapor, means that global estimates of parameterization error relevant for the radiative forcing of climate change will require much more ambitious calculations.",

            "abstract": "In the Nankai region, southwest Japan, low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are very active at the down-dip limit of the megathrust source region. To reveal the spatial relationship between underground structure and seismic activity, we newly construct high-resolution receiver function (RF) profiles of the subducting Philippine Sea plate (PHS) and overriding continental plate. In this study, we installed 30 short-period seismographs in western Shikoku for one year. The survey line was aligned in the NNW-SSE, perpendicular to iso-depths of the slab, and it was passed through above one of dominant LFE clusters. We apply the RF analysis to not only these temporal stations but also nine NIED Hi-net / F-net stations near by the survey line. Amplitude of converted phase at a dipping interface becomes unclear when a seismic wave comes from up-dip direction. Thus, we excluded the RFs estimated from earthquakes located in the SSE direction, up-dip direction of our survey line. Since transverse RFs have important information for dipping velocity interfaces, we draw both the radial and transverse RF profiles. We clearly confirm the existence of the north dipping oceanic Moho (OM) and the continental Moho (CM) from the profiles. The OM is lying at 30 km depth beneath the Pacific coastline, and inclines to the north with dip of 7°. The dip angle of the OM changes steeper at the middle of the survey line. In the northern part of the survey line, the flat CM is located at 30 km depth. At the area where the OM reaches 40 km depth, the CM becomes shallow to the south. From our new subduction image, the LFEs are active within the oceanic crust between the lifting CM and dipping OM. The LFEs are caused by dehydration of the subducting slab. When dehydration occurs in the oceanic crust, the hydrated mineral transforms its phase. At this time, the density of mineral is increase. We say that this feature corresponds to the slight increase of the dip of the OM.",

            "abstract": "Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models are known to be a valuable tool that can be used to study microphysical, dynamical and radiative properties and their complex interactions in stratocumulus clouds since they can generate stratocumulus clouds realistically. These model generated properties were often compared with observations usually focusing on macroscopic features such as cloud depth and LWP. In this study we try to examine how good LES models are in re-producing cloud microphysical characteristics of stratocumulus clouds. After all if microphysics is not right, macroscopic, dynamic and radiative characteristics represented by the model cannot be fully trusted. The observation data are obtained from the G-1 aircraft measurements of marine stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific near the coast of Chile during the Variability of the American Monsoon Systems Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx). Two LES models are used to simulate these clouds: one is CIMMS (Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies) LES and the other is WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) LES. Both models are run in 3-D setting and employ bin microphysics to be appropriate for detailed cloud microphysics calculation. Comparison between observation and LES models could reveal intrinsic problems of the LES models in representing entrainment and mixing processes. The difference between the two LES models may reveal the intrinsic differences between the two models in representing large eddies and microphysical processes. Some preliminary results indicate that the CIMMS LES model tends to produce cloud microphysical relationships that are expected to occur when homogeneous mixing is dominant. More detail will be presented at the conference.",

The BISL is based on probabilistic models of the source-station infrasonic signal propagation time, picking time and azimuth estimate merged with a prior knowledge about celerity distribution. It requires at each hypothetical source location, integration of the product of the corresponding source-station likelihood functions multiplied by a prior probability density function of celerity over the multivariate parameter space. The present BISL realization is generally time-consuming procedure based on numerical integration. The computational scheme proposed simplifies the target function so that integrals are taken exactly and are represented via standard functions. This makes the procedure much faster and realizable in real-time without practical loss of accuracy.

Leaf area index (LAI), one of important variable in the land surface processes, involves in canopy radiative transfer, momentum transfer, precipitation interception loss, and transpiration, which affect on land surface energy and water partition processes. Therefore, it crucially affects the ability of models to adequately simulate land-surface interaction. In this study, Long-term Global Mapping LAI (GLOBMAP LAI) and its corresponding land cover and greenness fraction are introduced into WRF_NMM/SSiB2. Compared with the control simulation based on the original specified LAI that is based on limited survey. The simulation with GLOBMAP LAI produced better precipitation distribution and rain belt movement. The improvements of the East Asia monsoon precipitation simulation are mainly attributed to the correction of the position of subtropical high. The north edge of subtropical high is related to the position of East Asia Westerly Jet. In the control simulation, weak westerlies lead subtropical high to move northward. Therefore compared with observations, more precipitation is in high latitudes. With imposed remote sensing LAI, the model produces larger meridional temperature gradient in surface and upper air, leading to stronger thermal westerlies. The Southward of Westerly Jet blocks the subtropical high, which amends the position of monsoon rain belt. This study directly takes advantage of recently available remote sensing products, and attributes the improved regional model simulation to proper LAI specification, which leads to adequate land/atmosphere interactions.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge on GHG fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems in Africa remains limited. Published field trials on soil GHG fluxes are summarized in approx. 10 research papers. Emissions related to livestock production, which are dominating most current estimates, rely on modelling work. Thus, uncertainties for African GHG fluxes are likely the highest at continental scale. Even though total GHG fluxes from agricultural soils seem to be low (insufficient fertilizer use/ soil degradation) the opposite might be true for livestock systems. Emissions per kg edible milk protein in SSA are a magnitude higher as for Europe (>100 kg CO2eq kg-1). Differences are related to feed intake, quality and availability, species and breeds, etc. Besides, handling of animal wastes is often less sophisticated, resulting in high nutrient losses and GHG fluxes. Estimates remain unconstrained, since in-situ measurements are missing and emission factors, developed elsewhere, are applied without verification to the African situation. To support African countries to improve emission reporting, to improve productivity of the agricultural sector while minimizing GHG fluxes and to allow them to play a vital role in emission trading, , requires to build in-continent research capacity. The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), has recently established a state-of-the art GHG laboratory in East Africa, which is envisioned to build a knowledge hub for environmental research. First measurement results indicate that EF for excreta applications to rangelands might be largely overestimated, mainly due to its rather low N concentrations. On the other hand, EF for ruminant CH4 emissions might be strongly underestimated, since those do not consider that livestock is often held at sub-maintenance levels. Thus, an international initiative is needed to support African countries to learn about land based GHG fluxes and to build research capacity. When do we start?",

In addition, considering the impact of model input, parameters and structure on streamflow prediction, the quantile regression method is employed to post-process the raw streamflow prediction to obtain probabilistic prediction and assess the predictive uncertainty. The quantile regression establishes the relation between different quantile (i.e. 0.05, 0.5 and 0.95) of prediction error and corresponding forecasting value itself.

We find that the solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF Bz play key roles in causing the relativistic electron flux dropouts, but also that either large solar wind dynamic pressure or strong southward IMF Bz by itself is capable of producing the significant depletion of relativistic electrons. The relativistic electron flux dropouts occur not only when the magnetopause is compressed closer to the Earth, but also when the magnetopause is located very far (> ~10 RE). Importantly, our results show that in addition to the large solar wind dynamic pressure, which pushes the magnetopause inward strongly and causes the electrons to escape from the magnetosphere, relativistic electrons can also be scattered into the loss cone and precipitate into the Earth’s atmosphere during periods of strong southward IMF Bz, which preferentially provides a source of free energy for electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave excitation. This is supported by the fact that the strongest electron precipitation into the atmosphere is found in the dusk sector, where EMIC waves are typically observed in the high-density plasmasphere or plume and cause efficient electron precipitation down to ~ 1 MeV.",

In particular, the often non-linear relationships and the different scales complicate the combination procedure. A well-known example is the combination of pointwise measured precipitation records with indirect precipitation measurements like radar or satellite observations.\nThis work presents a new developed conditional simulation technique called Random Mixing that allows merging of data sets across different scales. It is based on linear combinations of spatial random fields and uses copulas to model the dependence structure. The linear combinations need to be found such that all linear constraints, like precipitation gauge data, are fulfilled. Furthermore, certain information (e.g. zero values) can be extracted from remotely sensed data and used as additional linear constraints. Taking advantage of a specific property of Random Mixing an infinite number of conditional fields can be defined, hence non-linear constraints like large scale averages resulting from remote sensing can be incorporated via minimization of a certain objective function.\nThe methodology will be demonstrated using two precipitation simulation examples. First, precipitation estimations using gauge and radar data in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in south west Germany. Second, precipitation estimations using gauge and satellite (TRMM) data in Singapore.",

Most studies developed so far on the role of colloids in P transport have however focused on laboratory extracted colloids with only little attention being paid to natural soil solutions. Here, we monitored P speciation in natural soil solutions along two transects in a small, agricultural catchment located in Western France, during one hydrological year. We compared the P speciation in these solutions (<0.45 µm) with that of P in lab solutions (NaCl 0.001 M) obtained from the same soil samples, using different speciation techniques, including ultrafiltration combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (UF-ICP-MS) and XANES spectroscopy. XANES data evidenced no difference in terms of P speciation between lab extracted colloids and bulk soil samples, however revealing a strong enrichment of P in extracted colloids, thereby confirming the role of colloids as a major P carrier phase in agricultural soils. In natural soil solutions, total dissolved P concentrations (TDP) were similar in transect K and G, while molybdate reactive dissolved P (MRDP) was nearly 10 times higher in transect G than in Transect K. UF-ICP-MS data showed that the natural and lab extracted colloids consisted of a homogeneous mixture of Fe(Al)-oxides and organic matter, despite strong spatial variations of colloidal P proportion in natural waters (from 25 to 70%). Overall, transect G waters showed high proportions of truly-dissolved MRDP (up to 65%), waters in Transect K being richer in colloidal P and truly-dissolved organic P (OP). Lab extractions, however, did not reveal the same difference in P speciation, all the extracts being dominated by colloidal P and MRDP in roughly the same proportions. So far, the cause of this difference is not clearly identified. Though confirming the important role of colloids as a major P carrier phase in agricultural soils, this study indicates that natural soil solutions and lab extracts may yield different results regarding P speciation in soils, and that care should be exercised in extrapolating lab data to field situation.",

            "abstract": "Coal seam methane is a form of natural gas stored in coal beds and is one of the most important unconventional resources of energy. The flow and transport in coal beds occur in a well-developed system of natural fractures that are also known as cleats. We use micro-Computed Tomography (CT) imaging at both dry and wet conditions to resolve the cleats below the resolution of the image. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is used for calibration of micro-CT data. Using soft lithography technique, the cleat system is duplicated on a silicon mould. We fabricate a microfluidic chip using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to study both imbibition and drainage in generated coal structures for understating gas and water transport in coal seam reservoirs. First, we use simple patterns observed on coal images to analyse the effects of wettability, cleat size and distribution on flow behaviour. Then, we study transport in a coal by injecting both distilled water and decane with a rate of 1 microliter/ min into the fabricated cleat structure (Figure 1), initially saturated with air. We repeat the experiment for different contact angles by plasma treating the microfluidic chip, and results show significant effects of wettability on the displacement efficiency. The breakthrough time in the imbibition setup is significantly longer than in the drainage. Using rapid video capturing, and high resolution microscopy, we measure the saturation of displacing fluid with respect to time. By measuring gas and liquid recovery in the outlet at different saturation, we predict relative permeability of coal. This work has important applications for optimising gas recovery and our results can serve as a benchmark in the verification of multiphase numerical models used in coal seam gas industry.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty is often one of the sufferings when underlying models are constructed by using unitary geophysical data retrieved from field prospections. Velocity-susceptibility models are structured by using velocity obtained from arrival time of seismic waves transferring into susceptibility through characteristics of minerals and/or rocks to integrate two parameters together. Two profiles with intense undulation of geomagnetic anomalies over sediment areas in central-west Taiwan and complex geological structures at the rim of subduction zone in northeast Taiwan are used to examine discrepancy in values derived from prospections and the integrated models via a 2D forward method. Agreements between prospections and models suggest that rocks with high susceptibility can be identified in sediment areas and complex geological areas. Models with two-parameter adaptions shed light on constructing potential and susceptibility models in a more convincing way for further processes of inversion.",

            "abstract": "The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) has become a hotspot of geological research, and was thought to record the most widespread event of Phanerozoic juvenile crust formation. NE China is located within the eastern CAOB, and is characterized by the Paleozoic amalgamation of micro-continental massifs, such as the Songnen–Zhangguangcai Range Massif (SZM) and Jiamusi Massif (JM). This paper presents new zircon U–Pb, Hf isotope, and whole-rock major and trace element data for early Paleozoic igneous rocks of the northern SZM, in order to constrain the early Paleozoic tectonic evolution and crustal nature of the eastern CAOB. Zircon U–Pb dating indicates that early Paleozoic magmatic events within the northern SZM can be subdivided into four stages: Middle Cambrian (~505 Ma), Late Cambrian (~490 Ma), Early–Middle Ordovician (~470 Ma), and Late Ordovician (460–450 Ma). Middle Cambrian monzogranites recorded the latest stage of continent (SZM)–continent (JM) collision, whereas Late Cambrian A-type granitoids suggest a post-collisional extension. Ordovician calc-alkaline igneous rocks recorded an active continental margin setting. Additionally, the large variations of zircon εHf(t) values for early Paleozoic igneous rocks from the northern SZM indicate heterogeneity of the deep crust beneath the study area. Furthermore, zircon Hf two-stage model ages for early Paleozoic igneous rocks from the northern SZM (prominent peaks around 1.9–1.8 and 1.5–1.4 Ga and secondary peaks between 1.3–1.2 Ga) and the JM (1.7–1.2 Ga), suggest significant reworking of the ancient crust rather than extensive juvenile crust formation during early Paleozoic and imply that these two massifs have similar histories of Mesoproterozoic and early Paleozoic crustal accretion and reworking, although the northern SZM contains much older crustal material than the JM.\nThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (grant: 2013CB429802) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant: 41330206).",

            "abstract": "The 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake ruptured a significant portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), the main active structure responsible for the building of the Himalayas and for most destructive earthquakes in the past. Since this structure does not slip during the interseismic period, only indirect evidences allowed to infer its geometry at depth, a crucial point for numerous questions ranging from the long-term evolution of the mountain range to the dynamics of seismic ruptures. We use all available space-based geodetic data recording surface displacements during the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, including InSAR, GPS and optical imagery, to explore the space of possible geometric configurations of the MHT in the region of Kathmandu. From the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT), the surface expression of the MHT, our preferred fault geometry includes a steep (30°) ramp down to 5-km-depth, prolonged at depth by a shallow (5-8°) thrust extending 85 km north from the MFT where it steepens to form a 20-30° mid-crustal ramp, linking the seismic portion of the MHT to its deep, aseismic, root. This geometry is consistent with earlier geophysical measurements, such as electro-magneto-telluric data, the InDepth seismic reflection profile and the depth of relocated microseismicity. Moreover, the position of the mid-crustal ramp is consistent with the broad anticlinal shape of foliation north of the Kathmandu klippe. Such geometric configuration would suggest a structural control of the generation of high frequencies during the propagation of the rupture, as high-frequency radiators coincide with the up-dip edge of the mid-crustal ramp. Our proposed fault structure is meant to be used for further modeling of the earthquake cycle in the area, including the propagation of dynamic ruptures on a complex fault plane and the long-term behavior of the MHT, controlling the growth of the Himalayas.

We use soft lithography method to make 4’ diameter silicon wafer to be used as a mould of our designs. We have fabricated a range of microfluidic chips based on a range of patterns including pore junction with unequal throats, junction of throats with different coordination numbers, and junction of tortuous throats. We also fabricate more complex networks as a combination of the mentioned simple patterns. Decane and water are used as the wetting and non-wetting phases, respectively. Using high-resolution microscopy, we visualise the displacement processes and the movement of the interface between two fluids at different saturations. We initially test to micromodel chip for modelling drainage into a pore junction and compare our results with the prediction by the Young-Laplace equations. Then we focus on the sequence of pore filling and effects of pore space geometry, tortuosity and the injection rate. We use plasma treating to vary the contact angle and then study the effects of wettability on interface movement. Using accurate pump and pressure controller, we measure pressure drop across the micromodels at different time. By image processing of fluids distribution in the microfluidic chip, saturation of both phases can be estimated. Then, we plot relative permeability versus saturation curves for different pore space geometries. Our results can be used for validation of numerical two phase flow simulation and also we provide novel suggestions for modifying the equations of motion in pore network models.",

Dispersivity is crucial in groundwater numerical modeling of flow and non-reactive solute transport, as it deeply affects the predicted pollution plume when we use a numerical model to simulate the pollutant transport, however, the dispersivity used in the model are very difficult to obtain. In this study, transport data observed from a two-dimensional confined aquifer is assimilated via a localized Ensemble Kalman Filter system to calibrate the dispersivity field, and the result is satisfying. Some additional examples are illustrated to investigate the effect of different factors such as the number of realizations, initial assumed guesses, number and configuration of observations, and observation error on the efficiency of this method. The result indicate that the number of realizations greatly affects the efficiency of this method, excessive or insufficient is not good. A better estimation can be obtained if initial assumed guesses and observations is similar with the real field.",

The Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) instrument of each satellite were operated in “burst mode”: the recording frequency of the instruments were risen from the nominal 1 Hz to 250 Hz. A total of seven burst mode sessions, covering between 3 and 48 hours of continuous recording, were realized between December 2013 and February 2014. During that time, the local time of Swarm satellites orbits shifted from midnight-noon to post sunrise-post sunset. The last burst-mode session occurred during the recovery phase of a geomagnetic storm. Therefore ASM burst mode data allow to investigate both quiet and geomagnetic active periods.\nThe analysis of burst mode data was focused on the phenomena that can be investigated only using this higher sampling rate, providing insight in the frequency band between few Hz to 125 Hz. From the analysis of the magnetic field data we could observe typical signals related to different geomagnetic phenomena, showing distinct features at low, mid and high latitude.\nWe were able to detect fast magnetic field fluctuations with a typical pattern, associated with low-latitudes irregularities in the ionospheric plasma during the development of post-sunset plasma bubbles.\nWe also present results of the analysis of short electromagnetic signals that were detected mostly in the mid-to-low latitudes evening sector, investigating their correlation with the occurrence of lightning on the ground.\nOver the high latitudes, we detected fast variations in the intensity of the magnetic field during the active periods and analyse their correlations with plasma irregularities.",

            "abstract": "Based on analysis of a piston core collected in 2014 from the Lena River paleo delta, now Laptev Sea, we show that rapid and massive organic carbon (OC) deposition took place into the marine system at the termination of the Younger Dryas when the Arctic region experienced a large and extremely fast climate change. The highly laminated strata with absence of bioturbation further confirm the rapid event-driven emplacement of this deposit which was largely dominated by terrigenous OC as indicated by depleted δ13C values and high concentrations of terrestrial fossil biomarkers (lignin phenols and cutin-derived products). Moreover, the hydrogen isotopic composition (δ2H) of HMW n-alkanes indicates that this terrestrially-derived translocated OC was produced in the watershed during a relatively cold period. The OC appears to be a few thousand years old at time of deposition (ca. 4-5000 radiocarbon years; reservoir age corrected), consistent with the radiocarbon age of pre-aged OC currently supplied by the Lena river. Altogether our results indicate that fast climate warming exerts first-order control on large-scale carbon redistribution. Because the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition occurred within a few decades, we infer that the abrupt and large release of terrigenous OC was essentially driven by rapid changes in the permafrost stability (i.e., thermal collapse/thawing) and increase in precipitation over the Siberian watershed. Interestingly, only surface and sub-surface carbon pools (i.e., active layer) were remobilized while deep and old sources (radiocarbon dead) did not seem to have substantially contributed to the total land-to-ocean flux during the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition.",

However, whether or not these ionospheric changes are reliable precursors that could be useful for earthquake prediction is controversial within the scientific community. To test a possible statistical relationship between the ionosphere and earthquakes, we compare changes in the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere with occurrences of M≥6.0 earthquakes globally for a multiyear period. We use TEC data from a global ionosphere map (GIM) and an earthquake list declustered for aftershocks. For each earthquake, we look for anomalous changes in TEC within ±30 days of the earthquake time and within 2.5° latitude and 5.0° longitude of the earthquake location (the spatial resolution of GIM). Our preliminary analysis, using global TEC and earthquake data for 2002-2010, has not found any statistically significant changes in TEC prior to earthquakes. Thus, we have found no evidence that would suggest that TEC changes are useful for earthquake prediction. Our results are discussed in the context of prior statistical and case studies. Namely, our results agree with Dautermann et al. (2007) who found no relationship between TEC changes and earthquakes in the San Andreas fault region. Whereas, our results disagree with Le et al. (2011) who found an increased rate in TEC anomalies within a few days before global earthquakes M≥6.0.",

            "abstract": "As an important component of hydrologic cycle, groundwater is affected by topography, vegetation, climate condition, and anthropogenic activity. Groundwater horizontal convergence and divergence and vertical interaction with soil water result in variations of soil moisture, water and energy exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere, which ultimately influences climate. In this work, a two-dimensional groundwater lateral flow scheme based on groundwater mass equation, is developed and incorporated into the land surface model CLM4.5 to investigate effects of groundwater lateral flow on land surface processes in a river basin. A 30-year simulation with groundwater lateral flow and a control run without the horizontal movement are conducted over Heihe River Basin, north-west China, from 1979 to 2012 using the developed model. Results show that with groundwater lateral flow, equilibrium distribution of groundwater table shows more spatial variability following topography rather than the water balance between local precipitation and evapotranspiration, and are much closer to well observations especially over middle reaches area. Along with shallower groundwater table over piedmont areas in the middle reaches, increased soil moisture is shown which alleviates the underestimation of CLM4.5 at here. Changes in evapotranspiration are occurred and it is mainly controlled by the variation of local surface soil moisture, since water is the major limitation factor of evapotranspiration over this arid area. Besides, groundwater lateral flow can change the distribution of surface runoff by changing the saturated area fraction of each model grid cell. Energy cycle also responds to the changes of hydrological cycle which redistributes the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the entire basin.",

They are distributed in the fore arc side along the strike of the descending Philippine Sea plate. The generation of tremors may be related to the movement of fluid in the subduction zone judging from the long duration and mobility of the tremor activity,.\nThe network magnetotelluric (NMT) method (Uyeshima et al., 2001) is one of the MT method and is well-suited for investigating deep and large-scale conductivity strcture. Yamaguchi et al. (2009) has developed a modified NMT (modified NMT) method to overcome the problem posed by the progressive replacement of metallic transmission cables with fiber cables and first applied this modified NMT method over the Kii Peninsula. They showed a 2D conductivity model along a transect across the CENTRAL part of the Kii Peninsula. Their model is characterize by a large (∼20 km wide and depths of 10–60 km) and highly conductive (<10 ohm- m) region between the Conrad discontinuity and the upper surface of the Philippine Sea slab. This region contains the hypocenters of many deep low-frequency tremors but regular earthquakes are rare.\nIn this paper, we show a 2D conductivity model along the transect across the WESTERN part of the Kii Peninsula in order to image a 3D structure in and around the DLT region.\nOur model is characterized by following four regions.\n(1) A highly conductive region in the wedge mantle. This region contains the hypocenters of many DLT but regular earthquakes are rare.\n(2) A highly conductive region along the upper boundary of the Philippine Sea slab at a depths of 20–40 km. As this region well corresponds to the high Poisson's ratio region, so we interpret highly conductivity is caused by presence of fluid.\n(3) A highly resistive region between the surface to ~10km in depth beneath the southern part of the model profile. The region corresponds to the Kumano acidic rocks.\n(4) A highly conductive region in the shallower part (< 10 km in depth) under the northern part of the model profile. It is interesting that this region well corresponds an earthquake swarm area beneath Wakayama prefecture.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is located at the margin of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which is a subduction zone between these two plates and the fault structures are rather complicated and dense seismicity, especially the Longitudinal Valley (LV) in eastern Taiwan. Non-volcanic tremor (NVT) is a seismic signal with low amplitude and long duration. NVT is often occurred below the seismogenic zone, which is between the lower crust and upper mantle, and the arrival time data of the body wave is difficult to be collected. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the physical mechanisms of NVT in several steps. First, in the investigation of the teleseismic earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey in 2005 to 2014, thirty-five potential teleseismic earthquakes are selected. Second, the seismograms are collected from the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) and Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) for these thirty-five potential teleseismic earthquakes. Third, the Seismic Analysis Code is used to select the seismograms from seven possible events which satisfied the conditions of triggering tremor during the passage of the surface wave. Forth, a band-pass filter is applied to retain the frequency with the range of 2-8 HZ of the surface waveform. Finally, visually determination for the tremor signals. The experimental results show that five certainly NVT events and two potential triggered events were found in the LV zone of eastern Taiwan. The locations of the hypocenters were then estimated using HYPO71 for these five certain events. According to the estimated hypocenters, the sources of NVT are possibly beneath the southern region of LV, close to the Chih-Shang fault. Moreover, these estimated hypocenters are within the high Vp/Vs ratio region and in depth of 30-40 km. The further analysis found that the amplitude of the surface wave is one of the key factors that when the peak ground velocity > 0.02cm/s, which equivalents to 2-3kPa dynamic stress, might trigger tremors.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the time-varying structure of Etna, an active stratovolcano in eastern Sicily, using seismic tomography. In volcanic systems, it is thought that the presence of fluids, cracks and pressurized gases can rapidly and drastically change the elastic properties of the host rocks. Recent work suggests that changes beneath Etna are detectable with seismic methods, and that these changes can be linked to volcanic activity. Temporal changes to Earth structure are commonly investigated by carrying out separate tomographic inversions for different epochs. However, repeated inversions of the same area are expected to vary, even if the structure itself does not change. This is due to variations in the seismic ray distribution and to observational errors. Potentially, changes between epochs which are due to experimental limitations can be misinterpreted as changes to the structure of the volcano.\nConsequently, we use a new tomographic program, TOMO4D, that inverts multiple data sets simultaneously [Julian & Foulger, Time-dependent seismic tomography, GJI, 2010]. This code imposes constraints which minimise the differences calculated between two epochs. The remaining structural variations are thus truly required to fit the data, and reflect changes which almost certainly exist between the two epochs. We have selected and relocated ~400 local earthquakes with at least 5 P and 5 S observations. They cover a period which includes several eruptions, from 1st November 2000 to 31st December 2006. We divide our data into different epochs and invert two epochs simultaneously. The models show a seismically fast central region, surrounded by a slower outer region. This suggests a central system of dykes or sills surrounded by volcanic sediments and country rock. At depths of 0-4 km below sea level the seismically fast region is not below the summit crater but is offset to the southwest. \n\nBy monitoring the changes to the elastic parameters of the host rocks we observe temporal changes within the volcano. The technique has potential for long-term volcano monitoring and hazard assessment since it could be applied to monitoring changes from month to month.",

            "abstract": "We present the modularized software package ASKI which is a flexible and extendable toolbox for seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) as well as sensitivity or resolution analysis operating on the sensitivity matrix. It utilizes established wave propagation codes for solving the forward problem and offers an alternative to the monolithic, unflexible and hard-to-modify codes that have typically been written for solving inverse problems. It is available under the GPL at www.rub.de/aski.\nThe Gauss-Newton FWI method for 3D-heterogeneous elastic earth models is based on waveform sensitivity kernels and can be applied to inverse problems at various spatial scales in both Cartesian and spherical geometries. The kernels are derived in the frequency domain from Born scattering theory as the Fréchet derivatives of linearized full waveform data functionals, quantifying the influence of elastic earth model parameters on the particular waveform data values. As an important innovation, we keep two independent spatial descriptions of the earth model - one for solving the forward problem and one representing the inverted model updates. Thereby we account for the independent needs of spatial model resolution of forward and inverse problem, respectively. Due to pre-integration of the kernels over the (in general much coarser) inversion grid, storage requirements for the sensitivity kernels are dramatically reduced.\nASKI can be flexibly extended to other forward codes by providing it with specific interface routines that contain knowledge about forward code-specific file formats and auxiliary information provided by the new forward code. In order to sustain flexibility, the ASKI tools must communicate via file output/input, thus large storage capacities need to be accessible in a convenient way. Storing the complete sensitivity matrix to file, however, permits the scientist full manual control over each step in a customized procedure of sensitivity/resolution analysis and full waveform inversion.",

Bottom up approach was adopted for quantifying the grid wise on road CO2 emissions of Chennai city at a finer resolution of 1Km x 1Km using the real time traffic data of 56 major roads. In addition, monitoring of ground level CO2 concentrations and vehicular traffic were carried out at a residential site in Chennai to understand the impact of vehicular emissions on the ambient CO2 levels. Further, AERMOD, a US EPA regulatory model, was deployed to find the spatial variation of CO2 concentrations due to the emissions from 38 major corridors of Chennai.\nResults indicated that a total emission of 0.65 Tg/year of CO2 was emitted by the vehicular traffic from the major roads of Chennai. Cars were identified as the larger emitters of CO2 with a contribution of 25% of the total emissions followed by three wheelers (21%), trucks (16%), buses (15%), two wheelers (13%) and Light Commercial Vehicles (9%). Ground level CO2 concentrations at the study area were in the range 391.52 to 666.37 ppm, with a mean hourly concentration of 448 ± 33.45 ppm. It was observed that the CO2 concentrations were high during the morning and evening peak hours and low during the afternoons and further vehicular emissions were found to have a significant effect on the ambient CO2 concentrations during the morning peak hours (R2=0.78) and afternoons (R2=0.50). But, contrastingly, a weak correlation was observed between the vehicular emissions and CO2 concentrations during the evening peak hours (R2=0.02). In addition, night time CO2 concentrations were observed higher in the weekends corresponding to high vehicular traffic during the late evenings. From the modelling results, it was found that the considered 38 major corridors contribute 0.12 ppm of CO2 per year to the ambient atmosphere.",

However the associated health risks due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration is not well known in India, while the assigned mean threshold values are 60 μg/m3 for 24-hour period and 40 μg/m3 for annual period. Both are considered safe concentration limits regarding human health effects. However, the daily and annually concentrations of PM2.5 were observed more than three times of NAAQS in the present study for a year. This study relates the incessant exposure to significant levels of PM2.5 to deleterious health effects, such as heart and lung diseases. The relation between environmental air quality and human health has been studied through different parameters e.g., hazard quotient (HQ), lifetime incremental cancer risk (LICR), and individual risk for different groups of ages in Delhi, the capital city of India. These analysis lead to additional insights into health disparities and may suggest that more rigorous strategies. This may be application to other urban areas across the nation. In this study, we propose to quantify such impacts through estimation of different health risk factors.",

            "abstract": "Riparian zones are often viewed as hot spots controlling N, C, P and Fe cycling and export in catchments. Groundwater and surface water flowpaths converge in these zones, and encounter the most reactive, organic-rich, uppermost soil horizons, while being at the same time zones in which soil moisture conditions temporarily fluctuate due to changes in water table depth, which can trigger biogeochemical processes. One well documented example is the process of denitrification which can remove N from riparian groundwater due to the anaerobic reduction of nitrate by soil organic matter. However, the role of riparian zones on the cycling of other nutrients such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved P (DP) is much less well documented. In this study, we evaluated this role by using time series of DOM and DP concentrations obtained on the Kervidy-Naizin catchment, a temperate agricultural headwater catchment controlled by shallow groundwater. Over 2 years, groundwater DOM and DP were monitored fortnightly both in the riparian zones and at the bottom of hillslope domains. Two periods of synchronous DOM and DP release were evidenced, the first corresponding to the rise of the water table after the dry summer period, the second being concomitant of the installation of reducing conditions. The reductive dissolution of soil Fe oxyhydroxides initiated by the prolonged soil water saturation caused the second peak, a process which was, however, strongly temporarily and spatially variable at the catchment scale, being dependent on i) the local topographic slope and ii) the annual rainfall amount and frequency. As regard the first peak, it was due either to the flushing by the water table of DOM and DP accumulated during the summer period, or to the release of microbial DOM and DP due to microbial biomass killing by osmotic shock. This study argues for the existence of coupled and complex DOM and DP release processes in the riparian zones of shallow groundwater dominated catchments, and for the need of considering water table fluctuations as one of the key driving factor controlling the nature and magnitude of these processes. Important implications regarding DOM and DP transfer from soils to surface waters will be discussed.",

Since 1980s, intensive efforts have been made to model and map carbon and water fluxes by means of land surface models and remote sensing techniques. Recently, remote sensing data based land surface models have been developed and applied at site, regional and global scales. However, these coupling models mainly focused on short-term land surface characterization, whereas long-term dynamics is more useful for global climate change research. In this study, we derived a set of long-term energy and mass exchange products (1981-2014) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). We evaluated products using flux tower measured data, and made comparison to other long-term carbon and water fluxes datasets derived from land surface models or remote sensing techniques. The spatial and temporal patterns of carbon and water fluxes were also investigated.",

            "abstract": "The effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation is important for weather-scale phenomena as well as cloud radiative forcing and climate change. However, because numerical models of clouds are complex and therefore slow to run, our understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction mostly relies on individual case studies and a very limited exploration of model uncertainties. Although we know that aerosols can substantially affect the thermodynamic and microphysical properties of convective clouds, we have little idea how robust our understanding is.\nHere we show how the accumulated precipitation from a mixed-phase convective cloud responds to changes in aerosol concentration, accounting for uncertainties in the cloud microphysical processes. We do this using the statistical techniques of Gaussian process emulation and variance-based sensitivity analysis that enable the interacting effects of many model uncertainties to be simulated. As expected, the mean cloud response is an increase in precipitation with aerosol when aerosol concentrations are low and a decrease in precipitation when aerosol concentrations are high. However, when we account for the uncertainties in the model processes, the variability in the precipitation response to aerosols is sufficiently large that even the direction of response can no longer be defined with confidence, except in extremely polluted conditions.\nThe results of this research provide information on where efforts should be directed to reduce the uncertainty in modelling aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.",

            "abstract": "Tomographic studies have been conducted to retrieve 3D seismic attenuation structure around Japan Arc since 1980s. However, in the Ryukyu Arc, 3D attenuation structures has never been estimated. It is important to estimate the 3D attenuation structure in this region, since there are highly active volcanos and seismicity between the Okinawa Trough and the Ryukyu Trench. In this study, we estimate 3D seismic attenuation structure in the Ryukyu Arc. We use seismic waveform data recorded by seismic observation networks of NIED, JMA and Kagoshima University, from 2004/06 to 2014/05. We select seismic events of more than 4,500. Since the Ryukyu Arc region are so wide, we separate it into three subregions: Sakishima Islands, Okinawa Islands and Amami Islands subregions. Before calculating the attenuation quantity t*, the corner frequency of the source spectrum for each event is estimated by using an omega square model. The t* is estimated from the amplitude decay rate from the source-corrected spectra. We then invert the t* data to the attenuation structure by a 3D tomographic technique using the non-negative least squares method. Our estimated attenuation structure has the remarkable features: in Sakishima Islands subregion, high attenuation zone exists beneath northern Ishigaki Island. This region corresponds to the Okinawa Trough. High attenuation zone also exists beneath Hateruma Island in upper crust. It corresponds to the accretionary prism formed by subducting Philippine Sea Plate. In Amami Islands subregion, high attenuation zone is located along volcanic front. Low attenuation zone spreads over subducting Philippine Sea slab in all subregions.\nAcknowledgements: We used JMA Unified Hypocenter Catalogs and seismic waveform data recorded by NIED, JMA and Kagoshima University. We also used a computer program by Zhao et al. (1992, JGR) for the tomographic analysis.",

By using L2 aerosol profiles satellite data of CALIOP/CALIOPSO the aerosol extinction coefficients were analyzed over northwest China. As an important case, space distribution and transmission route of dust aerosol were investigated during the dust events occurred from April 16th to 18th in 2013 over northwest China, based on L1 data of CALIOP/CALIOPSO, a combination of multiple satellite data and models. The results show that (1) dust aerosols could cause the reduction in effective radius of particle, cloud liquid water content and cloud optical thickness, and the increase of the number concentration of liquid cloud particles as well, (2) The aerosol extinction coefficients were decreased with the increase of height. The value of the aerosol extinction coefficients in desert area was greater than that in the area of Gansu Province due to urbanization. Distribution of the aerosol extinction coefficients in spring was nearly the same as the annual average. (3) Using aerosol products of the vertical characteristics from CALIOP/CALIOPSO, aerosol was classified during dust events, and with NAPPS Global aerosol model, daily distribution of the dust aerosol concentration was given, showing the transport and diffusion of dust aerosol. With HYSPLIT trajectory model，dust transportation path of the sand dust source areas was simulated and identified. During the outbreak of dust event dust aerosol was mainly distributed over the surface about 3km, with depolarization ratio at 0.4 and color ratio at 1.2. During the dust events were close to weak and stop, dust aerosol was mainly distributed over the surface under 2 km, with depolarization ratio from 0.2 to 0.3, and color ratio about 1.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic pore network simulators are important tools in studying macroscopic quantities in two-phase flow through porous media. However, these simulators have a time complexity of order N2  for N pore bodies, which limits their usage to small domains. Quasi-static pore network simulators, which assume capillary dominated flow, are more efficient with a time complexity of order N log(N), but are unable to capture phenomena caused by viscous effects such as viscous fingering and stable displacement.\nIt has been experimentally observed that, in several flow scenarios, capillary forces are dominant at the pore scale and viscous forces at larger scales. In order to take advantage of this behaviour and to reduce the time complexity of existing dynamic pore network simulators, we propose a multi-scale pore-network method for two phase flow. In our solution algorithm, the pore network is first divided into smaller subnetworks. The algorithm to advance the fluid interfaces within each subnetwork consists of three steps: 1) The saturation rate of each subnetwork is obtained by solving a two-phase meso-scale mass balance equation over the domain of subnetworks. Here, a multi-point flux scheme is used. 2) Depending on the local capillary number computed in the subnetwork, either an invasion percolation algorithm or a dynamic network algorithm is used to locally advance the fluid-fluid interfaces within each subnetwork until a new saturation value is matched. 3) The transmissibilities for the meso-scale equation are updated based on the updated fluid configurations in each subnetwork. For this purpose the methodoloy of the existing multi-scale finite volume (MSFV) method is employed.\nAn important feature of the multi-scale pore-network method is that it maintains consistency of both fluid occupancy and fluxes at subnetwork interfaces. Viscous effects such as viscous fingering (see figure) can be captured at a decreased computational cost compared to dynamic pore network simulators. In addition, it is straightforward to parallelize the solution algorithm. Validation studies are presented and compared to results obtained with an existing dynamic pore network model. ",

For each seismogram, this approach yields depth-dependent path average models of shear velocity and quality factor, and a set of fundamental and higher-mode dispersion and attenuation curves. We combine these attenuation measurements in a tomographic inversion after a careful rejection of the noisy data. We first remove data likely to be biased by a poor knowledge of the source. Then we assume that waves corresponding to events having close epicenters and recorded at the same station sample the same elastic and anelastic structure, we cluster the corresponding rays and average the attenuation measurements. Logarithms of the attenuations are regionalized using the non-linear east square formalism of Tarantola and Valette (1982), resulting in attenuation tomographic maps between 50s and 300s. After a first inversion, outlyers are rejected and a second inversion yields a moderate variance reduction of about 20%. We correct the attenuation curves for focusing effect using the linearized ray theory of Woodhouse and Wong (1986). Accounting for focussing effects allows building tomographic maps with variance reductions reaching 40%. In the period range 120-200s, the root mean square of the model perturbations increases from about 5% to 20%. Our 3-D attenuation models present strong agreement with surface tectonics at period lower than 200s. Areas of low attenuation are located under continents and areas of high attenuation are associated with oceans. Surprisingly, although mid oceanic ridges are located in attenuating regions, their signature, even if enhanced by focusing corrections, remains weaker than in the shear velocity models. Synthetic tests suggests that regularisation contributes to damp the attenuation signature of ridges, which could therefore be underestimated.",

            "abstract": "Post-disaster assessments for historical tsunami events (>15 years old) are either scarce or contain limited information. In this study, we are assessing ways to examine tsunami impacts by utilizing data from old events, but more importantly we examine how to best utilize information contained in tsunami historical databases, in order to provide meaningful products that describe the impact of the event. As such, a tsunami intensity scale was applied to two historical events that were observed in New Zealand (one local and one distant), in order to utilize the largest possible number of observations in our dataset. This is especially important for countries like New Zealand where the tsunami historical record is short, going back to only the 19th century, and where instrument recordings are only available for the most recent events. We found that despite a number of challenges in using intensities -uncertainties partly due to limitations of historical event data - these data with the help of GIS tools can be used to produce hazard maps and offer an alternative way to exploit tsunami historical records. Most importantly the assignment of intensities at each point of observation allows for utilization of many more observations than if one depends on physical information alone, such as water heights. We hope these results may be used towards developing a well-defined methodology for hazard assessments, and refine our knowledge for past tsunami events for which the tsunami sources are largely unknown, and also for when physical quantities describing the tsunami (e.g. water height, flood depth, run-up) are scarce.",

            "abstract": "Detecting groundwater inflow into lakes and reservoirs still remains a challenge. The buoyancy of groundwater during winter and early spring can be used for identification of groundwater up-welling related hotspots on surface water by TIR imaging (TIR). TIR has been successfully used to image and fast screen relatively large surface areas of lakes, reservoirs and large rivers for groundwater contributions. Still, quantitative interpretations of groundwater fluxes are hampered by the lack of understanding how the groundwater up-welling signal is propagated from the sediment-water interface through the water column to the water-air interface and what perturbations and signal losses occur along this pathway.\nIn the present study, groundwater discharge to a surface water body was simulated in a mesocosm experiment. Under winter conditions water of 14° C to 16°C was discharged at the bottom of a 10x2.8 m mesocosm where surface water varied from 4°C –7.4°C. Four layers (20, 40, 60 and 80 cm above the sediment) of the 81 cm deep mesocosm were equipped with fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) for tracing thermal patterns in the mesocosm and TIR imaging was deployed to monitor temperature pattern at the water surface in order to: (1) analyze the propagation of the temperature signal through the water column by FO-DTS (2) characterize the spatial distribution of groundwater-borne hot spots on the lake surface by FO-DTS and TIR and, (3) conduct inverse modelling from surface water TIR data to identify the groundwater source at the sediment-water interface. In order to assess the reliability of the model we compare modeled data with FO-DTS observations. Different exfiltration rates were simulated in order to establish the minimum rate of GW upwelling that can be reliably detected at the water surface by TIR imaging. The experiments also allow us to benchmark scale dependencies and adequacy of both methods, FO-DTS and TIR. They also reveal that weather conditions can have important impacts on the detection of groundwater exfiltration at surface water-atmosphere interfaces at larger scales.",

Current models of carbon exchange thus handle the Arctic as either a single or few ecosystems, responding to environmental change in the same manner. In this study, we developed and tested a simple NEE model using the Misterlich light response curve (LRC) function with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) as the main driving variable. Model calibration was carried out with eddy covariance carbon dioxide data from 12 Arctic tundra sites. The model input parameters (fcsat, Rd and α) were estimated as a function of air temperature and leaf area index (LAI) and represent specific characteristics of the NEE-PPFD relationship. They describe the saturation flux, dark respiration and initial light use efficiency, respectively. While remotely sensed LAI is readily available as a MODIS Terra product (MCD15A3), air temperature was estimated from a direct relationship with MODIS land surface temperature (MOD11A2, LST). Therefore, no specific knowledge of the vegetation type is required. Preliminary results show the model captures the spatial heterogeneity of the Arctic tundra but so far, overestimates NEE on all 17 test sites which include heaths, bogs, fens, and tussock tundra vegetation. The final updated results and error assessment will be presented at the conference in December.",

            "abstract": "In plate-tectonic settings where magmatism is driven by decompression melting there is convincing evidence that activity is modulated by changes in ice- or water-loading across glacial/interglacial cycles. In contrast, the response of subduction-related volcanoes, where the crust is typically thicker and mantle melting is dominated by flux melting, remains unclear. The large areas spanned by arcs, and the typical activity at subduction zone volcanoes present particular challenges when compiling regional eruption archives. Records of effusive eruptions from long-lived, arc stratovolcanoes are challenging to obtain, and date; while deposits from the explosive eruptions, which dominate arc records, are prone to erosion and reworking. Here we use a rare high-resolution post-glacial (<18 ka) eruption record from a large stratovolcano (Mocho-Choshuenco) in southern Chile to gain new insight into the magmatic response to removal of an ice load; variation in eruptive flux, eruption size and magma composition are observed and divided into three distinct phases based on style of activity and erupted composition. Phase 1, shortly after deglaciation, was dominated by large explosive eruptions of dacite and rhyolite. During Phase 2 (7.3 – 2.9 ka) eruption rates and eruptive fluxes were lower, and activity was dominated by moderate-scale basaltic-andesite eruptions. Since 2.4 ka (Phase 3) eruptive fluxes have been elevated, and dominated by explosive eruptions of more intermediate magmas. This time-varying behaviour reflects changes in crustal plumbing systems, and magma storage timescales. During glaciations, magmas stall and differentiate to form large, evolved crustal reservoirs. After the load is removed, much of this stored magma is erupted (Phase 1). Subsequently, less-differentiated melts infiltrate the shallow crust (Phase 2). Then, as storage timescales increase, volcanism returns to more evolved compositions (Phase 3). On short (<10 kyr) timescales these variations are less likely to result from changes in mantle melt flux in an arc setting. Instead, the phenomena more likely reflect changes in the crustal stress field due to unloading. This tripartite pattern of evacuation, relaxation and recovery may be a general feature of previously-glaciated arc volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "The environmental release of the toxic and mobile Cr(VI) from poorly soluble and non-toxic Cr(III) mineral phases primarily occurs via oxidation by Mn(IV) oxides. This process accounts for the contamination of a number of natural and anthropogenically perturbed environments. The mechanism and controls upon the reaction of Mn(IV) oxides with insoluble Cr(III) minerals remain poorly understood. Further to this, despite near ubiquity in nature and a number of studies investigating Mn(IV) oxides reactivity towards natural organic compounds, few studies have assessed the impact of organics upon the oxidation of Cr(III) minerals by Mn(IV) oxides.\nThis study aimed to determine the changes in redox state of the Cr and Mn during reactions between the environmentally dominant Cr(OH)3 and δ-MnO2 minerals, under circum-neutral conditions, in the presence and absence of organic and humic acids. We used a combination of aqueous analytical techniques, alongside cryo-TEM-EELS which enabled mapping of the Cr and Mn redox state of the solid phases at the nanometre scale.\nIn the absence of organic compounds, a steady but significant release of Cr(VI) occurred prior to cessation of the reaction, despite the presence of a large pool of un-reacted Cr(III) and Mn(IV). Analysis using cryo-TEM-EELS suggests a passivation mechanism, through the detection of Mn(II) at the Cr and Mn mineral surface. The presence of oxalate and citrate variably promoted and inhibited Cr(VI) release, depending upon their concentrations relative to the mineral phases. The presence of humic acids, however, invariably promoted Cr(VI) release under the conditions tested. The complex impacts of organics on Cr(VI) release by δ-MnO2-mediated oxidation of Cr(OH)3 result from the various roles that organics can play in the reaction, acting as complexants, reductants and adsorbing species.",

            "abstract": "The dissipation of turbulent energy at small scales in space plasmas remains an open and challenging problem. Two plausible channels for energy dissipation have been intensively investigated in recent years: linear wave damping and non-linear interactions within coherent structures. However, a general consensus has not yet been reached on what is the relative importance of these two processes. It is now well established that coherent structures in the form of current sheets are associated with localized particle heating, and are generally responsible for the observed intermittent nature of plasma turbulence. Still, the contribution of such structures to the local energy spectrum is not well understood. Here we apply a 'space-filter' technique to a two-fluid plasma simulation of Kelvin-Helmoltz turbulence, in order to obtain a local measure of the inter-scale transfer and to characterize the contribution of coherent structures to the energy spectrum. Despite of being well-known in the hydrodynamics and Large-Eddy-Simulation communities, such technique is applied here for the first time to space plasma turbulence. Specifically, we study in detail the current sheets identified in turbulent Kelvin-Helmoltz vortexes by the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) technique, and we discuss the correlation between the inter-scale transfer and high values of the PVI index.",

            "abstract": "Drought indices are frequently used to compare the occurrence and characteristics of droughts at different sites as well as to characterize different hydrometeorological aspects of drought. The existing indices have been mostly focused on precipitation, soil moisture, and surface waters though. To enable a comparison of groundwater drought with other hydrometeorological aspects of drought, the Standardized Groundwater level Index SGI was proposed by Bloomfield and Marchant (2013). So far, the SGI has been applied only to consolidated aquifers in the UK. The purpose of this work is to assess the applicability and performance of the SGI in unconsolidated, porous aquifers situated in valleys, which represent the main sources of drinking water in many regions. For this purpose, long-term time series of groundwater levels both in wet and dry regions of Austria are analyzed and compared with time series of precipitation, evapotranspiration and river stages. It is shown that large drought events, such as 2003 with only 79% of the long-term average precipitation, but also less severe events are reflected by negative SGI anomalies. To identify and classify time periods with a groundwater deficit, such benchmark years are used to propose a threshold value of the SGI defining the onset of a drought. Time periods where a clear drop in SGI does not correspond to a significant anomaly in precipitation are also visible in the data. More detailed investigations into small valley fill aquifers in the south-east of Austria reveal that the SGI may closely correlate with river stage fluctuations. Also, effects of the geographic setting (mountainous area vs. lowland) and the impacts of human activities (hydropower, drinking water extraction) are shown. Bloomfield, J. P., Marchant, B.

            "abstract": "Fatty acids are one of the major components in modern marine sediments. It is well known that the saturated short-chain FAs were typically to be from vascular plants, algae, bacteria, and other sources, while the saturated long-chain FAs are the major components found in leaf waxes, suberin, and cutin in terrestrial higher plants. So the lipid biomarkers of fatty acids in Site 4B from Shenhu Area, northern South China Sea were investigated in Recent research supported from the 973 Program (2009CB219506), and the resources of branched fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids were mainly discussed. The results reveal that i/a15:0, i/a17:0, 16:1ω5, 18:1ω9 and 10me16:0 are derived from sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), while 16:1ω7t/c and 18:1ω7 are originated from sulphur-oxidising bacteria (SOB). The biomakers of methanotrophs such as 16:1ω6/8 and 18:1ω6/8 were not detected in the sediments which coincide with more positive carbon isotope values of the fatty acids in the sediments. The stable relationship between SRB and SOB below 97cm in the sediments reflects the relative stable oxidative and reductive depositional environment which may be connected with the sulphur cycle in the sediments, that is carried out as sulfate is reduced to sulfide, and then sulfide is oxidized to sulfate and elemental sulfur, at last elemental sulfur is disproportionated to sulfide and sulfate. The frequently changed relationship of SRB and SOB above 97cm in the sediments indicates intensely changing oxidative and reductive sedimental environment, that may related with diapir structure around Site 4B, which also brings about hydrocarbon seepage leading to increasing biomass at 97cm.",

            "abstract": "The Sahara Desert is the most important source of aerosols transported across the Mediterranean towards Europe. Airborne microorganisms associated with aerosols may be transported over long distances and act as colonizers of distant habitats. However, little is known on the composition and viability of such microorganisms, due to difficulties related to their detection, collection and isolation. Here we describe an in-depth assessment of the bacterial communities associated with Sahara dust (SD) particles deposited on snow.\nTwo distinct SD events reaching the European Alps in February and May 2014 were preserved as distinct ochre-coloured layers within the snowpack. In June 2014, we collected samples from a snow profile at 3621 m a.s.l. close to the Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps). SD particles were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Backward trajectories were calculated using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. Bacterial communities were charac-terized by MiSeq Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial physiological profiles were assessed by incubation of samples on BIOLOG plates.\nThe SD-layers were generally enriched in illite and kaolinite particles as compared to the adjacent snow layers. The source of SD could be traced back to Algeria. We observed distinct bacterial community structures in the SD-layers as compared to the clean snow layers. While sporulating bacteria were not enriched in the SD-layers, low abundant (<1%) phyla such as Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococcus-Thermus appeared to be specific bioindicators for SD. Both phyla are adapted to arid oligotrophic environments and UV radiation and thus are well suited to survive the harsh conditions of long-distance airborne transport. Our results show that bacteria are viable and metabolically active after the trek to the European Alps.",

            "abstract": "We have conducted paleomagnetic and rock magnetic measurements on the sedimentary sections recovered from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1408 in the Northwest Atlantic, off Newfoundland. The measurements were done on u-channel samples using a pass-through superconducting rock magnetometer in a manner that remanent magnetizations (natural, anhysteretic and isothermal remanent magnetizations: NRM, ARM and IRM) were subjected to stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetizations up to 80 mT and are measured with 1 cm spacing at each step.\nThe characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) was resolved after AF demagnetization of 20-30 mT for most of the studied interval. As a result, we could identify several polarity reversals which were able to be correlated with the geomagnetic polarity time scale by Gradstein et al. (2012) (Geologic Time Scale 2012), with referring the shipboard biostratigraphy (Norris et al., 2014). The interval at ~ 33-157 mcd (meter composite depth) was interpreted to cover the Chrons C18n.1n to C20n with missing Chron C19n because of the somewhat ambiguous magnetic signals at the interval at ~ 70-110 mcd. The correlation provided an age model inferring sedimentation rate of about 2-4 cm/kyr during these chrons.\nThere is the interval that shows relatively constant ARM and IRM intensities as well as ratios of ARM to IRM (ARM/IRM): the interval at ~ 37-90 mcd resulted in ARM intensity of 0.2-0.4 A/m, IRM intensity of 1-2 A/m and ARM/IRM of 0.17-0.20. This interval corresponds to the Chron C18 and the estimated sedimentation rate of the interval is ~ 2 cm/kyr. It is expected that high-resolution relative paleointensity estimate during the middle Eocene is potentially possible. We will report a preliminary estimate.",

We analyze seismic arrivals at ~20-50 s after the direct P wave in an array in northeast China (NECESSArray) recordings of four deep earthquakes occurring beneath the west-central Pacific subduction zones (from the eastern Indonesia to Tonga region). We employ the array analyzing techniques of 4th root vespagram and beam-form analysis to constrain the slowness and back azimuth of later arrivals. Our analyses reveal that these arrivals have a slightly lower slowness value than the direct P wave and the back azimuth deviates slightly from the great-circle direction. Along with calculation of one-dimensional synthetic seismograms, we conclude that the later arrival is corresponding to an energy of S-to-P converted at a scatterer below the sources. Total five scatterers are detected at depths varying from ~700 to 1110 km in the study region. The past subducted oceanic crust most likely accounts for the seismic scatterers trapped in the mid-mantle beneath the west-central subduction zones. Our observation in turn reflects that oceanic crust at least partly separated from subducted oceanic lithosphere and may be trapped substantially in the mid-mantle surrounding subduction zones, in particular in the western Pacific subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "After Hinode was launched in 2006, the observing program designed to catch rare white-light (WL) events has steadily been improved. So we now have a large enough number of WL events to make a statistical study.\n To understand the conditions that produce enhancements of WL in solar flares, we performed a statistical analysis of Hinode/SOT WL data. From the analysis of data obtained between January 2011 and August 2013, we found that the precipitation of large amounts of accelerated electrons into a compact area within a short time plays a key role in generating a WL event (Kitagawa et al., submitted to ApJ). And we also found that the coronal magnetic field strength in the flare region is one of the important factors that can distinguish between WL and non-WL (NWL) events.\n In this paper, we present the results derived from a new statistical study from the observing period extended to December 2014. In this study, we use not only the Hinode/SOT WL (G-band, Blue, Green, Red) data, but we also SDO/HMI continuum data. The total number of events is now about two times larger than that of Kitagawa’s previous study. We compared the white-light emission data with GOES soft X-rays, RHESSI hard X-rays and/or the strength of the photospheric magnetic fields, and investigated the relationships between many physical parameters. For example, from scatter plots of the start-to-peak time-scale in X-rays and the energy of nonthermal electrons, one can easily find a clear boundary between WL and NWL events. WL events show a relatively shorter time-scale among events with almost the same nonthermal energy. Most of the results in this study show the same characteristics as in the previous study, but they are more clearly seen thanks to the larger number of events.\n We also report some statistical results on WL and NWL events from Nobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH) and Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP) data, which give information on the magnetic field of the flare loop.",

            "abstract": "Study of structural geology in the north Jizhong Depression, Bohai Bay has achieved great breakthroughs in recent years. However the studies of structure and dynamics still remain much controversy. Based on the 3D and partial 2D seismic data, combined with regional geology and well data, the characteristics of structures in the north Jizhong Deprssion are analyzed, the dynamics is discussed.\nOur analyses show that the Cenozoic structures in the north Jizhong Depression can be subdivided into extensional system and strike-slip system. Extensional system concludes series of normal faults and transfer faults. Normal faults are mainly trend NNE and NE. They control the Paleogene sediments in sub-depressions of hanging-wall, and bottom out into a sub-horizontal detachment zone in deep level shaped like listric. Transfer faults mainly adjust displacement of normal faults, yet some like Tongbozhen and Niutuozhen are transfer faults in Paleocene and Eocene but change to normal faults in Oligocene. Strike-slip system is predominantly consisted by sub-vertical right-lateral strike-slip faults such as Xin`anzhen and Maxi. From seismic profiles, Xin`anzhen and Maxi cut into basement but only influence the sediments of Ed of Paleogene and Lower Neogene. Based on the relation of sedimentary sequence and faults, the extensional system mainly develops from Paleocene to Late Oligocene, but strike-slip system predominantly develops from Late Oligocene to Miocene. From the superposed section of crustal structure and basin structure in Jizhong Depression, the Cenozoic sub-basin is just located on the thinner zones of crustal, corresponding with the location of mantle uplift. It indicates that the Paleogene development of Jizhong Depression is related to the horizontal tension caused by uplift of magma in mantle.\nThe results illustrate that extensional deformation in Jizhong depression is caused by the uplift of magma. The right-lateral strike-slip deformation, same with Tancheng-Lujiang fault zone, is induced by the movement of plates. This study makes further steps to the research of basin evolution in Jizhong depression, especially the relationship between extensional system and strike-slip system, and provides references to the basin research of Bohai Bay, even the destruction of North China Craton.",

For the first time, complete lacustrine sections were sampled in the 900 m deep crater of Trou au Natron at Pic Toussidé (3,315 m a.s.l.), and in 800 m deep Era Kohor, the major sub-caldera of Emi Koussi, the Sahara’s 3,445 m high peak (photo). The probed diatomites are located 360 and 125 m above the present-day bottom of the calderas. Studies in the 1960s suggested that lake levels in the Trou au Natron were 300-500 m high at 12,400-14,970 uncal. yrs BP. Such lake depths and resulting water volumes, however, are hardly conceivable in view of the limited intake area and precipitation-evaporation ratios which would have required local rainfall by far surpassing estimates for latitudes 19-21°N from the full-Holocene record of Lake Yoa situated 460 or 220 km southeast, and 1,550 or 2,450 m lower. The presentation will examine whether differences in altitude may explain unparalleled lake depths and postglacial humid conditions 4,000-7,000 years earlier than in the surrounding lowlands, and present alternative hypotheses of lake formation in this Saharan key region.",

Volcanic reservoirs have become one of the important target reservoir types of eastern basin of China. In order to study the volcanic reservoirs, we need to know the main factors controlling the reservoir space.\nBy careful obsercation on volcanic drilling core, casting thin sections and statistical analysis of petrophysical properties of volcanic reservoir in Songliao basin, it can be suggested that the igneous rock reservoir in Yingcheng formation of Lower Crataceous is composed of different rock types, such ad rohylite, rohylitic crystal tuff, autoclastic brecciation lava and so on. There are different reservoirs storage space in in various lithological igneous rocks, but they are mainly composed of primary stoma, secondary solution pores and fractures.The evolution of storage space can be divided into 3 stage: the pramary reservoir space,exogenic leaching process and burial diagenesis.During the evolution process, the reservoir space is effected by secondary minerals, tectonic movement and volcanic hydrothermal solution. The pore of volcanic reservoirs can be partially filled by secondary minerals, but also may be dissoluted by other chemical volcanic hydrothermal solution.\nTherefore, the favorable places for better-quality volcanic reservoirs are the near-crater facies of vocanic apparatus and dissolution zones on the high position of paleo-structures.",

            "abstract": "Satellite based remote sensing has been used to monitor plant phenology. Numerous studies have generally utilized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to quantify phenological patterns and changes in regional to the global scales. Obtaining the NDVI values during summer in East Asian Monsoon regions is important because most plants grow vigorously in this season. However, satellite derived NDVI data are error prone to clouds during most of the period. Various methods have attempted to reduce the effect of cloud in temporal and spatial NDVI monitoring; the fundamental solution is to have a large data pool that includes multiple images in short period and supplements NDVI values in same period. Multiple images of geostationary satellite in a day can be a method to expand the pool. In this study, we suggest an approach that minimizes data gaps in NDVI of the day through geostationary satellite derived NDVI composition. We acquired data from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) which is a satellite that was launched to monitor ocean around the Korean peninsula, China, Japan and Russia. The satellite observes eight times per day (09:00 - 16:00, every hour) at 500 x 500 m resolution from 2011 to 2015. GOCI red- and near infrared radiance was converted into surface reflectance by using 6S Radiative Transfer Model (6S). We calculated NDVI tiles for each of observed eight tiles per day and made one day NDVI through maximum-value composite method. We evaluated the composite GOCI derived NDVI by comparing with daily MODIS-derived NDVI (composited from MOD09GA and MYD09GA), 16-day Landsat 8-derived NDVI, and in-situ light emitting diode (LED) NDVI measurements at a homogeneous deciduous forest and rice paddy sites. We found that GOCI-derived NDVI maps revealed little data gaps compared to MODIS and Landsat, and GOCI derived NDVI time series were smoother than MODIS derived NDVI time series in summer. GOCI-derived NDVI agreed well with in-situ observations of NDVI using LED-sensors. We conclude that NDVI composition with geostationary satellite could effectively reduce data gaps in NDVI temporal series and spatial patterns.",

The spherical curvature is not negligible in far field especially for large event and the real Earth is laterally inhomogeneity and the analytical results still are difficult to explain the geodetic measurements. We use equivalent body force finite elements method Zhang et al. (2015) and mesh the whole earth, to compute global co-seismic displacements using four fault slip models of the 2004 Sumatra earthquake provided by different authors. Comparisons of calculated co-seismic displacements and GPS show that the confidences are well in near field for four models, and the confidences are according to different models. In the whole four models, the Chlieh model (Chlieh et al., 2007) is the best as this slip model not only accord well with near field data but also far field data.\nAnd then we use the best slip model, Chlieh model to explore influence of three dimensional lateral earth structure on both layered spherically symmetric (PREM) and real 3-D heterogeneous earth model (Crust 1.0 model and GyPSuM). Results show that the effects of 3-D heterogeneous earth model are not negligible and decrease concomitantly with increasing distance from the epicenter. The relative effects of 3-D crust model are 23% and 40% for horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively. The effects of the 3-D mantle model are much smaller than that of 3-D crust model but with wider impacting area.",

            "abstract": "Automatic detection of seismic events is a complicated process. Common procedures depend on the detection of seismic phases (e.g. P and S) in single trace analyses and their correct association with locatable point sources. The event detection threshold is thus directly related to the single trace detection threshold. Highly sensitive phase detectors detect low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) phases but also produce a low percentage of locatable events. Short inter-event times of only a few seconds, which is not uncommon during seismic or volcanic crises, is a complication to any event association algorithm. We present an event detection algorithm based on seismic migration of trace attributes into an a-priori three-dimensional (3D) velocity model. We evaluate its capacity as automatic detector compared to conventional methods. Detecting events using seismic migration removes the need for phase association. The event detector runs on a stack of time shifted traces, which increases S/N and thus allows for a low detection threshold. Detected events come with an origin time and a location estimate, enabling a focused trace analysis, including P- and S-phase recognition, to discard false detections and build a basis for accurate automatic phase picking. We apply the migration based detection algorithm to data from a semi-permanent seismic network at Hengill, an active volcanic region with several geothermal production sites in southwest Iceland. The network includes 26 stations with inter-station distances down to 5 km. Results show a high success rate compared to the manually picked catalogue (up to 90% detected). New detections, that were missed by the standard detection routine, show a generally good ratio of true to false alarms, i.e. most of the new events are locatable.",

            "abstract": "Quick clay can liquefy under increased stress and is responsible for major landslides in Sweden, Norway and Canada, but despite extensive investigations delineating quick clay remains a challenge. As part of a large multidisciplinary project, this study focuses on an area prone to quick-clay landslides in SW Sweden. P- and S-wave seismic, electrical resistivity tomography, and RMT (radio-magnetotelluric) data obtained in 2011 (Malehmir et al. 2013) suggested the presence of a coarse-grained layer of variable thickness sandwiched between clays, with quick clay above. The coarse-grained layer was assumed to accelerate the formation of quick clay, influencing its thickness. Additional geophysical data (reflection and refraction seismic, and RMT) and studies of three boreholes drilled in 2013, with the aim to intersect the coarse-grained layer, extended the area covered in 2011. Here we report on four seismic profiles (total length 3.5 km) acquired in 2013, combined with side-scan and single channel reflection seismic data along a river, which was believed to be important in the context of quick-clay landslides. Wireless (50-1C-10 Hz and 24-3C-broadband) and cabled sensors (323-28 Hz), 4-10 m apart, were used for the data acquisition of the longest profile (nearly 2 km long). Dynamite, accelerated weight-drop and sledgehammer were used as seismic sources. Simultaneous data acquisition for two parallel profiles, about 300 m apart, provides additional information. Preliminary results delineate the bedrock and its undulation near and in the river. We believe that overlying reflections are caused by the coarse-grained materials, whose lateral extension is considerably larger than previously thought. This may imply a wider area containing quick clay and hence at risk of slope failure. The new data and previous results are combined to construct a high-resolution 3D subsurface model that focuses on the coarse-grained layer and potential quick-clay areas. \nMalehmir A, Bastani M, Krawzyck C, Gurk M, Ismail N, Polom U, Persson L (2013) Geophysical assessment and geotechnical investigation of quick-clay landslides—a Swedish case study.

            "abstract": "Following the work of Saevik et al. (Transp. Porous Media, 2013; Geophys. Prosp., 2014), we investigate the ability of classical inclusion-based effective medium theories to predict the macroscopic permeability of a fractured rock mass. The fractures are assumed to be thin, oblate spheroids, and are treated as porous media in their own right, with permeability kf, and are embedded in a homogeneous matrix having permeability km. At very low fracture densities, the effective permeability is given exactly by a well-known expression that goes back at least as far as Fricke (Phys. Rev., 1924). For non-trivial fracture densities, an effective medium approximation must be employed. We have investigated several such approximations: Maxwell’s method, the differential method, and the symmetric and asymmetric versions of the self-consistent approximation. The predictions of the various approximate models are tested against the results of explicit numerical simulations, averaged over numerous statistical realizations for each set of parameters.\nEach of the various effective medium approximations satisfies the Hashin-Shtrikman (H-S) bounds. Unfortunately, these bounds are much too far apart to provide quantitatively useful estimates of keff. For the case of zero matrix permeability, the well-known approximation of Snow, which is based on network considerations rather than a continuum approach, is shown to essentially coincide with the upper H-S bound, thereby proving that the commonly made assumption that Snow’s equation is an “upper bound” is indeed correct. This problem is actually characterized by two small parameters, the aspect ratio of the spheroidal fractures, α, and the permeability ratio, κ = km/kf. Two different regimes can be identified, corresponding to α < κ and κ < α, and expressions for each of the effective medium approximations are developed in both regimes. In both regimes, the symmetric version of the self-consistent approximation is the most accurate.",

In this study, the impact of the severe drought on a mixed evergreen subtropical forest ecosystem was analyzed using eddy covariance measurements from a newly established flux tower at Ningxiang county of Hunan Province and simulations with the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) driven by high resolution forcing data from China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System and the in-situ meteorological data. When soil moisture reduced from 0.35 m3 m-3 to 0.12 m3 m-3, both vegetation productivity and evapotranspiration (ET) experienced a strong reduction in July-August period due to drought-induced stomatal closure. Results also showed that the ecosystem respiration (Reco) decreased together with gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), instead of accelerating with the increase of temperature under extremely dry soil condition (< 0.14 m3 m-3). As a balance of the carbon uptake and release, the magnitude of net ecosystem productivity also experienced a large reduction from 11.8 to 7.7 μmol m-2 s-1 and the ecosystem even switched to a net source of carbon. In addition, persistent soil water content deficit in summer limited the plant water uptake and led to a reduction of the stomatal conductance, which weakened the coupling relationship between carbon and water fluxes. Water availability severely limited the carbon sequestration of the targeted ecosystem with water use efficiency (WUE) plummeted during the drought period. With high quality of meteorological forcing data, CLM4.5 captured the variability of water fluxes during the growing season quite well with correlation coefficients of 0.95 for soil moisture and 0.82 for ET, except for an underestimation of GEP at the end of drought period. Further improvement in simulating the response to drought in subtropical forest ecosystem is required.",

Mixed-phase clouds are an integral part of the Arctic system, for precipitation and for their interactions with radiation and the local thermodynamics. Mixed-phase processes are often poorly represented in global models and many use an empirically based diagnostic partition between the liquid and ice phase that is dependent solely on temperature. However, increasingly more complex microphysical parameterizations are being implemented allowing a more physical representation of mixed-phase clouds.\nThis study uses in situ observations from the ASCOS campaign in the central Arctic to evaluate the impact of a change from a diagnostic to a prognostic parameterization of mixed-phase clouds and increased vertical resolution in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The newer cloud scheme improves the representation of the vertical structure of mixed-phase clouds, with supercooled liquid water at cloud top and ice precipitating below, improved further with higher vertical resolution. Increased supercooled liquid water and decreased ice content are both in closer agreement with observations. However, these changes do not result in any substantial improvement in surface radiation and there remains a warm and moist bias in the lowest part of the atmosphere. Both schemes also fail to capture the transitions from overcast to cloud-free conditions. Moreover, whereas the observed cloud layer is frequently decoupled from the surface, in the model the cloud remains coupled to the surface most of the time. The changes implemented to the cloud scheme are an important step forward in improving the representation of Arctic clouds, but improvements in other aspects such as boundary layer turbulence, cloud radiative properties, sensitivity to low aerosol concentrations and representation of the sea-ice surface may also need to be addressed.",

The target of exploration are typically fault damage zones associated with graben bounding normal faults that allow the migration of hot fluids. Within the Kemaliye concession, located at the northern margin of the Gediz Graben, more than 300 MT/AMT stations were acquired in order to image the geometry of the basement and infer the location of major faults. In addition, time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) measurements were acquired at each site to be able to correct for static-shift.\nWe present 3D inversion results for this dataset using a novel inversion technique that simultaneously inverts for a conductivity model and the four parameters of the full distortion matrix at each site. Using this approach results in a better recovery of structures and less artefacts for the near-surface compared to inversion without any correction. We will demonstrate how this approach works in practice and compare the recovered distortion parameters with the static-shift correction inferred from the TDEM measurements. A comparison with recently drilled boreholes in the area allows us to further verify the accuracy of our inversion results.",

            "abstract": "In this study we assess the impact of climate change on water resources by using uncorrected and bias corrected data from the regional climate model REMO simulations over the Senegal River Basin. Both simulations were used as input of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology – Hydrological Model over the Upper Senegal Basin.Applying the bias correction simulations of present day climate (1971-2000) substantially improved for both temporal and spatial variations of the analyzed climate parameters (precipitation, temperature) when compared to observations and independent station data. Additionally, the bias corrected input give better representation of the mean river flow, the low flows (10th percentile) and the high flows (90thpercentile) at the outlet of the USB.For the future, the regional climate model projections for precipitation show a general decrease by the end of 21stcentury (2071-2100) for both scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and datasets in the majority of the basin, except the Guinean highlands where a slight increase is found. In case of the potential changes of the maximum consecutive number of dry days and wet days, the northern basin is likely to face the most pronounced increase of dry days and decrease of wet days, although slight increase of heavy rainfall is found with similar spatial patterns in both data. Furthermore, a general temperature increase is projected over the entire basin for both scenarios, but more pronounced under the RCP8.5 scenario. Warm night’s percent is found to be higher than warm day’s percent. As for the potential changes of the basin’s hydrology, a general decrease of river discharge, runoff, actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture is found under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in all simulations. The decrease is higher under RCP8.5 with uncorrected data in the northern basin. However, there are some localized increases of runoff in some parts of the basin. Furthermore, the available water resources are projected to substantially decrease by more than -50% in the majority of the basin for all data, except the southern basin in Guinea where no change is projected.The impact of the bias correction on the projected climate change signal, affects mainly the magnitude of the signal rather than its direction of change although some alterations may occur in particular months and localities.",

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of coastal drought has a different dynamic from upland droughts that are typically characterized by agricultural, hydrologic, meteorological, and(or) socio-economic impacts. Because of the uniqueness of drought impacts on coastal ecosystems, a coastal drought index (CDI) that uses existing salinity datasets for sites in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida was developed using an approach similar to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). CDIs characterizing the 1- to 24-month salinity conditions were developed and the evaluation of the CDI indicates that the index can be used for different estuary types (for example, brackish, olioghaline, or mesohaline), for regional comparison between estuaries, and as an index for wet conditions (high freshwater inflow) in addition to drought conditions. Unlike the SPI where long-term precipitation datasets of 50 to 100 years are available for computing the index, there are a limited number of salinity data sets of greater than 10 or 15 years for computing the CDI. To evaluate the length of salinity record necessary to compute the CDI, a 29-year dataset was resampled into 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year interval datasets. Comparison of the CDI for the different periods of record show that the range of salinity conditions in the 10-, 15-, and 20-year datasets were similar and results were a close approximation to the CDI computed by using the full period of record. The CDI computed with the 5-year dataset had the largest differences with the CDI computed with the 29-year dataset but did provide useful information on coastal drought and freshwater conditions.\nAn ongoing National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) drought early warning project in the Carolinas is developing ecological linkages to the CDI and evaluating the effectiveness of the CDI as a prediction tool for adaptation planning for future droughts. However, identifying potential coastal drought response datasets is a challenge. Coastal drought is a relatively new concept and existing datasets may not have been collected or understood as “drought response” datasets. We have considered drought response datasets including tree growth and liter fall, harmful algal blooms occurrence, Vibrio infection occurrence, shellfish harvesting data, and shark attacks.",

This geomagnetic storm has been considered as one of strongest storms in the solar cycle 24 where, the Dst index reached a minimum of −227 nT at 23:00 UT (17/03/2015) with KP reaching to 8-, and the monthly mean F10.7 solar flux was 125 sfu. This space weather event was studied using a large network of 110 GPS stations. It has been noticed that the Total Electron Content (TEC) was severely disturbed during the geomagnetic storm main and recovery phases.\nA wavelike oscillation with three peaks is observed from equator to low latitudes during the storm main phase on 17th and 18th March, 2015. Using a latitudinal chain of 8 GPS stations from equatorial region to low latitudes the storm time behavior of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) is investigated. It was noticed that the wavelike oscillation peak latitudinal extent decreases from the beginning of main phase to the recovery phase. The first maximum extends beyond from 2oS to 20oS, the second one from 8oS to 18oS and the third one from 13oS to 17oS. In addition, a strong negative phase in TEC variations is observed during the recovery phase on March 18, 2015. This negative phase is found to be stronger at low-latitude compared to the equatorial region. An anomalous behavior of EIA caused by the wavelike oscillations is observed during the main phase on March 17, 2015. Also, due to the strong negative phase in TEC resulted in strong EIA suppression on March 18, 2015.\n  ",

            "abstract": "A data assimilation (DA) framework is established to characterize the geomechanical response of a strongly compartmentalized hydrocarbon reservoir. The available observations over the offshore gas field consist of a bathymetric survey carried out before and at the end of the ten-year production life. The time-lapse map of vertical displacements is used to infer the most important parameter characterizing the reservoir compaction, i.e. the rock formation compressibility cm. The methodology is tested for two different conceptual models: (a) cm varies with depth and the vertical effective stress (heterogeneity due to lithostratigrafic variability) and (b) cm also varies horizontally within the stratigraphic unit. The latter hypothesis is made to account for the behavior of the partitioned reservoir due to the presence of sealing faults and thrusts, which suggest the idea of a block heterogeneous cm. The calibration of the geomechanical parameters is obtain with the aid of the Ensemble Smoother algorithm, that is, an ensemble-based DA analysis scheme. In scenario (b), the number of reservoirs blocks dictates the set of uncertain parameters, whereas scenario (a) is characterized by only one uncertain parameter. The outcome from scenario (a) indicates that DA is effective in reducing the cm uncertainty. However, the maximum measured settlement is underestimated with an overestimation of the areal extent of the subsidence bowl. Significant improvements are obtained in scenario (b) where the maximum model overestimate is reduced by about 25% and an overall good match of the measured bathymetry is achieved.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 470 million years ago one of the largest cosmic catastrophes occurred in our solar system since the accretion of the planets. A 200-km large asteroid was disrupted by a collision in the Main Asteroid Belt (MAB), which spawned fragments into Earth crossing orbits. This had tremendous consequences for the meteorite production and cratering rate during several millions of years following the event. The 7.5-km wide Lockne crater, central Sweden, is known to be a member of this family. The 600 m large Lockne asteroid was a binary and had a companion in space by a smaller 150 m satellite. The recent discovery of the nearby, 0.7-km diameter, synchronous Målingen crater suggests it to form a doublet impact structure together with the larger Lockne crater, and as we will show here, most likely by a binary, ‘rubble pile’ asteroid. Despite observational evidence that about 16% of the Near Earth Asteroids (NEA’s) are binary, only a handful of the approximately 188 known craters on Earth have been suggested as potential doublets. The stratigraphic and geographic relationship with Lockne suggests the Lockne and Målingen craters to be the first described doublet impact structure by a binary asteroid into a marine-target setting. In addition, the precise dating of the Lockne-Målingen impact in relation to the MAB breakup event provides a hands-on reference for studies of the formation of binaries from asteroid breakup events.",

More intense and larger TCs, with higher waves, form when ocean temperature is increased. The maximum significant wave height increases more than the maximum wind speed for TCs up to hurricane force wind. However, above hurricane force wind the change in maximum wind speed is similar or greater than the change in maximum significant wave height. This can be explained by the wind drag coefficient decreasing as wind speed exceeds hurricane force wind, so that the growth of waves is dampened. The areal footprint of wave height grows considerably more than the maximum as ocean temperature is increased. This suggests a large increase in the surface area of damaging waves generated by TCs may be the dominant impact of a future warmer ocean.",

The Heletz area is located in the Southern part of the Mediterranean Coastal Plain, about 7 km from the sea shore. The target layer is composed of sandstone, has a thickness of around 20 meters and is located at a depth of 1500 m.\nFlow-through laboratory experiments of CO2-rich brine were realized to evaluate the chemical processes occurring in the Heletz site. The Heletz sandstone rock is poorly consolidated and has a high porosity (around 23%) and connectivity.\nWe performed four flow-through experiments at in situ storage conditions (T = 60ºC, P = 15 MPa, PCO2 =1.8 MPa). The flow rates injection were 0.05 and 0.30 mL.min-1. Two different brine solutions were used, both representative of the Heletz reservoir native water. The first one was a synthetic brine of the Heletz reservoir (closed to seawater). The second one was the first one equilibrated with gypsum.\nThe results show an increase in permeability for all the percolation experiment whatever the flow rate and the brine solution. This is explained by the dissolution of ankerite, dolomite and feldspar. We observed that the permeability increase is higher and faster for high flow rate injection than for low flow rate. Precipitation of secondary phases is characterized such as gypsum during equilibrated-gypsum brine injection. Secondary clay minerals precipitation is also observed near feldspar dissolution.\nModeling these experiments is a non-trivial task, as some chemical processes are local in space. Reactive transport models have been performed in order to understand and reproduce the observed processes. We have used a water mixing approach which uses the mass mixing fraction between mobile and/or immobile zones. The approach relies in the fact of not transporting species or components, but the containing waters. This allows decoupling chemistry calculation from solute transport modelling.",

In particular, induced magnetizations for which the inducing field (i.e., the Earth's main magnetic field) is known can be recovered uniquely. In the case of general (vertically integrated) magnetizations, one does not get uniqueness but one can at least recover more contributions than without the additional assumption of local support.

In this study, gridded observations, TRMM rainfall and Meteosat-7 IR brightness temperature datasets were analyzed, the time-longitude diagrams and the composite analyses show that the two-day periodicity is related to westward propagating convection with propagation speed ~12m/s and zonal spatial scale ~2000km.\nIn order to examine the vertical structure of the two-day convective disturbances, high-vertical resolution upper-air sounding data and the combined KAZR/S-Pol radar data (only available at Gan Island, 0.69°S, 73.15°E) from DYNAMO were also used to construct composite fields over a 48-hour period centered at the maximum rain rate of these precipitating events.\nThe composited moisture, stability, temperature anomaly and cloud radiative effect reveal a distinct pattern of convective evolution – shallow convection to deep convection to stratiform precipitation – similar to that observed on longer time scales all the way up to that of the MJO.

            "abstract": "An open question in the experimental study of surface processes is how basin water depth controls the dynamics of delta distributary channels. A recently suggested idea as to the issue is that, if a set of peculiar conditions is assumed, all of delta progradation, channel migration, alluvial aggradation and attainment of, or how close to, alluvial grade can be given by an identical formula with the same numerical value that is specified with dimensionless basin water depth. As one step ahead from this notion, we here report the finding obtained from a new series of tank experiments that basin water depth can also affect the modes by which active distributary channels change their locations, i.e. which one of avulsion and continuous shifting is predominant over the other. The results of the experiments clearly indicate that continuous shifting tends to become more predominant over avulsion as basin water depth increases. This tendency is related to a progressive decrease/increase in rate of alluvial aggradation which directly controls avulsion frequency. The present experimental notion can be examined with stratigraphic records of river deltas that accumulated with increasing or decreasing basin water depth.",

Relative to year 1980, simulated surface BC concentrations in year 2010 increased by 0.21 µg m–3 (29%) averaged over China. The corresponding all-sky direct radiative forcing of BC at the top of the atmosphere increased by 0.35 W m–2 (51%). Considering variations in both meteorological parameters and emissions for 1980–2010, simulated annual mean surface BC concentrations averaged over China were in the range of ~0.7–1.0 µg m–3 and showed decadal trends of 0.31, –0.20, 0.16 µg m–3 decade–1, respectively, in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The associated interannual variations were –20 to 15%, 0.068 µg m–3, and 7.7%, respectively, for the values of deviation from the mean, mean absolute deviation, and absolute percent departure from the mean. Model sensitivity simulations indicated that the decadal trends of surface BC concentrations were mainly driven by changes in emissions, while the interannual variations were dependent on variations of both emissions and meteorological parameters. We also found that the strength of the East Asian monsoon (either summer or winter monsoon) negatively correlated with surface BC concentrations in eastern China (20–45° N, 110–125° E) (r = -0.7), mainly by the changes in atmospheric circulation. Relative to the five strongest monsoon years, simulated surface BC concentrations over eastern China were higher by 2–10% in the five weakest monsoon years.",

We aim at extending our understanding of such types of interaction by looking at intermediate states between weakly sputtering planetary obstacle and ionosphere-rich obstacles. We present results from our hybrid model AIKEF of planetary obstacles, using a Chapman profile for the ionosphere, and characterize them using currents flowing around the interaction region. Among our results, we evaluate the ionospheric conductivity at each obstacle related to its ionospheric production, giving an estimation of the ion production that triggers a bow shock. We explore two cases of ionospheric species, hydrogen and oxygen, separately. Results show that an oxygen generated ionosphere requires less production to trigger a bow shock than a hydrogen-generated ionosphere, as well as differences in the pick-up process and the induced asymmetry of the interaction region. The final results are summarized into three-dimensional schematics representing qualitative changes when tweaking the production.",

            "abstract": "Images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal fresh craters on Mars that are known to be recent as they are constrained by before and after images (Daubar et al., 2013). In particular, on Nov. 19, 2013 an image acquired by HiRISE, ESP_034285_1835, observed a 25 m diameter fresh crater located at 3.7° N, 53.4° E. This impact occurred between July 2010 and May 2012, as constrained by Context camera (CTX) images. Because the terrain where the crater formed is dusty, the fresh crater appears blue in the enhanced color of the HiRISE image, due to removal of the reddish dust in that area.\nWe analyze this crater using the iSALE shock physics code (Amsden et al., 1980, Collins et al., 2004, Ivanov et al., 1997, Melosh et al., 1992, Wünnemann et al., 2006) to model the formation of this impact structure which is ~25 m in diameter and ~ 2.5 - 3 m in depth. These values are obtained from the DTM profile we have generated. We model the Martian surface considering different target compositions as regolith and fractured basalt rock and we based our simulations on a basalt projectile with a porosity of 10% (which is derived from the average of the meteorite types proposed by Britt et al., 2002) that hits the Martian surface with a beginning velocity equal to 7 km/s (Le Feuvre & Wieczorek, 2011) and an impact angle of 90°. The projectile size is around 1 m and it is estimated from the comparison between the DTM profile and the profiles obtained by numerical modelling. The primary objective of this analysis is the detailed study of the ejecta, in fact we will track the ejecta coming from the simulation and compare them to the ejecta distribution computed on the image (the ejecta reached a distance of more than 15 km). From the matching of the simulated ejecta with their real distribution, we will be able to understand the goodness of the simulation and also put constraints on the target material.",

Identifying the locations of the slopes will help reduce the risk of disasters, by avoiding building infrastructure and properties nearby, or if they are already there, by applying appropriate counter measures before it suddenly moves. In this study, airborne LiDAR data was analyzed to find their geomorphic characteristics to use for extracting their locations. The study site was set in the suburb of Sapporo City, Hokkaido in Japan. The area is underlain by Andesite and Tuff and prone to landslides. Slope angle and surface roughness were calculated from 5 m resolution DEM. These filters were chosen because colluvial materials deposit at around the angle of repose and accumulation of loose materials was considered to form a peculiar surface texture differentiable from other slope types. Field survey conducted together suggested that colluvial slopes could be identified by the filters with a probability of 80 percent. Repeat LiDAR monitoring of the site by an unmanned helicopter indicated that those slopes detected as colluviums appeared to be moving at a slow rate. In comparison with a similar study from the crushed zone in Japan, the range of slope angle indicative of colluviums agreed with the Sapporo site, while the texture was rougher due to larger debris composing the slopes.",

However, obtaining the detailed spatial distribution of θs through a large amount of field point samples for a field area is an arduous task. To efficiently derive the distribution of θs for a field area, this study proposed a method that integrates hydraulic head and gravity measurements by using hydraulic tomography (HT) method. A synthetic case is used to demonstrate the capability of the developed method. Our preliminary results show that gravity measurements are helpful to constrain the estimated distribution of θs. By comparing the results estimated by the proposed method with that of original HT, the uncertainty of the distribution of θs estimated by the proposed method is improved. Our studies show that the proposed method is practicable and could be useful to reduce the uncertainty of field-scale characterization.",

This project is a component of large multi-disciplinary geoscience project on the ‘Distal Footprints of Giant Ore Systems’. The Capricorn Orogen, a largely Proterozoic orogenic belt, is being used as a natural laboratory to develop methods for exploring for mineral deposits ‘under cover’.\nThe MT dataset consists of a total of 240 broadband magnetotelluric stations (BBMT) and 84 long period stations (LMT). Analysis of the dataset reveals the area to have complex 3-D variations in electrical conductivity, making 3-D interpretation methods essential.\nThe first 3-D inversion model encompasses south-eastern part of the Capricorn Orogen (Padbury-Bryah Basins) and the adjoining Yilgarn Craton, and involves the inversion of 58 BBMT sites. The results shown a prominent resistive feature that is tentatively correlated with the northern boundary of the Yilgarn Craton. Apart from this, the other main geoelectrical feature is a high conductivity body located within the Yilgarn Craton. This structure could be related to tectonic features associated with the accretion of the different terranes composing this part of the craton. Forward models were used to validate these and other structures.\nMajor faults occurring at cratonic margins are known to be important indicators of increased prospectivity and our preliminary results suggest MT surveys are a useful tool for regional scale exploration in the study area.",

We selected the 185 profiles of slab dips in subduction zones on the basis of subduction geometry model slab 1.0. For each profile, partial or entire slab dips were estimated using a linear regression to minimize the statistical uncertainty of the slab dips. Estimated slab dips were then compared with the age of subducting oceanic lithosphere, plate speed as determined from Euler pole conversion, and the strength of slab pull caused by viscous mantle flow. We found that the age of subducting oceanic lithosphere is the most contributing factor in determining the geometry of the slab dips. Correlation between the slab dips and the age of subducting oceanic lithosphere changes significantly at 80 Ma, as steeper (shallower) dips dominant for older (younger) oceanic floor. Such age-dependent variation of steeper slab dips was prominent at southern Sumatra, Marianas, northern Japan-Kuril, and northern Peru-Chile.",

Especially, optical remote sensing tools for atmospheric monitoring have the potential to measure integrally CO2 emissions over larger scales (> 10.000m2). Within the framework of the MONACO project (“Monitoring approach for geological CO2 storage sites using a hierarchical observation concept”), an integrative hierarchical monitoring concept was developed and validated at different field sites with the aim to establish a modular observation strategy including investigations in the shallow subsurface, at ground surface level and the lower atmospheric boundary layer.\nThe main aims of the atmospheric monitoring using optical remote sensing were the observation of the gas dispersion in to the near-surface atmosphere, the determination of maximum concentration values and identification of the main challenges associated with the monitoring of extended emission sources with the proposed methodological set up under typical environmental conditions. The presentation will give an overview about several case studies using the integrative approach of Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (OP FTIR) in combination with in situ measurements. As a main result, the method was validated as possible approach for continuous monitoring of the atmospheric composition, in terms of integral determination of GHG concentrations and to identify target areas which are needed to be investigated more in detail. Especially the data interpretation should closely consider the micrometeorological conditions. Technical aspects concerning robust equipment, experimental set up and fast data processing algorithms have to be taken into account for the enhanced automation of atmospheric monitoring.",

Clay rich sedimentary rocks in Paleo-Mesoproterozoic strata deposited stably in the Yanshan-Taihangshan aulacogen (YTA), North China Craton (NCC), which created a unique opportunity to investigate the marine redox chemistry.\nOur Fe speciation analysis involved totally 48 samples from the black shale of the Chuanlinggou Formation (~1650 Ma), the mud shale of the Gaoyuzhuang Formation (~1560 Ma) and the black shale of the Xiamaling Formation (~1380 Ma) cropped out in Hebei Province, North China. Of all the 48 samples, 19 of them from Chuanlinggou Formation have FePy/FeHR ratios well below 0.8, while 14 of those have FeHR/FeT values above 0.15. For the 9 samples from Gaoyuzhuang Formation, their FeHR/FeT values are generally above 0.15, while 8 of them have FePy/FeHR ratios well below 0.8. For the 21 samples from Xiamaling Formation, 19 of them have FePy/FeHR values below 0.8, among which 13 samples have FeHR/FeT values above 0.15. Although a few samples analysed are more or less weathered, these data can still point to widespread ferruginous instead of sulfidic conditions over these three stratigraphic units.\nAbundant Fe containing carbonate concretions have been found in the shale of the Xiamaling Formation, which are significant in revealing the early burial and diagenetic marine environment. Our X-ray diffraction and rock magnetism studies reveal that the major minerals in the concretions are ferron dolomite and siderite, without any signs of sulphide of iron. These results imply that the concretions in the Xiamaling Formation were formed in ferruginous.\nOur analysis suggests a ferruginous condition was maintained throughout the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic (~1650 Ma to ~1380 Ma) in the YTA, a typical intracontinental rift basin developed in the interior of the Nuna supercontinent. Our results are in agreement with the previous study (Planavsky et al., 2011), the ferruginous conditions were both spatially and temporally extensive across the global ocean during the mid-Proterozoic.\nPlanavsky et al., 2011, Nature, 477(7365): 448-451.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of the Western Mediterranean is a highly debated question by geologists and geophysicists. Even though most scientists agree in considering slab roll-back to be the driving mechanism of the tectonic evolution of this area, there is still no consensus about the initial setup and its time evolution. A recent model proposed by Vergés and Fernàndez (2012) suggests a lateral change in subduction polarity of the Ligurian-Thetys oceanic domain to explain the formation and evolution of the Betic-Rif orogenic system and the associated Alboran back-arc basin. Such geodynamic scenario is also proposed for different converging regions. The aim of this study is to analyze the dynamic evolution of a double-polarity subduction process and its consequences in order to test the physical feasibility of this interaction and provide geometries and evolutions comparable to those proposed for the Western Mediterranean. The 3D numerical model of double-polarity subduction is carried out via the Underworld framework. Tectonic plate behavior is described by equations of fluid dynamics in the presence of several different phases. Underworld solves a non-linear Stokes flow problem using Finite Elements combined with particle-in-cell approach, thus the discretization combines a standard Eulerian Finite Element mesh with Lagrangian particles to track the location of the phases. The final model consists of two oceanic plates with viscoplastic rheology subducting into the upper mantle and the problem is driven by Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The main factors to be studied are the interaction between the two plates, the poloidal and toroidal mantle fluxes, the velocity variations of slabs, the stress distribution and the variations in the trench morphology.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between Tropical Cyclones (TCs) and ocean is a major mechanism responsible for energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean. TCs affect the thermal and dynamical structure of the ocean, but the magnitude of the impact is still uncertain. Very few CMIP5 models demonstrated ability in representing TCs, mainly due to their horizontal resolution. We aim to improve TCs representation in next CMIPs experiments through the new CMCC-CESM-NEMO General Circulation Model, having a horizontal resolution of ¼ degree in both atmospheric and ocean components. The model is capable to represent realistically TCs up to Cat-4 Typhoons. The wind structure associated with TCs is responsible for two important atmosphere–ocean feedbacks: the first feedback — positive — is driven by the latent heat associated with the enhanced evaporation rate and leads to an increase of the available energy for TC. The second feedback — negative — is due to the cold water upwelling induced by the increased wind stress at the ocean surface and by the shear-induced mixing at the base of the mixed layer. The second feedback is responsible for a significant cooling of the sea surface, leading to a weakening of the cyclone intensity due to the reduction of the total heat flux into the atmosphere. Furthermore TC intensification, intensity, and lifetime strongly depend on their transitional speed. A good representation of the TC-Ocean interaction strongly depends on the coupling frequency between the atmospheric and the ocean components, especially when simulating fast moving TCs. In this work, we investigate the role of the coupling frequency in representing the two mentioned feedbacks using the new fully coupled General Circulation Model developed at CMCC.",

            "abstract": "Equilibrium climate sensitivity is one measure that is frequently used to predict long-term climate change in GCMs. Despite much research over the last decades, little progress has been made in constraining the uncertainty on climate sensitivity. One reason for this is the fact that the climate has a strong internal variability on many time scales, is subject to a non-stationary forcing and mostly out of equilibrium with the changes in the radiative forcing.\nPalaeo records of past climate variations can give insight into how the climate system responds to various forcings although care must be taken of the slow feedback processes at comparing palaeo climate sensitivity estimates with estimates from (short time scale) model simulations. In addition, for the late Pleistocene ice age cycles it has been shown from both proxy data and a conceptual climate model that climate sensitivity varies considerably between the cold and warm phases because the fast feedback processes change their relative strength over one cycle. Records of past CO2 and temperature together with 3D ice sheet model results extending back into the Pliocene suggest yet another value for the climate sensitivity in the warmer Pliocene.\nHere we use a conceptual model with known dynamics modelling the late Pleistocene ice ages to explore how climate sensitivity can be estimated from the model time series. Extracting the climate sensitivity from the relation between radiative forcing and global mean temperature leads to strongly state dependent behaviour and even negative values for climate sensitivity at rapid transitions into the deep glacial states. The degree to which the system is out of equilibrium and its relation to the equilibrium assumption of climate sensitivity needs therefore to be taken into account. Furthermore, Milankovitch forcing is generally not considered in palaeo climate sensitivity estimates. In the model time series we show how the sensitivity to Milankovitch forcing can be accounted for in an estimate of the climate sensitivity.",

We study inherent natural length scales that govern these flow processes and constrain the spatial range of their representation by continuum models. These inherent length scales reflect interactions between intrinsic porous medium properties that affect liquid phase continuity, and the interplay among forces that drive and resist unsaturated flow. We have defined an intrinsic length scale for hydraulic continuity based on pore size distribution that controls soil evaporation dynamics (i.e., stage 1 to stage 2 transition). This simple metric may be used to delineate upper bounds for regional evaporative losses or the depth of soil-atmosphere interactions (in the absence of plants). A similar length scale governs the dynamics of internal redistribution towards attainment of field capacity, again through its effect on hydraulic continuity in the draining porous medium. The study provides a framework for guiding numerical and mathematical models for capillary flows across different scales considering the necessary conditions for coexistence of stationarity (REV), hydraulic continuity and intrinsic capillary gradients.",

            "abstract": "Interstellar pick-up ions (PUIs) are used to study in-situ the interstellar flow through the heliosphere. The locations of the peaks of the downwind focusing cone and the upwind crescent as observed in the PUI flux have been used as signatures for the flow direction of neutral interstellar (ISN) gas into the heliosphere. We study the modulation of interstellar He, Ne, and O PUI along the Earth orbit over almost the entire solar activity cycle from 2002 to 2013. We present the expected density of ISN atoms and the resulting PUI fluxes with their modulation due to varying ionization over the solar cycle. Considering the important role of the finite injection speed of ISN atoms and of adiabatic PUI cooling, we show that Ne and O always form an upwind crescent in the PUI flux, but that the crescent formation for He PUIs strongly depends on the integration boundaries for the PUI distribution. Because the crescent has been observed for all three species, we find that the classical model of PUI evolution by Vasyliunas & Siscoe (1976) may not be sufficient to reproduce the upwind structure of He PUIs. We also find that ecliptic longitude of the PUI peak in the focusing cone is a good proxy for the inflow direction of ISN He and Ne during solar minimum, but not for ISN O, which exhibits a systematic shift in the model. On the other hand, the peak location derived from the crescent may not be a good proxy to determine the inflow longitude because it is highly modulated by short-time (few months) variations in the ionization losses. These lead to a corrugated crescent structure and may shift the fitted position of the crescent peak used to determine the inflow direction by up to 10°, with the strongest effects for the species that are heavily affected by ionization, i.e., O and Ne. These findings are in a qualitative agreement with results of in-situ PUI measurements, which showed that the location of PUI maximum varies.",

            "abstract": "Defining an appropriate forecasting model is a key phase in water resources planning and design. Quantification of uncertainty is an important step in the development and application of hydrologic models. In this study, we examine the dependency of hydrologic model uncertainty on the observed model inputs, defined model structure, parameter optimization identifiability and identified likelihood. We present here a new uncertainty metric, the Quantile Flow Deviation or QFD, to evaluate the relative uncertainty due to each of these sources under a range of catchment conditions. Through the metric, we may identify the potential spectrum of uncertainty and variability in model simulations. The QFD assesses uncertainty by estimating the deviation in flows at a given quantile across a range of scenarios. By using a quantile based metric, the change in uncertainty across individual percentiles can be assessed, thereby allowing uncertainty to be expressed as a function of time. The QFD method can be disaggregated to examine any part of the modelling process including the selection of certain model subroutines or forcing data. Case study results (including catchments in Australia and USA) suggest that model structure selection is vital irrespective of the flow percentile of interest or the catchment being studied. Examining the QFD across various quantiles additionally demonstrates that lower yielding catchments may have greater variation due to selected model structures. By incorporating multiple model structures, it is possible to assess (i) the relative importance of various sources of uncertainty, (ii) how these vary with the change in catchment location or hydrologic regime; and (iii) the impact of the length of available observations in uncertainty quantification.",

            "abstract": "Cropland area has been expanded in Brazil and by now the agricultural sector has been calculated as the major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). This state was preceded by the conversion of natural ecosystems, which inevitably causes changes in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the soil. However, detailed model and measurement approaches are lacking for sound national estimates. Here we present data from model driven measurement campaigns from different ecosystems and the results of a review of available data on annual N2O fluxes throughout Brazil. Contrary to expectations, emissions from agricultural land (0.80 kg N ha-1 yr-1) tended to be lower than from rainforest (2.29 kg N ha-1­­ yr-1). At the same time, N-fertilization did not lead to a relevant increase in annual N­­2O emissions. Moreover, pastures showed an age-related decrease in emissions: median annual emissions from young pastures (≤ 10 years) were 2.52 kg N ha-1, whereas old pastures (> 10 years) emitted 0.90 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Since N2O is known to react very sensitively to changes (for example dry-wet changes), it is likely that high emissions occur during actual land conversions. Consequently, our own measurement campaigns concentrated on the transitional period from dry to wet season, as already predicted by previously performed model simulations. Results from these short-term measurements supported the findings of the review, regarding land use-specific differences in N2O-N fluxes, but did not support our assumptions of emission pulses after rewetting of the soil. Applied process-oriented models performed quite well on the studied sites, but better adaptation is inevitable with regard to the possibility of more precise predictions and spatial extrapolation. This requires spatial and temporal higher resolved monitoring, in order to involve soil types, which have so far not been considered sufficiently, and capture short-term effects from precipitation and fertilizer events.",

In particular, unraveling stable vector information of ancient magnetic field would constraint thermal evolution of meteorites.

We tested the reliability of the ratio of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) to saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM). Although the uncertainty of TRM/SIRM was an order of magnitude larger than that of the high-fidelity Thellier-type estimation, the TRM/SIRM was especially useful when dealing with meteorites which are highly susceptible to alteration on exposure to external heat. The ratio of TRM/SIRM is grain-size dependent, as it is larger for finer grains. We also found that metal-poor silicates from highly differentiated planetary bodies tend to show higher ratio of TRM/SIRM.",

However, the same N-S trending lineaments were recognized to exist even though no surface ruptures occurred from the south of the Tabito-Nameishi to the boundary between the Fukushima and Ibaragi Prefectures. In the attempt to elucidate the differences of active and non-active segments of the fault, this report discusses the results of active segment.\nAll experiments were conducted using a rotary-shear low to high-velocity frictional testing apparatus at the State Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics, Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration. The apparatus is capable of producing slip rates of 60 mm/year to 2.1 m/s on a pair of cylindrical specimens of 40 mm in diameter, and temperature and pressure up to 500 degree in centigrade and 70 MPa by using TiAlCr alloy piston.\nGouge samples were taken from the thick fault gouge in crystalline shist at Betto outcrop, and gouge from the contact between sandstone and crystalline shist at Shionohira outcrop. They were dried in an oven for 20 hours at 60 degree in centigrade and were gently disaggregated to make gouge powder. Wet and dry gouge experiments have been conducted at the initial compression of fault gouge samples from 1 to 5 MPa, at slip rates from 0.0002 mm/s to 2.1 m/s and at normal stresses of 1.0 to 2.0 MPa. Friction strengthening or weakening behavior was also examined.\nThe results revealed high friction coefficients around 0.6 to 0.8 under non-porous conditions, but very low coefficients of around 0.1 to 0.2 under porous conditions for both outcrop samples. The results also indicated the sample taken from the active segment of Shionohira fault to show a velocity strengthening behavior, whereby the friction coefficient became slightly higher as velocity increased.",

            "abstract": "There is no question that human must produce additional 70% food to feed the new 2.2 billion of people on the planet by 2050, but the question is where to grow the additional food. The demand for the additional food lies not only in producing the basic resources needed to sustain a healthy lifestyle, but also from a changing diet, especially in rapidly developing countries in the dryland regions around the world. It is forecast that this demand for meat will require an additional 0.2 billion tons per year by 2050, which is almost a doubling of present meat consumption. These new demands create mounting pressures on agriculture and pastoral ecosystems and the reported trajectory of warmer and drier climate in the future increases uncertainties in food security, adding further stresses to the already stressed nations in the Asian dryland belt. Different approaches are being either proposed or practiced in the region but the question is whether or not the current practices are sustainable or optimal in addressing the emerging issues. Given the complexity and interplay among the food, water and energy, what are alternatives to ensure a sustainable trajectory of regional development to meet the new food demand? This presentation reviews existing practices and proposes alternative solutions, by specifically examining the trade-offs between different ecosystem services that drylands in Asian may provide. Preliminary analysis suggested that the current trajectory of meat and milk production is likely not on a sustainable pathway.",

Large variation ranges were observed for δD with (-35.3‰ to -77.1‰ in summer, -31.3‰ to -76.6‰ in winter) andδ18O (-4.8‰ to -10.3‰ in summer, -4.5‰ to -10.3‰ in winter). From the river head to the river mouth, the H and O isotope compositions of the river water collected in the high-discharge and low-discharge period display always a similar variation pattern. On the basis of isotopic composition of river water, the Xijiang River may be separated by three subbasins including the upper basin, the middle basin and the lower basin. The upper reached river water contains relatively low values of δD and δ18O. The values of δD and δ18O in the middle reaches are quite variable because of the middle basin severely disturbed through water impoundments. The lower reaches river water contains high values of δD and δ18O. The differences of δD and δ18O compositions between various tributaries and its effect to the δD and δ18O of the mainstream reflects also the constraint of the meteoric water to the Xijiang River. Evaporation has also important effect to the H and O isotope compositions of the Xijiang River, and it is found that evaporation can also raise the δD and δ18O values of the water during the dry season. Our investigation indicates that the H and O isotope tracing method can play a key role in studying the interaction between river water and other waters, such as the meteoric water, underground water, and lake water. The combination of proper H and O isotope study with conventional meteoric and hydrological investigation can be very helpful to understand the variation trend of water resource in the Xijiang River.",

            "abstract": "A period-of-record flow duration curve (FDC) represents the relationship between the magnitude and frequency of daily streamflows. Prediction of FDCs in ungauged basins is of great importance in those locations characterized by sparse, or more often missing, streamflow observations. We present a detailed comparison of two approaches which are capable of predicting an FDC in ungauged basins. An adaptation of the geostatistical method Top-kriging employs a linear weighted average of dimensionless empirical FDCs, standardized for a reference streamflow value. Weights are the result of the application of Top-kriging over a point index which, empirically, expresses the similarity between curves. Dimensional FDCs are then reconstructed developing a similar Top-kriging-based model capable of predicting the reference streamflow in the same sites. The second method is based on regional multiple linear regressions and is one of the most common method for prediction of FDCs in ungauged sites. Comparisons of these two methods are made at 182, mostly unregulated, river catchments in the southeastern U.S. using a three-fold cross-validation algorithm. Our results reveal that the two methods perform very similarly throughout flow-regimes, showing average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies of 0.566 and 0.662 in natural scale, while 0.883 and 0.829 in log-transformed scale, for the geostatistical and the linear regression models, respectively. However, some complementarities are shown in the very low-flow regime, i.e. duration greater than 0.95, where the two models highlight different behaviors whether considering natural or log-transformed streamflows.",

A large portion of dryland sub-Saharan Africa is under the influence of global climatic teleconnections that produces variability in the Earth’s climate. Areas where the vegetation has a strong response to climatic variability clearly exhibit the relationship between human well-being and the climate system. We define NPP supply as the annual amount of carbon that plants remove from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and store as biomass, and NPP demand is the annual amount of carbon required for food, feed and fuel and it drives land use changes such as the expansion of cropland, wood fuel extraction and pasture creation. In this poster, we present preliminary evidence to show that global climatic teleconnections regulate the NPP supply in Africa, while NPP demand increase as a function of demographic growth. Our results point to a scenario whereby the demand for NPP could outpace available supply. Increased climatic variability and extreme events could potentialy tilt this balance further by reducing NPP supply through intense droughts and floods.",

Due to a very low attenuation of radio waves in the ELF (extremely low frequency, below 3 kHz) range, very strong electromagnetic pulses can propagate round the globe several times before vanishing in the background noise. \nWe report on first simultaneous observations of Q-bursts with broadband ELF receivers (0.03 - 300 Hz) located at two continents. They are part of our World ELF Radiolocation Array (WERA) project. Our first broadband receiver was installed at the Hylaty geophysical station in Poland in 2013. In May 2015, we installed our second ELF station in Colorado, USA. Both stations continuously measure two magnetic field components: north-south and east-west. \nIn this work we analyze the waveforms of Q-bursts recorded simultaneously by these two broadband receivers. We compare them with the recordings from our previous generation ELF receiver (0.03 - 52 Hz) intended for Schumann resonance observations, which we run simultaneously at the Hylaty station. We also present our signal processing method that allows us to detect Q-bursts in ELF recordings.",

Values of Hf isotopes εHf (t) range from -23.6 to -17.5, suggesting that the DKG are products of reworked Archean crustal rocks. A similar sequence of tectonic events including the presence of 2.8-2.9 Ga tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneiss, metamorphic development of TTG gneiss at 1.9-2.0 Ga, and 1.85 Ga magmatic activity were recognized both in Yangtze block and northwestern Vietnam.

            "abstract": "In large scale subsurface injection of carbondioxide as obtainable in carbon sequestration programs and in environmentally friendly hydraulic fracturing processes (using supercritical CO2), rock-fluid interaction can affect reservoir and seal rocks properties which are essential in monitoring the progress of these operations. The mineralogical components of sedimentary rocks are geochemically active particularly under enormous earth stresses. While geomechanical properties such as rock stiffness, Poisson’s ratio and fracture geometry largely govern fluid flow characteristics in deep fractured formations, the effect of mineralization can lead to flow impedance in the presence of favorable geochemical and thermodynamic conditions. Experimental works which employed the use of analytical tools such as ICP-OES, XRD, SEM/EDS, TOC and BET techniques in investigating diagenetic and micro-structural properties of crushed shale caprock/CO2-brine system concluded that net precipitation reaction processes can affect the distribution of petrophysical nanopores in the shale as a result of rock-fluid interactions. Simulation results previously reported, suggest that influx-induced mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions within clay-based sedimentary rocks can continuously close micro-fracture networks, though injection pressure and effective-stress transformation first rapidly expand these fractures. This experimental modelling research investigated the impact of in-situ geochemical precipitation on conductivity of fractures under geomechanical stress conditions. Conductivity is measured as differential-pressure drop equivalence, using a pressure pulse-decay liquid permeametry/core flooding system, as geochemically saturated-fluid is transported through composite cores with embedded micro-tubings that mimic fractures. The reactive fluid is generated from crushed shale rocks of known mineralogical composition when flooded with aqueous CO2 at elevated temperature and pressure. The result indicated that rock-fluid geochemical interactions can constrict natural fracture conductivity under CO2 sequestration conditions. This diagenetic accretions can lead to significant improvement in the seal integrity of shaly caprocks.",

            "abstract": "Bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) are the primary indicators of the presence of gas hydrate systems and are generally considered to approximate the base of the gas hydrate stability zone. Here we use a combination of well-log, pressure-core, geochemical and high-resolution 3D seismic data, acquired in deepwater NW Borneo, to report the presence of gas hydrates both above and below a BSR at the top of a thrust-related anticline. This complex gas hydrate system overlies a conventional hydrocarbon reservoir. Hydrates beneath the BSR are interpreted to have a thermogenic origin because they contain significant quantities of C2+ hydrocarbons. The base of the hydrate stability coincides at the top of the anticline with a sudden decrease in resistivity in four adjacent wells. Away from the anticline top, in an environment dominated by mass-transport deposits, geochemical data from cores indicate a significant reduction in C2+ hydrocarbons. This change in gas composition is thought to reflect variations in hydrocarbon migration effectiveness and mechanisms. We demonstrate that, where thermogenic gases are efficiently transported to shallow parts of basins, hydrate stability zones could be much thicker than suggested by the depths of BSRs. This means that the carbon stored in thermogenic hydrate systems may be underestimated.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic measurements are assimilated into an a priori model of present-day glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) via least-squares inversion. The result is an updated GIA model wherein the final predicted signal is informed by both observational data with realistic errors, and prior knowledge (or intuition) of GIA inferred from models. This method has recently been implemented within a limited but growing number of GIA studies (e.g., Hill et al. 2010). The combination method allows calculation of the uncertainties of predicted GIA fields, and thus offers a significant advantage over predictions from purely forward GIA models. Here, we show the results of using the combination approach to predict present-day rates of GIA in North America. Both GPS-measured vertical land motion rates and GRACE-measured gravity observations are assimilated into the prior model. In order to assess the influence that each dataset has on the final GIA prediction, the vertical motion and gravimetry datasets are incorporated into the model first independently (i.e., one dataset only), then simultaneously. Similar to other studies, we find that the predicted model uncertainty decreases as the number of data incorporated increases. Because the a priori GIA model and its associated covariance are developed by averaging predictions from a suite of forward models that varies aspects of the Earth rheology and ice sheet history, the final GIA model is not independent of forward model predictions. However, we examine in detail the effect of using different representations of the input model covariance in order to determine the sensitivity of the final model result to the prior GIA model information. Along parts of the North American coastline, improved predictions of the long-term (kyr-scale) GIA response and its uncertainty at present-day allows better constraint of both the magnitude and uncertainty of the component of measured present-day sea-level change that is attributable to shorter-term forcing.",

Earlier observations showed that most of the mounds have their summits around 550 m water depth and summits have been reported as being covered with living coral. Pelagia cruises in 2012 and 2013 revealed completely new insights in mound development. Video transects across mounds with different morphology showed that summits of the highest and largest mounds are presently not covered by living coral as opposed to smaller and lower mounds which are covered with a thriving living coral framework. Measurements in the water column with CTD and near-bottom with benthic landers and thermistor string showed that turbulence is likely the most important factor influencing nutrient and food supply and thus coral growth. It seems that the large mounds have outgrown themselves and that their relatively large size and flat summits are limiting turbulence, thereby limiting oxygen, nutrient and food replenishment. Redistribution of nutrients, oxygen and food is vital for ecosystem functioning and reef development. The presence of a healthy coral cover on the summits of the small mounds was also shown by the vertical mound growth rate measured in sediment cores. These showed fourfold higher sedimentation rates during the Holocene on small mounds compared to highest mounds.",

Outbreaks of cold continental air may lead to excess cooling over the Sargasso Sea, as in 1976-77. Under these circumstances, the Gulf Stream may intensify through a steepening of cross-stream density gradients. An alternative scenario prevailed during the cold outbreak of 2013-14 where excess cooling occurred over the central subpolar gyre and may have influenced the extreme storminess experienced in western Europe. An objectively-analysed temperature and salinity product (EN4) is used to investigate the variability of the GSNAC. Temperature and salinity profiles are used to obtain geostrophic transport at selected GSNAC transects, confirming strong horizontal temperature gradients and a positive geostrophic velocity anomaly at 70oW in spring 1977, the strongest spring transport seen in the 1970s at this location. In addition to observations, an eddy-resolving model hindcast spanning 1970-2013, is used to further characterise GSNAC transport variability, allowing a fuller assessment of the relationship between the winter surface heat flux, end-of-winter mixed layer depth, subtropical mode water volume and GSNAC transports. Preliminary results reveal a significant negative correlation between the winter surface heat flux over the Sargasso Sea and the GSNAC transport in the following spring.",

One big potential obstacle in using paleomagnetic results acquired from sedimentary rocks is a bias towards shallow magnetic inclination. Contrary to sedimentary rocks, volcanic rocks are known to preserve faithful ancient geomagnetic record. We have tested the lithologic dependence of magnetic inclination in East Asia for the 150 Ma. Influence of magnetic inclination shallowing results in significant modification of paleolatitude for South China Craton, but was insignificant for North China Craton. We also estimated relative rotation with time by converting shallowing-corrected magnetic poles to representative geographic locations. Then, the relative longitudinal swing was incorporated in constructing paleogeography in addition to absolute longitudinal motions. We propose that a newly defined apparent polar wander path (APWP) with magnetic inclination shallowing treatment would be of help in rigorous construction of East Laurasia.",

            "abstract": "A potential transport mechanism of various tracers from the tropical troposphere to the lower stratosphere (LS) across the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is the overshooting convective clouds which inject air with tropospheric characteristics (high carbon monoxide (CO), high water vapor (H2O), low ozone (O3) into the LS over a period of a few days. Evidence of such convective intrusions is observed at the end of January and beginning of February in 2010 associated with increased convective activity over the southern African continent following the onset of stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event. The modulation of tropical upwelling by SSW appears to force stronger and deeper tropical convection, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics. The simulation analysis with fine vertical resolution also showed that deep convection especially in the SH became stronger during the SSW event because the upwelling associated with SSW destabilized the TTL [Eguchi et al., ACP, 2015]. The January 2010 SSW event induced the lowest recorded LS temperature in MLS history (2004-13), which destabilized the TTL allowing an unprecedented clear detection of stratosphere-troposphere exchange process by way of CO, H2O and O3 intrusions. The present study suggests that short duration, overshooting clouds can have a large impact on the zonally averaged fields of LS composition.",

            "abstract": "As evidenced by numerous palaeoclimate records worldwide, the Holocene warm period has been interrupted by several short, low-amplitude cold episodes. Among these, the so-called 8.2 ka cold event is the most prominent Holocene climate perturbation but despite extensive studies, knowledge about its synchrony in different areas and particularly about the dynamics of subsequent climate recovery is still limited. As this is of crucial importance for understanding the complex mechanisms that trigger rapid climate fluctuations and for testing the performance of climate models, new data on the 8.2 ka cold event are needed. Here we present a new sub-decadally resolved, precisely dated oxygen isotope (δ18O) record for the interval 7.7–8.7 ka BP obtained from benthic ostracods preserved in the varved lake sediments of Mondsee (Austria), providing new insights into climate development around the 8.2 ka cold event in Central Europe. The new high-resolution δ18O data set reveals the occurrence of a pronounced cold spell around 8.2 ka BP, whose amplitude (~1.0 ‰, equivalent to a 1.5–2.0 °C cooling), total duration (151 a) and absolute dating (8231–8080 a BP, i.e. calendar years before AD 1950) perfectly agree with results from other Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate archives, e.g. the precisely dated Greenland ice cores. In addition, the Mondsee δ18O record also indicates a 75-year-long air temperature overshoot of ~0.7 °C directly after the 8.2 ka event (between 8080 and 8005 a BP), which is so far only poorly documented in the mid-latitudes. However, this observation is consistent with results from coupled climate models and high-latitude proxy records, thus likely reflecting a hemispheric-scale climate signal driven by enhanced resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which apparently also caused synchronous migrations of atmospheric and oceanic front systems in the North Atlantic realm.",

A combined study of Lu-Hf isotopes and U-Pb ages for detrital zircons from Huashan Group can provide information on the crustal evolution of sedimentary provenances and the timing of the Jinning orogeny. Detrital zircons from Huashan Group have two major U-Pb age populations of about 2.0Ga, 2.65Ga, and three subordinate age groups of about 0.82Ga, 2.5Ga, 2.9Ga with minor >3.0Ga ages. The youngest five analyses yield a weighted average age of 816±9Ma, which is consistent with that of interlayered basalt (824±9Ma, Deng et al., 2013) and roughly defines the minimum depositional age of Huashan Group. Detrital zircons of Huashan Group mostly have two stage Hf isotope model ages (TDM2) between 3.0 to 3.3Ga, indicating that the northern Yangtze Block experienced significant continental crustal growth during the Paleo- to Meso-archean. Similar U-Pb ages of detrital zircons have been obtained from Precambrian sedimentary rocks in the northern Yangtze Block from previous studies (Liu et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2014 and references therein). Recently, ca. 2.65Ga A-type granites had been reported from the Kongling and Huji area, which likely record the thermally stable lithosphere (Chen et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). In combination with this study, it documents the widespread 2.6-2.7Ga magmatic rocks in the northern Yangtze Block. Zhao et al. (2013) demonstrated both the ca. 850Ma tonalite and trondhjemite of the Huangling igneous complex were formed in a continental arc setting. This suggests the Miaowan-Huashan oceanic basin proposed by Bader et al. (2013) has not been closed at ca. 850Ma. This evidence, together with the depositional age of the Huashan Group, indicates the Jinning orogeny took place at 850–820 Ma.\n[1] Bader et al., 2013 Tectonics [2] Deng et al., 2013 International Geology Review [3] Guo et al., 2014 Precambrian Research [4] Liu et al., 2008 American Journal of Science [5] Zhao et al., 2013 American Journal of Science",

CO2 was injected at a rate of 10,400 tonnes. ‘Mid Niigata Prefecture Earthquake in 2004’ (Mw6.6) and ‘The Niigataken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake in 2007’ (Mw6.6) occurred during the CO2 injection-test and after the completion of injection-test. Japan is one of the world's major countries with frequent earthquakes.This paper presents a result of seismic response analysis, and reports of seismic hazard evaluation of a reservoir and a caprock.\nIn advance of dynamic response analysis, the earthquake motion recorded on the earth surface assumed the horizontally layer model, and set up the input wave from a basement layer by SHAKE ( = One-Dimensional Seismic Response Analysis). This wave was inputted into the analysis model and the equation of motion was solved using the direct integral calculus by Newmark Beta Method. In Seismic Response Analysis, authors have used Multiple Yield Model (MYM, Iwata, et al., 2013), which can respond also to complicated geological structure.\nThe intensity deformation property of the foundation added the offloading characteristic to the composition rule of Duncan-Chang model in consideration of confining stress dependency, and used for and carried out the nonlinear repetition model. And the deformation characteristic which made it depend on confining stress with the cyclic loadings and un-loadings, and combined Mohr-Coulomb's law as a strength characteristic.\nThe maximum dynamic shearing strain of caprock was generated about 1.1E-04 after the end of an earthquake. Although the dynamic safety factor was 1.925 on the beginning, after the end of an earthquake fell 0.05 point. The dynamic safety factor of reservoir fell to 1.20 from 1.29.\nAs a result of CO2 migration monitoring by the seismic cross-hole tomography, CO2 has stopped in the reservoir through two earthquakes till the present after injection, and the leak is not accepted till the present. By the result of seismic response simulation, it turned out that the stability of the foundation is not spoiled after the earthquake.",

Sometimes even short, intense droughts can cause significant damages to the natural environment as well as the economy. In recent years, North Korea (NK) has been suffering severe droughts. Yet, the thorough field investigation of drought disaster conditions in NK is impossible now. Thus, it is necessary to get more information of drought conditions to restore the damaged environment in NK after unification. RS data can be used to monitor vegetation, bare soil conditions, especially in inaccessible regions. This information can be used to derive spatial variation of drought conditions.\nThus, the spatiotemporal pattern of drought conditions in NK using multi-sensor RS data and available meteorological data were investigated in this study. The RS data---MODIS NDVI (MOD13A3) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) (MOD11A2) from 2000 to 2014 which obtain the vegetation health conditions were used to derive two operationally used agricultural drought indices: Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI). The in-situ precipitation data from 27 weather stations from 1981 to 2014 were used for identifying the relative dry/wet years and acquiring meteorological drought index Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The correlations between the agricultural drought indices and metrological drought index were derived. These data were stored in GIS and used for spatial analysis to figure out the spatiotemporal pattern of drought in NK. The spatiotemporal information of NK drought in this study can provide the basic information for restoring the drought damaged field after the unification of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Land Surface Models (LSM) coupled with River Routing schemes (RRM), are used in Global Climate Models (GCM) to simulate the continental part of the water cycle. They are key component of GCM as they provide boundary conditions to atmospheric and oceanic models. However, at global scale, errors arise mainly from simplified physics, atmospheric forcing, and input parameters. More particularly, those used in RRM, such as river width, depth and friction coefficients, are difficult to calibrate and are mostly derived from geomorphologic relationships, which may not always be realistic.\nIn situ measurements are then used to calibrate these relationships and validate the model, but global in situ data are very sparse. Additionally, due to the lack of existing global river geomorphology database and accurate forcing, models are run at coarse resolution. This is typically the case of the ISBA-TRIP model used in this study.\nA complementary alternative to in-situ data are satellite observations. In this regard, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, jointly developed by NASA/CNES/CSA/UKSA and scheduled for launch around 2020, should be very valuable to calibrate RRM parameters. It will provide maps of water surface elevation for rivers wider than 100 meters over continental surfaces in between 78°S and 78°N and also direct observation of river geomorphological parameters such as width ans slope.\nYet, before assimilating such kind of data, it is needed to analyze RRM temporal sensitivity to time-constant parameters. This study presents such analysis over large river basins for the TRIP RRM. Model output uncertainty, represented by unconditional variance, is decomposed into ordered contribution from each parameter. Doing a time-dependent analysis allows then to identify to which parameters modeled water level and discharge are the most sensitive along a hydrological year. The results show that local parameters directly impact water levels, while discharge is more affected by parameters from the whole upstream drainage area. Understanding model output variance behavior will have a direct impact on the design and performance of the ensemble-based data assimilation platform, for which uncertainties are also modeled by variances. It will help to select more objectively RRM parameters to correct.",

Based on this compilation, we investigate hotspots of nutrient inputs and retention along the river, as well as concentration and load correlations with river discharge and various human drivers of excess nutrient inputs to the SRC. For cross-regional assessment and possible generalization, we also compare corresponding results between the SRC and the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin (BSDB). In the SRC, one small incremental subcatchment, which is located just downstream of Zagreb and has the highest population density among the SRC subcatchments, is identified as a major hotspot for net loading (input minus retention) of both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) to the river and through it to downstream areas of the SRC. The other SRC subcatchments exhibit relatively similar characteristics with smaller net nutrient loading. The annual loads of both TN and TP along the Sava River exhibit dominant temporal variability with considerably higher correlation with annual river discharge (R2 = 0.51 and 0.28, respectively) than that of annual average nutrient concentrations (R2 = 0.0 versus discharge for both TN and TP). Nutrient concentrations exhibit instead dominant spatial variability with relatively high correlation with population density among the SRC subcatchments (R2=0.43-0.64). These SRC correlation characteristics compare well with corresponding ones for the BSDB, even though the two regions are quite different in their hydroclimatic, agricultural and wastewater treatment conditions. Such cross-regional consistency in dominant variability type and explanatory catchment characteristics may be a useful generalization basis, worthy of further investigation, for at least first-order estimation of nutrient concentration and load conditions in less data-rich regions.",

            "abstract": "Geomechanical models of different slip mode nucleation and transformation can be developed basing on laboratory experiments, in which regularities of shear deformation of gouge-filled faults are studied. It’s known that the spectrum of possible slip modes is defined by both macroscopic deformation characteristics of the fault and mesoscale structure of fault filler. Small variations of structural parameters of the filler may lead to a radical change of slip mode [1, 2].\nThis study presents results of laboratory experiments investigating regularities of shear deformation of discontinuities filled with multicomponent granular material. Qualitative correspondence between experimental results and natural phenomena is detected.\nThe experiments were carried out in the classical “slider model” statement. A granite block slides under shear load on a granite substrate. The contact gap between rough surfaces was filled with a discrete material, which simulated the principal slip zone of a fault. The filler components were quartz sand, salt, glass beads, granite crumb, corundum, clay and pyrophyllite.\nAn entire spectrum of possible slip modes was obtained - from stable slip to slow-slip events and to regular stick-slip with various coseismic displacements realized per one act of instability. Mixing several components in different proportions, it became possible to trace the gradual transition from stable slip to regular stick-slip, from slow-slip events to fast-slip events. Depending on specific filler component content, increasing the portion of one of the components may lead to both a linear and a non-linear change of slip event moment (a laboratory equivalent of the seismic moment). For different filler compositions durations of equal-moment events may differ by more than two orders of magnitude.\nThe findings can be very useful for developing geomechnical models of nucleation and transformation of different slip modes observed at natural faults.\nThe work was supported by RFBR (grant no. 13-05-00780).\n1.

In the mid and low latitudes at the ground, the SIs are the sudden increases of the northward magnetic field. Using a set of 447 SI cases and the SMR index (local Dst index provided by SuperMAG), we find that the responses of the geomagnetic field to the jump of the square root of solar wind dynamic pressure show a strong local time dependence with the strongest responses located in the midnight and the weakest responses located in the dawn side. We also find that geomagnetic responses, especially the noon and midnight responses, have quite different amplitudes under north and south interplanetary magnetic field. By calculating the normalized sudden impulses, we find that there is a seasonal variation with the peak around summer and the valley around winter. We also find that the shock normal orientation affects the amplitude of the sudden impulses: the more parallel the shock normal orientation is to the sun-earth line, the stronger the sudden impulses will be.",

            "abstract": "Faults grow over the long-term by accumulating displacement and lengthening, i.e., propagating laterally. We use fault maps and fault propagation evidences available in literature to examine geometrical relations between parent faults and off-fault splays. The population includes 47 worldwide crustal faults with lengths from millimeters to thousands of kilometers and of different slip modes. We show that fault splays form adjacent to any propagating fault tip, whereas they are absent at non-propagating fault ends. Independent of parent fault length, slip mode, context, etc, tip splay networks have a similar fan shape widening in direction of long-term propagation, a similar relative length and width (~30 and ~10 % of parent fault length, respectively), and a similar range of mean angles to parent fault (10-20°). Tip splays more commonly develop on one side only of the parent fault. We infer that tip splay networks are a genetic and a generic property of faults indicative of their long-term propagation. We suggest that they represent the most recent damage off-the parent fault, formed during the most recent phase of fault lengthening. The scaling relation between parent fault length and width of tip splay network implies that damage zones enlarge as parent fault length increases. Elastic properties of host rocks might thus be modified at large distances away from a fault, up to 10% of its length. During an earthquake, a significant fraction of coseismic slip and stress is dissipated into the permanent damage zone that surrounds the causative fault. We infer that coseismic dissipation might occur away from a rupture zone as far as a distance of 10% of the length of its causative fault. Coseismic deformations and stress transfers might thus be significant in broad regions about principal rupture traces.

            "abstract": "The focus of climate reconstructions at large-scales has been so far placed on temperature (cf. PAGES2k, PMIP3) and particularly over the last millennium. Here, we present new global simulations with an Earth System Model covering the past 2,000 years and more specifically investigate the hydrological changes over southwestern North America (sNADA), and the European continent.\nOn a global scale, changes in soil wetness are negatively correlated to changes in (local) temperature with the strongest correlations over the tropical and subtropical non-desert covered areas. Long term-trends over the full simulation period indicate increases for NH summer soil wetness over central NA, central Europe, whereas southern NA and southwestern Europe show drying tendencies.\nThe evolution of the modelled and the reconstructed sNADA and soil wetness, respectively, over southwestern North America show only very little coherence, even on multi-decadal time scales. One explanation may be the high amount of internal variability and deficiencies in both model and reconstruction. An interesting second analysis pertains to the hydrological changes over the European continent in comparison with southwestern North America. Here, results indicate that on multi-decadal time scale those regions, especially the European Mediterranean, share common variance at lower frequencies on top of the millennial-scale trends.\nThe prominent volcanic eruption in 528 AD produces an immediate increase of soil wetness over southwestern Europe and western North America. However, on a global scale this pattern is not robust, as in the 2nd ensemble member the same eruption produces a different pattern, especially in tropical areas pointing to the high degree of internal variability involved despite pronounced changes in volcanic activity.",

Within recent decades, fundamental climate changes on the southeastern part of the TP were detected leading to substantial changes within the regional hydrological budget and affecting local ecosystems. By using a spatial network of multicentennial to 1.5 millenial year old tree-ring δ18O time-series from the southeastern part of the TP, the regional climate history as well as the late Holocene monsoonal variability will be presented. Since the main climatically sensitive periods like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age are displayed in all chronologies, their typical hydroclimatological characteristics and impacts will be discussed especially in regard to the recent warming trend on the TP and the responsible climatic triggers. Arising from these results, regional impacts and differences of the proposed hydrological changes will be discussed. In addition, first results of a comparison between proxy-based (δ18O) and model-based (re-analysis datasets) trajectory calculations will be presented, trying to give insights in the origin and impact of air masses for the most striking last three decades on the southeastern part of the TP.",

            "abstract": "Comparison of tsunamis from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the 1896 Sanriku earthquake shows that the runup heights along the northern and central Sanriku coasts were similar (Tsuji et al., 2015, Pageoph), but the 1896 tsunami waveforms recorded on tide gauges at Hanasaki, Ayukawa and Choshi show much smaller (< 1/5) amplitudes. These three tsunami waveforms were previously used to estimate the 1896 fault model by Tanioka and Satake (1996, GRL) and Tanioka and Seno (2001, GRL). Computed tsunami from a northeastern part (150 km x 50 km or 200 km x 50 km near the trench axis) of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake slip model (Satake et al., 2013, BSSA) roughly reproduces the 1896 runup heights on the Sanriku coast, but the tsunami waveforms on the tide gauges are much larger than the observed ones. Inversion of the 1896 tsunami waveforms indicates that the largest slip is 20 m on the second subfault (50 km x 25 km) from north and from the trench axis, and the slip on other subfaults ranges 3 to 7 m. However, this slip distribution model produces coastal tsunami heights smaller than the observed. If the length of the large slip subfault is extended to 100 km, then both observed tsunami waveforms and coastal heights are reproduced. Thus the 1896 tsunami model is 200 km long, 50 km wide with an average slip of 8 m, but the very large slip (20 m) was located on a 100 km x 25 km fault at a depth range of 3.5 – 7 km. Assuming a rigidity of 2 x 1010N/m2, the total seismic moment is 1.6 x 1021 Nm and the corresponding moment magnitude is Mw 8.1. During the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, the slips on these subfaults which largely slipped 20 m in 1896 were 3 and 14 m, but the shallower parts slipped 20 and 36 m, where the 1896 slip was 3 m. Hence the large slip of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred even shallower part (a depth range of 0 – 3.5 km) of the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Model ability to compute and predict tsunami flow velocities is of importance in risk assessment and hazard mitigation. Substantial damage can be produced by high velocity flows, particularly in harbors and bays, even when the wave height is small. Besides, an accurate simulation of tsunami flow velocities and accelerations is fundamental for advancing in the study of tsunami sediment transport. These considerations made the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) proposing a benchmark exercise focused on modeling and simulating tsunami currents. Until recently, few direct measurements of tsunami velocities were available to compare and to validate model results. After Tohoku 2011 many current meters measurement were made, mainly in harbors and channels. In this work we present a part of the contribution made by the EDANYA group from the University of Malaga to the NTHMP workshop organized at Portland (USA), 9-10 of February 2015. We have selected three out of the five proposed benchmark problems. Two of them consist in real observed data from the Tohoku 2011 event, one at Hilo Habour (Hawaii) and the other at Tauranga Bay (New Zealand). The third one consists in laboratory experimental data for the inundation of Seaside City in Oregon. For this model validation the Tsunami-HySEA model, developed by EDANYA group, was used. The overall conclusion that we could extract from this validation exercise was that the Tsunami-HySEA model performed well in all benchmark problems proposed. The greater spatial variability in tsunami velocity than wave height makes it more difficult its precise numerical representation. The larger variability in velocities is likely a result of the behaviour of the flow as it is channelized and as it flows around bathymetric highs and structures. In the other hand wave height do not respond as strongly to chanelized flow as current velocity.",

In particular, using the spectral-element method,\nwe explored the effect of topography of the '410' and '660' mantle discontinuities on the travel times of SS precursors recorded on transverse component seismograms.\nThe latter are routinely used to infer the topography of mantle transition zone discontinuities. The step from precursory\ntravel times to topographic changes is mainly done using linearised ray theory, or sometimes using finite frequency kernels.\nWe simulated exact seismograms in 1-D and 3-D elastic models of the mantle. In a second simulation, we added topography to the discontinuities.\nWe compared the waveforms obtained with and without topography by cross-correlation of the SS precursors. Since we did not add noise, the precursors are visible in individual seismograms without the need of stacking. The resulting\ntime anomalies were then converted into topographic variations and compared to the original models of topography.\nWe found that linearised ray theory gives a relatively good idea on the location of the uplifts and depressions of the discontinuities,\nprovided that the ray coverage is good, although it seriously underestimates the amplitude of the topography.\nThe amplitude of the topographic variation is underestimated in average by a factor of 2.8 for the '660' and of 4.5 for the '410'.\nAdditionally, we found a strong non-linearity in the measured data which cannot be modelled without a fully non-linear inversion for elastic structure and discontinuities simultaneously.",

Reaction vessel studies provide evidence that in the aqueous phase photooxidation of water soluble organic compounds (e.g., glyoxal, methylglyoxal) form multifunctional organic products and oligomers. In this work, we extend this bulk-phase chemistry to the condensed-phase chemistry that occurs in/on aerosols by conducting smog chamber experiments — photooxidation of ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid aerosols containing glyoxal and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of NOx under dry/humid conditions. Particles were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS).\nIn the irradiated chamber, photooxidation products of glyoxal as seen in reaction vessel experiments (e.g., oxalic acids and tartaric acids) were also formed in both ammonium sulfate aerosols and sulfuric acid aerosols at humid and even dry conditions. However, the major products were organosulfurs (CHOS), organonitrogens (CHON), and nitrooxy-organosulfates (CHONS), which were also dominantly formed in the dark chamber. These products were formed via non-radical reactions, which depend on acidity and humidity. However, the real-time profiles in the dark chamber and the irradiated chamber were very different, suggesting photochemistry substantially affects non-radical formation in the condensed phase.",

            "abstract": "The moon-plasma interactions and the resulting surface charging have been subjects of extensive recent investigations. While many particle-in-cell (PIC) based simulation models have been developed, all existing PIC simulation models treat the surface of the Moon as a boundary condition to the plasma flow. In such models, the surface of the Moon is typically limited to simple geometry configurations, the surface floating potential is calculated from a simplified current balance condition, and the electric field inside the regolith layer cannot be resolved.\nThis paper presents a new full particle PIC model to simulate local scale plasma flow and surface charging. A major feature of this new model is that the surface is treated as an “interface” between two mediums rather than a boundary, and the simulation domain includes not only the plasma but also the regolith layer and the bedrock underneath it. There are no limitations on the surface shape. An immersed-finite-element field solver is applied which calculates the regolith surface floating potential and the electric field inside the regolith layer directly from local charge deposition. The material property of the regolith layer is also explicitly included in simulation. This new model is capable of providing a self-consistent solution to the plasma flow field, lunar surface charging, the electric field inside the regolith layer and the bedrock for realistic surface terrain.\nThis new model is applied to simulate lunar surface-plasma interactions and surface charging under various ambient plasma conditions. The focus is on the lunar terminator region, where the combined effects from the low sun elevation angle and the localized plasma wake generated by plasma flow over a rugged terrain can generate strongly differentially charged surfaces and complex dust dynamics. We discuss the effects of the regolith properties and regolith layer charging on the plasma flow field, dust levitation, and dust transport.",

By using mainly Arias intensity, we assess how the incoming energy beneath the foundations is convoyed into the monument, through what preferential frequencies such process takes place, how the trapped energy increases amplitude vibration with floors. Moreover, we also investigate the role played by the near-surface geology in generating differential motions below the monument foundations. In addition we also check, in a preliminary way, the foundation dynamical behaviour under the action of the incoming wave-field.",

            "abstract": "It is important to predict climate change correctly in regional scale and to build adaptation measures and mitigation measures in the Asian monsoon region where more than 60 % of the world's population are living. The reliability of climate change prediction model is evaluated by the reproducibility of past climate in general. However, because there are many developing countries in the Asian monsoon region, adequate documentations of past climate which are needed to evaluate the climate reproducibility have not been prepared. In addition, at present it is difficult to get information on wide-area agricultural meteorological data which affect the growth of agricultural crops when considering the impact on agriculture of climate. Therefore, we have started a research project entitled “Climatic changes and evaluation of their effects on agriculture in Asian monsoon region (CAAM)” under the research framework of the Green Network of Excellence (GRENE) for the Japanese fiscal years from 2011 to 2015 supported by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). This project aims to improve the reliability of future climate prediction and to develop the information platform which will be useful to design adaptation and mitigation strategies in agriculture against the predicted climatic changes in Asian monsoon regions.\nWhat is GRENE?\nBased on the new growth strategy which was approved by the Cabinet of Japan in June 2010, Green Network of Excellence program (GRENE) has started under MEXT from FY 2011. The objectives of this program are that the domestic leading universities work together strategically and promote a comprehensive human resource development and research of the highest level in the world while sharing research resources and research goals. In the field of environmental information, it is required that universities and research institutions, which are working on issues such as adaptation to climate change, cooperate to promote the utilization of environmental information and to develop human resources while using DIAS (Data Integration and Analysis System) which has been built by MEXT.",

            "abstract": "Observed streamflow (Q) data from 1286 medium sized catchments (1000–5000 km2) around the globe were used to comprehensively evaluate the Q estimates (1979–2012) of six global hydrologic models (GHMs) and four land surface models (LSMs) run within the EartH2Observe project. The models were all driven by the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis (WFDEI) meteorological dataset, but used various datasets for non-meteorologic variables and were run at various spatial and temporal resolutions, although all data were re-sampled to a common 0.5° spatial and daily temporal resolution. For the evaluation we used a broad range of performance metrics related to various important aspects of the hydrograph. The GHMs were found to perform slightly better overall than the LSMs, and the calibrated models were found to generally outperform the uncalibrated models for the metrics incorporated in the objective functions used for calibration. We further found that the ensemble mean had only slightly worse performance than the best (calibrated) model, and that despite adjustments using in-situ observations and corrections for orography, the WFDEI precipitation data still contain substantial biases which are reflected in the simulated Q. We argue that model parameter regionalization deserves more attention, given that the large majority of the land surface is ungauged or poorly gauged. We suggest that a parameter ensemble for a single sufficiently flexible model is easier to realize yet provides the same benefits as a multi-model ensemble. The results of this study have important implications for studies assessing the hydrologic impacts of climate and land-use change.",

            "abstract": "Study of spatial and temporal distribution of Holocene terminal fans in the Indo-Gangetic foreland basin suggests the segmentation of the basin was initiated at 9.3 Ka and continued up to 0.75 Ka in three distinct episodes. The earliest episode (9.3-7.3 Ka) was exclusively confined in the upper Gangetic plain. This episode covers 29% of total time span and contributes 13% of total faults including their reactivations. Development of six faults associated with terminal fans having large age gaps indicate relatively slow rate of faulting activities in the early Holocene. The second episode was started at 6.4 Ka and continued upto 2.3 Ka covering 60% time of the total time span and contributed 69% of total faults (including their reactivations). Though in most of the time the faulting events were confined in the upper Gangetic plain, but development of few faults in the middle Gangetic plain in the middle of this episode shows a transitional shift of tectonic front from the upper to the middle Gangetic plain. The third faulting episode (1.5-0.75 Ka) is mainly confined in the middle Gangetic plain. This episode covers 11% time of the total time span and contributes 18% of faults. Out of the eight faults, seven of them are in the middle Gangetic plains. These three episodes have contributed in segmentation of the Gangetic plains, but the second episode was responsible for major segmentation of the region. Two major tectonically stable periods (7.3-6.4 Ka and 2.3-1.5 Ka) and three minor periods (i.e 0.5 Ka) have been observed in the region. Episodic development of faults in individual tectonic blocks indicates the stress distribution along the plains is non-uniform which can also be correlated to the adjacent corresponding segments of the Himalayan tectonics. It has been observed that, in each fault-bounded block the faulting events start slowly and later becomes more frequent. The youngest faulting episode of the present study coincides with that of previous study and suggests the region between the Gandak and Kosi rivers is tectonically most active at present. The change of orientation of the faults in the plain may be correlated to directional change of Indian plate motion, differential convergence, and upliftment rate along the Himalayan front and the spatial extension of subsurface Precambrian basement ridges into the plains.",

            "abstract": "The major Mw = 7.8 earthquake which rocked the Nepal Himalaya on 25th April 2015 is the largest to have occurred in this region in the past 81 years. This event occurred by slip on a ~150 km long and 55 km wide, shallow dipping (~5◦) segment of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), causing the Himalaya to lurch southwestward by 4.8±1.2 m over the Indian plate. The mainshock ruptured the down-dip end of the frictionally locked segment of the MHT, initiating near the locking line and propagated up-dip. The rupture stopped ~8 km below the surface, loading the up-dip end of the MHT. The mainshock was followed by a large number of aftershocks among which four were larger than magnitude (Mw) 6.5. These strong aftershocks occurred on fault(s) with similar orientation as the mainshock, contributing to strain release on the MHT. Moderate-to-light aftershocks originated close to the up-dip edge of the MHT, close to where the mainshock rupture stopped. We use regional and local waveform data to (a) relocate these aftershocks and (b) model the source mechanism of the moderate aftershocks (Mw>5.0). This will provide valuable constraints on the up-dip geometry of the MHT, presence of ramps and associated back thrust underneath the Himalayan foothills. Our study will also highlight the adjacent segments of the Himalaya where significant unrelieved elastic strain has accumulated and may rupture in similar or greater earthquakes in the future.",

            "abstract": "Almost all coastal environments in Greenland are developed in high-relief areas, along fjords, or hard-rock cliffs. The sedimentary shores often fringe these areas and a large number of small deltas (areal delta surface < 10 km2) exists. The sediments mostly originate from rivers that are fed by melting glaciers or drain pro-glacial and fluvial valleys. There is also active reworking at the present shorelines of sedimentary deposits of glacial, peri-glacial and deltaic origin that were formed during and after the last glaciation of the coastal plain.\nArctic coastal processes are not only affected by waves, tides and currents, but to a large extend by freezing temperatures, ice and snow. There is a seasonal variation with open waters and active rivers in summer and ice-covered coastal waters and frozen rivers in winter. The coastal processes by waves and tides are thus often limited to summer and early fall. Nowadays, global climate changes induce many changes along the arctic coasts. Global sea-levels are rising due to thermal expansion and an increased fresh water flux from the glaciers and land ice masses, while ice coverage of the coastal waters decreases and the open water periods in summer extend. However, it is still unknown if the extra input of fluvial sediments can cope with increased erosion rates at the shores. Besides, the rate of actual sea-level rise in West Greenland is probably less than the local rate of isostatic uplift, leading to local relative sea level fall.\nThe focus in this presentation is on shoreline changes and its impact on two coastal environments in Greenland: the Young Sound area (fjord environment in North-East Greenland), and the southern shore of Disko Island (open sea embayment in West Greenland). These coastal environments exhibit a wide variety of coastal landforms like deltas, spits, barriers, etc. The coastal landforms were mapped and aerial images, orthogonal photos, and satellite images were used to digitize successive shorelines. The shoreline changes were estimated using the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) of the USGS. The spatial variability of accumulation and erosion patterns was detected and shows a surprising thread for ancient settlements and present-day activities in the coastal zone. The same patterns are finally discussed in terms of coastal risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "Fire emissions of methane potentially represent a significant but highly uncertain component of the global methane budget with estimates ranging from 14 to 88 Tg / yr. This range of estimates is driven in part by knowledge of dry matter burned, the fuel type, and variations in combustion efficiency. Here we use global estimates of CO emissions based on CO profiles from the NASA Terra MOPITT instrument and CH4/CO emission ratios from NASA Aura TES data to constrain estimates of the global contribution to atmospheric methane from fires. For the years 2001 to the present we find that fire emissions of methane are approximately 3% (or ~ 15 Tg / yr) of the global methane budget. Furthermore, fire emissions have likely been decreasing during this time period indicating that non-fire methane fluxes have primarily contributed to the recent increase in global atmospheric methane concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic fissure vents are a difficult geologic feature to quantify. They are often too thin to document in detail with seismology or remote geophysical methods. Additionally, lava flows, lava drain back, or collapsed rampart blocks typically conceal a fissure’s surface expression. For exposed fissures, quantifying the surface (let along sub0surface) geometric expression can become an overwhelming and time-consuming task given the non-uniform distribution of wall irregularities, drain back textures, and the larger scale sinuosity of the whole fissure system. We developed (and previously presented) VolcanoBot to acquire robust characteristic data of fissure geometries by going inside accessible fissures after an eruption ends and the fissure cools off to <50 C. Data from VolcanoBot documents the fissure conduit geometry with a near-IR structured light sensor, and reproduces the 3d structures to cm-scale accuracy. Here we present a comparison of shallow subsurface structures (<30 m depth) within the Mauna Ulu fissure system and their counterpart features at the vent-to-ground-surface interface. While we have not mapped enough length of the fissure to document sinuosity at depth, we see a self-similar pattern of irregularities on the fissure walls throughout the entire shallow subsurface, implying a fracture mechanical origin similar to faults. These irregularities are, on average, 1 m across and protrude 30 cm into the drained fissure. This is significantly larger than the 10% wall roughness addressed in the engineering literature on fluid dynamics, and implies that magma fluid dynamics during fissure eruptions are probably not as passive nor as simple as previously thought. In some locations, it is possible to match piercing points across the fissure walls, where the dike broke the wall rock in order to propagate upwards, yet in other locations there are erosional cavities, again, implying complex fluid dynamics in the shallow sub-surface during fissure eruptions.",

In this system the narrowest and most highly dissected interfluves (gentle ridges and hilltops) are 1st order and increase in rank dendritically through interfluve branching and broadening. Interfluve order attends to the structure, function, and management of residual porous-solid systems in the transport of water, solutes, and eroded solids in our deeply weathered (>30m soil/saprolite) critical zone. Recently generated geospatial data regarding the interactions of geomorphology, human land use, and forest ecology further strengthen the utility of this system. These upland networks and corresponding “land-sheds” have potential in linking recent work in the fields of geophysics and geomorphology regarding bedrock weathering front dynamics.\nPatterns of bedrock weathering depth, landcover & land-use change, and soil erosion are considered as they correspond to interfluve order. With LiDAR mapping and the burgeoning development and utilization of geophysical techniques and models enabling new quantitative research of critical zone landscape structure and function, many physiographic regions could benefit from a system that delineates and orders interfluve networks.",

            "abstract": "Fluid circulation in geothermal reservoirs depends on the density, geometry, and hydraulic properties of fractures. The Soultz-sous-Forêts site located in the Upper Rhine Graben in Alsace, France, consists of a granitic reservoir overlain by a 1.4 km-thick sedimentary succession. Core analysis and borehole wall imagery collected from reconnaissance well EPS1 (2230 m depth) revealed an extensive fracture network throughout the granite and overlying sediments, including both open fractures and fractures filled through mineral precipitation (primarily quartz, barite, calcite, and galena). Here we present an experimental study that aims to quantify the impact of healed or partially-healed fractures on permeability anisotropy in the Triassic Buntsandstein sandstone (1000-1400 m). We targeted borehole samples that best represent the variability of these fractures. Forty cylindrical core samples (40 mm length and 20 mm diameter) were prepared such that they contain fractures either parallel or perpendicular to their axis. We also prepared samples of the intact host rock. Porosity and permeability were measured for each core, and thin sections were made to characterise the nature of the fractures and the precipitated minerals. The low permeability of the host rock (10-15 to 10-17 m2) can be explained by prevalent pore-filling clays. We found that fractures may present a conduit for or a barrier to flow, depending on the extent of healing and the nature of the filling. Crystal precipitation models, using borehole fluid composition and temperature data from Soultz, provide a timescale for crack healing. Our modelling shows that fractures that once represented effective conduits for flow may heal rapidly (on the order of months) and switch from providing conduits for flow to presenting barriers to flow, modifying the permeability anisotropy within these units. These data are important for understanding fluid flow and heat transfer within the reservoir.",

U-channel samples were taken wherever core recovery and lithology permitted, producing a palaeomagnetic record at 1 cm resolution covering around 5 m of the total 9 m coring depth; discrete samples were taken from several of the intervals unsuitable for u-channelling.\nStepwise alternating-field treatment resulted in good demagnetization behaviour, with most samples showing a clear, major origin-directed magnetization component. The average inclination of around 57° is close to the geocentric axial dipole inclination of 60° for the sampling site, with the difference attributable to typical inclination shallowing effects.\nOur record contains several brief excursions of shallowed inclination. The most significant of these reaches inclinations of below 10°, and we have tentatively correlated it with the Blake event. Relative palaeointensity exhibits a similarly dynamic behaviour across this interval. Integration of our palaeomagnetic record with ongoing biostratigraphic work, and with other regional palaeomagnetic data, will provide a more thorough characterization of Late Pleistocene palaeosecular variation in southern Europe.",

A change of cloud microphysical properties related to anthropogenic activities may result in distressing climate consequence and changes. Since atmospheric aerosol is the major source of cloud condensation nuclei (CNN) that is critical for the formation of cloud microphysical structures and properties, aerosol changes due to anthropogenic emissions will result in the modification of CCN and cloud microphysical properties and eventually cause the changes of Earth’s climate. In this study, we will investigate the effect of aerosol on the microphysical properties, including cloud particle effective radius, cloud water path, and cloud optical depth, of marine stratus clouds by using more than 30-years climate data records (CDRs) of aerosols and clouds derived from NOAA operational AVHRR satellite observations. The correlation between satellite derived cloud and aerosol microphysical parameters will be determined and the statistics significance will be examined using the long-term AVHRR satellite CDRs.",

            "abstract": "For the reconstruction of the laterally heterogeneous upper-mantle structure using surface waves, we generally use phase delay information of seismograms, which represents the average phase velocity perturbation along a ray path, while the amplitude information has been rarely used in the velocity mapping. Amplitude anomalies of surface waves contain a variety of information such as anelastic attenuation, elastic focusing/defocusing, geometrical spreading, and receiver effects. The effects of elastic focusing/defocusing are dependent on the second derivative of phase velocity across the ray path, and thus, are sensitive to shorter-wavelength structure than the conventional phase data. Therefore, suitably-corrected amplitude data of surface waves can be useful for improving the lateral resolution of phase velocity models. In this study, we collect a large-number of inter-station phase velocity and amplitude ratio data for fundamental-mode surface waves with a non-linear waveform fitting between two stations of USArray. The measured inter-station phase velocity and amplitude ratios are then inverted simultaneously for phase velocity maps and local amplification factor at receiver locations in North America. The synthetic experiments suggest that, while the phase velocity maps derived from phase data only reflect large-scale tectonic features, those from phase and amplitude data tend to exhibit better recovery of the strength of velocity perturbations, which emphasizes local-scale tectonic features with larger lateral velocity gradients; e.g., slow anomalies in Snake River Plain and Rio Grande Rift, where significant local amplification due to elastic focusing are observed. Also, the spatial distribution of receiver amplification factor shows a clear correlation with the velocity structure. Our results indicate that inter-station amplitude-ratio data can be of help in reconstructing shorter-wavelength structures of the upper mantle.",

To develop a simplistic, yet empirical framework that can explore, and predict dissolved organic carbon (DOC) degradation patterns across five large Arctic Rivers we leverage relatively simple optical methods, developed for rapid analysis of DOC, combined with known physical catchment characteristics. Specifically, we use fluorescence to estimate the concentration of relatively “labile” versus “refractory” DOC sources, and assuming first order kinetics introduce a robust DOC lability index (%DF). We then show that the mean slope of the catchment can predict the flux of DOC delivered to the Arctic Ocean, and estimate the extent of terrestrial DOC degradation on a pan-Arctic scale. Next, we estimate relevant DOC exposure (tE) and processing (tP) time scales, and show that the outcome of an individual thaw event depends critically on the ratio between tE:tp, regardless of the spatial regime over which the reaction occurs. Finally, we provide strong evidence that the mean catchment slope, and to what extent the catchment remains continuously frozen (i.e. % continuous permafrost) are key variables to predict the fate of Arctic River DOC under a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "We use our fully coupled 3-D Jupiter Thermosphere General Circulation Model (JTGCM) to quantify wind processes that are responsible for generating neutral winds in the auroral thermosphere from 20 μbar to 10-4 nbar self-consistently with the thermal structure and compositions. The heat sources in the JTGCM that drive the global circulation of neutral flow are charge particle heating from particle impact of extreme auroral conditions and large amount of Joule heating produced in the Jovian ovals by imposing high speed anticorotational ion drifts up to ~3.5 kms-1. These sources are strongly related to the current system in the equatorial plasma sheet that allows plasma to flow outward from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere in the inner part and return from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere in the outer part. We find that strong pressure gradients are developed in the auroral regions, affecting zonal and meridional winds in addition to local temperature distributions. We also find that the zonal flow of neutral winds in the ovals of both hemispheres is primarily driven by competition between Coriolis forcing and ion drag processes near the ionospheric peak. However, above the ionospheric peak, the acceleration of neutral flow due to pressure gradients is found to be the most effective parameter impacting zonal winds. One of the most important findings of this investigation is that the meridional flow of neutral winds in the Jovian ovals is poleward near the peak of the auroral ionosphere. The strength of this flow is gradually weakened and turned equatorward at the sub-nanobar levels with wind speeds up to ~250 ms-1 in the southern oval and ~75 ms-1 in the northern oval. The corresponding neutral motion in this region is upward with wind speeds up to 4 ms-1 in both ovals. We will discuss the model assumptions, numerical framework and several parameterizations of inputs quantities. Comparisons of key model outputs (e.g. neutral temperatures and wind components) will be provided.",

            "abstract": "EMIC waves are believed to play an important role in the dynamics of ring current ions and radiation belt electrons, especially during geomagnetic storms. But, in which phase of the storm do the EMIC waves occur more is still under debate. Ground and some low altitude satellite observations demonstrate that EMIC waves are observed more frequently during the recovery phase, rather than during the main phase. Halford et al. 2010 looked at the occurrences of EMIC waves during 119 storms occurring throughout the CRRES mission. They found that 49 of the 119 (41%) storms observed EMIC waves and the majority, 56.25%, of storm time EMIC waves occurring during the main phase, while 35.57% in the recovery phase. One shortcoming of the CRRES mission is that the apogee of it did not covered the dawn to noon sector during its life time. Therefore, some dayside EMIC waves caused by the compression of magnetosphere may not be included in Halford et al 2010, as they mentioned. The apogee of Van Allen Probes covered all the MLT sectors from their launch to April 2014. Utilizing the data from magnetometer instrument on board the Van Allen Probe A, Wang et al. 2015 studied the occurrence rate of H-band and He-band EMIC waves in different MLT sectors, and Yu et al 2015 reported the O-band EMIC wave observations. In this work, we analysis the occurrence of EMIC waves during storms. According to the criteria of storm in Halford et al. 2010, we find 76 storms in our interested period, 8 September 2012 to 30 April 2014, when the apogee of Van Allen Probe A covered all the MLT sectors. To identify the onset of geomagnetic storm more accurately, we corrected the Sym-H index referred to Zhao and Zong (2011), which is helpful to demonstrate the activity of ring current. 50 of the 76 storms (66%) observed 124 EMIC wave events, in which 80 (64.5%) EMIC wave events are found in the recovery phase, more than the EMIC wave events in the main phase (35, 28.2%). The remaining 9 (7.3%) EMIC wave events are found in the pre-onset phase, defined as that in Halford et al. 2010. This result is different from that of Halford et al. 2010. The reason may lie on the different orbit coverage of the two different satellites. The dominant storm type, CME or CIR, is also checked for the storms in the different periods, which may also lead to the differences between our research results and those of Halford et al. 2010.",

One way to begin examining the role of kinetic effects is to consider more accurate fluid approximations, such as Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD). In this study, decaying HMHD and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are examined using 3D direct numerical simulations with grids up to 768^3 points and with different initial conditions. It is found that the small scales of HMHD turbulence are magnetically dominated and this behavior can be associated with nonlinear advection becoming subdominant to dissipation. Current structures in HMHD are found to be narrower than in MHD whereas vorticity structures are broader. In the simulations examined herein, an association between strong current structures and alignment between the current and magnetic field is present, which may be important in collisionless plasmas where field-aligned currents can be unstable.",

The SHADOZ time series began in 1998, using electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes. Like many long-term sounding stations, SHADOZ is characterized by variations in operating procedures, launch protocols, and data processing such that biases within a data record and among sites appear. In addition, over time, the radiosonde and ozonesonde instruments and data processing protocols have changed, adding to the measurement uncertainties at individual stations and limiting the reliability of ozone profile trends and continuous satellite validation. Currently, the ozonesonde community is engaged in reprocessing ECC data, with an emphasis on homogenization of the records to compensate for the variations in instrumentation and technique. The goals are to improve the information and integrity of each measurement record and to support calculation of more reliable trends. We illustrate the reprocessing activity of SHADOZ with selected stations. We will (1) show reprocessing steps based on the recent WMO report that provides post-processing guidelines for ozonesondes; (2) characterize uncertainties in various parts of the ECC conditioning process; and (3) compare original and reprocessed data to co-located ground and satellite measurements of column ozone.",

            "abstract": " With the successful launch of Magnetospheric Multiscale Misssion (MMS), it becomes possible to observe the dynamic signatures of magnetospheric transients with high-time resolution measurements of electromagnetic fields and plasma. The Active Spacecraft Potential Control (ASPOC) neutralizes the spacecraft potential by releasing positive charge produced by indium and thereby controlling the spacecraft potential in order to enable accurate measurements also in sparse plasma environments essential to study properties of reconnection. Since the current balance around the spacecraft is maintained by contribution also from the ambient plasma, predominantly electrons, ASPOC beam current values combined with spacecraft potential data from FIELDS instruments enable to deduce the ambient electron plasma parameters . Particularly, using data from multi-spacecraft measurements with different ASPOC current levels and FIELDS data, parameters on ambient electron temperature and density can be deduced.\n Monitoring the environmental plasma parameters are essential to determine the accurate scales of the structure or wave length relative to plasma scales and hence to understand the physical processes. In this study we investigate the changes of the electron parameters in the transient structures such as the magnetic field disturbance forming at the front of BBF/flow bursts, called dipolarization front (DF), and reconnection jets in thin current sheets obtained by MMS mainly during the commissioning phase when the spacecraft traversed the near-Earth tail.\n ",

            "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are capable of all-weather day and night observations that can discriminate between land and smooth open water surfaces over large scales. Because of this there has been much interest in the use of SAR satellite data to improve our understanding of water processes, in particular for fluvial flood inundation mechanisms.\nPast studies prove that integrating SAR derived data with hydraulic models can improve simulations of flooding. However while much of this work focusses on improving model channel roughness values or inflows in ungauged catchments, improvement of model bathymetry is often overlooked. The provision of good bathymetric data is critical to the performance of hydraulic models but there are only a small number of ways to obtain bathymetry information where no direct measurements exist. Spatially distributed river depths are also rarely available.\nWe present a methodology for calibration of model average channel depth and roughness parameters concurrently using SAR images of flood extent and a Sub-Grid model utilising hydraulic geometry concepts. The methodology uses real data from the European Space Agency’s archive of ENVISAT[1] Wide Swath Mode images of the River Severn between Worcester and Tewkesbury during flood peaks between 2007 and 2010. Historic ENVISAT WSM images are currently free and easy to access from archive but the methodology can be applied with any available SAR data.\nThe approach makes use of the SAR image processing algorithm of Giustarini[2] et al. (2013) to generate binary flood maps. A unique feature of the calibration methodology is to also use parameter ‘identifiability’ to locate the parameters with higher accuracy from a pre-assigned range (adopting the DYNIA method proposed by Wagener[3] et al., 2003).\n\n[1] https://gpod.eo.esa.int/services/\n[2] Giustarini. 2013. ‘A Change Detection Approach to Flood Mapping in Urban Areas Using TerraSAR-X’.

Errors in estimating stream channel geometry can therefore result in increased discharge uncertainty.\nThis study investigates coupling national-scale airborne laser scanning (ALS) and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) bathymetric survey data for generating stream rating curves. Specifically, stream channel geometries were generated from coupled ALS and ADCP scanning data collected for a well-monitored site located in northern Sweden. These data were used to define the hydraulic geometry required by a physically-based 1-D hydraulic model.\nThe results of our study demonstrate that the effects of potential scanning data errors on the model generated rating curve were less than the uncertainties due to stream gauging measurements and empirical rating curve fitting. Further analysis of the ALS data showed that an overestimation of the streambank elevation (the main scanning data error) was primarily due to vegetation that could be adjusted for through a root-mean-square-error bias correction. We consider these findings encouraging as hydrometric agencies can potentially leverage national-scale ALS and ADCP instrumentation to reduce the cost and effort required for maintaining and establish rating curves at gauging stations.",

However, land surface models currently prescribe rooting profiles as a function of only the plant functional types, with no consideration of the dynamic rooting strategies in response to the changing environments. In this study, a new dynamic rooting scheme which taking the controlling effects of soil water and nitrogen on rooting strategies into account was incorporated into the version 4.5 of the Community Land Model with carbon-nitrogen interactions (CLM4.5-CN). Two pairs of experiments were conducted to study the effects of dynamic root distribution on eco-hydrological modeling for the Tapajos National Forest km83 (BRSa3) site and the Amazon Basin. For site-level comparisons, the dynamic rooting scheme can improve the carbon and water cycle modeling by reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in gross primary production (GPP) by 0.4 g C m-2 day-1, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 1.96 g C m-2 day-1, latent heat (LE) by 5.0 W m-2, soil moisture (SM) by 0.03 m3 m-3. In the Amazon basin, the vegetation responses (including GPP and LE) to seasonal drought and server 2005 drought are also better captured with dynamic root distribution incorporated.",

            "abstract": "Apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology is an effective thermochronometer to measure source exhumation in the North American Cordillera, western U.S.A. We use a combination of thermochronology and geochronology to measure lag times, i.e., the difference in time between the cooling and depositional ages of a mineral crystal. These lag-time measurements using source exhumation ages, measured with AFT thermochronology, and depositional ages, measured with biostratigraphy and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, indicate constant to decreasing lag times of 0–5 m.y. throughout the Cretaceous. These lag times are consistent with rapid exhumation rates of ~0.9–>1 km/m.y. One pitfall of using detrital thermochronology to measure source exhumation is assuring that the apatite crystals are exhumed apatites and not volcanic apatites introduced into the system from the volcanic arc. To do this we use U-Pb geochronology to remove samples contaminated with young arc derived apatites and keep those with old exhumed apatites. Five of the seven detrital AFT samples were significantly contaminated with young volcanic apatites, showing that U-Pb geochronology should be a routine step in measuring lag times.\nOur findings demonstrate that coarse-grained foreland basin deposits in the Cretaceous Western Interior, in both the proximal and distal settings, were deposited during times of active tectonism and exhumation and that sediments are not stored in wedge-top and proximal foredeep settings for long periods of time, i.e. >5 m.y., and then subsequently reworked distally. Exhumation rates of ~0.9–>1 km/m.y. are not sustainable over the entire orogenic belt for the duration of the Sevier orogeny, indicated by the lack of deep-crustal material exhumed in the North American Cordillera. High exhumation rates were likely concentrated over the eastward-propagating Sevier fold-thrust belt, whereas the Nevadaplano and hinterland experienced much slower rates of exhumation. This variation in exhumation rates is observed in South America in the central Andean arc, Puna-Altiplano, and eastern Cordillera zones.",

The EPD suite consists of four different sensors (STEP, SIS, EPT and HET) which together will resolve the energetic particle spectrum from 2 keV to 20 MeV for electrons, 3 keV to 100 MeV for protons and circa 100 keV/nuc to 100 MeV/nuc for heavier ions.\nEPT itself is primarily designed to cleanly separate and measure electrons in the energy range from 20 - 400 keV and protons from 20 - 7000 keV.\nTo achieve this, EPT uses two back-to-back solid state detectors with a magnet system to deflect electrons on one side and a Polyimide foil to stop protons below ~400 keV on the other side. The two detectors then serve as each other's anti-coincidence.\nAdditionally this setup also allows us to measure penetrating particles with deposited energies in the 1 MeV to 40 MeV range. Looking at the ratio of deposited energy in the two detectors versus total deposited energy allows us to differentiate between protons and alpha particles.\nDistinguishing 3He from 4He will be challenging, but possible provided good knowledge of the instrument, high-fidelity modeling and a precise calibration of EPT. Here, we will present feasibility studies leading to a determination of the 3He / 4He ratio with EPT.",

            "abstract": "Perturbations to sediment regimes due to anthropogenic activities may have long lasting effects, especially in systems dominated by coarse sediment where travel times are relatively long. Effectively evaluating management alternatives requires understanding the future trajectory of river response at both the river network and reach scales. The Ozark Plateaus physiographic province is a montane region in the interior US composed primarily of Paleozoic sedimentary rock. Historic land-use practices around the turn of the last century accelerated delivery of coarse sediment to river channels. Effects of this legacy sediment persist in two national parks, Ozark National Scenic Riverways, MO and Buffalo National River, AR, and are of special concern for management of native mussel fauna. These species require stable habitat, yet they occupy inherently dynamic environments: alluvial rivers. At the river-network scale, analysis of historical data reveals the signature of sediment waves moving through river networks in the Ozarks. Channel planform alternates between relatively stable, straight reaches, and wider, multithread reaches which have been more dynamic over the past several decades. These alternate planform configurations route and store sediment differently, and translate into different patterns of bed stability at the reach scale, which in turn affects the distribution and availability of habitat for native biota. Geomorphic mapping and hydrodynamic modeling reveal the complex relations between planform (in)stability, flow dynamics, bed mobility, and aquatic habitat in systems responding to increased sediment supply. Reaches that have a more dynamic planform may provide more hydraulic refugia and habitat heterogeneity compared to stable, homogeneous reaches. This research provides new insights that may inform management of sediment and mussel habitat in rivers subject to coarse legacy sediment.",

It is located in the Southern portion of the country, as well as part of Argentina and the entire Uruguay, and is formed principally by natural grasslands that have been used for centuries for grazing livestock. In recent decades it has gone through a process of intense land use change and degradation, with the replacement of natural vegetation by rice paddy crops, soybean and exotic forests. Recent studies show that the Pampa has only 36% of its original vegetation in Brazil. Research on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in Pampa Biome are recent. It is known that the Pampa natural areas contain high stocks of soil organic carbon, and therefore their conservation is relevant for climate change mitigation. However, the net exchange of carbon and water between the surface and the atmosphere are unknown. To fill this gap, a flux tower network, SULFLUX –\nwww.ufsm.br/sulfux\n, was created. Currently, SULFLUX comprises three flux towers in the Pampa biome, two of them being over natural vegetation and the other one over a rice paddy. The flux towers are nearly 100 km apart from each other. We examine the effects of climate on carbon fluxes of through the year 2014. Analysis of temporal variability in water and CO2 fluxes are examined at daily to annual scales. Overall, regional variability in climatic drivers, land use and soil proprieties appears to have a greater effect on evapotranspiration than on net carbon exchange.",

            "abstract": "Massive amounts of Northwest African dust are transported westward over the Atlantic Ocean towards the Americas each year. These dust particles are thought to feed back on climate through a number of mechanisms including reflection of solar energy at the top of the atmosphere, absorption of energy that was reflected at the Earth’s surface in the lower atmosphere, changes of the Earth’s albedo, and fertilisation of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.\nWe are monitoring Saharan dust transport and deposition using an array of instruments that was deployed along a transect between Northwest Africa and the Caribbean at 12°N. In October 2012, we deployed five moorings along this transect between 23°W and 57°W with sediment traps that collect all material settling down through the water column on a temporal resolution of about two weeks. In November 2013, we added three dust-collecting buoys to the transect. The instruments on these buoys filter air to collect the dust particles that are suspended in the air just above sea level. In January 2015, the instruments were recovered and re-deployed for the third time, so that two years of sampling can help us understand the temporal and spatial variability of Saharan-dust deposition and its marine environmental effects. In this presentation, we will introduce the projects in the framework of which this study is carried out, and present preliminary data on grain-size trends as well as marine-environmental observations.\nSee: www.nioz.nl/dust",

            "abstract": "Complex geophysical flows such as tsunamis, water floods, and avalanche/debris flows, wave atmosphere interaction and violent river flow are the multiphysics flows characterized by large interfacial deformation and fragmentations and frequent topology change in various spatial and temporal scales. Dealing with such characteristics is still beyond the capabilities of many conventional mesh-based Eulerian numerical methods. Mesh-free particle (Lagrangian) numerical methods, such as Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), which have been developed for continuum mechanics, offer a unique opportunity to deal with such complexities. This research presents a mesh-free particle method for complex multi‐physics geophysical flows, based on a quasi incompressible MPS-based formulation for turbulent liquid, solid and gas multiphase systems. In combination with the various constitutive relations it is capable of dealing with the non-Newtonian behaviors in geophysical flows (e.g. for case of granular flows). The capabilities of proposed numerical method are evaluated and demonstrated for a series of computationally demanding examples including submarine landslide (and resulting tsunami wave), river flow/ice dynamics, and wave-air interaction. The capabilities of the model in accurate prediction of flow characteristics such as interfacial deformation, velocity/pressure fields, turbulence and mixing processes are demonstrated. Results of this study not only evaluates the capabilities of mesh-free particle methods for complex geophysical flows, but only provides a reliable tool for in deep analysis of mechanisms and processes involved in such flow systems.",

            "abstract": "Over recent decades oil palm plantations have rapidly expanded across Southeast Asia (SEA). Much of this expansion has come at the expense of natural forests and grasslands. Aircraft measurements from a 2008 campaign, OP3, found that oil palm plantations emit as much as 7 times more isoprene than nearby natural forests. Furthermore, SEA is a rapidly developing region, with increasing urban population, and growing air quality concerns. Thus, SEA represents an ideal case study to examine the impacts of land use change on air quality in the region, and whether those changes can be detected from satellite observations of atmospheric composition.\nWe investigate the impacts of historical and future oil palm expansion in SEA using satellite data, high-resolution land maps, and the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We examine the impact of palm plantations on surface-atmosphere processes (dry deposition, biogenic emissions). We show the sensitivity of air quality to current and future oil palm expansion scenarios, and discuss the limitations of current satellite measurements in capturing these changes. Our results indicate that while the impact of oil palm expansion on air quality can be significant, the retrieval error and sensitivity of the satellite measurements limit our ability to observe these impacts from space.",

            "abstract": "To confidently project future environmental changes as the climate warms it is imperative that we are able to quantify and explain changes in the geological past. Such analyses are important for reducing the uncertainty and range of future projections of climate change. The ocean system is a key component of all numerical models because of the role that currents have in distributing heat across the globe. Grain-size measurements, provenance studies and palaeocurrent directions from iceberg scours are among some of the traditional proxies used for investigating the strengths and directions of ancient currents. Many authors have shown that deep-water production and northward transport of heat in the North Atlantic was reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum, but our knowledge of past climatic cycles is comparatively limited.\nIn this work we show new evidence for a similar reduction during the third last glacial, for which only very limited palaeocurrent information was previously available. This is based on the discovery of an exquisitely well-preserved set of buried iceberg scours seen in 3D seismic reflection data on the mid-Norwegian shelf. These scours are dated to ~429 ka based on a spike of ice-rafted detritus on the Voring Plateau. This marks the culmination of the stage 12 glaciation when the Northern Hemisphere ice cover was rapidly melting before the onset of the stage 11 interglacial. This time period has long been seen as a crucial analogue for understanding the Holocene interglacial and contemporary climate change. The geometry of the scours shows that the icebergs were influenced by tidal and translatory ocean currents. The ratio of these current velocities compared to present shows that the translatory current was 50% slower than today. This suggests that northward movement of heat was reduced due to a more sluggish meridional overturning circulation during the deglacial. This was likely in response to large volumes of deglacial freshwater and icebergs, as is also indicated by the abundance of other deep-draft iceberg scours on the same stratigraphic level. Further work, particularly numerical modelling, is required to fully elucidate the oceanographic implications of these results.",

            "abstract": "This paper reviews some of the basic properties of fracture networks. Most of the data can only be derived numerically, and to be useful they need to be rationalized, i.e., a large set of numbers should be replaced by a simple formula which is easy to apply for estimating orders of magnitude.\nThree major tools are found useful in this rationalization effort. First, analytical results can usually be derived for infinite fractures, a limit which corresponds to large densities. Second, the excluded volume and the dimensionless density prove crucial to gather data obtained at intermediate densities. Finally, shape factors can be used to further reduce the influence of fracture shapes.\nPercolation of fracture networks is of primary importance since this characteristic controls transport properties such as permeability. Recent numerical studies for various types of fracture networks (isotropic, anisotropic, heterogeneous in space, polydisperse, mixture of shapes) are summarized; the percolation threshold rho is made dimensionless by means of the excluded volume. A general correlation for rho is proposed as a function of the gyration radius.\nThe statistical characteristics of the blocks which are cut in the solid matrix by the network are presented, since they control transfers between the porous matrix and the fractures. Results on quantities such as the volume, surface and number of faces are given and semi empirical relations are proposed.\nThe possible intersection of a percolating network and of a cubic cavity is also summarized. This might be of importance for the underground storage of wastes. An approximate reasoning based on the excluded volume of the percolating cluster and of the cubic cavity is proposed.\nFinally, consequences on the permeability of fracture networks are briefly addressed. An empirical formula which verifies some theoretical properties is proposed.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of the greenhouse gas N2O (δ15Nbulk, δ18O and 15N site preference (SP) of N2O) can be used to distinguish N2O production pathways. So far, controls of δ18O values are not sufficiently explored due to complex fractionation processes and varying extent of O-exchange with soil water. However, it can potentially serve as another isotopic parameter, beside SP values, enabling to differentiate between bacterial and fungal N2O production.\nIn the study presented here, natural isotopic signature of N2O and O-exchange between denitrification intermediates and water for the first time was analyzed simultaneously from three bacterial and three fungal pure cultures. Anaerobic incubations with nitrite for fungi and nitrate for bacteria as electron acceptors were conducted. Treatments with three waters differing in 18O signature were used to determine O-exchange. 15N labeled electron acceptors served to determine the ongoing production pathway. After an incubation time of five, ten and 14 days gas samples were taken and analyzed with GC-IRMS.\nAside from one fungus all others produced N2O by denitrification only. As expected, SP values of N2O produced by fungi were much higher compared to bacterial N2O. During fungal denitrification O-exchange was high (78 to 93%) and O isotope effects were stable over time and species and depended on O signature of water (42 to 48‰). In contrast, bacteria showed a much larger range of O-exchange (15 to 86%) with varying O isotope effects (14 to 39‰). Modelling O fractionation during denitrification revealed that O-exchange occurring by different enzymatic steps (nitrite reductase or nitric oxide reductase) could be responsible for the observed inconsistent O fractionation effects of bacteria compared to fungi. Thus, O fractionation of bacteria seems to be very complex and needs further investigation. Generally, fungal denitrification seems to be characterized by higher O fractionation effect than bacterial denitrification.",

Channel 1 of the Imager with a bandpass from 623 to 754 nm is the channel usually used for recording TLEs. However, it also covers the wavelength range of the OH* Meinel Band nightglow (8,3) in the infrared region, and this circumstance opens a window for us to study the relationship between OH* nightglow and TLEs. The result shows that over 95% of the elves are within +/- 2 pixels in altitude of the brightest OH* emission. The abrupt increase of atomic oxygen with altitude serves to release electrons from O2- thereby providing electrons the opportunity to attach to meteoric dust eventually. Atomic O is also vital to OH* nightglow as the necessary species to make O3. Additionally , from the fundamental reaction , O+ O2- -> O3 + e- , it can be seen that this is not only a key process to move the free electrons to the ablation dust toward making the electron density ledge, but is also an effective way to make O3 for the OH* nightglow. We suggest that the meteoric dust with abrupt appearance in the electron density ledge forms the upper boundary for the VLF waveguide. This circumstance may justify the use of the VLF waveguide cutoff height as a proxy for the dominant altitude of elves. When the global map of such cutoff heights (Toledo-Redondo et al., 2012) and the OH nightglow (WINDII) heights are compared, both show a distinct wavenumber-4 structure in the low-latitude region. The collocation of elves and the OH* nightglow layer is not coincidental and reveals new information about the structure of the D region.",

It is formed at pressures of 9-10 GPa, which correspond to a depth of 270-330 km. In this study, we use a combination of X‐ray diffraction and first principles simulations to constrain the equation of state and elasticity of the 3.65 Å phase. We find that the density of the 3.65 Å phase is slightly lower than the density of the 10 Å phase, which is stable at conditions relevant to cold subduction zones. However, the bulk sound velocities of the 3.65 Å phase are faster compared to the 10 Å phase. An assemblage of dense mantle phases such as stishovite (st), high-pressure clinoenstatite (HPCen) in association with the 3.65 Å phase (~8 %) could account for the seismically observed X-discontinuity. Based on the observed seismic reflection coefficient, we predict that the water content in cold subduction zone settings as in Tonga could be as high as 3 wt%.",

            "abstract": "Many potential events could define the onset of the Anthropocene in the Neotropics. The first effects caused by humans included the final extinction of megafauna around 10,000 years ago, and changes in fire frequency, particularly after about 8000 years ago. The first agriculture (squash) is evident in northwestern regions at 9000 BP, and in the Amazon Basin maize is cultivated by 6300 BP. But these events have not been widely documented on the continent and if some chronological uniformity is sought as a guide to defining the onset of the Anthropocene, they would fail that test.\nComing forward through time, increasing societal complexity is evident beginning about 3000 BP in both the Amazon and the Andes, but again the development was patchy. Some archaeologists are arguing that between c. 2000 BP and 500 BP the Amazon Basin became a manufactured landscape. While major river corridors were very likely influenced by human populations, the level of use in the great interfluvial areas (c. 90% of Amazonia) remains a matter of debate. The empirical data that exist for human presence in these areas point to sparse occupation, both in space and time, and the assertion that most of prehistoric Amazonia was manipulated by humans is unsupported. Following European contact, indigenous populations were reduced probably 90-95% within 200 years, which interrupted the cultural trajectory of the Neotropics.\nThe next possible contender for the local onset of the Anthropocene was the Rubber Boom (1879-1912). The Rubber Boom greatly increased human populations along many of the Amazon’s major rivers and tributaries. Hunting and deforestation picked up pace, and the growing presence of steamships allowed exportation of a wide range of Amazonian products beyond rubber, e.g. plumes, timber, and turtle oil. In addition to these local effects, the global effects that came with increased fossil fuel use and industrialization, would also have influenced all of South America. Even so, the influence of the Rubber Boom would have been strongest in the Amazon Basin and far milder in the Andes or along the Pacific coastline.\nIn the 1950s-1970s the green revolutions and fossil-fuel based agriculture caused an increase in global NOx. Increased NOx deposition and the appearance of plastics may be defining markers of the Anthropocene in South America.",

            "abstract": "Rapidly uplifting mountains at convergent plate margins are currently not represented in the CZO network. Despite the potential impact on global carbon sequestration and biogeochemical cycling, the critical zone’s response to processes associated with high tectonic uplift is poorly defined. The western Southern Alps constitute an ideal laboratory of such conditions with up to 1 cm y-1 tectonic uplift, >10 m y-1 precipitation and up to 2.5 mm y-1 denudation/ soil production. To date, most studies have utilised river data to make inferences about weathering but little work has been done on the critical zone directly. Here we present new river, soil, groundwater and bedrock geochemical data and discuss their implications. River water composition followed the known trend of high Ca/Na molar ratios in the region (=2.7, n=6) but also revealed positive and negative correlations of flow-rate with 87/86Sr and Ca/Na molar ratios, respectively. High flow rates are also associated with elevated Fe, Al and Mn concentrations. Maximum Fe, Al and Mn concentrations were observed in soil water that also had the lowest measured Ca/Na molar ratios of <0.1. Groundwater typically featured the highest Ca/Na ratios of >3.9, and had the highest concentrations of Ca, Mg, Si, and Sr. Phosphorus fractions used as tracers for chemical modification indicate that 50% of the total P in bedrock at the soil base has been already transformed from a primary mineral form into various secondary forms, further increasing to >90% in soils.

            "abstract": "Previous studies of the 2009 Harrat Lunayyir (western Saudi Arabia) dike intrusion have shown extensive ground deformation. However, these studies did not report fully the spatial and temporal evolution of ground deformation during majority of the activity. Here we use additional InSAR observations, stress calculations and analog experiments to unravel the sequence of events during the intrusion and to analyze the interaction between the intruding dike and normal faulting at Harrat Lunayyir. We find that surface deformation is first observed in data from 16 May, about four weeks after the earthquake activity started, when surface displacements due to a ~1.9 m thick dike intrusion are observed. From 19 May, the dike propagated to within ~1 km of the surface, with graben-bounding normal fault displacements dominating the near-field deformation. The volume of the dike increased gradually from a total of ~0.06 km3 on 16 May to ~0.13 km3 on 17 June. Coulomb failure stress-change calculations of the dike-fault interaction show that the growing dike caused extension above its tip and triggered slip on the graben-bounding normal faults. In return, the faulting lead to compression around the upper tip of dike, holding back its vertical propagation. Our analog experiments show that the wedge-shape graben at the surface is consistent with the asymmetric arched shape of the dike at shallow depth.",

            "abstract": "Southeastern Brazil is under a period of drought that has impacted the conservation of watersheds and the management of water quality and quantity for agricultural and urban demands. In this context agro-hydrological modeling tools can generate information of water response over time in response to climate and landuse changes. A 12-km2 watershed which has suffered from anthropogenic activities is the Ribeirão das Posses watershed that is located in the extreme south of Minas Gerais State and is a headwater catchment of the Jaguari river, one of the contributing rivers of the Cantareira Reservoir Complex in the state of São Paulo. This watershed had its landscape changed over the last century from native forests to more homogeneous vegetation for pastures and small crops and some forest plantations fragments with eucalyptus. Currently, the Conservative Waters project has planted some small areas with vegetation of native species, especially where there are springs and at the top of the hills, in order to recover degraded areas and improve the hydrogeochemistry in this study basin. In this context, the AgroEcoSystem-Watershed (AgES-W) model is presented to simulate the water movement and storage in agricultural watersheds with different spatial resolutions of land areas or hydrological responses units. The objectives are to evaluate the quality and quantity of water in Ribeirão das Posses Basin using measured data, then simulate these responses in space and time to test the AgES-W model. The period chosen for research was from 2011 to 2015, because the water quality data were collected during this period. The answers that we hope to find out are: How well does the AgES-W model simulate this Brazilian watershed in the tropics? What are the future prospects of the quality and quantity of water in this basin? The results will help to guide hydrological simulations in similar tropical environments in Brazil in this and other agricultural watersheds with AgES-W.",

            "abstract": "Environmental changes in the Arctic and Antarctic appear to be accelerating and scientists are trying to understand both the patterns and the impacts of change. These changes will have profound impact on humanity and create a need for public education about these critical habitats. We have focused on a two-pronged strategy to increase public awareness as well as enable educators to discuss comfortably the implications of climate change. Our first focus is on entraining public support through the development of science documentaries about the science and people who conduct it. Antarctic Edge is a feature length award-winning documentary about climate change that has been released in May 2015 and has garnered interest in movie theatres and on social media stores (NetFlix, ITunes). This broad outreach is coupled with our group’s interest assisting educators formally. The majority of current polar education is focused on direct educator engagement through personal research experiences that have impact on the participating educators’ classrooms. Polar Interdisciplinary Coordinated Education (ICE) proposes to improve educator and student engagement in polar sciences through exposure to scientists and polar data. Through professional development and the creation of data tools, Polar ICE will reduce the logistical costs of bringing polar science to students in grades 6-16. We will provide opportunities to: 1) build capacity of polar scientists in communicating and engaging with diverse audiences; 2) create scalable, in-person and virtual opportunities for educators and students to engage with polar scientists and their research through data visualizations, data activities, educator workshops, webinars, and student research symposia; and 3) evaluate the outcomes of Polar ICE and contribute to our understanding of science education practices. We will use a blended learning approach to promote partnerships and cross-disciplinary sharing. This combined multi-pronged approach is critically important to entraining society in understanding the ramifications of changing polar systems.",

            "abstract": "In March of 2015 we mapped the resistivity structure of the Del Mar methane seep in the inner California borderlands using a deep towed electromagnetic (EM) source and receiver array. Located in the San Diego trough at a depth of 1km, the seep site is on the flank of a mound associated with a transpressive step in the San Diego trough fault. The seep site has previously been associated with seafloor pockmarks, acoustic wipeouts, chemosynthetic communities, and active methane bubble venting. Controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys are performed by deep-towing an EM source that is transmitting a known signal; this signal is detected by towed receivers. This transmitted signal is altered by the electrical properties of the surrounding environment. Compared to seismic methods, EM methods are largely insensitive to free gas, making it an especially useful tool for detecting electrically resistive methane hydrate in areas of active gas venting. We used a 50m dipole transmitting 100A, with 3-axis electric field receivers spaced at 130m, 230m, 330m, and 430m behind the transmitter dipole center. The receiver data are inverted using MARE2DEM, a finite element 2D inversion routine. The inversion results show the background resistivity of the trough sediments to be about 1-2 ohmm, and are largely featureless outside of the seep site. However at the seep site we see a decanter-shaped 100 ohmm resistor whose base is 100m below the seafloor, and 1km wide at its widest. This feature narrows at the top to form a pipe structure about 200m wide that extends to the seafloor. These resistive structures are interpreted to be methane hydrate resulting from methane rich fluid flow along faults associated with the transpressional system that brackets the seep site.",

            "abstract": "On August 3, 2014, an Ms6.5 earthquake struck Ludian county, Zhaotong city in Yunnan province, China. Although this earthquake is not very big, it caused abnormal severe damages. Thus, study on the causes of the serious damages of this moderate strong earthquake may help us to evaluate seismic hazards for similar earthquakes. Besides the factors which directly relate to the damages, such as site effects, quality of buildings, seismogenic structures and the characteristics of the mainshock and the aftershocks may also responsible for the seismic hazards. Since focal mechanism solution and centroid depth provide key information of earthquake source properties and tectonic stress field, and the focal depth is one of the most important parameters which control the damages of earthquakes, obtaining precise FMSs and focal depths of the Ludian earthquake sequence may help us to determine the detailed geometric features of the rupture fault and the seismogenic environment.\nIn this work we obtained the FMSs and centroid depths of the Ludian earthquake and its Ms>3.0 aftershocks by the revised CAP method, and further verified some focal depths using the depth phase method. Combining the FMSs of the mainshock and the strong aftershocks, as well as their spatial distributions, and the seismogenic environment of the source region, we can make the following characteristics of the Ludian earthquake sequence and its seismogenic structure: (1) The Ludian earthquake is a left-lateral strike slip earthquake, with magnitude of about Mw6.1. The FMS of nodal plane I is 75o/56o/180o for strike, dip and rake angles, and 165o/90o/34ofor the other nodal plane. (2) The Ludian earthquake is very shallow with the optimum centroid depth of ~3 km, which is consistent with the strong ground shaking and the surface rupture observed by field survey and strengthens the damages of the Ludian earthquake. (3) The Ludian Earthquake should occur on the NNW trend BXF. Because two later aftershocks occurred close to the fault zone of the ZLF, and their FMSs are similar with the characteristics of the ZLF, the shallower part of the ZLF may also rupture during the aftershock duration of the Ludian earthquake. Since the ZLF is much longer than the BXF, the seismic risk of the ZLF may be high and should be required more attention.",

            "abstract": "Study about the evolutions of coronal magnetic flux ropes has important significance in understanding solar energetic activities. In previous studies, it is suggested that there exists a catastrophe, during which the flux rope jumps upward from the equilibrium at a lower altitude to another equilibrium at higher altitude or running away. This 'upward' catastrophe is believed to be an efficient mechanism for the solar eruptive activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. In this work, we numerically study and discuss the possibility of the catastrophe of a flux rope in the reversed way, i.e., the flux rope jumps from a higher altitude to a lower altitude, which we call it 'downward' catastrophe. From the simulation in force free magnetic field under a partially open bipolar magnetic configuration, we found that such 'downward' catastrophe does exists. Although the flux rope moves oppositely during the two different catastrophes, the magnetic energies are always released. This indicates that the flaring phenomenon might be also triggered by the 'downward' catastrophe, during which no coronal mass ejections will accompany.",

            "abstract": "Stemflow is an important phenomenon in forests and shrublands but has remained poorly understood, despite the fact that it can alter the hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of wooded landscapes. Several key areas of stemflow research where significant increases in our understanding have developed over the past decade include stemflow-soil interactions and the interactions between stemflow and canopy fungi. Other areas of new knowledge have improved our understanding of stemflow generation within events and the dynamic interplay between stemflow and canopy structure. In addition, some work has examined the cycling of particulate matter by stemflow. The stemflow research in these topical areas is summarized and synthesized with a particular focus on areas where future research should be conducted. Guidance on the quantification of stemflow fluxes is also presented. Specifically, we supply several equations to better frame stemflow inputs into wooded ecosystems and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of many different stemflow parameters. With an increasing recognition on the importance of stemflow throughout the geoscience community, it is likely that our knowledge of stemflow generation and its importance in the larger scope of watershed hydrology and biogoechemistry will be achieved.\nPublication note: This presentation is based on the following article: Levia, D.F. and Germer, S. 2015.

            "abstract": "The strength of the climate feedbacks by which the Earth responds to a given radiative forcing depend themselves on the climate state of the Earth. If the sum of these feedbacks gets more positive as the Earth warms, the warming response can become highly nonlinear, and sensitivity can greatly increase. Such increases are difficult to model properly with general circulation models (GCMs), as these increases can push GCMs into regimes outside of their configurations, causing numerical and physical blow-up. Understanding these cases is vital to understanding the risks posed by anthropogenic forcings.\nIn this talk, we present results from two approaches to studying feedback temperature dependence. The first explores our ability to model highly nonlinear behavior using a perturbed physics ensemble in which parameters controlling convection and cloud formation are varied in several versions of the CAM atmospheric models. The feedback temperature dependence of the resulting ensemble members is estimated. We test our hypothesis that existing GCMs lie close to (or past) the threshold of extreme nonlinear behavior. We also test this hypothesis by analyzing the RCP8.5 runs in the CMIP5 archive.\nThe second approach uses observations and paleoclimate proxies to estimate how sensitivity changes under warming. An established literature uses estimates of the temperature changes and forcings from the instrumental record to estimate modern day sensitivity. We combine these estimates with temperature proxies and δ13C records of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum to estimate the sensitivity of the Paleocene, as well as the temperature dependence of the overall climate feedback. Consideration is given to other sources of nonlinear sensitivity, such as changes in boundary conditions. We find a substantial increase in sensitivity under warmer temperatures.",

            "abstract": "During formation, magnetic minerals record the direction and intensity of the Earth’s magnetic field. Paleomagnetists use this information to investigate, for example, past tectonic plate motion and geodynamo evolution. However, subsequent to formation the constituent magnetic minerals are commonly exposed to a range of weathering conditions and environments. One of the most common weathering processes is maghemization, which is the oxidation of magnetite (Fe3O4) at ambient temperatures, i.e., the slow oxidation of Fe3O4 to maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), and is known to alter the original remanent magnetization.\nOf the constituent magnetic minerals, particles in the single domain (SD) grain size range (< 100 nm) are regarded as ideal paleomagnetic recorders because of their strong remanence and high magnetic stability, with potential relaxation times greater than that of the age of the Universe. However, magnetic signals from rocks are often dominated by small grains with non-uniform magnetization that exhibit magnetic recording fidelities similar to those of SD grains (termed pseudo-SD (PSD)).\nIn this context, the effect of maghemization on the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 grains in the PSD size range is investigated as a function of annealing temperature. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirms the precursor grains as Fe3O4 ranging from ~ 150 nm to ~ 250 nm in diameter, whilst Mössbauer spectrometry suggests the grains are initially near-stoichiometric. The Fe3O4 grains are heated to increasing reaction temperatures of 120 – 220 ºC to investigate their oxidation to γ-Fe2O3. High-angle annular dark field imaging and localized electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals slightly oxidized Fe3O4 grains, heated to 140 ºC, exhibit higher oxygen content at the surface. Off-axis electron holography allows for construction of magnetic induction maps of individual Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 grains, revealing their PSD (vortex) nature, which is supported by magnetic hysteresis measurements, including first-order reversal curve analysis. The coercivity of the grains is shown to increase with reaction temperature up to 180 ºC, but subsequently decreases after heating above 200 ºC; this magnetic behavior is attributed to the growth of a γ-Fe2O3 shell with magnetic properties distinct from the Fe3O4 core.",

            "abstract": "The concept of data being “Born Semantic” has been proposed in recent years as a Semantic Web analogue to the idea of data being \"born digital\"[1], [2]. Within the \"Born Semantic\" concept, data are captured digitally and at a point close to the time of creation are annotated with markup terms from semantic web resources (controlled vocabularies, thesauri or ontologies). This allows heterogeneous data to be more easily ingested and amalgamated in near real-time due to the standards compliant annotation of the data.\nIn taking the \"Born Semantic\" proposal from concept to operation, a number of difficulties have been encountered. For example, although there are recognised methods such as Header, Dictionary, Triples [3] for the compression, publication and dissemination of large volumes of triples these systems are not practical to deploy in the field on low-powered (both electrically and computationally) devices. Similarly, it is not practical for instruments to output fully formed semantically annotated data files if they are designed to be plugged into a modular system and the data to be centrally logged in the field as is the case on Argo floats and oceanographic gliders where internal bandwidth becomes an issue [2].\nIn light of these issues, this presentation will concentrate on pragmatic solutions being developed to the problem of generating Linked Data in near real-time systems. Specific examples from the European Commission SenseOCEAN project where Linked Data systems are being developed for autonomous underwater platforms, and from work being undertaken in the streaming of data from the Irish Galway Bay Cable Observatory initiative will be highlighted. Further, developments of a set of tools for the LogStash-ElasticSearch software ecosystem to allow the storing and retrieval of Linked Data will be introduced.\n",

A significant amount of literature showed that PAM plays an important role to control erosion. However, researchers are looking for more natural alternative for PAM. This study evaluated two anionic polymers including low and high molecular weight (MW), root exudates and bacterial exudates. We evaluated their influence on the rate and efficacy of colloid flocculation and the percent of water stable aggregates. We found that PAM was more effective than EPS in flocculating the colloids and all polymers increased the percent of stable soil aggregates although the PAM was more effective. These data suggest that the EPS would be less effective than PAM for reducing water erosion owing to its lesser flocculation and aggregate stabilizing potential.",

The project consists of 18 partners with expertise in a broad range of sub-orbital and satellite observations and will run from 2015 through 2018. It intends to make use of primarily reference quality measurements (traceable with robust uncertainty quantification) to achieve its aims. Work packages cover:\n* Defining and mapping sub-orbital measurement capabilities based upon quantifable properties such as traceability and representivity;\n* Improving metrological characterisation of key measurements including robust uncertainty estimation;\n* Improved understanding of the effects of inevitable co-location mismatch related uncertainties; and\n* The use of data assimilation as tool for propogating information from reference network measurements.\nOutcomes will be presented through a 'Virtual Observatory' facility via EUMETSAT with the plan to potentially become an operational service for the future. There are many opportunities to get involved including, but not limited to, an envisaged series of user workshops. We would also appreciate having volunteers who may be interested in beta testing and providing feedback on the tools from the Virtual Observatory. Further details on the project can be found at www.gaia-clim.eu.\nThis presentation will primarily provide an overview of project objectives.

            "abstract": "Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large-scale solar wind transients characterized primarily by an enhanced and smoothly-rotating magnetic field over periods of the order of one day. They are the drivers of the most intense geomagnetic storms, therefore understanding their interaction with the Earth's environment is of major interest for space weather forecasting. The first steps of this complex chain of processes are their interaction with the terrestrial bow shock and the ensuing propagation in the magnetosheath. Recent studies have shown that under certain conditions the distinctive magnetic structure of MCs can be significantly altered downstream of the bow shock. In such case, the magnetic field impinging on the magnetosphere strongly differs from that in the upstream solar wind and could lead to a reconnection pattern very different from that expected from the solar wind observations. The aim of the present work is to substantiate and generalize these results, obtained from a few MC events, in performing a statistical study. For this purpose, a comprehensive database of MC events, covering about 15 years of data, from 2000 to 2014, has been compiled. It lists presently 151 MCs observed in L1 by either Wind or ACE. Using the events during which spacecraft observations in the magnetosheath are simultaneously available, we investigate the evolution of the magnetic structure of MCs from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. The influence of the upstream solar wind parameters, such as the plasma beta, the Alfven Mach number or the magnetic field strength, is examined. Using a semi-analytical model, we estimate the local shock properties encountered upon entering the magnetosheath and find that the alteration of the magnetic structure of MCs strongly depend on the shock geometry. The large dataset allows us to assess the limitations of the magnetosheath model. The consequences of our results in terms of the geoeffectivity of MCs are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Every year, an estimated 140 million tons of Saharan dust are deposited in the Atlantic Ocean, which can have several direct and indirect effects on global and regional climate. For example, dust can scatter and absorb incoming and reflected solar radiation, transport nutrients and pathogens, and act as mineral ballast particles in the ocean. In order to constrain the relations between atmospheric dust and climate, submarine sediment traps at five stations along a transect across the Atlantic Ocean at 12°N were deployed, at 1200m and 3500m water depth. Samples of seven of these sediment traps, that sampled from October 2012 to November 2013, have been analyzed on particle size and dust flux.\nThe size of the dust particles is important because it can have an effect on the positive or negative radiation balance in the atmosphere. Small particles in the high atmosphere can reflect incoming radiation and therefore potentially have a cooling effect on climate. Large particles in the lower atmosphere have the opposite effect by absorbing reflected radiation from the Earth’s surface. Mineral dust also affects carbon export to the deep ocean by providing mineral ballast for organic particles, and the size of the dust particles directly relates to the downward transport velocity.\nHere I will present the measured grain-size distributions of first-year samples from seven sediment traps recovered from the 12°N-latitude transect as well as dust flux data. The data show seasonal variations, with finer grained dust particles during winter and spring, and coarser grained particles during summer and fall. Also a fining trend of the grain sizes of the dust particles from source (Africa) to sink (Caribbean) is observed, which is expected due to intuitive relationships between size and transport distance. The observed size of the dust particles at large distances from their source is much larger than previously assumed and applied in climate models.\nSee: www.nioz.nl/dust",

            "abstract": "Bulk flux algorithms are routinely used in climate and numerical weather prediction models to estimate the surface exchange of momentum, heat, and moisture. However, these algorithms often perform poorly over sea ice where the effect of variable ice conditions on the exchange coefficient is poorly understood. This is largely due to the paucity of direct surface flux measurements in polar regions with which are needed to develop better algorithms. Some recent state of the art parameterizations attempt to address this issue by accounting for both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sea ice due to, for example, the appearance of leads and melt ponds in summer, and the dependence of ice surface roughness on morphology and age. These parameterizations are derived largely from theoretical considerations and have yet to be thoroughly tested against observations.\nHere, we present direct measurements of surface stress, heat and moisture fluxes obtained during a 3 month cruise in the Arctic Ocean during summer 2014. Measurements were made via the eddy covariance technique from a mast over the bow of the icebreaker Oden. Flux estimates were obtained over a wide range of surface conditions, ranging from open water to multi-year pack ice. Digital imagery is used to classify the surface through estimation of local ice properties, including the fractional area of multiple ice categories, melt ponds, and leads. Variability in transfer coefficient estimates with surface conditions is investigated, and several parameterizations of differing complexity are tested using the direct estimates.",

            "abstract": "The structure of magma plumbing systems controls the distribution of volcanism, thereby influencing continental break-up and passive margin evolution. However, delimiting the structure of entire plumbing systems is difficult because: (1) intrusion networks cannot be directly accessed at active volcanoes; (2) field outcrops are limited by exposure; and (3) the resolution of geophysical data imaging the sub-surface is restricted. As a result, models involving the vertical transfer of magma in dikes, which extend from a melt source to overlying reservoirs and eruption sites, dominate the volcanic literature. Whilst there is evidence supporting the existence of vertically stacked plumbing systems, we compile a series of field- and seismic reflection-based case studies documenting the importance of extensive lateral magma transport (up to 4100 km) within sill-complexes. Most of these sill-complexes are emplaced into sediment-filled rift basins (e.g., Rockall Basin, NE Atlantic; Ceduna Sub-basin, offshore southern Australia; Karoo Basin, South Africa). There is also evidence that some sill-complexes occur within crystalline, continental crust (e.g., in the Yilgarn Craton, Australia). The case studies presented demonstrate that sill-complex emplacement is largely controlled by host rock lithology and structure. Sill intrusion is accommodated through roof uplift or, alternatively, via non-brittle processes (e.g., porosity reduction induced by host rock fluidization) that may not deform the overburden. The full or partial accommodation of magma by space-making mechanisms other than roof uplift means that intruding magma volumes may be underestimated by or completely hidden from ground deformation analyses. We show that plumbing systems need not be vertically stacked. Magma can instead be transported within laterally extensive (up to 3 × 106 km2) sill-complexes, promoting the development of volcanoes that do not overlie the melt source.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, some changes have been experienced in the climate in the region related to the dam constructions and lake formations within the scope of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP). In the study, we presented a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal trends in suspended sediment flux based on daily gauge measurements of river discharge (Q) and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) from seven sites along Euphrates River for 30 years in average. In conjunction with satellite data depicting rainfall we infer climatic evaluation of peak SSC events.All the data were obtained through time in order to provide to make the link to sediment removal and erosion - especially in the aftermath of agricultural development and dam construction. Moreover, we combine these data with remotely sensed rainfall to elucidate driving mechanisms for peak SSC (≥99th percentile) days and assess their impact on the suspended sediment budget. Preliminary results from the gauge data indicate positive correlations between daily river discharge and daily SSC for all stations , i.e. the higher the river discharge, the higher the sediment concentration. This correlation suggests increasing mobilization of transiently stored sediment along the river as the river discharge increases. However, some days are characterized by extraordinary high SSC values that occasionally range 1–2 orders of magnitude above the seasonal average and therefore exhibit large residuals from the fitted Q-SSC relationship. Our preliminary results indicate that in all stations of the study area, the 90th SSC percentile accounts for more than 55% of the total suspended sediment flux and similarly, the 90th discharge percentile accounts for maximum 50% of the total discharge flux. Besides, we defined rainstorms as days during which rainfall exceeds the 99th percentile of all days with rainfall ≥.1 mm/day during the last 15-yr rainfall data set and within each station. We also defined peak SSC days as days in which the SSC exceeds the 99th percentile of the entire SSC data set from each station. In other words, peak SSC days correspond to the uppermost 1% magnitude of the SSC data set. In case of several successive peak SSC days, we assume a single trigger mechanism and refer to peak SSC events.",

            "abstract": "In light of evidence for extensive modern ocean acidification, it has become imperative to better understand the global carbon cycle by reconstructing past ocean acidification/alkalization events. Our goal is to test the deglacial global alkalization hypothesis using a multi-proxy approach by reconstructing the pH, temperature, and [CO32-] of thermocline waters and the dissolution in deep sea sediments over the last 25,000 years in core ME-27 from the eastern equatorial Pacific. Our specific research questions are: Is there unequivocal evidence for a deglacial ocean alkalization event? If yes, what was the magnitude of the alkalization event? If no, how can we explain why evidence of this event is missing from our core? We inferred temperature from Mg/Ca, and habitat water [CO32-] from sized-normalized shell weight in Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. Dissolution in sediments was estimated using the Globorotalia menardii Fragmentation Index (MFI). We see no clear indication of a deglacial ocean alkalization event with our proxies. Neither our shell weight, nor MFI data show a more alkaline deglacial ocean compared to the Last Glacial Maximum and the modern Interglacial. Instead, we observe a steady decrease in thermocline [CO32-], and increase in deep sea calcite preservation since the LGM. Our results may indicate that the global alkalization event was obscured in ME-27 due to higher organic carbon fluxes during the deglacial, and/or due to yet undetermined effects of temperature on the foraminifer shell weight proxy.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) affect the tropospheric oxidative capacity due to their ubiquitous abundance and relatively high reactivity towards the hydroxyal radical. Over the ocean and away from terrestrial emission sources, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) make up a large fraction of VOCs as airmasses age and become more oxidized. In addition to being produced or destroyed in the marine atmosphere, OVOCs can also be emitted from or deposited to the surface ocean. Here we first present direct air-sea flux measurements of three of the most abundant OVOCs – methanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde, by the eddy covariance technique from two cruises in the Atlantic: the Atlantic Meridional Transect in 2012 and the High Wind Gas Exchange Study in 2013. The OVOC mixing ratios were quantified by a high resolution proton-reaction-transfer mass spectrometer with isotopically labeled standards and their air-sea (net) fluxes were derived from the eddy covariance technique. Net methanol flux was consistently from the atmosphere to the surface ocean, while acetone varied from supersaturation (emission) in the subtropics to undersaturation (deposition) in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic. The net air-sea flux of acetaldehyde is near zero through out the Atlantic despite the apparent supersaturation of this compound in the surface ocean. Knowing the dissolved concentrations and in situ production rates of these compounds in seawater, we then estimate their bulk atmospheric depositions and oceanic emissions. Lastly, we summarize the state of knowledge on the air-sea transport of a number of organic gasses, and postulate the magnitude and environmental impact of total organic carbon transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, simulation of low latitude ionospheric response to the recent super geomagnetic storm of 17 March 2015 at Indian longitude, utilizing SAMI2 codes by incorporating Doppler EXB drift, relevant to the storm period, is being presented. Intense enhancement in the EXB drift of 60 to 70 m/s over magnetic equator was observed in the evening hours of 17 March due to the prompt penetration of the high latitude electric field. This remarkable intensification of EXB drift transported the F layer to beyond 550 km altitude, quite unusual in the Indian sector. Model EXB drift in the day time during the recovery phase of the super storm was slightly westward, unlike the eastward EXB drift during the quiet day. This has been found to be linked with the disturbance dynamo during the recovery phase. SAMI2 model, utilizing the Doppler EXB drift during the evening hours and model EXB drift during the rest of the period, could simulate the intense F layer height rise and latitudinal expansion of EIA during storm main phase. Equator ward disturbance thermospheric winds during the recovery phase have also been incorporated in the simulation. Simulation results also indicated a complete suppression of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) during the recovery phase, linked with the westward disturbance dynamo electric field. Model simulations indicate the role of the disturbance neutral winds during the recovery phase in enhancing the plasma density, however, the development of the EIA has been found to be controlled by the zonal electric field. The model results have been compared with the ground observations of the total electron content (TEC). TEC map over the Indian region shows a remarkable suppression of the EIA during the recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. Peculiarities of this super storm will also be discussed in the light of the current understanding of the space weather impact on the low latitude ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Skillful prediction of Arctic sea ice is important for the wide variety of interests focused in that region. However, the current operational system used by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center does not adequately predict the seasonal climatology of sea ice extent and maintains too high sea ice coverage across the Arctic. It is thought that the primary reasoning for this lies in the initialization of sea ice thickness. Experiments are carried out using the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) model with an improved sea ice thickness initialization from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Analysis and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) rather than the default Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) sea ice thickness data. All other variables are initialized from CFSR. In addition, physics parameterizations are adjusted to better simulate real world conditions. Here we focus on hindcasts initialized from 2005-2014. Although the seasonal cycle of sea ice is generally better captured in runs that use PIOMAS sea ice thickness initialization, local sea ice freeze in early winter in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea is delayed when both sea ice thickness configurations are used. In addition ice freeze in the North Atlantic is more pronounced than in the observations. This shows that simply changing initial sea ice thickness is not enough to improve forecasts for all locations. Modeled atmospheric and oceanic parameters are investigated including the radiation budget, land surface temperature advection, and sub-surface oceanic heat flow to diagnose possible reasons for the modeling deficiencies, and further modifications to the model will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, seismic observations have provided increasing evidence for significant heterogeneity in Earth’s lower mantle at both large (i.e. large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs) and comparatively small (ultra-low velocity zones, or ULVZs) scales. One possible source of heterogeneity is variation in the Fe-content of the (Mg,Fe)O component of the lower mantle due to melting events and/or reactions with Earth’s outer core. Most previous studies have focused on compositions containing ~10-20 mol% Fe, but small amounts of compositions with an enhanced Fe concentration may strongly impact the elastic properties of the bulk phase assemblage. Here, we present results from two high-precision single-crystal x-ray diffraction studies on (Fe0.78Mg0.22)O magnesiowüstite to pressures of about 55 GPa at 300 K, one using neon and the other using helium as pressure-transmitting media. We observe a noticeably different compression behavior in the two pressure media at pressures greater than about 20 GPa, and compare to previous work on similar compositions. We also conducted a complementary single-crystal time domain synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy (SMS) study on the same composition in a helium medium to about 70 GPa to gain insight into the atom-scale properties of the Fe sublattice. We discuss the resulting hyperfine fields as a function of pressure, including the isomer shift, quadrupole splitting, magnetic, and texturing parameters. The advantages of using single crystals for such investigations will also be discussed. Finally, implications for the elastic properties of magnesiowüstite in the deep mantle will be considered.",

Over the past two decades a variety of mechanisms have been identified through which these waves induce mixing and hydrodynamic instabilities throughout the water column. Near the bottom boundary, these waves have been associated with increased sediment resuspension. In this study, we considered the head on collisions of internal solitary waves. Mathematically, these collisions have been classified as “weak” and hence seemed a reasonable place to begin a systematic study of internal solitary wave collisions. Using well-resolved numerical simulations, we will demonstrate that head on collisions can, in fact, be far from weak. They induce significant overturning (and hence mixing) at the back of the wave after the collision has occurred, and induce instability near the bottom that can effectively transport tracer that is initially found in the bottom boundary layer. Unlike past studies in the literature, the near bottom instability does not manifest itself as a bursting separation bubble.",

            "abstract": "How tectonic processes operated and changed through the Precambrian is debated: what was the nature and scale of orogenic events and were they different on the younger, hotter, more ductile Earth? The geology of northern Hudson Bay records the Paleoproterozoic collision between the Western Churchill and Superior plates: the 1.8Ga Trans-Hudson Orogeny (THO) and is thus an ideal study locale to address this issue. It has been suggested, primarily on the strength of traditional field geology, that the THO was comparable in scale and style to the present-day Himalayan-Karakoram-Tibet Orogen (HKTO). However, understanding of the deep crustal architecture of the THO, and how it compares to the evolving HKTO is presently lacking.\nThrough joint inversion of teleseismic receiver functions and surface wave data, we obtain new Moho depth estimates and shear velocity models for the crust and upper mantle. Archean crust in the Rae, Hearne and Churchill domains is thin and structurally simple, with a sharp Moho; upper crustal wavespeed variations are readily attributed to post-formation events. However, the Paleoproterozoic Quebec-Baffin segment of the THO has a deeper Moho and more complex crustal structure. Our observations are strikingly similar to recent models, computed using the same methods, of the HKTO lithosphere, where deformation also extends >400km beyond the collision front. On the strength of Moho character, present-day crustal thickness, and metamorphic grade, we thus propose that southern Baffin experienced uplift of a similar magnitude and spatial extent to the Himalayas during the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogeny.",

In this study the observational data records from MODIS and AIRS spanning 2002-2014 are combined with ECMWF-interim reanalysis to compare the observed variability of low cloud to the predicted response to warming. Large-scale thermodynamic and dynamical predictors of LCC selected based on insight from large-eddy simulations and observational analysis. Observations show that increasing inversion strength is associated with increased cloud cover. Drying of the free-troposphere is associated with decreased cloud cover, as entrainment of dry air thins the cloud. Decreased cloud cover accompanies subsidence. Finally, it is found that increasing SST at fixed wind speed leads to a robust decrease in cloud cover. Idealized estimates of the response of EIS, free tropospheric relative humidity, and subsidence to a uniform SST warming are used to calculate the change in LCC. Decreases in LCC due to enhanced SST dominate the response and are only slightly offset by increases in EIS. In combination, these effects infer an overall decrease in low cloud cover in the subtropics of 1-3% for a 1K SST increase.",

            "abstract": "The internal structure of ophiolite complexes plays a key role in illuminating processes in both mid-ocean ridge (MOR) and suprasubduction zone (SSZ) environments. However, it is not yet clear to what extent the internal structure of the crust and processes may differ between these settings. Thus, it may be useful to compare details of reconstructed ophiolites with known MOR crustal structures. Very large variations in the structure of the oceanic lithosphere generated at MOR spreading centers have been documented as a function of low magma budget (or spreading rate). Even at intermediate (~50-80 mm/yr) to fast (80->120 mm/yr) spreading rates, involving spreading with a persistent magma supply, significant variations occur. A synthesis of seafloor observations, crustal drilling and seismic data for relatively fast-spread upper oceanic crust may help distinguish ophiolites generated at MORs from those from SSZ settings. Crust formed at the fastest rates has a relatively uniform seismic thickness, thin lavas, and a relatively thick, near-vertical sheeted dike unit over complex massive to layered gabbroic rocks. Intermediate rate crust is more variable in seismic thickness and has much thicker lavas and sheeted dikes showing evidence of tilting, fracturing, and subsidence during construction of the upper crust over a heterogeneous gabbroic middle crust. Crustal sections formed at rates between these limits show a range of intermediate structures. These structural features correlate well with spreading rate, and possibly magma supply, and have implications for the reconstruction of ophiolite complexes. A more complete documentation of MOR lithosphere (independent of ophiolites) in this range of rates will require: 1) sampling of the middle to lower oceanic crust and mantle by deep drilling and 2) determining the internal structure of the crust along spreading segments, providing a basis for identifying ophiolites that formed in MOR and SSZ settings.",

            "abstract": "The Amundsen Embayment sector of West Antarctica is experiencing some of the fastest sustained bedrock uplift rates in the world. These motions, recorded by the Antarctic GPS Network (ANET), cannot be explained in terms of the earth’s elastic response to contemporary ice loss, and the residues are far too rapid to be explained using traditional GIA models. We use 13 years of very high resolution DEM-derived ice mass change fields over the Amundsen sector to compute the elastic signal and remove it from the observed geodetic time series. We obtain a very large residual - up to 5 times larger than the computed elastic response. Low or very low mantle viscosities are expected in this area based on existing heat flow estimates, seismic velocity anomalies, thin crust, and active volcanism, all of which are associated with geologically recent rifting. We hypothesize that the rapid crustal displacement manifests a low viscosity short-time-scale response to post- Little Ice Age ice mass changes, including ice losses developed in the last decade or so. A plausible ice history for the last hundred years is made by using the actual measurements from 2002 to 2014, and 25% of the present day melting rate before 2002. We then simulate and fit the bedrock displacement – both vertical and horizontal - with a spherical compressible viscoelastic Earth model having a low viscosity shallow upper mantle. We show that we can constrain the shallow upper mantle viscosity very well and also explain most of the signal (amplitude and direction) by using 2 x10^18 Pa s. However we are not able to precisely constrain the thickness of the lithosphere (the preferred thickness is more than 50 km, quite thick for that region) or ice history. By using our preferred set up (earth model + ice history) we compute the GIA gravitational signature and convert it in equivalent superficial water density (see figure) that can be directly used to correct the mass changes observed by GRACE.\nFor the Amundsen sector the apparent trend of mass changes caused by the GIA fast mantle flow is more than 15 Gt/yr, which is 11.5% of to the -130 Gt/yr altimetry derived trend. Therefore, previous GRACE derived mass changes in Amundsen sector have been systematically underestimated.",

            "abstract": "California and The Central Valley are experiencing one of that region’s worst, persistent droughts, which represents the continuation of a prolonged drought that started in the early 2000’s. Due to the continued drought, many agricultural regions in The Central Valley have been experiencing water shortages, negatively impacting agricultural production and the socio-economics of the region. Due to these impacts, there has been an increased incentive to find new ways to conserve water for use in irrigation. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques provide the ability for end users to better understand field conditions so they may make more informed decisions on irrigation timing and amounts. However, a good understanding of soil moisture and its role in crop health and yield is lacking to support informed water management decisions. Though known to be important, a robust understanding of the role of the spatio-temporal patterns in soil moisture linked to crop health is lacking. Remote sensing platforms such as NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) provide the capacity to obtain within-field measurements to estimate within-field and field-to-field variability in soil moisture. UAVSAR radar images acquired from 2010 to 2014 for Yolo County, California are being examined to determine the suitability of high resolution (field scale) multi-temporal L-band radar backscatter imagery for soil moisture assessment and crop conditions through the growing season. By using such data and linking to in-situ meteorology measurements, modeling (MIMICS), and other remote sensing derived datasets (Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, and TOPS-SIMS), an integrated monitoring system can potentially support the assessment of agricultural field conditions. This allows growers to optimize the use of limited water supplies through informed water management practices, potentially improving crop conditions and yield in a water stressed region.",

            "abstract": "Boreal terrestrial ecosystems act as a huge reservoir of organic carbon, most of which is mainly stored in both active-layer soils and permafrost. Recently, many observational studies have revealed that ongoing climate warming has promoted changes in fire regime, which stimulates the permafrost thaw in the boreal area. Consequently, the decomposition rate of the organic and mineral soils will increase and a large amount of CO2 will be released into the atmosphere. The sustained CO2­ release from the soils may create a positive feedback in relation to carbon cycling between the atmosphere and boreal terrestrial ecosystems. However, there still remains substantial uncertainty for evaluating the mechanisms of the carbon cycle feedbacks over centuries. In the present study, we examined the effect of warming and fire episodes on soil carbon dynamics in an upland black spruce ecosystem in interior Alaska, by using a Physical and Biogeochemical Soil Dynamics Model (PB-SDM) which can simulate the feedback cycle of soil organic carbon accumulation with soil thermal and hydrological dynamics. The result indicates that soil carbon accumulation in the organic layer was strongly dominated by increased temperature. In addition, fire events by which a great number of soil layers burned contributed to decrease in soil carbon accumulation largely in the organic layer. On the other hand, remarkably increased temperature conditions (around 9.6℃ by 3000) controlled soil carbon accumulation in the mineral layer and changes in soil decomposition rate accompanying with the shift from frozen to thawed conditions with warming accelerated soil carbon decomposition. It is suggested that future climate warming would result in drastic decrease in the soil carbon stock, largely from the organic layer, whereas the vulnerability of deeper soil carbon to future warming is closely connected to permafrost degradation due to wildfire disturbance.",

            "abstract": "As shown by climate models, increasing global temperatures and enhanced greenhouse gas concentration such as CO2 have had major effects on the dynamics of the hydrologic cycle and the surface energy budget, in particular, on evapotranspiration (ET). ET has significant decadal variations whether it be regionally or globally and variations of ET have major environmental and socioeconomic impacts. A number of recent studies have found a global increase in annual mean ET around 7mm per year per decade from about 1982 to the late 1990s. These results correspond with what is expected from an intensification of the hydrological cycle. However, the increasing ET trend did not continue after 1998 and from 1998-2008 this global trend was replaced with a decreasing trend of similar magnitude. This study uses numerical modeling to investigate if similar changing ET trends emerge in the continental U.S and part of northern Mexico. After validating model simulated evaporative fluxes and comparing spatial patterns to the aforementioned studies, various changing trends of different signs are identified across the U.S., and specific regions with strong signals of change are chosen for further examination with the purpose of identifying the root causes of these changing trends and which variables are most influential towards change. Experimental simulations conducted to isolate the most influential factors towards ET reveal that precipitation amount as well as its characteristics have the greatest impact on the ET trends discovered, with other factors like wind and air temperatures displaying less influence over inter-annual trends. This study helps better understand terrestrial ET and it’s interactions which will help facilitate better predictions of change in surface climate such as heatwaves and droughts as well as impacts on water resources.",

Such data allows scientists to investigate fundamental hydrological and geochemical processes relevant to agriculture, water resources and climate change. For scientists to easily share, model and interpret such data requires novel tools with capabilities for interactive data visualization.\nUnder sponsorship of the US Department of Energy, Subsurface Insights is developing the Predictive Assimilative Framework (PAF): a cloud based subsurface monitoring platform which can manage, process and visualize large heterogeneous datasets. Over the last year we transitioned our visualization method from a server side approach (in which images and animations were generated using Jfreechart and Visit) to a client side one that utilizes the D3 Javascript library.\nDatasets are retrieved using web service calls to the server, returned as JSON objects and visualized within the browser. Users can interactively explore primary and secondary datasets from various field locations. Our current capabilities include interactive data contouring and heterogeneous time series data visualization. While this approach is very powerful and not necessarily unique, special attention needs to be paid to latency and responsiveness issues as well as to issues as cross browser code compatibility so that users have an identical, fluid and frustration-free experience across different computational platforms.

In the study presented here the fractal dimension of the rivers Kosi, Gandak and Baghmati are analyzed to understand the scaling attributes of their respective morphometric features.\nKosi is a major tributary of the Ganga system and is notorious for its vulnerability to frequent avulsions that inevitably lead to its shifting course. These destructive episodes have also earned the river its sobriquet of ‘Sorrow of Bihar’. Gandak and Baghmati are two sister river systems that, like Kosi, also rise in Nepal Himalayas and flow into the North Bihar Plains of India. While Gandak outfalls directly into river Ganga near Hajipur, Baghmati is a tributary river of Kosi and joins the latter near Khormaghat. It is indeed noteworthy that heavy silt laden discharges are a distinctive feature of all these rivers but the latter two (i.e. Baghmati and Gandak) do not show any definite proclivity to morphological avulsion and accompanying course instability. The seemingly distinctive morphological dynamics of Kosi is clearly seen to be at odds with the morphological regime of Baghmati and Gandak.\nLANDSAT 8 imageries (USGS) are used to estimate the fractal dimensions of the three rivers using the box counting technique. The analysis of the fractal study done here shows multifractal behavior in all the three rivers. However, the fractal dimensions of Kosi River are found to be in contrast with its sister rivers which elucidate the curious behavior of the River.",

            "abstract": "The current spatial resolution in regional climate models (RCMs), typically around 5 to 20 km, remains too coarse to accurately reproduce the spatial variability in surface mass balance (SMB) components over the narrow ablation zones, marginal outlet glaciers and neighbouring ice caps of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). In these topographically rough terrains, the SMB components are highly dependent on local variations in topography. However, the relatively low-resolution elevation and ice mask prescribed in RCMs contribute to significantly underestimate melt and runoff in these regions due to unresolved valley glaciers and fjords. Therefore, near-km resolution topography is essential to better capture SMB variability in these spatially restricted regions.\nWe present a 1 km resolution dataset of daily GrIS SMB covering the period 1958-2014, which is statistically downscaled from data of the polar regional climate model RACMO2.3 at 11 km, using an elevation dependence. The dataset includes all individual SMB components projected on the elevation and ice mask from the GIMP DEM, down-sampled to 1 km. Daily runoff and sublimation are interpolated to the 1 km topography using a local regression to elevation valid for each day specifically; daily precipitation is bi-linearly downscaled without elevation corrections. The daily SMB dataset is then reconstructed by summing downscaled precipitation, sublimation and runoff.\nHigh-resolution elevation and ice mask allow for properly resolving the narrow ablation zones and valley glaciers at the GrIS margins, leading to significant increase in runoff estimate. In these regions, and especially over narrow glaciers tongues, the downscaled products improve on the original RACMO2.3 outputs by better representing local SMB patterns through a gradual ablation increase towards the GrIS margins. We discuss the impact of downscaling on the SMB components in a case study for a spatially restricted region, where large elevation discrepancies are observed between both resolutions. Owing to generally enhanced runoff in the GrIS ablation zone, the evaluation of daily downscaled SMB against ablation measurements, collected at in-situ measuring sites derived from a newly compiled ablation dataset, shows a better agreement with observations relative to native RACMO2.3 SMB at 11 km.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the drivers behind the urban heat island (UHI) effect – the phenomenon of elevated temperatures in urban areas – is an important goal in urban climatology, particularly in the context of an increasingly urbanized and warming planet. Remote sensing offers a useful source of information for UHI studies by providing spatially explicit measures of both temperature and surface properties over time. However, key questions remain, particularly regarding what controls spatio-temporal dynamics in the UHI in and around cities. The objective of this study is to characterize seasonality in the daytime and nighttime UHI over Boston for the period 2001-2010, paying special attention to the roles of (1) green leaf phenology and (2) urban land use and shading in urban canyons as explanatory variables. We use 1 km 8-day land surface temperature (LST) data from MODIS to characterize temperature variability. Initial results are consistent with previously described UHI characteristics, with the highest daytime urban-rural temperature difference occurring during the summer. However, seasonal hysteresis for Boston is apparent in an enhanced UHI signature in the spring versus the fall, even when rural temperatures are equivalent during the two time periods. To characterize how surface cover variations control surface temperatures over the course of the year, we use spectral mixture analysis (SMA) applied to 30 m multi-temporal Landsat data. SMA is particularly well suited for studies of spatially heterogeneous urban areas because unlike classification methods or traditional vegetation indices, SMA takes explicit advantage of sub-pixel compositional variability. Preliminary results for 2010 suggest that spatio-temporal patterns in surface properties, and by extension land surface temperatures, in and around Boston are well explained as combinations of (a) green vegetation, (b) substrate/soil, (c) urban impervious, and (d) shade derived from SMA of multi-temporal Landsat data.",

The seashore was established to preserve cultural and natural resources of national significance, yet these islands have shoreline rates of change that are predominately erosional, frequently experience storm surge inundation driven by tropical and extra-tropical storm events, and are highly vulnerable to sea level rise. The National Park Service staff are concerned about the vulnerability of historic structures located within the park, and recognized the utility of a coastal hazard risk assessment to assist park managers with long-term planning. They formed a cooperative agreement with researchers at East Carolina University to conduct the assessment, which primarily used GIS to evaluate the susceptibility of 27 historical structures to coastal erosion, storm surge, and sea-level rise. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to calculate a linear regression rate of shoreline movement based on historical shorelines. Those rates were used to simulate the future position of the shoreline along transects. The SLOSH model output was down scaled to a DEM generated from the 2014 NC QL2 LiDAR collection to determine the extent and depth of inundation that would occur from storm events. Sea level rise was modeled for various scenarios referenced to existing MHHW, and also added to each SLOSH model output to determine the effect of a storm event under those sea level rise scenarios. Risk maps were developed to include not only areal coverage for existing structures and districts, but also identify potential areas of relocation or retreat in the long-term. In addition to evaluating vulnerability, timelines for potential impacts provided scenarios for National Park Service staff to research adaption and mitigation strategies.",

In this presentation, we will review the research that is being planned for ABoVE that involves the use of remotely-sensed data, including the development of information products required by end users to assess the societal impacts of environmental change. These plans included taking advantage of recent advances in mapping of key surface and atmospheric characteristics using both airborne and spaceborne remote sensing data.

            "abstract": "Reservoir water levels are usually not allowed to exceed the flood limited water level (FLWL) during flood season, which neglects the meteorological and real-time forecast information and leads to the great waste of water resources. With the development of weather forecasting, hydrologic modeling, and hydro-climatic teleconnection, the streamflow forecast precision have improved a lot, which provides the technical support for the flood water utilization. This paper addresses how much flood water can be conserved for use after the flood season through the operation of reservoir based on uncertain forecast information by taking into account the residual flood control capacity (the difference between flood conveyance capacity and the expected inflow in a lead time). A two-stage model for dynamic control of the flood limited water level (the maximum allowed water level during the flood season, DC-FLWL) is established considering forecast uncertainty and acceptable flood risk. It is found that DC-FLWL is applicable when the reservoir inflow ranges from small to medium levels of the historical records, while both forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk in the downstream affect the feasible space of DC-FLWL. As forecast uncertainty increases (under a given risk level) or as acceptable risk level decreases (under a given forecast uncertainty level), the minimum required safety margin for flood control increases, and the chance for DC-FLWL decreases. The derived hedging rules from the modeling framework illustrate either the dominant role of water conservation or flood control or the tradeoff between the two objectives under different levels of forecast uncertainty and acceptable risk. These rules may provide useful guidelines for conserving water from flood, especially in the area with heavy water stress.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami wave predictions of the current tsunami warning systems rely on accurate earthquake source inversions of wave height data. They are of limited effectiveness for the near-field areas since the tsunami waves arrive before data are collected. Recent seismic and tsunami disasters have revealed the need for early warning to protect near-source coastal populations. In this work we developed the basis for a tsunami warning system based on rapid earthquake source characterisation through regional seismic array back-projections. We explored rapid earthquake source imaging using onshore dense seismic arrays located at regional distances on the order of 1000 km, which provides faster source images than conventional teleseismic back-projections. We implement this method in a simulated real-time environment, and analysed the 2011 Tohoku earthquake rupture with two clusters of Hi-net stations in Kyushu and Northern Hokkaido, and the 2014 Iquique event with the Earthscope USArray Transportable Array. The results yield reasonable estimates of rupture area, which is approximated by an ellipse and leads to the construction of simple slip models based on empirical scaling of the rupture area, seismic moment and average slip. The slip model is then used as the input of the tsunami simulation package COMCOT to predict the tsunami waves. In the example of the Tohoku event, the earthquake source model can be acquired within 6 minutes from the start of rupture and the simulation of tsunami waves takes less than 2 min, which could facilitate a timely tsunami warning. The predicted arrival time and wave amplitude reasonably fit observations. Based on this method, we propose to develop an automatic warning mechanism that provides rapid near-field warning for areas of high tsunami risk. The initial focus will be Japan, Pacific Northwest and Alaska, where dense seismic networks with the capability of real-time data telemetry and open data accessibility, such as the Japanese HiNet (>800 instruments) and the Earthscope USArray Transportable Array (~400 instruments), are established.",

For example, Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) at National Centers for Environmental Prediction has hindcasts starting 1981 and includes an ensemble of four 9-month forecast every 5th day. Hindcast datasets are generally used for (a) bias correction and calibration of real-time forecasts, and (b) assessment of prediction skill. Hindcasts also provide a large sample of seasonal means that can be used for analysis of climate variability – CFSv2 hindcasts have a sample of ~ 5000 for each season. As an example of the utility of the hindcast dataset, this large sample data set is analyzed to document seasonal mean precipitation variability over California, and how it depends on the sea surface temperature (SST) variability in tropical Pacific. An overarching conclusion of the analysis is a wide range of seasonal mean precipitation outcomes that can occur under similar SSTs. Possible implications for precipitation variability (for a fix forcing) on decision making are also discussed.",

However, computation methods of dynamic roughness coefficients are few concerned in current research; few studies have come up with a spatial-temporal distribution of roughness coefficients in basin. A formula to calculate the n value was established based on the statistical analysis of observations in this study. And then we improved the routing model of a distributed hydrological model using the new formula of n. Roughness coefficient is not constant but changes dynamically with the changing of water depth and vegetation in improved hydrological model. The improved model was applied in the Yellow River basin. The results show the dynamic roughness coefficients can improve the streamflow simulation of hydrological model and especially has a big influence in the routing model on the slope. The dynamic spatial-temporal distribution of manning's roughness coefficients can be afforded as the model output in basin. It is possible to apply this method to afford a spatial-temporal profile of roughness coefficients to support the global routing in land surface model.",

            "abstract": "The accumulation of surface meltwater on ice shelves can lead to the formation of melt lakes. These structures have been implicated in crevasse propagation and ice-shelf collapse; the Larsen B ice shelf was observed to have a large amount of melt lakes present on its surface just before its collapse in 2002. Through modelling the transport of heat through the surface of the Larsen C ice shelf, where melt lakes have also been observed, this work aims to provide new insights into the ways in which melt lakes are forming and the effect that meltwater filling crevasses on the ice shelf will have. This will enable an assessment of the role of meltwater in triggering ice-shelf collapse. The Antarctic Peninsula, where Larsen C is situated, has warmed several times the global average over the last century and this ice shelf has been suggested as a candidate for becoming fully saturated with meltwater by the end of the current century. Here we present results of a 1-D mathematical model of heat transfer through an idealized ice shelf. When forced with automatic weather station data from Larsen C, surface melting and the subsequent meltwater accumulation, melt lake development and refreezing are demonstrated through the modelled results. Furthermore, the effect of lateral meltwater transport upon melt lakes and the effect of the lakes upon the surface energy balance are examined. Investigating the role of meltwater in ice-shelf stability is key as collapse can affect ocean circulation and temperature, and cause a loss of habitat. Additionally, it can cause a loss of the buttressing effect that ice shelves can have on their tributary glaciers, thus allowing the glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "The Kaguya satellite and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have observed a number of vertical holes on the terrestrial Moon [Haruyama et al., GRL, 2009; Robinson et al., PSS, 2012], which have spatial scales of tens of meters and are possible lava tube skylights. The hole structure has recently received particular attention, because the structure gives an important clue to the complex volcanic history of the Moon. The holes also have high potential as locations for constructing future lunar bases, because of fewer extra-lunar rays/particles and micrometeorites reaching the hole bottoms. In this sense, these holes are not only interesting in selenology, but are also significant from the viewpoint of electrostatic environments. The subject can also be an interesting resource of research in comparative planetary science, because hole structures have been found in other solar system bodies such as the Mars.\nThe lunar dayside electrostatic environment is governed by electrodynamic interactions among the solar wind plasma, photoelectrons, and the charged lunar surface, providing topologically complex boundaries to the plasma. We use the three-dimensional, massively-parallelized, particle-in-cell simulation code EMSES [Miyake and Usui, POP, 2009] to simulate the near-hole plasma environment on the Moon [Miyake and Nishino, Icarus, 2015]. We took into account the solar wind plasma downflow, photoelectron emission from the sunlit part of the lunar surface, and plasma charge deposition on the surface. The simulation domain consists of 400×400×2000 grid points and contains about 25 billion plasma macro-particles. Thus, we need to use supercomputers for the simulations.\nThe vertical wall of the hole introduces a new boundary for both photo and solar wind electrons. The current balance condition established at a hole bottom is altered by the limited solar wind electron penetration into the hole and complex photoelectron current paths inside the hole. The self-consistent modeling not only reproduces intense differential charging between sunlit and shadowed surfaces, but also reveals the potential difference between sunlit surfaces inside and outside the hole. The results demonstrate the uniqueness of the near-hole plasma environment as well as provide useful knowledge for future landing missions.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosol particles play a vital role in the Earth's radiative energy budget. They exert a net cooling influence on climate by directly reflecting the solar radiation to space and by modifying the shortwave reflective properties of clouds. Radiation is the main source that regulates the surface energy budget. Surface temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height depends on accurate calculation of both shortwave and longwave radiation. The weakening of the ambient winds is known to influence the structure of PBL. This study examines the sensitivity of the performance of Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) ARW Model to the use of different radiation schemes [For Long wave Radiation: Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM), Eta Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), Goddard, New Goddard, NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0), New Goddard scheme, Fu-Liou-Gu scheme and for Short wave Radiation: Dudhia scheme, Eta Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0), New Goddard scheme]. Two different simulations are conducted one for the summer (14-15 May 2009) and winter (14-15 Dec 2008) season characterized by strong and weak wind conditions over India. Comparison of surface temperatures from different schemes for different cities (New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jaipur and Jodhpur) on 14-15 May 2009 and 14-15 Dec 2008 with those observed shows the simulation with RRTM , New Goddard, and Fu-Liou-Gu schemes are closer to the observations as compared to other schemes. The temperature simulated from all the radiation schemes have more than 0.9 correlation coefficient but the root mean square error is relatively less in summer compared to winter season. It is surmised that Fu-Liou-Gu scheme performs better in almost all the cases. The reason behind can be the greater absorption of solar and IR radiative fluxes in the atmosphere and the surface provided in Fu‐Liou‐Gu radiation scheme than those computed in other radiation schemes in WRF model.",

            "abstract": "Cobble bedforms, c. 1m high with lengths of several metres and transverse to the reversing tidal currents, are exposed at extreme low-water Spring tides on an inter-tidal bedrock shelf in the macro-tidal Severn Estuary, UK. Near-bed flow velocities during Spring tides can exceed 1.5m/s, with water depths varying from zero to in excess of 10m. During neap tides the bedforms are not exposed, and sediment is expected to be of limited mobility. When exposed, the bedform geometry tends to be asymmetric; orientated down estuary with the ebb current. During Spring tides, vigorous bedload transport of gravel (including large cobbles) occurs during both flood and ebb over the crests and yet, despite this temporal dynamism, the bedforms remain spatially static over long time periods or show weak down-estuary migration. Stasis implies that the tidal bedload transport vectors are essentially in balance. Near-bed shear stress and bed roughness values vary systematically with the Spring-tide current speeds and the predicted grain-size of the bed load using the Shields criterion is in accord with observed coarser grain-sizes in transport. These hydrodynamic data, delimited by estimates of the threshold of motion, and integrated over either flood or ebb tides are being used to explain the apparent stability of the bedforms. The bulk hydraulic data are supplemented by particle tracer studies and laser-scanning of bed configurations between tides. The high-energy environment results in two forms of armouring. Pronounced steep imbrication of platy-cobbles visible on the exposed up-estuary side of dunes is probably disrupted during flood tides leading to rapid reworking of the toe deposits facing up-estuary. In contrast, some crest and leeside locations have been stable for prolonged periods such that closely-fitted fabrics result; these portions of the bedforms are static and effectively are ‘armour-plated’. Ebb-tide deposits of finer, ephemeral sandy-units occur on the down estuary side of the bedforms. Sandy-units (although not observed at low tide) presumably also are deposited on the up estuary side during flooding tides but these deposits are destroyed by ebb flows. The implication of these sediment transport processes on the stratification of the bedforms is considered.",

Aircraft observations and ozonesonde profiles collected during the Maryland DISCOVER-AQ field campaign indicate the presence of stratospheric air just above the boundary layer on several days raising the question of whether or not such stratospheric intrusions (SI)s have a similar influence in the eastern U.S. and to what degree they influence policy-relevant background ozone levels. Better understanding the processes controlling the variability of tropospheric ozone is critical for both air quality and climate applications. High-resolution (50 km or greater) global atmospheric models and reanalyses have been demonstrated in several studies to realistically reproduce the observed vertical structure and temporal evolution of a limited number of SI events, but more research is needed to evaluate their ability to simulate the seasonal, spatial, and interannual variability of SIs. In this study, we used simple, computationally-efficient stratospheric tracers implemented in the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) model, along with aircraft data and ozonesonde profiles to determine the frequency and extent of SIs over the United States during the observing period of NASA's Aura satellite (2004-2014). High-resolution simulations of stratospheric tracers are compared with ozone fields from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2), which includes assimilation of observed ozone from MLS and OMI to constrain upper troposphere/lower stratosphere mixing ratios, to assess the representation of SIs in the lower troposphere. We will discuss 1) the implications for using reanalyses to assess interannual variability of SIs and 2) the potential of operational forecasting of SIs using simple tracers in conjunction with ozone assimilation.",

Electron acceleration can arise from fundamentally different processes than those affecting ions due to differences in their gyroradii.

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is known to be the most important process for plasma transport and energy conversion in space plasma. MESSENGER observations taken at Mercury have shown that magnetic reconnection is the dominant driver of magnetospheric dynamics and that it is significantly more intense than at Earth. Hence, Mercury provides a perfect natural laboratory to study the structure and reconnection at Mercury’s magnetotail as signatures of magnetic reconnections are expected to be more intense and prominent as compared to Earth and the outer planets. Using 4 years of MESSENGER’s magnetic field and plasma data, we analyzed 356 plasma sheet crossings. We determined that the B-field magnitude in the magnetotail lobe and plasma sheet follows a power law relation as a function of downstream distance |XMSM|. Statistical studies on the direction of Bz in the plasma sheet suggest that reconnection X-lines are most likely to occur at distance |XMSM| < 2.5RM. Assuming simple pressure balance, we have estimated the plasma beta β in the plasma sheet as a function of |XMSM|. Our results indicate that the beta is higher in the region where X-lines are usually found. Finally, we compared our results at Mercury with previous studies on the terrestrial magnetotail. Our results are consistent with the canonical idea that Mercury’s magnetotail is structurally similar to Earth’s but with shorter timescale due to more intense reconnection at Mercury.",

On the Paraná side, these rocks are basalt tholeiitic with high (>2%) and low TiO2 content, and dacites, rhyodacites, rhyolites and quartz latites forming the acid types Chapecó and Palmas. The volcanic acid Palmas are found in the South part of Brazil, and based on TiO2 and P2O5 contents are subdivided into Caxias do Sul, Santa Maria, Anita Garibaldi, Jacuí, Clevelândia and Barros Cassal units. In the studied region, the first stratigraphic sequence is low TiO2 basalt followed by Caxias do Sul, Barros Cassal and Santa Maria on top. We sampled all these units in the Gramado Xavier (Rio Grande do Sul State, South Brazil) region. To determine the mean magnetization directions of each site, samples were demagnetized by both thermal and AF techniques. The results show that the basalt flows recorded both normal and reverse polarities of the geomagnetic field. All sites from Caxias do Sul registered an anomalous direction suggesting an excursion of the geomagnetic field. Sites from Barros Cassal present both normal and reverse polarities. All sites from Santa Maria unit show a reverse polarity of the geomagnetic field. The normal and reverse polarities recorded in the different units are similar indicating contemporaneity of the magmatic source. Due to the existence of only one reversal event, a short duration of volcanism is suspected.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation of microwave brightness temperature (TB) observations (i.e., radiance assimilation (RA)) has been proven to improve snowpack characterization at relatively small scales. However, large-scale applications of RA require a considerable amount of further efforts. Our objective in this study is to explore global-scale snow RA. In a RA scheme, a radiative transfer model (RTM) is an observational operator predicting TB; therefore, the quality of the assimilation results may strongly depend upon the RTM used as well as the land surface model (LSM). Several existing RTMs show different sensitivities to snowpack properties and thus they simulate significantly different TB. At the global scale, snow physical properties vary widely with local climate conditions. No single RTM has been shown to be able to accurately reproduce the observed TB for such a wide range of snow conditions. In this study, therefore, we hypothesize that snow estimates using a microwave RA scheme can be improved through the use of multiple RTMs (i.e., multi-RTM-based approaches). As a first step, here we use two snowpack RTMs, i.e., the Dense Media Radiative Transfer–Multi Layers model (DMRT-ML) and the Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS). The Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) is used to simulate snow dynamics. The assimilation process is conducted by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), which is a community facility developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for ensemble-based data assimilation studies. In the RA experiments, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) TB at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz vertical polarization channels are assimilated into the RA system using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. The results are evaluated using the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) daily snow depth, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover fraction, and in-situ snowpack and river discharge observations.",

            "abstract": "In recent satellite missions, spaceborne radar observations, sometimes in combination with passive microwave radiometer measurements, are being used to estimate vertical profiles of precipitation rates. Launched in 2014, the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission core satellite observatory features a dual-frequency radar operating at 13.6 and 35.5 GHz (Ku and Ka bands) and a microwave radiometer with thirteen channels from 10 - 183 GHz. The use of combined radar and radiometer observations should yield the most accurate estimates of precipitation profiles from space, and these estimates will ultimately serve as a crucial reference for cross-calibrating passive microwave precipitation estimates from the GPM radiometer constellation. And through the microwave radiometer estimates, the combined algorithm calibration will ultimately be propagated to GPM infrared-microwave multisatellite estimates of surface rainfall.\nThe GPM combined precipitation estimation algorithm performs initial estimates (an “ensemble”) of precipitation profiles based upon an observed Ku-band reflectivity profile and different a priori assumptions concerning the size distributions of the precipitation particles and the profiles of cloud water and water vapor in the atmospheric column. The initial ensemble of profiles is then updated using a filter that embodies the physics relating precipitation to the observed Ka reflectivity profile, Ku and Ka path-integrated attenuation (derived from radar surface backscatter measurements), and microwave radiances. The final, filtered ensemble of profiles is consistent with all the available radar-radiometer data and a priori information.\nSince the GPM launch, the combined radar-radiometer algorithm has been improved to more specifically account for the effects of radar non-uniform beamfilling, multiple-scattering of radar pulses, the different resolutions of the radar and radiometer observations, interrelated radar and passive microwave surface properties, and precipitation particle single-scattering properties. These and other changes lead to estimates of surface rainfall rates that compare favorably with ground-based, raingauge-calibrated radar estimates of rain rates. Algorithm improvements and validation will be discussed at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The cap carbonate in Doushantuo Formation (ca. 635 Ma) has been extensively studied for Earth systems change following the Marinoan ‘snowball Earth’ glaciation. An important feature of this cap carbonate is the local occurrence of extremely negative δ13Ccarb values (down to –50‰) from dark-colored calcite cements. These calcites have been interpreted as carbonate cements precipitated from cold methane seeps or as hydrothermally induced diagenetic carbonates. To test these contrasting interpretations, we mechanically separated the calcite cements from host dolostones and analyzed stable isotope compositions of pyrite, carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), and organic carbon in both components of the Doushantuo cap carbonate in the Yangtze Gorges area, South China. The data show that δ34Spyrtie of extremely 13C-depleted calcite (22.8–73.9‰) are up to 34‰ higher than those of the dolomite (14.7–39.9‰). Similarly, δ34SCAS of calcite (37.1–80.1‰) are up to 40‰ higher than those of the dolomite (24.5–41.5‰). The δ18OCAS of calcite (12.9–22.2‰; VSMOW) are also systematically higher than those of dolomite (13.3–16.8‰; VSMOW). In contrast, δ13Corg of calcite cements (-27.2 ‰ to -46.1‰) are lower than those of the dolostones (-26.5‰ to -31.7‰). In addition, there is a strong positive correlation between δ34SCAS and δ18OCAS and a negative correlation between δ13Corg and δ34Spyrtie of the calcite (Figure 1). The data demonstrated convincingly that the 13C-depleted calcites were formed in a environment facilitated by sulfate-driven anaeorobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The co-occurrence of unusually low δ13Corg and high δ34S values requires presence of active flow of both methane and sulfate, a condition not far away from conducive seawater sulfate supply.\nFigure 1: Cross plots of δ34SCAS vs. δ18OCAS and δ13Corg vs δ34Spyrtie in host dolomite and in the extremely 13C-depleted calcite cements.",

            "abstract": "To understand the current state of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations, policy makers refer to national inventories and reporting programs, and therefore, it is imperative that these reports are accurate and representative. Many studies exist that investigate the reliability of current monitoring methods, however, to our knowledge the temporal variability of the magnitude and source of methane (CH4) emissions from oil and gas facilities has not been reported in the literature. We present results from a field campaign conducted in June 2014 in the Eagle Ford basin, Texas to assess the temporal variability of emissions from a variety of facilities using data obtained through four different methods. The variability of total CH4 emission rate from individual facilities was investigated by repeated measurement of emissions from five gathering facilities using two aircraft-based mass balance approaches. Basin-wide emissions variation was examined by conducting a series of eight four hour afternoon aerial surveys of two 35 x 35 km areas, with transects oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. The emission source-type and magnitude were further investigated using helicopter-based FLIR camera observations conducted repeatedly at eight oil wells, one gas well, and four gathering facilities. Results indicate a high degree of variability in day-to-day and sometimes hour-to-hour CH4 emissions magnitude. FLIR camera observations suggest that the component-level source of facility emissions is also highly variable over time, with both storage tank vent stacks and tank hatches representing important components of the observed day-to-day variability. While some emissions were due to scheduled maintenance, others appeared to occur due to faulty and/or aging equipment. Here we discuss what was learned in terms of factors that explain the observed emission rate variability.",

            "abstract": "Bedload monitoring based on seismological observations has recently emerged as a viable non-invasive measurement technique. However, its applications have only been shown for sediment transport in steep mountain rivers. We evaluated for the first time the potential of seismology for bedload transport monitoring in a rural gravel bed stream (Koulbich river in Luxembourg), characterized by low gradient (around 0.6%), small flowrate (<2.3 m3/s) and D50 transported (around 5 mm on average).\nThe dominant anthropogenic noise in the area of investigation greatly complexified the seismic analysis but was successfully eliminated in order to extract the river’s imprint on the ambient seismic field. Additional in-situ hydroacoustic measurements of bedload motion (co-located impact-plate device) and 3D hydro-morphodynamic modeling were performed to help interpreting this river’s seismic signature likely dominated by water turbulences. From previous laboratory flume experiments, a calibration model was obtained between the amplitude/spectral attributes of impact measurements and the grain size of transported material, leading to an unprecedented estimation of bedload median grain size (D50) at high temporal resolution (minutes ranges) using impact-plate system. For the studied natural flood event, both simulated and estimated D50 from impact-plate measurements exhibit near-simultaneous increases, a similar temporal evolution and the same order of magnitude. The joint analysis of seismic data with hydroacoustic records and sediment transport simulation showed that the seismic records in close proximity of the stream contain evidence of bedload transport, especially in form of hysteresis behavior. These results underline the potential of non-invasive seismic measurements to estimate the triggering of bedload transport for a broader range of river systems and grain sizes than previously investigated. This study also confirms the potential of impact-plate device as robust quantitative bedload monitoring technique.",

This study aims at exploring and understanding the physical controls on spatial patterns of pan-European flow signatures. This understanding will ultimately enhance our ability to predict hydrological variables in ungauged catchments.\nIn this study, similarities in signatures are explored and compared to similarities in catchment characteristics to distinguish coherence in spatial patterns. In total, some 50 characteristics variables (physical, human alteration and climate) have been computed for more than 1500 stream gauges across Europe. For the same gauges, 15 selected signatures have been calculated for different time-periods (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years) of continuous daily flow measurements. Relationships between characteristics and signatures are subsequently explored through correlation analyses to find the best explanatory variables for each signature and to build regression models for predictions in ungauged basins. Significant relationships are observed between some signatures and predictors like land-use area percentages (agriculture, open areas), topography and climatic indices.\nTwo types of classification (based on catchment characteristics or flow signatures) are applied and the obtained patterns are compared. Regression models are built for each class and compared to the general models built without classification. Attention is drawn to human alteration when looking at outliers or differences between modeled and observed patterns. Finally, the regression models are applied for 35 000 watersheds, mostly ungauged, across Europe (on average 250 km2) to create a map of flow regimes across the European continent. Dominant flow generating processes are analyzed for each class to understand the spatial pattern.",

However, there has been rather limited experimental evidence demonstrating these losses are taking place. In particular, there has been significant uncertainty regarding the minimum electron energy likely to be affected, and thus the significance of EMIC-losses to the dynamics of the outer radiation belt. We combine observations from multiple space and ground-based experiments to demonstrate EMIC waves are causing precipitation of relativistic electrons. We use POES MEPED data and the AARDDVARK subionospheric network to characterise the electron precipitation. EMIC wave activity is confirmed by the search coil magnetometer in Halley, Antarctica. We also use case studies from the Van Allen Probes to identify the impact of EMIC waves on the evolution of the trapped fluxes. Our study specifically examines the minimum energy of the electron precipitation in these events. These are considerably lower than the relativistic or ultra relativistic levels often predicted by theory, with values commonly as small as a few hundred keV.",

            "abstract": "We report on recent effort and progress at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in developing consistent SO2 and HCHO retrieval products from Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP)/Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) nadir mapper. Given the substantial differences between OMI and OMPS in several key aspects, such as spatial and spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, a major challenge in ensuring data continuity between the two instruments is to properly account for different instrument characteristics as well as instruments’ degradation over time. To this end, we have developed an innovative approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) of measured Earthshine radiances. We utilize a PCA technique to extract a series of spectral features (principal components or PCs) explaining the variance of measured reflectance spectra, associated with both physical processes (e.g., ozone absorption, rotational Raman scattering) and measurement details (e.g., wavelength shift). By fitting these PCs along with pre-computed Jacobians for our target species (SO2 or HCHO) to the measured radiance spectra, we can estimate the atmospheric loading of SO2 or HCHO while minimizing the impacts of interfering processes and measurement imperfection on retrievals. Since no explicit instrument-specific radiance data correction scheme is required, the PCA method is easily implemented with both OMI and OMPS and maximizes data continuity. The PCA algorithm currently runs operationally in the production of the new generation NASA standard OMI planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO2 data that have been shown to improve the detection limit of anthropogenic SO2 emission sources by a factor of two, as compared with the previous generation product. In this presentation, we will demonstrate that the PCA algorithm can produce SO2 and HCHO retrievals from OMPS that have comparable data quality with our OMI retrievals. We will also demonstrate the advantage of the PCA approach in mitigating the adverse effects of instrument degradation, and discuss its other features that make it a promising technique for extending the global SO2 and HCHO datasets from EOS/Aura to S-NPP and follow-up JPSS satellites.",

            "abstract": "From recent ground- and satellite-based observations as well as from model results, it is well known that lunar tide signatures are amplified significantly during northern hemisphere sudden stratospheric warming events (SSWs). Such signatures have been observed in the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere and mesosphere, and at the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) at the northern mid and high latitude mesosphere. More recently, ionospheric signatures at mid-latitudes have been also observed in satellite instruments and such observations are corroborated with model results when the lunar tides are included. From these results (N. Pedatella, personal communication), there is a strong hemispheric asymmetry, where ionospheric perturbations occur primarily in the southern hemisphere. Motivated by these results, in this work we compare the tidal signatures in the MLT region at mid and high latitudes in both hemispheres. We make use of MLT winds obtained with specular meteor radars (SMR) at Juliusruh (54oN), Andøya (69oN), Rio Grande (54oS), and Davis (69oS) around the 2009 and 2013 major SSWs. In addition we complement our studies, with model results from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Extended version (WACCM-X) combined with the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) and the inclusions of lunar tides. Besides these results, we present a brief description and preliminary results of our new approach to derive wind fields in the MLT region using multi-static, multi-frequency specular meteor radars, called MMARIA.",

            "abstract": "Surface waters play an important role in the global carbon balance. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are a major transfer of terrestrial carbon to river systems, and the net removal of terrestrial DOC in aquatic systems is poorly constrained. We used a combination of spatially distributed sampling of three DOC fractions, nitrate, and chloride in streams of different size throughout a river network and modeling to quantify the net removal of terrestrial DOC relative to other constituents during a summer base flow period. The approach was applied to the 400 km2 Ipswich River watershed, MA, USA. We found that aquatic reactivity of terrestrial DOC leading to net loss is low, closer to conservative chloride than to reactive nitrogen. Net removal of DOC occurred mainly from the hydrophobic organic acid fraction, while hydrophilic and transphilic acids showed no net change. Model fits were improved using the different DOC fractions than when using bulk DOC, indicating that partitioning of bulk DOC into different fractions is critical for understanding terrestrial DOC removal. These findings suggest that river systems may have only a modest ability to alter the amounts of terrestrial DOC delivered to coastal zones.",

            "abstract": "Here we examine the apparent long-term refilling (change in density at a particular position over days) of electron density and mass density. At solar maximum, the changes in these quantities following a period of large geomagnetic activity can be very different. For instance, for events during 2001 we used both the ion density measured by the Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer (MPA) instrument and mass density inferred from Alfven wave frequencies measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) to show that the mass density varied comparatively little while the electron density dropped down to a low value and recovered slowly. During this event, the composition changed dramatically, from a high concentration of O+ very soon after large geomagnetic activity to a very low concentration of O+ after a long quiet period. This result suggests that at solar maximum O+ is quickly distributed to the region outside the plasmasphere sometimes called the warm plasma cloak while H+ refills this region much more slowly. Here we use a large database of mass density measurements based on Alfven waves observed by GOES to examine statistically the behavior of the mass density during periods of quiet following large geomagnetic activity and to see how this behavior varies over the solar cycle. We will compare with previous results for refilling of electron density.",

            "abstract": "The Caatinga is a tropical dry forest unique to northeastern Brazil. It has a relatively high degree of endism and supports a population of about 20 million subsistence farmers. However, it is poorly understood, under-researched and often over-looked in regards to other Brazilian ecosystems. It is a highly perturbed system that suffers from deforestation, land use change, and may be threatened by climate change. How these perturbations affect hydrology is unknown, but may have implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services and resiliency. Therefore, understanding key hydrological processes is critical, particularly as related to deforestation. In this study, Hydrus 1D, which is based on van Genuchten parameters to describe the soil water curve and Richard’s Equation to describe flow in the vadose zone, was used to model soil moisture in the Caatinga ecosystem. The aim was 1) to compare hydraulic characterization between a forested Caatinga site and a deforested pasture site, 2) to analyze inter-annual variability, and 3) to compare with observed soil moisture data. Hydraulic characterization included hydraulic conductivity, infiltration, water content and pressure head trends. Van Genuchten parameters were derived using the Beerkan method, which is based on soil texture, particle distribution, as well as in-situ small-scale infiltration experiments. Observational data included soil moisture and precipitation logged every half-hour from September 2013 to April 2014 to include the dry season and rainy season. It is expected that the forested Caatinga site will have a higher hydraulic conductivity as well as retain higher soil moisture values. These differences may be amplified during the dry season, as water resources become scarce. Deviations between modeled data and observed data will allow for further hypothesis to be proposed, especially those related to soil water repellency. Hence, these results may indicate difference in soil water dynamics between a forested and non-forested site which will have implications for land use and management strategies that promote water resource conservation and availability.",

            "abstract": "We present the first report of experimental measurements of the enhanced settling velocity of volcanic particles as function of particle volume fraction. In order to investigate the differences in the aerodynamic behavior of ash particles when settling individually or in mass, we performed systematic large-scale ash settling experiments using natural basaltic and phonolitic ash. By releasing ash particles at different, controlled volumetric flow rates, in an unconstrained open space and at minimal air movement, we measured their terminal velocity, size, and particle volume fraction with a high-speed camera at 2000 fps. Enhanced settling velocities of individual particles increase with increasing particle volume fraction. This suggests that particle clustering during fallout may be one reason explaining larger than theoretical depletion rates of fine particles from volcanic ash clouds. We provide a quantitative empirical model that allows to calculate, from a given particle size and density, the enhanced velocity resulting from a given particle volume fraction. The proposed model has the potential to serve as a simple tool for the prediction of the terminal velocity of ash of an hypothetical distribution of ash of known particle size and volume fraction. This is of particular importance for advection-diffusion transport model of ash where generally a one-way coupling is adopted, considering only the flow effects on particles. To better quantify the importance of the enhanced settling velocity in ash dispersal, we finally introduced the new formulation in a Lagrangian model calculating for realistic eruptive conditions the resulting ash concentration in the atmosphere and on the ground.",

            "abstract": "Despite their relatively small surface area, continental margins are regions of intense carbon and nutrient processing, export and exchange, and thus have a significant impact on global biogeochemical cycles. In response to recommendations for regional synthesis and carbon budget estimation for North America put forth in the North American Continental Margins workshop report (Hales et al., 2008), the Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry (OCB) Program and North American Carbon Program (NACP) began coordinating a series of collaborative, interdisciplinary Coastal CARbon Synthesis (CCARS) research activities in five coastal regions of North America (Atlantic Coast, Pacific Coast, Gulf of Mexico, Arctic, Laurentian Great Lakes) to improve quantitative assessments of the North American carbon budget. CCARS workshops and collaborative research activities have resulted in the development of regional coastal carbon budgets based on recent literature- and model-based estimates of major carbon fluxes with estimated uncertainties. Numerous peer-reviewed papers and presentations by involved researchers have highlighted these findings and provided more in-depth analyses of processes underlying key carbon fluxes in continental margin systems. As a culminating outcome of these synthesis efforts, a comprehensive science plan highlights key knowledge gaps identified during this synthesis and provides explicit guidance on future research and observing priorities in continental margin systems to help inform future agency investments in continental margins research. This presentation will provide an overview of regional and flux-based (terrestrial inputs, biological transformations, sedimentary processes, atmospheric exchanges, lateral carbon transport) synthesis findings and key recommendations in the science plan, as well as a set of overarching priorities and recommendations on observations and modeling approaches for continental margin systems.",

One of the applications which has recently been subject of great interest is geological sequestration of CO2 in deep saline aquifers. A primary goal of the studies in this area is predicting the migration of the injected CO2 in the reservoir both a priori and a posteriori. The results from continuum-scale models, however, often have significant uncertainties, which in part stems from ignoring the pore-scale transport and displacement processes. One of the powerful tools that can help improve our understanding of pore-scale flow and transport processes is the microscopic particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) technique, which yields temporally- and spatially-resolved velocity vector fields. We have studied drainage and imbibition processes in a homogeneous, two-dimensional porous micromodel with water and liquid/supercritical CO2 as the two fluid phases at reservoir-relevant conditions. Instantaneous velocity vector fields in the aqueous phase were recorded that provide new insight about the flow at the pore-scale.",

            "abstract": "The subduction zone interface is the place of the largest earthquakes on earth. Compared to the size of a subduction zone itself, it constitutes a very thin zone (few kilometers) with effective rheological behaviour that varies as a function of pressure, temperature, loading, nature of the material locally embedded within the interface as well as the amount of water, melts and CO2. Capturing the behaviour of this interface and its evolution in time is crucial, yet modelling it is not an easy task. In the last decade, thermo-mechanical models of subduction zone have flourished in the literature. They mostly focused on the long-term dynamics of the subduction; e.g. flat subduction, slab detachment or exhumation. The models were validated models against PTt path of exhumed material as well as topography. The models that could reproduce the data all included a mechanically weak subduction channel made of extremely weak and non cohesive material. While this subduction channel model is very convenient at large scale and might apply to some real subduction zones, it does not capture the many geological field evidences that point out the exhumation of very large slice of almost pristine oceanic crust along localised shear zone. Moreover, modelling of sismological and geodetic data using short term tectonic modelling approach also point out that large localised patches rupture within the subduction interface, which is in accordance with geological data but not with large-scale long-term tectonic models.\nI will present how high resolution models permit to produce slicing at the subduction interface and give clues on how the plate coupling and effective location of the plate interface vary over a few millions of year time scale. I will then discuss the implication of these new high-resolution long-term models of subduction zone on earthquake generation, report progress in the development of self-consistent thermomechanical codes which can handle large strain, high resolution and fluids pathways together with adaptative time stepping schemes permitting to switch from static long term-tectonic approach to seismic cycle modelling within the same frame work and discuss how the results of these forward models can be used to better assess coupling at the subduction zone interface from geodetic, seismologic and geologic record.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning can sometimes emit surprisingly active ice nucleating particles, though these emissions are not at all consistent between biomass fuel sources and burns. Soot from biomass combustion has been attributed to some but not all of the ice nucleating potential of biomass burning aerosol (BBA), while fossil fuel combustion soot emits very weak ice nucleants. The causes of the sometimes significant but variable ice nucleating ability of BBA are still largely unknown.\nBBA experiences significant atmospheric aging as the plume evolves and mixes with background air, yet almost no reports exploring the effects of atmospheric aging on the freezing properties of BBA have been made. We have performed some of the first experiments to determine the effects of simulated atmospheric aging on these ice nucleation properties, using a chamber reactor. The fresh and aged BBA was collected for subsequent droplet freezing array analysis using an impinger sampler to collect aerosol in water, and by deposition onto substrates in a MOUDI sampler. Droplets containing the chamber particles were then suspended in oil on a cold plate for freezing temperature spectrum measurement.\nAging of Sawgrass flaming-phase combustion BBA by exposure to hydroxyl radicals (from H2O2 photolysis) enhanced the ice nucleation ability, observed by a shift to warmer droplet freezing temperatures by ~2-3°C. The changes in the aerosol’s chemical composition during aging were observed using a laser ablation single-particle mass spectrometer and a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer. We will report our observations of the effects of other types of simulated aging (including photochemistry under high and low NOx conditions, dark ozonolysis, and nitric acid exposure) on Sawgrass and BBA from other grass and palm fuels.",

            "abstract": "As the flux-tower studies of terrestrial CO2 exchange are currently approaching the stage of generalization and up-scaling, there is a growing need for an effective framework for these efforts facilitating comparative analysis and synthesis of flux tower data. Developed in the 1980s to denote a region with recurring patterns of ecosystems with similar climatic, vegetation, soil, and relief conditions, during the past decades the ecoregion concept was widely used as a tool combining modeling, GIS and remote sensing techniques in environmental and nature conservation project at the national and international scale. We describe application of the ecoregion approach to synthesis and up-scaling of the tower CO2 exchange measurements in the three major ecoregions of the Great Plains: Shortgrass steppe (SGS), Mixed prairie (MP), and Tallgrass prairie (TP). Original data of tower CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements during the 1996-2013 period covering 23 years at 6 sites in SGS, 86 years at 21 sites in MP, and 80 years at 24 sites in TP were partitioned into the gross photosynthesis (Pg) and ecosystem respiration (Re) components using the light-soil temperature-VPD response method. We present ecoregion-specific multivariate models relating gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration and major ecosystem-scale ecophysiological parameters (photosynthetic capacity, apparent quantum yield, light-use efficiency, daytime respiration intensity) to on-site (climatic, plant, soil) and remotely sensed (NDVI) drivers of CO2 exchange. Superposition of these models on GIS layers of appropriate drivers was used to describe geographic patterns (maps) of photosynthesis, respiration, net CO2 exchange and ecophysiological parameters across the Great Plains. The source-sink activity at the ecoregion-scale was quantified by calculating spatial integrals of CO2 exchange characteristic over GIS pixels represented by the tower measurements.",

CME-driven shocks are responsible for large solar energetic particle (SEP) events and sudden commencement/sudden impulse events recorded by ground magnetometers. The excellent overlap of the spatial domains probed by SOHO/STEREO coronagraphs with the spectral domains of Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES has contributed enormously in understanding CMEs and shocks as space weather drivers. This paper is concerned with type II bursts of solar cycle 23 and 24 that had emission components down to kilometric wavelengths. CMEs associated with these bursts seem to be the best indicators of large SEP events, better than the halo CMEs. However, there are some differences between the type II bursts of the two cycles, which are explained based on the different states of the heliosphere in the two cycles. Finally, the type II burst characteristics of some recent extreme events are discussed.",

            "abstract": "We use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) measurements of solar irradiance from GOES satellites to derive daily hydrogen (H) density distributions of the terrestrial upper atmosphere. GOES satellites are in geostationary orbit and measure solar irradiance in a wavelength band around the Lyman-alpha line. When the satellite is on the night-side of the Earth looking through the atmosphere at the Sun, the irradiance exhibits absorption/scattering loss. Using these daily dips in the measured irradiance, we can estimate a simple hydrogen density distribution for the exosphere based on the integrated scattering loss along the line of sight towards the Sun. We show preliminary results from this technique and compare the derived exospheric H density distributions with other data sets for different solar, geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The GOES observations will be available for many years into the future and so potentially can provide continuous monitoring of exospheric H density for use in full atmospheric models. These measurements may also provide a means to validate, calibrate and improve other exospheric models. Improved models will help with the understanding of the solar-upper atmospheric coupling and the decay of the ions in the magnetospheric ring current during geomagnetic storms. Long-term observations of trends can be used to monitor impacts of climate change and improved satellite drag models will help satellite operator adjust satellite orbits during geomagnetic storms. We discuss planned improvements to this technique.",

            "abstract": "The focal point of most lacustrine studies in the Mojave National Preserve (MNP) to date has been on lakes fed by the Mojave River. The source of the Mojave River is found on the northern flank of the San Bernardino Mountains. Consequently, the lakes that receive these waters are predominantly responding to the winter-only coastal southwest United States climate (e.g., Kirby et al., 2015 - Silver Lake); to a lesser degree, these lakes are also influenced by the Mojave’s bimodal winter/summer climate. Ford Lake, located in the southeastern Mojave Desert is a small closed basin lake with its drainage basin located exclusively within the Mojave Desert. Therefore, sediment collected from Ford Lake contains a 100% Mojave-only climate signal. A 2.18 m sediment core was collected from the lake’s depocenter in May 2015. Sediment analyses at 1 cm contiguous intervals include: magnetic susceptibility (MS), percent total organic matter, percent total carbonate content, and grain size analysis; C:N ratios, C and N isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analyses, and macrofossil counts are determined at 2 cm intervals. The site’s age model is based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon ages from discrete organic macrofossils or bulk organic carbon. To deconvolve the coastal climate, winter-only signal from the Mojave-only climate signal the data from Ford Lake will be compared to one Mojave River fed lake (Silver) and several southern California lakes (Lower Bear, Lake Elsinore, Dry Lake, and Zaca Lake). Our results will be analyzed in the context of climate forcings such as insolation and ocean – atmosphere dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The apparent large scale anisotropy is the mixing of intrinsic anisotropic minerals (LPO) and extrinsic anisotropy due to materials with fine layering, fluid inclusions, cracks (SPO) . The same issue arises for attenuation (with many different anelastic processes). The proportion of extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropy and attenuation in the Earth mantle is still an open question. The interpretation of observations of seismic anisotropy and attenuation is the subject of controversies and often contradictory according to their intrinsic or extrinsic nature. Fine layering is a good candidate for explaining at the same time a large part of observed radial anisotropy (Wang et al., Geophys. Res. Lett., 2013) and attenuation (Ricard et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 2014).\nA plausible model of mixing of materials in a chaotic convecting fluid creates a spectrum of heterogeneity varying like 1/k (k wavenumber of the heterogeneity). A body wave propagating in a finely layered medium will be scattered and its distorted waveform can be interpreted as due to attenuation with a quality factor Q. We showed that, with the specific 1/k spectrum and only 6-9% RMS heterogeneity, the resulting apparent attenuation Q is frequency independent. Aggregates of randomly orientated anisotropic minerals are good candidates for giving rise to this extrinsic apparent attenuation. The relationship for a 1/k spectrum with apparent seismic anisotropy is also explored.",

            "abstract": "First let’s describe the context. Approximately 80% of our students in Medellin major in engineering. In the National University system students can choose freely twenty percent of the credits. Their decisions are made taking into account various reasons. As far as we know the amount of work and the expected grades are factors besides the interest in the topics. Statistics show that there is an even distribution among complementary professional, cross-disciplinary and general interest courses.\nPlan B took the name from Lexter Brown book, which was the original inspiration and text. The program expanded with more in depth consideration to a general understanding of climate and climate change science, and to water and energy crises because they are close to my research area. But we consider other global change uses as well, including recycling, loss of biodiversity, food crises, economics of climate change and demographic and social issues. We developed a textbook whose title would translate as “Where is the Globe heading?” that refers to a usual saying during Christmas time in relation to candle balloons popular at that time of the year that children and teen-agers try to catch. The expression reflects the need for predictions, call for action, but also acknowledges that chance is a factor to consider. I believe it summarizes well the content of the course.\nThe class meets in a large auditorium with 250 sits. We moved from the usual size room of about 50 because of the large demand during registration. This forced us to adjust the methodology, but our evaluation is that such a large audience is worthwhile. Student’s feedbacks at the end of the semester confirm this with very good rating and general comments.\nBesides crude diagnostics of the problems based on data and science we always make an effort to present solutions. For instance there is ample consideration to renewal energy technologies. Globalization is also a theme of the course, there are local actions but in particular curbing of greenhouse gas emissions needs global actions.\nWe need that this kind of efforts spread to many campuses around the world and need to share experiences to take advantage of globalization.",

            "abstract": "Forearc stability and inherent tectonic failure processes at active continental margins very much depend on the strength of the composing sediments. Forearc sediments can either be prone to fracturing and more localized deformation or alternatively to creep and distributed deformation. Strength and deformation behavior can vary significantly depending on small differences in composition and fabric of the sediments as has been shown in a similar study on samples from the Nankai trench and forearc (Stipp et al., 2013). Cylindrical core samples with diameters of 30 and 50 mm recovered during IODP Expeditions 334 and 344 from a depth range of 7–788 m below sea floor were experimentally deformed in two different triaxial deformation apparatus under consolidated and undrained conditions at confining pressures of 0.4–20 MPa, room temperature, variable axial displacement rates of ~0.01–0.5 mm/min, and up to axial compressive strains of ~50%. Experimental results show great differences in the consolidation state and the related mechanical behavior of upper plate and incoming plate sediments. Similar to previous findings from the Nankai trench and forearc, structurally weak and structurally strong samples can be distinguished. One sample from shallow depth in the incoming plate shows a transition from structurally strong to structurally weak behavior with increasing confining pressure that has not been observed for Nankai samples. The differences in mechanical behavior may be the key for strain localization, faulting and surface breakage at active erosive as well as accretionary continental margins.\n",

These tides are known to influence the energy and momentum budget of the ionosphere thermosphere system. The seasonal and climatological studies of these tides are being made since long using systematic radio sounding measurements. Here in this study, meteor radar based horizontal wind observations during 2003-2014 from a high-latitude station, Andenes (69oN, 16oE) and during 2008-2014 from a mid-latitude station, Juliusruh (54oN, 13oE) are used to study the behavior of mesospheric SDTs. It has been observed that the amplitudes of SDTs are enhanced in both the stations during September equinox in all the years and after the March equinox in some years. Some earlier studies from low-latitudes, where quasi biennial oscillation (QBO) has maximum influence, showed SDT amplitude enhancement in both March and September equinox in all the years. Previous studies attributed such enhancements to be due to changes in the refractive properties of the medium arising from wind and temperature variations. In this study it has been observed that these enhancements in September equinox are below/above mean level for those years in which the low-latitude QBO wind at 50 hPa is westward/eastward (QBOe/QBOw). It is conjectured that a Holton-Tan type mechanism, wherein the equatorial Kelvin waves influence the high- and mid-latitude tidal and planetary waves, is responsible for lower values of the SDT amplitudes during September equinox of the QBOe phase cases. These results will be discussed with supporting evidence from reanalysis data and WACCM model simulations.",

The density and velocity of these blobs show similarities with the slow solar wind. There are various scenarios proposed to comprehend the release mechanism for these plasmoids. Most widely accepted explanations include interchange reconnection and significant proton coronal heating at the streamer tip. A three-dimensional global coronal model will be used to examine this intermittent blob release over a several day period. We use the new real time version of Alfven Wave Solar Model (AWSoM-R) to decrease the computational costs. In AWSoM-R, the global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for the lower corona are solved along one-dimensional magnetic field line threads. The Alfven wave dissipation is partitioned into coronal heating of protons and electrons. We study how this heat partitioning affects plasmoid formation. We investigate the size and periodicity of the streamer blobs for Carrington Rotation 2109 (12 April 2011-09 May 2011) by constructing synthetic white light images from the time-dependent model and comparing our results with observations.",

            "abstract": "Stream hydrogeomorphology is a strong determinant of streambed microbial community activity, which in turn influences stream biogeochemistry. Whether this influence is unidirectional or whether microbial communities can also modulate biogeochemical processes by affecting hydrogeomorphology is an emerging question in research on sediment-water interfaces. Using experimental flumes simulating sandy streams, we tested whether such influences can occur through altered water exchange across the sediment-water interface. Results show that microbial communities in sandy streambeds can indeed affect hydrogeomorphology by producing gas bubbles. Specifically, gas bubbles accumulating in microbial biofilms can alter the water exchange by (i) reducing sediment pore space or (ii) provoking the detachment of the microbial biofilm detachment and thus altering streambed topography. Additionally, results indicate that water exchange is the major for the structure and activity of the microbial community. Our data also indicate that the potential of microbial communities to influence water exchange can be modulated by factors such as light intensity and discharge fluctuations. These biological-physical interactions and their effects on the influence of microbial communities on hydrogeomorphology is a source of spatiotemporal variability in water exchange across the sediment-water interface. Heterogeneity in water exchange is known to increase biogeochemical pathways and, thus, ecosystem functions. These results suggest that a holistic understanding of vertical connectivity in running waters requires consideration of biological-physical interactions at the water-sediment interface.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, China Geological Survey (CGS) has launched 3D geological mapping programs from regional to local scales. The project Deep geological survey at the periphery of the Songliao Basin funded by CGS was implemented from 2012 to 2014. Its main goals are to reveal the tectonic framework of the Jarud Basin (JB) as well as to identify the strata distribution of Permian Linxi Formation by integrating new electromagnetic data with existing geophysical and geological data since black mudstones in the Linxi Formation have shown the potential of shale gas. The study area covered dominantly with Cretaceous-Jurassic igneous rocks with exception of the southeast part is situated in Jarud Banner and Ar Horqin Banner, Inner Mongolia, China. It tectonically lies in the southern Great Khingan Range, western margin of the Songliao Basin, and north of Xar Moron Fault. Over the period of 2012 to 2014, a magnetotelluric survey was carried out at the JB. A total of 926 MT sites with nominal spacing 1 km was acquired in the effective frequency range of 0.01 Hz ~ 300 Hz on six NW and five NE profiles, covering area that exceeds 10, 000 km2. After dimensionality analysis and static shift removal, the nonlinear conjugate algorithm was used to conduct 2D inversion for TM and TE modes. The resistivity models underwent examination using sensitivity tests. The optimal resistivity models revealed numerous large faults, some of which constitute the boundaries of the JB, and modified the tectonic framework. Integrated with well logging and geological mapping data, the strata of Linxi Formation were identified and classified into three depressions: Depressions Arituguri, Gadasu and Wufen. Attention should be paid to Depression Gadasu with area of around 500 km2 since it contains reasonably thick conductive sediments exceeding 4 km in depth which are inferred to be black mudstones pertaining to shale gas.\n ",

            "abstract": "Carbonates play a fundamental role in the recycling of carbon inside our planet due to their presence in oceanic slabs that sink through the Earth’s interior. Through this process, iron carbonates are potential stable carbon-bearing minerals in the deep mantle in part due to spin crossover of ferrous iron. Our goal is to identify which minerals may be the dominant carriers of carbon into the deep mantle at the relevant conditions of fO2, P and T. All experiments were performed using synthetic FeCO3 and MgFeCO3 single crystals in laser heated diamond anvil cells up to 100 GPa and 3000 K in order to simulate the conditions prevailing in the Earth’s lower mantle. Transformation and decomposition products of the original carbonates were characterized at different synchrotron facilities by means of single-crystal XRD, synchrotron Mössbauer source spectroscopy and XANES techniques. At deep lower mantle conditions, we observed the transformation of FeCO3 to two new HP-carbonate structures, monoclinic Fe22+Fe23+C4O13 and trigonal Fe43+(CO4)3, both characterized by the presence of CO4 tetrahedra with different degrees of polymerization. At shallower depths in the lower mantle where temperatures are lower following the geotherm, Fe-carbonates decompose to different Fe-oxides instead of new HP-carbonates. However, at slab temperatures several hundred degrees lower than the surrounding mantle, carbonates could be stabilized until reaching conditions that trigger their transformation to HP-structures. We postulate that Fe-rich carbonates could exist in regions down to the core-mantle boundary in the proximity of subducting slabs, i.e., a “cold” environment with relatively high fO2.",

This study concentrates on new unidirectional flow scenarios which can be reduced to analytical models. It begins by describing slight modifications to the classical pulse-decay techniques involving flow along the axial direction of cylindrical core samples, followed by models for flow in the radial direction in cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems. Such strategies enable noticeably, in some cases dramatically, faster experimental measurements within lower permeability regimes than conventional pressure-pulse-decay techniques. These approaches could form baseline alternatives to the industry-standard pulse-decay variants in wide use for ultra-low permeability materials like shales and caprocks.",

            "abstract": "Ceres shape and crater morphology are consistent with a layer of low-density material that appears to be more dense and viscous than pure water ice, over an even more dense and viscous core. In order to understand the evolution of Ceres, we conduct a series of numerical experiments designed to understand the evolution of temperature and flow within a spherical body with a soft outer shell over a nearly rigid core using 3D spherical code CitcomS. In these experiments the sphere is heated from within using chondritic abundances of radiogenic elements. We study the impact of surface temperature, outer shell thickness, as well as the density and rheology of the softer outer shell and stiffer core on the thermal and dynamical evolution of the interior of the body, including both the soft shell and stiff core. For the outer shells with a thickness less than 10% of the radius of the body and a surface temperature at or below 90 K, the entire body remains in a conductive state and the temperature of the soft outer shell never exceeds the melting temperature of pure water ice throughout the history of the solar system. However for a range of outer shell thickness and surface temperatures, we find that within the first Gyr of evolution a degree-1 (i.e. single hemisphere) mode of convection encompassing both the stiff core and soft outer shell overtakes shorter-wavelength convective flow occurring in the softer outer shell. When this happens the body dramatically cools over a time interval of less than 100 Myrs and the internal temperature remains asymmetric throughout the subsequent evolution of the body.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is a strong greenhouse gas emitted by both human activity and natural processes. Its emissions from vast marine and terrestrial carbon pools in Arctic shallow reservoirs could create a strong positive feedback to climate change as permafrost is thawing. The East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) overlays large areas of subsea permafrost that is degrading and causing the release of large amount of CH4 originally stored or formed there towards the water column. Large scale CH4 super-saturation has been observed in the ESAS waters, pointing out to leakages of CH4 through the sea floor and possibly to the atmosphere but the origin(s) of this gas is still debated.\nHere we present CH4 concentration and isotope data analyzed on gas extracted from sediment and water sampled over the shallow ESAS from 2007-2013. We find the presence of large amount (up to 500μM) of CH4 within the partially thawed subsea permafrost of this region. For all sediment cores, both hydrogen and carbon CH4 isotope data show the presence of highly depleted (in comparison with the atmospheric CH4 isotope signature) CH4, indicative of a microbial origin. Radiocarbon data demonstrates that in most cases the CH4 present in the ESAS sediment is of Pleistocene age or older. These results reveal the presence of CH4 that is not from thermogenic/natural gas (isotopically enriched CH4) origin as it has long been thought, but the results of microbial CH4 formation using as primary substrate old organic matter in the deep subsea permafrost or below.\nOur observations show that this CH4 accumulates under the Holocene marine sediment layer (when present) and slowly diffuses towards the sediment surface where it undergoes anaerobic methane oxidation. However, at locations where deep and/or open taliks develop in subsea permafrost, CH4 escapes to the water column as bubble plumes. In that case ebullition processes prevent CH4 anaerobic oxidation to occur in the surface sediment. CH4 will thus migrate rapidly through the water column to partially escape to the atmosphere (ice-free period) or become trapped in or under the sea ice and be released to the atmosphere during the melt season generating a positive radiative feedback.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the processes that control the terrestrial exchange of carbon and water are critical for examining the role of forested ecosystems in changing climates. A small but increasing number of studies have identified Carbonyl Sulfide (OCS) as a potential tracer for photosynthesis. OCS is hydrolyzed by an irreversible reaction in leaf mesophyll cells that is catalyzed by the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. Leaf- level field and greenhouse studies indicate that OCS uptake is controlled by stomatal activity and that the ratio of OCS and CO2 uptake is reasonably constant. Existing studies on ecosystem OCS exchange have been based on laboratory measurements or short field campaigns and therefore little information on OCS exchange in a natural ecosystem over longer timescales is available.\nThe objective of this study is to further assess the stability of OCS as a tracer for canopy photosynthesis in an active forested ecosystem and also to assess its utility for constraining transpiration, since both fluxes are mediated by canopy stomatal conductance. An off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy analyzer (Los Gatos Research Inc.) was deployed at the Wind River Experimental Forest in Washington (45.8205°N, 121.9519°W). Canopy air was sampled from four heights as well as the soil to measure vertical gradients of OCS within the canopy, and OCS exchange between the forest and the atmosphere for the growing season. Here we take advantage of simultaneous measurements of the stable isotopologues of H2O and CO2 at corresponding heights as well as NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) from eddy covariance measurements to compare GPP (Gross Primary Production) and transpiration estimates from a variety of independent techniques. Our findings also seek to allow assessment of the environmental and ecophysicological controls on evapotranspiration rates, which are projected to change in coming decades, and are otherwise poorly constrained.",

In this connection, the quality of geostationary data, first of all the level of noise in TEC estimations is of great interest and importance. In this work we present the results of the comparison of the noise patterns in TEC estimations using signals of geostationary satellites of augumentation systems – indian GAGAN, european EGNOS and american WAAS, as well as the signals of chinees COMPASS/Beidou navigational system. We show that among above mentioned systems geostationary COMPASS/Beidou satellites provide best noise level in TEC estimations (RMS~0.1TECU), which corresponds to those of GPS/GLONASS, while GAGAN and WAAS TEC RMS could reach up to 1.5 TECU with typical values of 0.25-0.5 TECU which is up to one order greater than for common GPS/GLONASS observations. EGNOS TEC estimations being even more noisy (TEC RMS up to 10TECU) than WAAS and GAGAN ones at present time are not suitable for ionospheric studies.\nWe also present geostationary TEC response to increasing solar X-Ray and EUV ionizing radiation during several recent X-class flares. Good correlation was found between TEC and EUV flux for the stations at the sunlit hemisphere. We also present geostationary TEC response to geomagnetic field variations during strong and moderate geomagnetic storms (including G4 St. Patricks Day Storm of 2015) showing examples of both positive and negative TEC anomalies of order of tens of TECU during main storm phase.\nOur results show the capability of geostationary GNSS and SBAS observations for continuous monitoring of ionospheric TEC. Intensively growing networks of dedicated receivers (for example MGEX network) and increasing number of dual-frequency geostationary satellites in SBAS and GNSS constellations potentially make it a powerful instrument for TEC climatology.",

Process networks, in which nodes are time-series variables and links are information theoretic measures, allow us to analyze a system in terms of unique and redundant time dependencies. It has been shown that process networks composed of measured and modeled ecohydrologic time-series variables exhibit breakdowns in feedbacks during periods of climate extremes such as drought. In this study, we use an information decomposition approach to partition shared information between ecohydrologic time-series nodes into redundant and unique components. Redundant information is information shared between multiple source nodes with a target node, while unique shared information is only attributable to a single source node. In an ecohydrologic network, unique shared information between two nodes is likely to represent a critical ecosystem link, and redundant shared information indicates synchronization or internally induced feedbacks between variables. We form networks using flux tower, weather station, and ecohydrologic model output variables over a range of natural and intensively managed ecosystem types. Methods to compute information transfer components with short datasets are used in order to observe shifts in network behavior that vary with weather conditions and extreme events on hourly to weekly timescales. We compare network properties with satellite derived vegetation indices, and evaluate how links shift in terms of strength, uniqueness, or redundancy as ecosystems respond to environmental conditions. This analysis shows that a network approach can detect critical linkages that dictate ecosystem vulnerability to extreme events.",

We present the first basin-wide, monthly estimates of Arctic Ocean SSH from satellite radar altimetry and combine this with GRACE ocean mass to estimate steric height. The large seasonal cycle of Arctic SSH (amplitude ~4cm) is dominated by seasonal freshwater fluxes and peaks in October-November. Overall, the annual mean steric height increases by 2.3±1.1cm between 2003-2012 before falling to ca. 2003 levels between 2012-2014. The total secular change in SSH between 2003-2014 is then dominated by a 1.8±0.6cm net increase in ocean mass. The well-documented doming of SSH in the Beaufort Sea is revealed by Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis to be concurrent with SSH reductions in the Siberian Arctic. Ocean storage flux estimates from altimetry agree well with high-resolution modelled results, demonstrating the potential for altimetry to elucidate the Arctic hydrological cycle. We also examine changes in Arctic Ocean geostrophic circulation and compare this with sea ice drift and atmospheric circulation. There is an increase in ocean geostrophic circulation around the Beaufort Gyre in late 2007, a year that saw large reductions in multiyear sea ice coverage in the Canadian Arctic as well as strong wintertime atmopheric forcing.",

            "abstract": "Particle fluxes in the oceans are determined by environmental circumstances and differ from site to site. In the western tropical North Atlantic the particle flux is considered to be rather low since there is low nutrient input and low productivity. It is, however, influenced by atmospheric dust deposition, Amazon River discharge, and nitrogen fixation. This brings both refractory lithogenic material and new nutrients into the system, affecting primary production and particle export. Particle export in particular has attracted attention since it is potentially partially responsible for atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Here we present one year (October 2012 until November 2013) flux data collected by two sediment traps at 1200 m and 3500 m depth in the western tropical North Atlantic (12⁰N, 49⁰W), combined with satellite data, giving information about environmental circumstances and particle export fluxes from the surface to the deep ocean. Average total mass fluxes vary between 40 – 270 mg/m2/d and 30 - 170 mg /m2/d at the upper and lower depths, respectively. Peak fluxes during the second half of April and by the end of October/start of November 2013 are notable since they differ in nature; carbonaceous material dominates fluxes in spring and biogenic opal in fall. While the fall peak seems related to Amazon River dispersal, the spring peak appears to arise due to changing environmental conditions; rising SST possibly combined with dry dust deposition, causing a spring bloom. Both peak fluxes go along with elevated organic matter and lithogenic fluxes in the upper trap at 1200 m. At this depth, additional individual elevated lithogenic fluxes are also accompanied by raised organic matter. The lithogenic and opal fractions are considered to be the main ballast components for organic carbon aggregates, or vice versa.\nSee: www.nioz.nl/dust",

            "abstract": "Low energy ions of ionospheric origin provide a significant contributon to the magnetospheric plasmapopulation. Measuring cold ions is difficult though. Observations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in regions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar illumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle detectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow during segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise arise if continuous longtime observations such as the during a geomagnetic storms are needed. In this paper we suggest a new approach, based on a combination of synoptic observations and a novel technique to estimate the flux and total outflow during the various phases of geomagnetic storms. Our results indicate large variations in both outflow rates and transport throughout the storm. Prior to the storm main phase, outflow rates are moderate, and the cold ions are mainly emanating from moderately sized polar cap regions. Throughout the main phase of the storm, outflow rates increase and the polar cap source regions expand. Furthermore, faster transport, resulting from enhanced convection, leads to a much larger supply of cold ions to the near Earth region during gemagnetic storms.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) derived from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass has received increasing attention due to their potential importance in a wide range of biogeochemical processes. China has been generally considered as the world’s largest BC emitter. Due to a combination of the prevailing East Asia monsoon and large amounts of riverine outflow, BC released from China can be transported to the adjacent continental shelf seas, the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS). Based on measurements of BC in 191 surface sediments, 36 riverine water, and 2 seawater samples, as well as the reported BC data set of the aerosol samples in the Bohai Rim, the concentration, flux, and budget of BC in the BS and YS were investigated. The spatial distribution of the BC concentration in surface sediments was largely influenced by the regional hydrodynamic conditions, with high values mainly occurring in the central mud areas. The BC burial flux in the BS and YS ranged from 4 to 1100 μg/cm2/yr, and averaged 166 ± 200 μg/cm2/yr. The area-integrated sedimentary BC sink flux in the entire BS and YS was ~325 Gg/yr. The BC budget calculated in the BS showed that atmospheric deposition and riverine discharge played comparable importance in delivering BC to the BS, and sequestration to bottom sediments was the major BC output pattern, accounting for ~88% of the total input BC.\nBesides, we attempted to apportion the BC sources in the BS and YS surface sediments using PAHs (organic molecular proxies cogenerated with BC) and BC as an input data to the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model. Results showed that ~83% of the sediment BC was attributed to the combustion of fossil fuels, and the remaining ~17% was from biomass burning. Due to the differences in their production mechanisms and therefore physicochemical properties, the above distinction and quantification would help us better understand their different environmental behaviors in the complex continental shelf regimes.",

            "abstract": "A unique marine and lagoonal system along the coast east of Rio de Janeiro is being investigated to understand the impact of climatic variability on the South Atlantic carbon cycle and biomineralisation processes involved in carbonate precipitation in the hypersaline coastal lagoons. The region is dominated by a semi-arid microclimate attributed to the local coastal upwelling phenomenon near Cabo Frio. The intensity of the upwelling affects the hydrology of the annual water and biogeochemical cycles in the lagoons, as well as biogeochemical signals of environmental change recorded in both onshore and offshore sediments.\nPreliminary results of δ18O and δD values of water samples collected monthly in Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo do Espinho from 2011 to 2014 show lower values for waters corresponding to the wet season, reflecting increased input of meteoric water. The higher values for waters collected during the dry season reflect the greater amount of evaporation with increased seasonal aridity. Radiocarbon dating of Holocene marine and lagoonal cores indicates that Mg-carbonate precipitation in the lagoons is associated with high evaporation. Modern field observations for the last 3 years suggest that the amount of carbonate precipitation is correlated with evaporitic conditions associated with the upwelling phenomenon.\nA calibration study of hydrogen isotopic fractionation in the modern lagoons is underway to define a relationship between δDlipid of suspended particles and δDwater of associated water. This isotopic relationship will be applied to material obtained in cores from the lagoons. Offshore cores will be studied using well-tested paleotemperature proxies to evaluate the intensity of the upwelling during the Holocene. In summary, linking the coastal upwelling with the lagoonal hydrology has the potential to furnish important insights about the relationship between the local climate and paleoceanographic circulation associated with the regional carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "We use globally unique datasets from paired laser profile scanners to measure debris-flow height, velocity and discharge in two well-known debris-flow channels in Switzerland. Since 2011, these scanners have been scanning passing debris flows at rates of up to 75 Hz, acquiring millions of cross-bed profiles. The profiles can be concatenated through time, generating unique 2.5D representations of passing debris flows. Applying a large-scale Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) approach to these datasets has proven successful to measure surface flow velocities. Flow height can also be estimated from the laser scanners, and thus a discharge estimate can be given. To account for changes to the channel bed due to erosion and deposition during the debris flow, we compute two flow height estimates using a pre-event as well as a post-event channel geometry in order to visualize discharge variability.\nVelocity outliers need to be excluded to provide reliable estimates of peak discharge, and changes to the channel bed are assumed to be the largest source of uncertainty. However, the latter problem is inherent to all debris-flow discharge measurements, and we have found the new system to offer distinct advantages over the conventional system relying on geophones and a radar gauge. The wide scan angle of up to 190° renders the scanners insensitive to changes of the flow path, and the point density of roughly 20 points per meter offer unprecedented spatial coverage.\nIn addition, the geometries of the cross-bed profiles have been analyzed, revealing distinct changes of cross-flow convexity between the front and the tail of the flows in several cases. This is assumed to indicate changes of debris-flow mixtures, but further research is needed to better understand this signal.\nWe hope that our preliminary analysis and toolbox will facilitate working with these kinds of datasets so as to further improve debris-flow understanding, monitoring and modeling efforts in the future.",

            "abstract": "Switching from annual cropping systems to perennial crops like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for biofuel feedstock production will have implications on carbon and water cycling as well as biophysical parameters, such as surface albedo.\nWe conducted eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide and water fluxes over a mature (>5 years) switchgrass field over three years (2012 to 2014) and a continuous corn field during the year 2014. Both fields were located in Southern Ontario, Canada. Results for carbon and water cycling were compared between the two crops for the year 2014. Differences in surface albedo between the two biofuel cropping systems were compared for the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. In 2014 switchgrass was a carbon sink with a net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of −66±59 g C m-2, while corn was a carbon source with an NECB of 328±30 g C m-2 for a scenario where corn grain only is harvested and 634±34 g C m-2 for a scenario where both grain and stover are harvested. Annual evapotranspiration in 2014 was higher for the corn field (608.7±12 mm) than for the switchgrass field (517.0±8 mm). Albedo measurements showed an average annual negative radiative forcing effect for the switchgrass field compared to corn. Differences in albedo were largest in spring and fall when radiative forcing values of −10.2 and −5.5 W m-2 were observed, respectively.\nComparing carbon cycling results from previous years, the switchgrass field was a source of carbon in 2012 (NEBC 106±45 g C m-2), but a small sink of carbon in 2013 (NEBC −59±45) and 2014. On average over the three measurement years, the switchgrass field was carbon neutral.\nQualitative analysis of the carbon budget, evapotranspiration, and albedo results from this study suggest that biofuel produced from switchgrass can have more climate benefits than biofuel from continuous corn. This study provides important data for improvement of Life Cycle Analysis of switchgrass biofuel.",

            "abstract": "Low frequency (< 20Hz) acoustic measurements have a great potential for the real time characterization of volcanic plume source parameters. Using the classical source theory, acoustic data can be related to the exit velocity of the volcanic jet and to mass eruption rate, based on the geometric constrain of the vent and the mixture density. However, the application of the classical acoustic source models to volcanic explosive eruptions has shown to be challenging and a better knowledge of the link between the acoustic radiation and actual volcanic fluid dynamics processes is required. New insights into this subject could be given by the study of realistic aeroacoustic numerical simulations of a volcanic jet. Lattice Boltzmann strategies (LBS) provide the opportunity to develop an accurate, computationally fast, 3D physical model for a volcanic jet. In the field of aeroacoustic applications, dedicated LBS has been proven to have the low dissipative properties needed for capturing the weak acoustic pressure fluctuations. However, due to the big disparity in magnitude between the flow and the acoustic disturbances, even weak spurious noise sources in simulations can ruin the accuracy of the acoustic predictions. Reflected waves from artificial boundaries defined around the flow region can have significant influence on the flow field and overwhelm the acoustic field of interest. In addition, for highly multiscale turbulent flows, such as volcanic plumes, the number of grid points needed to represent the smallest scales might become intractable and the most complicated physics happen only in small portions of the computational domain. The implementation of the grid refinement, in our model allow us to insert local finer grids only where is actually needed and to increase the size of the computational domain for running more realistic simulations. 3D LBS model simulations for turbulent jet aeroacoustics have been accurately validated. Both mean flow and acoustic results are in good agreement with theory and experimental data available in the literature.",

            "abstract": "An accurate and robust method to extract terrestrial water bodies is critical to effectively manage the fundamental resources for terrestrial life. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution of remotely sensed images and insufficient robustness caused by regional reflectance heterogeneity. Fuzzy clustering method (FCM) with local spatial information has proven to be capable of accounting for these limitations. This technique is however susceptible to immense false noise in original optical bands. A systematic surface water extraction method by synthesizing the water index (WI) method and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was therefore proposed to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications and validations were performed to sixteen background-heterogeneous sites in different parts of the world using the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images, which differed from previous research focusing on water bodies with specific morphological features (e.g., linear rivers or regular lakes). Results obtained demonstrated that the use of the proposed WIMFCM could improve the accuracy of surface water body extraction without regional or seasonal limitations in comparison to alternative methods at both pixel and sub-pixel level. Additional tests carried out on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data proved that the WIMFCM could be extended to global scale, as well as be used in near-real time water monitoring. The findings of this study are able to improve land cover mapping accuracy when using the optical satellite images under heterogeneous environments.",

            "abstract": "Although the stratosphere is mostly stably stratified, breaking gravity waves and instabilities produce turbulence and energy dissipation. This modifies the energy distribution from the troposphere to the mesosphere and is an important parameter for the vertical mixing of trace species. In order to precisely infer energy dissipation rates, the viscous subrange has to be resolved, which in the stratosphere lies at scales of centimeters and below. Our balloon-borne system LITOS (Leibniz-Institute Turbulence Observations in the Stratosphere) observes small-scale wind fluctuations with a vertical resolution of less than 1 mm. The dissipation rate is obtained by fitting a turbulence model to the measured spectrum of fluctuations.\nBetween 2008 and 2011 three flights were performed from Kiruna/Sweden (68°N, 21°E) during BEXUS campaigns as part of a large (~120 kg) payload. Recently, a new small version of LITOS (overall ~4 kg) was flown several times from Kühlungsborn/Germany (54°N, 12°E), thereof one during nighttime. Various turbulent layers with a vertical thickness in the order of a few 10 m have been observed. Stratospheric energy dissipation rates greatly vary within only a few 10 m, roughly between 10−8 and 10 W/kg, with a mean value of roughly 10−3 W/kg. Huge differences have been found in the altitudinal structure and strength of stratospheric turbulence. Results and differences between flights will be discussed in the geophysical context. Turbulence data will be compared with results from simultaneous radiosonde data (5–10 m vertical resolution).",

            "abstract": "The scientific question in this paper is focused on how water column processes of particulate matter affect geochemical indicator such as UK37 paleo-SST proxy. Based on UK37 index of sinking particles collected by time-series sediment traps in four stations as well as surface sediment samples in South China Sea (SCS), we attempt to explore the how geochemical parameter such as UK37 paleo-SST proxy affected by modern processes. Results show that sea surface temperature (SST) estimated by UK37 in settling particulate matter differs from the upper layer remote sensing temperature data in most cases and decoupling of particulate matter UK37 signals between upper and deep traps was also found in some cases. Coccolith living depth fluctuation in the euphotic zone could cause a lower estimated SST than remote SST, while advection of particle could cause an opposite effect. On the other hand, the variation of UK37 index during particle settling in the water column is unconspicuous, implying a weak effect of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) degradation on the estimation of UK37 temperature. Contemporary, the SST estimated by UK37 in surface sediment shows a good correlation with annual average temperature from upper layer in the SCS, suggesting a long term sediment record (decadal to millennial) may smooth the short term and local fluctuations of environment signals. In conclusion, although the UK37 index is a good proxy to study the paleotemperature of SCS, the study of modern processes are still of great significance.",

            "abstract": "The Mozambique Ridge (MozR), a supposed part of the South African Large Igneous Province (LIP) in the southwestern Indian Ocean, consists of four major geomorphological units associated with multiple phases of volcanic activity between 140 Ma and 120 Ma.\nHigh-resolution seismic reflection data collected in 2014 reveals various magmatic centres within each of the geomorphological units. Intra-basement reflections can be identified up to several hundred ms TWT below top of basement. These are interpreted to represent massive lava flow units, which are characteristic of oceanic plateau eruptions. Additionally to primary volcanic features associated with the initial formation of the different segments of the MozR we identify secondary volcanic features indicating magmatic reactivation after its initial build-up. The internal reflections generally dip away from their magmatic centres and individual reflectors are typically traced for 5-15 km. Several faults cutting through basement and older sedimentary units are interpreted as extensional tectonic features.\nOur observations hence provide further arguments for a LIP origin of the MozR. Still, this LIP obviously was subject to multiple magmatic and tectonic phases during its development, which we may relate with the opening of the South African gateway associated with Gondwana break-up and the separation of MozR from the conjugate parts of the proposed South African LIP. Further investigations will show whether more recent deformation can be traced back to further propagation of the East African Rift system.",

            "abstract": "Carbonaceous aerosols play an important role in air quality, human health and global climate change. Black Carbon (BC) can be considered the most efficient light absorber in the visible spectrum and is mainly found in the fine fraction of aerosol. Typically is emitted by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels related to traffic, industrial processes and biomass burning. São Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) with more than 19 million inhabitants, 7 million vehicles, as well as the major industrial and technological park of the country, has high concentrations of air pollutants, especially in the winter and vehicles are considered the principal source of particles emitted to the atmosphere. Since November 2014, Black Carbon and PM2.5 are being monitored using a MAAP (Multi Angle Absorption Photometer) Thermo 5012 and a Dust Trak DRX-8533 TSI in the East Campus of University of São Paulo, close to important highways and also to the largest airport of Brazil (Guarulhos Airport). Average BC concentration was 1.7 μg/m3 with some peaks above 17.0 μg/m3 and for PM2.5 average was 10.2 μg/m3. Particle concentrations reached values greater than the air quality standard (60 μg/m3) in the winter months. Winds coming from the East direction predominate. Traffic restrictions to heavy duty vehicles in the road-rings next to the sampling site during some hours of the day are the responsible for the daily BC and PM2.5 behavior (figure below), where high concentrations occur early in the morning and late at night, when heavy diesel vehicles are released for transit. Seasonal variations are different for BC and PM2.5 due to local sources of BC and meteorological conditions that have more influence on the particles. The weekly variation indicates that concentrations are lower on Sundays and higher from Tuesday to Thursday. Emission factors for BC were calculated based on traffic information.",

            "abstract": "The net primary productivity (NPP) is commonly used for understanding the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems and their role in carbon cycle. The global NPP, highly variable over space and time, cannot be directly observed; however, satellite based observations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are used as a proxy to understand and monitor the NPP dynamics. In this study, we used a combination of most recent NDVI dataset and modeled NPP (from TRENDY project) for the period 1982-2012, to study the role of terrestrial ecosystems in carbon cycle under the prevailing climate conditions. We found that 67% and 80% of the global land showed positive NDVI and NPP values, respectively, for this period. The global spatial trends of NPP and NDVI were consistent, and in general agreement; however, this consistency was more prominent regionally in Western Europe, Eurasia, Sahel region of Africa, India, and China. Generally, on temporal scale, both global NPP and NDVI showed a corresponding pattern of increase (decrease) for the duration of this study except, for few years (e.g. 1990 and 1995-98). Northern hemisphere showed higher NDVI and NPP increasing trends over time compared to Southern hemisphere. Overall, the results of this study suggest that NDVI was able to capture the broader pattern of vegetation production as estimated by the ecosystem models. This pattern was stronger in temperate and boreal regions compared to tropical and extra tropical regions.",

            "abstract": "Interaction between the solar wind and the dayside terrestrial magnetopause causes a transfer of energy and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. Consequently, a large scale circulation - the Dungey cycle - is set up in the magnetosphere. Since the magnetosphere is magnetically connected to the ionosphere, a corresponding circulation of plasma is also set up in the high-latitude ionosphere. Influences from external drivers, in particular the orientation of the radial component of the interplanetary magnetic field as well as daily and seasonal variations in the Earth's tilt angle are known to set up temporal north-south asymmetries in the magnetospheric and ionospheric plasma circulation. There are also persistent north-south asymmetries, which cannot easily be explained by the influence of external drivers. In this presentation, we show examples of such asymmetries in ionospheric convection and asymmetries in magnetospheric lobe density, presumably related to hemispheric asymmetries in ion outflow. We infer that these persistent asymmetries are mainly caused by differences in the strength and configuration of the geomagnetic field between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Since the ionosphere is magnetically connected to the magnetosphere, this difference will also be reflected in the magnetosphere in the form of different feedback from the two hemispheres.",

            "abstract": "Recovery of hydrocarbons by hydraulic fracturing depends on complex fluid-rock interactions that we are beginning to understand using neutron imaging and scattering techniques. Organic matter is often thought to comprise the majority of porosity in a shale. In this study, correlations between the type of organic matter embedded in a shale and porosity were investigated experimentally. Selected shale cores from the Eagle Ford and Marcellus formations were subjected to pyrolysis–gas chromatography, Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimetric analysis, and organic solvent extraction with the resulting affluent analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The pore size distribution of the microporosity (~1 nm to 2 µm) in the Eagle Ford shales was measured before and after solvent extraction using small angle neutron scattering. Organics representing mass fractions of between 0.1 to 1 wt.% were removed from the shales and porosity generally increased across the examined microporosity range, particularly at larger pore sizes, approximately 50 nm to 2 µm. This range reflects extraction of accessible organic material, including remaining gas molecules, bitumen, and kerogen derivatives, indicating where the larger amount of organic matter in shale is stored. An increase in porosity at smaller pore sizes, ~1-3 nm, was also present and could be indicative of extraction of organic material stored in the inter-particle spaces of clays. Additionally, a decrease in porosity after extraction for a sample was attributed to swelling of pores with solvent uptake. This occurred in a shale with high clay content and low thermal maturity. The extracted hydrocarbons were primarily paraffinic, although some breakdown of larger aromatic compounds was observed in toluene extractions. The amount of hydrocarbon extracted and an overall increase in porosity appeared to be primarily correlated with the clay percentage in the shale. This study complements fluid transport neutron imaging studies, to explain the physics and chemistry of fluid-rock behavior.\nResearch supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division and the Bredesen Center at the University of Tennessee.",

The objective of this study is to explore the dependencies of population to land management changes in Massili basin (2612 km²) located in central Burkina Faso. A set of three satellite scenes was acquired for the years 1990 (Landsat 7 ETM), 2002 (Landsat 7 ETM+) and 2013 (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS) from the Global Land Cover Facility’s (GLCF) website. Census data were provided by the National institute of statistics and demographic (INSD). The satellites images were classified using object-oriented classification method which was supported by historic maps and field data. Those were collected in order to allow for class definition, verification and accuracy assessments. Based on the developed land use maps, change analysis was carried out using post classification comparison in GIS. Finally, derived land use changes were compared with census data in order to explore links between population dynamics and the land use changes. It was found in 1990 that Massili watershed LULC was dominated by Tree/shrub savannah (69%, 1802.28 km2 ), Farm/Fallow was representing 22%, Gallery forest (4%), Settlement (3%), Barre soil (1%), Water bodies (1%). In 2002, the major landscape was Farm (54%). Tree/Shrub savannas were reduced to 36% while the Gallery Forest was decreased to1% of the basin area. The situation has also slightly changed in 2013 with an increase of the area devoted to farm/fallow and settlement at a rate of 3% and Gallery forest has increased to 4%. The changes in land use are in agreement with a notable increase in population. The analysis of census data showed that the number of inhabitants increased from 338 inhabitants per km2 in 1990 to 1150 inhabitants per km2 in 2013. As shown by statistical analysis (Kendall correlation tau=0.9), there is a close relation between both dynamics.",

To answer this question, an urban canopy model is integrated into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global climate and earth system models. In this study, the newly developed urban canopy model is coupled to a high-resolution, stretch-grid Atmospheric General Circulation model (AGCM) to investigating the hydroclimatic impacts of urbanization over the Continental United States (CONUS) with a resolution of ~8 km.

The comparisons are conducted over the conterminous United States (CONUS) at various spatial and temporal scales with respect to different precipitation intensities, and filtered with radar quality index (RQI) thresholds and precipitation types.\nPreliminary comparisons of Day-1 GPM products and Q3 are in reasonably good overall agreement. Based on the mission-to-date (expected to be March 2014 – November 2015) data from all GPM overpasses, the biases relative to Q3 for GMI and DPR precipitation estimates at 0.5o resolution are negative, whereas the biases for CMB precipitation estimates are positive. Based on all available data (March-July 2015 at this writing), the CONUS-averaged near-real-time IMERG Late Run hourly precipitation estimate is about 33% higher than MRMS. Detailed comparison results are available at http://wallops-prf.gsfc.nasa.gov/NMQ/.\nThis evaluation is carried out over the CONUS. Additional work is required to determine how applicable the results drawn from this land area might be to oceanic areas and regional land sites, as the precipitation error statistics can be highly regime dependent. Accordingly, the authors plan to conduct more comprehensive comparisons over a variety of regimes as GPM continues its mission.",

            "abstract": "Aseismic creep is found along several sections of major active faults at shallow depth, such as the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey, the San Andreas Fault in California (USA), the Longitudinal Valley Fault in Taiwan, the Haiyuan fault in China and the El Pilar Fault in Venezuela. Identifying the mechanisms controlling creep and their evolution with time and space represents a major challenge for predicting the mechanical evolution of active faults, the interplay between creep and earthquakes, and the link between short-term observations from geodesy and the geological setting.\nHence, studying the evolution of initial rock into damaged rock, then into gouge, is one of the key question for understanding the origin of fault creep. In order to address this question we collected samples from a dozen well-preserved fault outcrops along creeping and locked sections of the North Anatolian Fault. We used various methods such as microscopic and geological observations, EPMA, XRD analysis, combined with image processing, to characterize their mineralogy and strain.\nWe conclude that (1) there is a clear correlation between creep localization and gouge composition. The locked sections of the fault are mostly composed of massive limestone. The creeping sections comprises clay gouges with 40-80% low friction minerals such as smectite, saponite, kaolinite, that facilitates the creeping. (2) The fault gouge shows two main structures that evolve with displacement: anastomosing cleavage develop during the first stage of displacement; amplifying displacement leads to layering development oblique or sub-parallel to the fault. (3) We demonstrate that the fault gouge result from a progressive evolution of initial volcanic rocks including dissolution of soluble species that move at least partially toward the damage zones and alteration transformations by fluid flow that weaken the gouge and strengthen the damage zone.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is increasing temperatures and extending the growing season for many organisms. Shifts in phenology have been widely reported in response to global warming and have strong effects on ecosystem processes and greenhouse gas emissions. It is well understood that warming generally advances aboveground plant phenology, but the influence of temperature on root phenology is unclear. Most terrestrial biosphere models assume that root and shoot growth occur at the same time and are influenced by warming in the same way, but recent studies suggest that this may not be the case. Testing this assumption is particularly important in the Arctic where over 70% of plant biomass can be belowground and warming is happening faster than in other ecosystems. In 2013 and 2014 we examined the timing of root growth in the Arctic in plots that had been warmed or unwarmed for 10 years. We found that peak root growth occurred about one month before leaf growth, suggesting that spring root phenology is not controlled by carbon produced during spring photosynthesis. If root phenology is not controlled by photosynthate early in the season, earlier spring leaf growth may not cause earlier spring root growth. In support of this, we found that warming advanced spring leaf cover but did not significantly affect root phenology. Root growth was not significantly correlated with soil temperature and did not appear to be limited by near-freezing temperatures above the permafrost. These results suggest that although shoots are influenced by temperature, roots in this system may be more influenced by photosynthesis and carbon storage. Aboveground phenology, one of the most widely measured aspects of climate change, may not represent whole-plant phenology and may be a poor indicator of the timing of whole-plant carbon fluxes. Additionally, climate model assumptions that roots and shoots grow at the same time may need to be revised.",

            "abstract": "A defined periodicity in eruptive activity has been reported for different volcanoes. Lava lakes, for example are often characterized by periodic short-time scale fluctuations of the surface which has been termed “gas piston activity” (Swanson et al., 1971), as well as long-term periodical overturns. The latter have been also reported in extra-terrestrial volcanoes (e.g. Loki, Rathbun et al., 2002). This cyclic nature of volcanic eruptive activity, together with its characteristic time-scale, carries fundamental information on the degassing dynamics, and is thus more than worthy of further investigation. To this end, we have performed decompression experiments using Argon-saturated silicon oil, with viscosities of 10 to 1000 Pa s, as analogue for volatile-bearing mafic to intermediate magmas. The analogue samples were held to saturate in Argon in a shock tube for 72 hours, and then decompressed. In response to decompression, bubbles were nucleated and a foam layer developed at the top of the sample. Vigorous oscillations and periodical disruptions at the surface of the foam were observed, followed by foam restoration via bubble addition from below. This regime of periodical foam collapse and renewal was investigated through a monochromatic light-sensitive video camera. Also, in order to reconstruct the elastic energy due to the excitation mechanisms related to the foam collapse, 7 high-dynamic piezoelectric sensors (LDT Series, Measurement Specialties, Inc.) were distributed along of the shock tube. By tracking the flow front height trough time, joined with the observation of the micro-seismic signatures related to the foam disruption and growth, we were able to assess the time scale of foam collapse under dynamics conditions, and compare it to previous models (e.g. Proussevitch et al., 1993) and published data on natural cyclic phenomena in open conduit volcanoes. The laboratory investigation of bubbles coalescence and foam collapse in analogue materials represents a fundamental key step for unveiling the dynamics of magmatic fluids within the conduit, as well as a unique tool for understanding the time scale of eruptive activity at basaltic volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution stable isotope records combined with petrographic examination of stalagmite MA3 from Anjohibe Cave provide a better understanding of the climatically- and anthropogenically- induced ecosystem change in NW Madagascar between ca. AD 370 and 1210. The record suggests strong climatic control prior to ca. 700 and strong influence of human activities after ca. 920.\nPrior to 700, monsoonal rainfall and ecosystem change seem to respond to the change in the relative position of the ITCZ. This is inferred from the positive correlation between δ13C and δ18O and T anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere. A cooler NH pushed the ITCZ southward, thus favoring longer visits in northwestern Madagascar and strengthening the Malagasy monsoon. This offered favorable conditions to vegetation cover growth (the opposite was possible during warmer NH). The period between ca. 675 and 700 is the driest and might represent a period of abrupt change in vegetation cover as suggested by the stalagmite's petrography, smaller layer specific width, and greater values of both δ13C and δ18O. This drier period is followed by slight change in hydrology and a gradual recovery in vegetation in NW Madagascar, which lasted until ca. 920. This change is reflected in the decrease of stable isotope values and an increase in the layer specific width.\nSince ca. 920, the records suggest that the ecosystem change around the cave was controlled by something other than climate. The coincidence in time with human settlement and the gradual shift from lower to higher δ13C would suggest a strong involvement of human activities, particularly the practice of \"tavy\" or slash-and burn activities. This finding is important because Madagascar has experienced major ecological changes since the late Holocene, the cause of which has raised two hypotheses as to whether caused by severe climate change or by human activities. Deciphering the difference between human-induced and abrupt climatic changes has been challenged by the difficulty in recognizing cause-and-effect relationships in the paleorecords. This study has therefore helped in better understanding the main controls of ecosystem changes in Madagascar between ca. AD 370 and 1210, and we conclude that the strong evidence of human influence on the ecosystem change did not start until ca. 920.",

            "abstract": "We present a seismic tomography model of Greenland from surface wave analysis. Data from regional and teleseismic events with magnitude greater than Mw 5 and recorded over the last 15 years were used. In addition, in order to better constrain the crustal structure of Greenland, we also collected and analyzed two years (2013-2015) of ambient noise data. The empirical Green’s functions for all interstation paths were calculated by ambient noise cross-correlations. A frequency-time analysis technique is applied to measure the group velocity dispersion curves of the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave for periods ranging from 20 to 200 s for earthquake data and 10 to 50 s for ambient noise. In order to focus on the group velocity dispersions within the region of study, we used a global dispersion tomography model from Ekström et al. (2011) for the path outside of our region. Assuming an isotropic structure and using a generalized least-square approach, the dispersion curves are inverted to produce group velocity maps at several discrete periods. The results of the group velocity inversion are used to build localized dispersion curves in 1° by 1° cells. A Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is then applied to invert the localized curves and estimate shear wave velocity models of Greenland up to depths of 200 km where surface wave sensitivity to shear wave velocities is large. Detailed velocity models of Greenland’s lithospheric structure should help constrain the source of a high geothermal heat flux observed in northeast Greenland and provide valuable information about the geology within Greenland’s continental margin which has previously only been sparsely investigated. All the data are obtained from the GLISN and the GSN networks. We thank the operators of these stations for their open access to the data.",

            "abstract": "In this study we utilize U-series disequilibria measurements to investigate mineral fluid interactions and the role fractures play in the geochemical evolution of an analogue for a high level nuclear waste repository, the Nopal I uranium ore deposit. Samples of fracture-fill materials have been collected from a vertical drill core and surface fractures. High uranium concentrations in these materials (12-7700 ppm) indicate U mobility and transport from the deposit in the past. U concentrations generally decrease with horizontal distance away from the ore deposit but show no trend with depth.\nIsotopic activity ratios indicate a complicated geochemical evolution in terms of the timing and extent of actinide mobility, possibly due to changing environmental (redox) conditions over the history of the deposit. 234U/238U activity ratios are generally distinct from secular equilibrium and indicate some degree of open system U behavior during the past 1.2 Ma. However, calculated closed system 238U-234U-230Th model ages are generally >313 ka and >183 ka for the surface fracture and drill core samples respectively, suggesting closed system behavior for U and Th over this most recent time period. Whole rock isochrons drawn for the drill core samples show that at two of three depths fractures have remained closed with respect to U and Th mobility for >200 ka. However, open system behavior for U in the last 350 ka is suggested at 67 m depth. 231Pa/235U activity ratios within error of unity suggest closed system behavior for U and Pa for at least the past 185 ka. 226Ra/230Th activity ratios are typically <1 (0.7-1.2), suggesting recent (<8 ka) radium loss and mobility due to ongoing fluid flow in the fractures. Overall, the mainly closed system behavior of U-Th-Pa over the past ~200 ka provides one indicator of the geochemical immobility of these actinides over long time-scales for potential nuclear waste repositories sited in fractured, unsaturated tuff.",

The unsustainable use of groundwater resources in all three aquifer systems intensified from 2000 to 2008, making it imperative that we understand the consumptive processes and forces of demand that are driving their depletion. To this end, we quantify and track agricultural virtual groundwater transfers from these overexploited aquifer systems to their final destination. Specifically, we determine which US metropolitan areas, US states, and international export destinations are currently the largest consumers of these critical aquifers. We draw upon US government data on agricultural production, irrigation, and domestic food flows, as well as modeled estimates of agricultural virtual water contents to quantify domestic transfers. Additionally, we use US port-level trade data to trace international exports from these aquifers. In 2007, virtual groundwater transfers from the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifer systems totaled 17.93 km3, 9.18 km3, and 6.81 km3, respectively, which is comparable to the capacity of Lake Mead (35.7 km3), the largest surface reservoir in the United States. The vast majority (91%) of virtual groundwater transfers remains within the United States. Importantly, the cereals produced by these overexploited aquifers are critical to US food security (contributing 18.5% to domestic cereal supply). Notably, Japan relies upon cereals produced by these overexploited aquifers for 9.2% of its domestic cereal supply. These results highlight the need to understand the teleconnections between distant food demands and local agricultural water use.",

The liquid in many magma chambers, either the bulk magma or the interstitial liquid in the mushy regions, may convect, driven either thermally, due to cooling, or compositionally, due to fractional crystallization.\nWe have constructed a regime diagram of the possible convective modes in a system containing a basal mushy layer. These modes depend on the large-scale buoyancy forcing characterised by a global Rayleigh number and the proportion of the chamber height constituting the basal mushy region. We have tested this regime diagram using an analogue experimental system composed of a fluid layer overlying a pile of almost neutrally buoyant inert particles. Convection in this system is driven thermally, simulating magma convection above and within a porous cumulate pile. We observe a range of possible convective regimes, enabling us to produce a regime diagram. In addition to modes characterised by convection of the bulk and interstitial fluid, we also observe a series of regimes where the crystal pile is mobilised by fluid motions. These regimes feature saltation and scouring of the crystal pile by convection in the bulk fluid at moderate Rayleigh numbers, and large crystal-rich fountains at high Rayleigh numbers. For even larger Rayleigh numbers the entire crystal pile is mobilised in what we call the snowglobe regime.\nThe observed mobilisation regimes may be applicable to basaltic magma chambers. Plagioclase in basal cumulates crystallised from a dense magma may be a result of crystal mobilisation from a plagioclase-rich roof mush. Compositional convection within such a mush could result in disaggregation, enabling the buoyant plagioclase to be entrained in relatively dense descending liquid plumes and brought to the floor. The phenocryst load in porphyritic lavas is often interpreted as a disaggregated crystal mush. Such disaggregation may be caused by magma chamber replenishment, depending on the relative densities and temperatures of the resident and replenishing magma. If the new magma increases the Rayleigh number of either the bulk fluid or the fluid in the mushy layer, the resultant increased convective vigour may disaggregate the crystal pile.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic processes often exhume mantle peridotite to environments near the Earth’s surface, where serpentinization occurs and involves the hydration of peridotite at relatively low temperatures. This process oxidizes ferrous iron in olivine, which produces hydrogen (H2), creating environments that are conducive to abiotic synthesis of organic compounds and H2-based microbial communities. To understand better chemical and physical processes associated with serpentinization, two flow-through experiments (>30 days) were conducted at 150 and 200°C and 150 bar on intact dunite cores. Permeability decreased by a factor of 31 during the 200°C experiment, more than an order of magnitude larger than that at 150°C. Furthermore, H2 and methane concentrations exceeded 600 µmol/kg and 300 µmol/kg during the 200°C experiment, and were one and two orders of magnitude higher, respectively, than the 150°C experiment. H2 was primarily generated during the conversion of olivine to ferric serpentine at 200°C, since vibrating sample magnetometer analysis indicated little to no magnetite production. Secondary mineralization was identified on the core from this experiment, but X-ray computed tomography scans indicated little change. Furthermore, (ultra) small-angle neutron scattering datasets indicated that any change in nano-porosity and surface area was smaller than the natural variability of the dunite. Even though there was little evidence of alteration, the initial stage of serpentinization at 200°C was sufficient to produce a dramatic effect on flow fields in the core. Furthermore, this experiment generated significant dissolved H2 concentrations, while simulating open system dynamics. Thus, the experimental data provide insight on mass transfer processes in open geochemical systems, which effectively prevent highly elevated H2 concentrations due to continual loss. We speculate that this process is responsible for stabilizing unusually ferric-rich serpentine in nature.",

The model simulations are compared against a comprehensive data set on ozone from soundings, MOZAIC aircraft data, and surface observations. Detailed modeling studies that enable an understanding of the impact of emission (particularly NOx) on tropospheric ozone are evaluated for the period of 15 years (2000-2014), when emissions were increasing rapidly. Modeling runs were conducted with emissions removed, emissions included, and emissions scaled by certain factors to study the sensitivity of ozone abundances to emissions from various regions of interest.",

Macnae (1979) writes that “In one large survey in South Africa, electromagnetic (EM) techniques have proven to be remarkably effective in detecting the presence of weathered clays or epiclastic kimberlite contained within the pipes.”\nFull tensor AMT data were acquired at 65 points (stations) in a 3D configuration with frequencies ranging from 10kHz to 1Hz. The survey was located in the NW portion of the Mato Grosso state, Brazil, in na area of thick jungle coverage.\nDuring the AMT survey, few outcrops were seen because of the dense forest cover. Usually, the occurrences found were of sand deposits, indicating the occurence of Fazenda Casa Branca and Utiariti Formations and gravel from Salto das Nuvens Formation, widely used in paving trails n this region.\nIn the area of the survey, three main targets were confirmed/identified:\nKimberlite Area 1 - a classic kimberlite in the region, with the crater facies with different clasts and distinct size. We noted the occurrence of a red-brown soil and an unusual vegetation in this area. The resistivity model provided confirmed the presence of Kimberlite Area 1 and was used to identify other two areas.\nArea of Interest 1 - area with atypical vegetation along a trail. There is an excavation that displays soil of white color with several blocks present, there are small quartz crystal agglomerates in these blocks. The resistivity model cleary shows a conductive body here, indicative of the presence of a kimberlite.\nArea of Interest 2 - the presence of a kimberlite was confirmed, not exactly where the targeted Area 2 was, but the southwest of it. Close to this area, there was a very fine rock and a few blocks of pure silica, probably indicating a kimberlitic intrusion.\nIn summary, the 3D resistivity model in depth obtained from inversion of the AMT data confirmed and identified three targets for kimberlites quickly and at a low cost, in na otherwise region of difficult logistics due to the dense jungle cover and remote location.",

Polar prominence eruptions and coronal mass ejections have also been found to be important indicators of the time of polarity reversal. While these indicators are present in the current cycle, significant differences are found regarding the phase lag between the two hemispheres and the duration of polar eruptions.

            "abstract": "A prominent feature of recent climatic change is the strong Arctic surface warming that is contemporaneous with broad cooling over much of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Longer global surface temperature observations suggest that this contrasting pole-to-pole change could be a manifestation of a multi-decadal interhemispheric or bipolar seesaw pattern, which is well correlated with the North Atlantic sea surface temperature variability, and thus generally hypothesized to originate from Atlantic meridional overturning circulation oscillations. Here, we show that there is an atmospheric origin for this seesaw pattern. The results indicate that the Southern Ocean surface cooling (warming) associated with the seesaw pattern is attributable to the strengthening (weakening) of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, which can be traced to Northern Hemisphere and tropical tropospheric warming (cooling). Antarctic ozone depletion has been suggested to be an important driving force behind the recently observed increase in the Southern Hemisphere’s summer westerly winds; our results imply that Northern Hemisphere and tropical warming may have played a triggering role at an stage earlier than the first detectable Antarctic ozone depletion, and enhanced Antarctic ozone depletion through decreasing the lower stratospheric temperature.",

This Edition 4 product will replace the CERES Edition 3 ISCCP-like products. The major improvements between these two products are the new geostationary (GEO) 4-channel cloud retrievals, which are consistent with the MODIS, and provide both day and nighttime retrievals. The cloud retrievals include the standard ISCCP parameters of, cloud fraction, effective cloud pressure, temperature, optical depth and LWP/IWP. CERES also includes particle sizes, cloud emissivity, and cloud top parameters. The GEO cloud properties will be retrieved hourly, whereas for Edition 3 the properties were retrieved every 3-hours. The CldTypHist product will provide users 1° latitude by 1° longitude gridded monthly day/night 1-hourly cloud properties as a function of cloud type. The Terra (10:30 AM) and Aqua (1:30PM) MODIS cloud properties will supersede the GEO when available. Monthly means will also be computed from monthly hourly cloud-type means. It is anticipated that when 15 years of CldTypHist product are processed, that the regional cloud type parameters will provide new insight on the impact of clouds on the Earth’s radiation budget and improve cloud parameterizations for climate modelers.\nThis study will examine cloud property variations, between day and night, between land and ocean, among the five ocean basins, the five continents, ITCZ, Tibet, and Arctic. Also studied would be the correlation between skin temperature and cloud type amounts, and the correlations between cloud temperature and cloud optical depth over these regions.",

We present statistical studies of both the high-latitude ionospheric convection and the upper thermospheric circulation patterns obtained over almost a full solar cycle during the first decade of this century by measurements of the electron drift instrument (EDI) on board the Cluster satellites and by the accelerometer on board the CHAMP spacecraft, respectively. The asymmetries are attributed to the non-dipolar portions of the Earth's magnetic field that constitute hemispheric differences in magnetic flux densities, different offsets of the invariant geomagnetic poles, and generally in different field configurations of both hemispheres. Seasonal and solar cycle effects of the asymmetries are considered and first trials to explain the effects by numerical modeling are presented.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed the slip distributions of ~30 large continental earthquakes for which the long-term propagation of the causative faults is known. The lengthening of faults over their long-term growth induces systematic changes of their structural maturity along their length. We find that, independent of where ruptures nucleated on the faults, largest earthquake slips systematically occurred on the most mature parts of the broken fault sections, whereas coseismic slip systematically tapered linearly over most of the rupture length in the direction of long-term fault propagation, i.e., decreasing maturity. Also, ruptures systematically propagated faster, up to supershear, along the most mature parts of the broken sections. We suggest that earthquake slip asymmetry and rupture acceleration are mainly governed by along-strike changes in fault zone strength, due to evolution of fault segmentation and off-fault damage with increasing maturity. The generic location of largest coseismic slip in the most mature part of a rupture zone is likely a static effect, resulting from the intimate elasto-static relation between stress drop, slip and elastic modulus of the faulted medium; even if stress drop is constant over the rupture, the strong reduction of elastic modulus in the zone of most intense damage off- the most mature fault section leads to significantly larger slip. Additionally, the pinning of fault slip by inter-segments decreases in direction of increasing maturity. The faster rupture speeds along the most mature rupture parts show that earthquake dynamics is also influenced by along-strike changes of fault maturity. The enhancement of rupture speed is likely due to interactions between rupture and trapped waves in the damage zone. Since the direction(s) of long-term fault propagation can generally be determined from geological evidence, it should be possible to anticipate in which direction earthquake slip will increase and accelerate, and possibly become a Big One.",

With these first-ever measurements of GCR fluxes on the Martian surface, RAD can be used as a monitor for heliospheric modulation at Mars location, similar to neutron monitors at Earth. We do this by first correlating the GCR dose rate measurements at Mars and solar modulations at Earth when there is a good magnetic connection between the two planets. With the thus obtained correlation we obtain an empirical function for the dependence of the modulation parameter at Mars on RAD dose rate. This function can in turn help to calibrate the heliospheric modulation at Mars throughout the MSL/RAD mission period. The resulting solar modulation at Mars and at Earth over three years (>1000 sols) is then compared. In order to verify our 'prediction' method, we use the local modulation parameter at Mars as an input for Badhwar O'Neil model providing the primary spectra for PLANETOCOSMIC simulations which eventually model the surface particle spectra that can be compared with RAD measurements of the spectra.",

The results from fixed-resolution (15 km) and variable-resolution (ranging from 60 km to 15 km) 10-day forecasts will be compared, with a focus on the East Pacific in 2014 domain because of its high-level of TC activity. In the variable-resolution MPAS, the 15-km mesh covers the region from the Central Pacific to Central America. It will be shown that the variable-resolution MPAS performed nearly as well as the uniform resolution over the Eastern Pacific basin. Both produced track forecasts of comparable quality to the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS). Forecasts over the tropical East Pacific revealed only slowly growing differences between uniform and variable resolution through day 7. The results collectively indicate that variable resolution global simulations represent an efficient way to produce basin-scale TC forecasts while still including upscale TC influences on the global circulation. In addition, we will show improvements in TC genesis and intensity statistics introduced by changes to physical parameterizations for forecasts performed during the 2015 Northern Hemisphere TC season (August-October).",

            "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the large uncertainties in predictions of climate impact of linear contrails stem from inadequate parametrization of contrails in GCMs. But, the parameter space on which contrail dynamics and optical properties depend is very large and spanning it using high fidelity LES is prohibitively expensive. This study leverages the large dataset of LES done so far to understand the most important physical process that governs the evolution of contrails in different stages of its life and proposes a simple, low-cost and robust ODE model to capture the evolution of quantities of interest such as ice mass, vortex downwash and contrail cross-sectional dimensions. A direct consequence of modeling the contrail using parameters impacting the most important physical process is the reduction of the original parameter space to only those groupings of parameters that impact linear contrails independently. We are able to capture the most prominent features of the contrail at every stage of the life of the contrail - the induction of the jet exhaust by the trailing vortex pair, the vortex downwash and eventual destruction and the subsequent spreading of the contrail by ambient turbulence. A simplified version of GATOR-GCMOM - a GCM - is initialized using inputs from the new ODE model to test if the inclusion of the impact of the aforementioned parameter groups has significant persistent effects. Results from the GATOR-GCMOM box model calculations show which parameter groupings show persistent effects.",

            "abstract": "Municipalities, engineering consultants and State agencies use reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data (directly and indirectly) for long-term water planning, for designing hydraulic structures, and for establishing regulatory guidance and conservation programs intended to reduce water waste. The use ETo data for agricultural and landscape irrigation scheduling is becoming more common in Texas as ETo-based controllers and automation technologies become more affordable. Until recently, most ETo data has been available as monthly values averaged over many years. Today, automated weather stations and irrigation controllers equipped with specialized instrumentation allow for real-time ETo measurements. With the expected rise in global warming and increased frequency of extreme climate variability in the coming decades, conservation and efficient use of water resources is essential and must make use of the most accurate and representative data available. 2011 marked the driest year on record in the State of Texas. Compounding the lack of rainfall was record heat during the Summer of 2011. An analysis of real time ETo (reference evapotranspiration) data in Texas found that ET was 30 to 50% higher than historic averages during the 2011 Summer. The implications are quite serious, as most current water planning and drought contingency plans do not take into consideration increases in ET during such periods, and irrigation planning and capacity sizing are based on historic averages of consumptive use. This paper examines the relationship between ET and climate during this extreme climatic event. While the solar radiation was near normal levels, temperature and wind was much higher and dew points much lower than norms. The variability and statistical difference between average monthly ETo data and daily, monthly and seasonal ETo measurements (from 2006 to 2014) for selected weather stations of the Texas ET Network. This study will also examine the suitability of using average ETo rates for use in regional water planning and in irrigation scheduling.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous ice nucleation (HIN) remains one of the outstanding problems in cloud physics and atmospheric science. Experimental challenges in properly simulating HIN processes with relevant atmospheric conditions have largely contributed to the absence of a consistent and comprehensive parameterization. Here we formulate a new ice active surface site-based stochastic model of HIN with the unique feature of invoking a continuum assumption on the ice nucleation activity (contact angle) of an aerosol particle’s surface. The result is a particle specific property g that defines a distribution of local surface ice nucleation rates. Upon integration this yields a full freezing probability function for an ice nucleating particle. Current cold plate droplet freezing measurements provide a great resource for studying the freezing ability of many atmospheric aerosol systems. A method based on statistical significance and critical area analysis is presented that can resolve the two-dimensional nature of the ice nucleation ability of aerosol particles: variability in active sites and freezing rates along an individual particle’s surface, as well as variability between two particles of the same type in an aerosol population. When applied to published experimental data, the method demonstrates its ability to comprehensively interpret droplet freezing spectra of variable particle mass and surface area concentrations. By fitting the high concentration freezing curves to a statistically significant active site density function, the lower concentration freezing curves are successfully fitted via a process of random sampling from the statistically significant distribution. Using the new scheme, comprehensive parameterizations that can track the frozen fraction of cloud droplets in larger atmospheric models are derived.",

The flare loop system exhibits a double candle-flame configuration in SDO/AIA’s hot passbands, sharing a much larger cusp-shaped structure. The results of DEM analysis show that each candle flame has a similar temperature distribution as the famous Tsuneta flare. STEREO-A provides us a view from directly above the flare, and in SECCHI/EUVI 195 Å the post-flare loops are observed to propagate eastward. We performed a 3D reconstruction of the pos-flare loops with AIA and EUVI data. With the aid of the squashing factor Q based on a potential extrapolation of the photospheric field, we recognized that the footpoints of the post-flare loops were slipping along high-Q lines on the photosphere, and the reconstructed loops share similarity with the filed lines that are traced starting from the high-Q lines. The heights of the loops increase as they slip horizontally eastward, giving the loop-top a velocity of about 10 km/s. An extremely large EUV late phase in Fe XVI 33.5 nm observed by SDO/EVE is suggested to be related to the slipping magnetic reconnection occurring in the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) whose photosheric footprints are featured by the high-Q lines.",

CATE was selected in the initial NASA Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) solicitation in the Fall of 2013, and the experiment flight campaign was in July 2014. The experiment studied collisions between different particle populations at low velocities (sub-m/s) in a vacuum and microgravity to gain insight into processes in the protoplanetary disk and planetary ring systems. Faculty provided the experiment concept and key experiment design parameters, and the student team developed the detailed hardware design for all components, manufactured and tested hardware, operated the experiment in flight, and analyzed data post-flight. Students also developed and led an active social media campaign and education and public outreach campaign to engage local high school students in the project. The ability to follow an experiment through from conception to flight was a key benefit for undergraduate students whose available time for projects such as this is frequently limited to their junior and senior years. Key factors for success of the program included having an existing laboratory infrastructure and experience in developing flight payloads and an intrinsically simple experiment concept. Students were highly motivated, in part, by their sense of technical and scientific ownership of the project, and this engagement was key to the project’s success.",

            "abstract": "In seawater, we find that the complexation of the intermediate manganese oxidation state, dissolved Mn(III), is kinetically stabilized by organic ligands in diverse environments. The cycling of these complexes is also tightly coupled to the cycles of C, O, N, S, and Fe. In the suboxic porewaters of the St. Lawrence Estuary (2011 (1), 2014 (here)), Mn(III)-L complexes made up to 100 % of total dissolved Mn (dMn(T)). The porewaters were dominated by weak complexes in lower and upper estuary porewaters (35 ppt salinity), whereas in the Saguenay Fjord (30 ppt salinity), weak (logKcond=11.1-11.6) and strong (logKcond>13.6) Mn(III)-L complexes were found in the same sample, which were kinetically stable to reduction - even in the presence of excess soluble Fe(II). The site at the Saguenay fjord likely has more terrestrial influence, and potentially different Mn(III)-L binding ligands than in the more oceanic samples. Overlying waters at both sites indicate that dMn(T) is fluxing out of the sediments, and all water column samples contained strong Mn(III)-L complexes (up to 86% of dMn(T)). Laboratory tests show that strong terrestrial Mn(III)-L complexes can precipitate at pH<2, and so previous dMn(T) assays in such environments, involving an acidification step, may have omitted an important fraction of dMn(T). These findings present the first measurement of two Mn(III)-binding ligand classes in the same water mass, and indicate that Mn(III)-L complexes have diverse and varying reactivity. We will discuss the implication of fluxing Mn(III)-L complexes from sediments to the overlying water column, in the St. Lawrence system compared to our data from the Chesapeake Bay (2013 (2), 2014 (here)) where strong Mn(III)-L complexes made up to 50 % of total dissolved Mn (dMn(T)) in anoxic bottom waters, and were partially kinetically stable to sulfide reduction.\n1.

            "abstract": "Interactions between geologic features and a mobile substrate layer are present in several passive margin locations throughout the world. Deformation of a substrate layer is primarily due to differential loading of sediment and results in complexities within the morphology and subsequently the stratigraphic record. By using simplified scaled tank experiments, we investigated the relationship between substrate deformation and fan evolution in a fluvial-dump-wind-redistribution setting. In this system, sediment is being eroded from a mountain range and creating terminal fans; fluvial channels form off of the fan body and the deposited fluvial sediment is the source for an aeolian dune field. Several past experimental studies have focused on how deltas and dunes are affected on when deposited on a salt substrate, however terminal fans and channel formation off of fans have not been thoroughly investigated. The current experiments focused on which variables are the most significant in controlling fan growth, channel initiation and channel behavior on the salt substrate.\nOur experimental basin is 120 cm long, 60 cm wide and 30 cm tall. The materials used for a suite of five experiments involved a polymer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the deformable substrate analog and 100-μm quartz sand. By isolating certain variables such as substrate thickness, basin slope and sediment discharge we are able to see how terminal fans and channels are affected in different settings. The experimental results show that 1) increase in substrate thickness increased the amount of subsidence around the fan body, limiting sediment transport to channels off of the toe of the fan, 2) a higher basin slope increased the number of channels formed and increased sinuosity and width variations of channels over distance, and 3) a higher sediment discharge rate on a thin substrate allowed for the farthest downstream fan deposits. Preliminary results show that channel behavior and fan morphology is strongly dependent on substrate thickness and basin slope directly influences channel geometry. These findings will also be compared to the Mojave River Wash located in southern California off the San Bernardino Mountains near Zzyzx, CA to further understand the dynamics of terminal fans on a mobile substrate.",

In this paper, we present a revised, time-dependent picture of the substorm current wedge that follows its evolution from the initial substorm flows through substorm expansion and recovery. We describe the updated ionospheric current closure, which is far more complicated than the original picture, as well as an updated magnetospheric portion that includes two sets of field-aligned currents.

Even, number of numerical models has been used for inundation mapping effort, evaluation of critical structures, etc. without validation and verification. After 2004, NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) established standards for the validation and verification of tsunami numerical models (Synolakis et al. 2008 Pure Appl. Geophys. 165, 2197-2228), which will be used evaluation of critical structures such as nuclear power plants against tsunami attack. NCTR presented analytical, experimental and field benchmark problems aimed to estimate maximum runup and accepted widely by the community. Recently, benchmark problems were suggested by the US National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program Mapping & Modeling Benchmarking Workshop: Tsunami Currents on February 9-10, 2015 at Portland, Oregon, USA (\nhttp://nws.weather.gov/nthmp/index.html\n). These benchmark problems concentrated toward validation and verification of tsunami numerical models on tsunami currents. Three of the benchmark problems were: current measurement of the Japan 2011 tsunami in Hilo Harbor, Hawaii, USA and in Tauranga Harbor, New Zealand, and single long-period wave propagating onto a small-scale experimental model of the town of Seaside, Oregon, USA. These benchmark problems were implemented in the Community Modeling Interface for Tsunamis (ComMIT) (Titov et al. 2011 Pure Appl. Geophys. 168, 2121-2131), which is a user-friendly interface to the validated and verified Method of Splitting Tsunami (MOST) (Titov and Synolakis 1995 J. Waterw. Port Coastal Ocean Eng. 121, 308-316) model and is developed by NCTR. The modeling results are compared with the required benchmark data, providing good agreements and results are discussed.\nAcknowledgment: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning is a major source of atmospheric aerosol and greenhouse gases that substantially influence climate and regional air quality. However, the accuracy of biomass burning emissions estimated using traditional method is limited by large uncertainties in burned area and fuel loading. Alternatively, fire radiative energy (FRE) has recently been demonstrated to be linearly related to biomass combustion, which potentially improves the estimation of biomass burning emissions. The FRE-based combustion rate is 0.368-0.453 kg/MJ according to field controlled experiments while it varies from 1.37-4.5 kg/MJ derived from satellite-based bottom-up and top-down aerosol optical thickness estimates. Here we investigate the FRE combustion rate in over 1000 burn scars from 2011 to 2012 across the Continental United States (CONUS). Specifically, FRE was calculated by combining the high spatial observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the high temporal observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Biomass consumption in burn scars was modeled using Landsat TM 30m burn severities, 30m fuel loading from Fuel Characteristic Classification System, and combustion completeness compiled from recent literatures. The combustion rate was then investigated by correlating FRE to biomass consumption across CONUS and Bailey’s ecoregions. Our results show that the combustion rate can be extracted from the linear relationship between biomass consumption and FRE. The combustion rate is 0.415±10% kg/MJ across CONUS, which is similar to the rate derived from field experiments. However, it varies from 0.18-1.9 kg/MJ among ecoregions. This implies that a single combustion rate could produce large uncertainty in the estimation of biomass consumption at large scales. We suggest that ecoregion specified combustion rates should help to improve the accuracy of quantifying biomass burning emissions regionally and globally.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory’s (MSL) ChemCam spectrometer has been measuring atmospheric aerosol properties and gas abundances for more than one Martian year, doing so by operating in passive mode and observing scattered sky light at two different elevation angles. We perform these observations at 1 – 2 week intervals, occasionally acquiring multiple observations on a given day to assess the diurnal cycle. Six parameters are retrieved from each observation: dust aerosol particle effective radius, ice aerosol particle effective radius, the fraction of opacity contributed by ice rather than dust aerosol, the ratio of aerosol extinction scale height to gas pressure scale height (as a parameterization of the aerosol vertical profile), the O2 volume mixing ratio, and the water vapor column abundance (in precipitable microns).\nThe retrieval works by first constructing a ratio of the spectra from the two elevation angles and then fitting a discrete ordinates multiple scattering radiative transfer model. Total column opacity, CO2 mixing ratio, and atmospheric pressure are exogenous inputs. They are sourced from Mastcam, SAM QMS, and REMS measurements, respectively. An important feature of our procedure, which we have verified by numerical experimentation, is that the retrieved gas abundances have negligible sensitivity to the accuracy of the aerosol parameter solutions or to exogenous inputs or to a wide range of model assumptions.\nWe will present a survey of the results from the extensive ChemCam passive sky data set, including comparisons to related SAM and REMS in-situ atmospheric sampling and to Mastcam and Navcam sky observation campaigns. We will show that O2 has temporal variation unexplained by existing photochemical models and has vertical variations within the bottom 10 km of the atmosphere in some seasons. We will also show the water vapor is well mixed within the bottom 10 km in some seasons but not in others, and we will address a variety of aerosol phenomena.",

A serious of disastrous weather such as sandstorm, haze, and floods become the focus of public. Take an example of the impact on natural ecosystems, firstly, human are over-dependence on the supply services provided by ecosystem, especially the grain, fibers, forest and so on, resulting other ecosystem services decline. Secondly, the raising artificial ecosystems lead to the simplification of system structure and function. End up with environment pollution and habitat fragmentation, which endanger human well-being.\nEcosystem Services Welfare Index was introduced into this study. Evaluating the sustainable development level of regional ecology and society by calculating the efficiency of per unit ecosystem services consumption contributes to the human welfare. Welfare is the degree of human satisfaction, including not only the economic level, but also the education, health, and housing. This study will select the human development index (HDI) as the representation of human welfare, and ecosystem services footprint index (ESFI) presenting the ecosystem services consumption. According the results, 31 province in China could be divided into several different type, \"high development- low efficiency- high consumption\", \"low development - high efficiency- low consumption\" and \"low development- high efficiency- low consumption\", which could be evidence for decision makers.",

            "abstract": "The silicic peralkaline volcanoes of the East African Rift are some of the least studied and yet potentially most dangerous volcanoes in the world. We present the first detailed account of the eruptive history of Aluto, a restless silicic volcano located in the Main Ethiopian Rift, using new constraints from fieldwork, remote sensing, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and geochemistry. Prior to the growth of the Aluto volcanic complex (before 500 ka) the region was characterized by a significant period of fault development and mafic fissure eruptions. The earliest volcanism at Aluto built up a trachytic complex over 8 km in diameter. Aluto then underwent large-volume ignimbrite eruptions at ca. 300 ka developing a ~42 km2 collapse structure. After a hiatus of ~250 kyr, a phase of post-caldera volcanism began. Since ca. 60 ka, highly-evolved peralkaline rhyolite lavas, ignimbrites and pumice fall deposits have erupted from vents across the complex. The age of the youngest volcanism is not well known. Geochemical modelling is consistent with rhyolite genesis from protracted fractionation (>80 %) of typical ‘rift basalt’. Based on the field stratigraphy and the number, style and volume of recent eruptions we suggest that silicic eruptions occur at an average rate of 1 per 1000 years, and that future eruptions of Aluto will involve explosive emplacement of localised pumice cones and effusive obsidian coulees of volumes between 1–100 × 106 m3. Comparisons with other caldera volcanoes in this section of the rift suggest that there may be parallels between Aluto’s behaviour and that of other volcanic centres, both in terms of the volcanic ‘lifecycle’, and broad timings of caldera collapse events.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice has exhibited a rapid reduction and large fluctuations during recent decades in conjunction with a warming climate. To identify sea ice impacts on extratropical storm tracks and associated surface climate, we employed the NCAR’s Community Atmosphere Model to conduct a suite of sensitivity experiments, in which the model is solely forced with observed time-varying sea-ice concentration from 1979 to 2008. A storm identification and tracking algorithm was applied for analyzing variability of and changes in storm activities simulated by the model. The results show that reduced sea-ice cover enhances Arctic storm activity and increases warm moist air advection into the Arctic. As a consequence, Arctic surface air temperature (SAT) throughout the year and precipitation in spring, summer and fall seasons increase. By contrast, storm activity weakens and anticyclones strengthen over Eurasia. The strengthened anticyclones lead to a decrease in cloud cover, precipitation and SATs in both fall and winter seasons. These findings also suggest that Arctic sea ice not only impacts local, but also lower latitude weathers and climate.",

            "abstract": "Textural studies of pyroclasts have shown that both degassed, crystal-rich magma, and gas-rich, crystal-poor magma may be ejected by a single strombolian explosion. Furthermore, some pyroclasts contain both magma types, intermingled. These pyroclasts have been interpreted as evidence of the presence of a plug of degassed, crystal-rich – and therefore high-viscosity – magma at the top of the volcanic conduit, overlying gas-rich, crystal-poor, low-viscosity magma. Analogue experiments have indicated that the presence of a viscous plug increases the vigour of strombolian explosions by enhancing the build-up of overpressure in the gas slug that drives them.\nThe purported plug material has a higher density, as well as a higher viscosity, than the magma that underlies it. Consequently, the configuration is expected to be unstable, and the plug and underlying magma should convectively overturn. Does this mean that a viscous plug is an ephemeral feature? Or can a plug persist for long periods as a dynamic feature, which is continually created at the same rate at which it is convectively consumed? We conduct laboratory analogue experiments to investigate the formation and maintenance of a viscous plug. We drive thermal convection of a range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian magma analogue fluids in a 20cm diameter vertical pipe by heating the bottom, and cooling the top. The fluids have strongly temperature dependent rheology; both rheology and driving buoyancy are scaled to the volcanic scenario. We present preliminary results which characterize the spatial distribution of viscosity, density and velocity. We find that the hotter, lower-viscosity fluid ascends the core of the pipe, whilst the cooler, higher-viscosity fluid descends in an outer annulus. The upper region, in which the flow reverses direction, constitutes a dynamic plug.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of atmospheric and climate state variables provide the ultimate constraint on highly complex and uncertain model simulations. It is assumed that extensive and accurate measurements will enable a reduction in model uncertainty, although this is rarely demonstrated rigorously. Here we attempt to reduce the uncertainty in the aerosol-cloud forcing, one of the largest uncertainties in historical forcing of climate, by constraining a global model using idealised aerosol measurements. We show that the modelled forcing is poorly constrained compared to modelled aerosol because the aerosol measurements constrain only the relationships between multiple compensating parameters rather than individual parameter values. Although aerosol concentrations and aerosol-cloud forcing are controlled by the same parameters, the relationships between these parameters can be very different for the two quantities. Thus, much of the multi-dimensional aerosol-cloud forcing parameter space remains unconstrained. Our results show that while matching model state to observations is a necessary condition of model evaluation, it is not sufficient to constrain aerosol cloud forcing and process-oriented evaluation is also needed to constrain the model parameter values. We demonstrate how a sensitivity analysis of the model being constrained can identify the key compensating processes that require more detailed evaluation if uncertainty in aerosol-cloud forcing is to be further reduced.",

            "abstract": "Disturbances profoundly alter the structure and function of forests, imposing long lasting carbon legacies and strongly influencing rates of terrestrial carbon exchange with the atmosphere. Disturbance legacies vary across ecoregions, by forest types, and with disturbance severity and type. The complexity presents a significant challenge for observing and modeling carbon exchange, and hinders assessments of current and likely future states of the global carbon cycle. We demonstrate how carbon legacies vary following harvest, fire and bark beetle for forests in Pacific Norwest (PNW) United States, and how these processes influence carbon stocks and fluxes at pixel and regional scales. This study involves the use of satellite and aerial remote sensing products to characterize the frequency and severity of fire, harvest and insects over the past three decades. We use forest inventory data (FIA) to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for harvest, fire and bark beetle disturbances of varying severity across forest types and site productivity. We infer forest stand age and associated uncertainty based on maps of aboveground biomass, disturbance and forest types derived from remote sensing data, as well as carbon stock trajectories and stand productivity map derived from FIA. We then apply the group of carbon flux trajectories to the forest stand age map throughout the study area. Finally, we summarize the net carbon uptake as a consequence of disturbance and regrowth at pixel and regional scales. As such, this study represents a first demonstration of a spatially explicit assessment of carbon stock and flux responses to disturbances by linking remote sensing disturbance products, biomass maps and forest inventory data in a carbon cycle modeling framework. The methodology will be further applied across the conterminous US to provide a comprehensive forest carbon budget assessment.",

            "abstract": "Aquifers are under stress worldwide as a result of large imbalances between inflows and outflows. These imbalances are particularly severe in aquifers in semi-arid regions that are heavily pumped for irrigation, such as the High Plains aquifer (HPA) in the United States. The water resources community has responded by placing an increasing emphasis on more sustainable management plans. To aid in the formulation of such plans, we have developed a simple, water-balance-based approach for rapid assessment of the impact of proposed management actions and the prospects for aquifer sustainability. This theoretically sound approach is particularly well suited for assessing the short- to medium-term (years to a few decades) response to management actions in seasonably pumped aquifers. The net inflow (capture) term of the aquifer water balance can also be directly calculated from water-level and water-use data with this approach. Application to the data-rich portion of the HPA in the state of Kansas reveals that practically achievable reductions in annual pumping would have a large impact. For example, a 22% reduction in average annual water use would have stabilized areally averaged water levels across northwest Kansas from 1996 to 2013 because of larger-than-expected and near-constant net inflows. Whether this is a short-term phenomenon or a path to long-term sustainability, however, has yet to be determined. Water resources managers are often in a quandary about the most effective use of scarce funds for data collection in support of aquifer assessment and management activities. This work demonstrates that a strong emphasis should be placed on collection of reliable water-use data; greater resources devoted to direct measurement of pumping will yield deeper insights into an aquifer's future. The Kansas HPA is similar to many other regional aquifers supporting critically needed agricultural production, so this approach should prove of value far beyond the borders of Kansas.",

In this study, the performance of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) rainfall products was evaluated against hourly rain gauge network in warm season over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The study revealed that IMERG successfully captured the spatial pattern of gauged-based rainfall values in warm period at both plateau and river basin scales. Over the whole plateau, the south and center part primarily suffered from positive bias, while negative bias was mainly detected in the east and north. Although the correlation between IMERG and gauge data was a litter scattered spatially, their correlation coefficients increased gradually from 0.69 to 0.73 among hourly to daily periods. River-basin uncertainties were characterized by an underestimate in the Yellow river basin (-6.7%), and an overestimate both in the Brahumaputra (+18.4%) and Yangtze river (+9.6%) basins. In addition, there was generally an overestimate within the occurrence of heavy rainfall events, particularly at higher elevation sites. The probability of detection (POD) exhibited an appreciable elevational dependence, trending toward higher values as elevation increased. Also, the IMERG rainfall product reasonably well detected the onset, mature, and end of the Indian monsoon over the TP, where some moisture surge events were not detected by sparse rain gauge observations. Overall, this study provides meaningful guidance about the error characteristics associated with IMERG rainfall estimates and potential values for IMERG algorithm improvements over the complex and high TP area.",

Total column ozone from the OMPS nadir mapper is very consistent with ozone from the NOAA 19 SBUV/2 but with an offset of +1.9%. For the purpose of trend analysis a simple correction will be applied to make the mapper data consistent with the long term data record.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane is the second anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, with a 20% contribution to climate forcing since pre-industrial times. With a lifetime around 10 years in the atmosphere and a diversity of emission types, methane is an important target for climate change mitigation. Observations of atmospheric methane began in 1978, reached global coverage after 1983, and now include a large variety of in-situ and remote-sensed observations from the surface or from space. These data are assimilated in atmospheric inversion to infer methane emissions and sinks (top-down). In parallel, a large international effort is conducted to model processes (bottom-up) emitting methane at the surface (e.g. wetland emissions) or destroying methane in the atmosphere (e.g. OH radicals).\nAlthough sources and sinks of methane are identified, large uncertainties remain in their spatio-temporal quantification. Here, we present a synthesis of global and regional methane emissions and sinks since 2000 using an integrated approach to combine: atmospheric measurements, chemistry-transport models, ecosystem models, emission inventories, and climate-chemistry models. Robust and not robust emission estimates are extracted and presented from an ensemble of atmospheric inversions and of process-based models. The three most striking results imply :\n- a probable overestimation of Chinese methane emission and trend since 2000,\n- a mostly tropical origin (75%) of emission changes from 2005 to 2010,\n- a balanced (but still uncertain) partition of emission changes, between 2005 and 2010, between natural (wetlands) and anthropogenic (agriculture & waste, coal, biomass burning) emissions.",

            "abstract": "The western Pacific water enters into the Timor Sea (tropical Indian Ocean) by the thermohaline conveyor belt, and this region is under the influence of the SW monsoon. The higher precipitation during the monsoon rains lower the surface salinity in the north-eastern Indian Ocean towards the Bay of Bengal; whereas, the Arabian Sea remains highly saline due to higher evaporation in the region surrounding Arabian deserts. The salinity contrast in the northern Indian Ocean is very unique, and the radiolarian micro-zooplanktons living in the surface water serve a very good proxy for the monsoonal changes in the surface sea-water temperature (SST) and salinity in the geological past. We studied radiolarian faunal variation in the core MD01-2378, located at ~13oS and ~121oE (1783 m water depth), at the inlet of the thermohaline circulation into the Timor Sea. We applied the modern radiolarian based artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Gupta and Malmgren, 2009) to derive the SST and salinity during August-October for the last 140 ka (the full last glacial cycle). Based on the mean estimates of the 10 ANNs, the root mean square error in prediction (RMSEP) for SST is ~1.4oC with correlation between observed and estimated values r=0.98 (Gupta and Malmgren, 2009). Similarly, the RMSEP is 0.3 psu (r=0.94) for the salinity estimates. We derived paleo-SSTs and salinity values using modern radiolarian ANNs and the fossil radiolarian data generated from the core for the last 140-ka (Fig.1). The age model of the core is based on δ18O benthic oxygen isotope stratigraphy and 21 AMS 14C ages up to ~30-ka (Holbourn et al., 2005). Paleo SST-summer varied between 22-28.5oC, and it is in very good agreement with the δ18O benthic record of Holbourn et al. (2005) defining the Last Glacial Maximum (~24 ka) and the Eemian (~125 ka) stages. The salinity fluctuated between 34-35 psu, and compared well with oxygen isotope record representing the LGM and Eemian periods. We gratefully acknowledge Prof. Ann Holbourn (Keil Univ. Germany) for providing the core samples, AMS 14C dates and oxygen isotope data of the core.",

            "abstract": "This research investigates the impact of wildfires on watershed flow regimes throughout the western United States, specifically focusing on evaluation of fire events within specified subregions and determination of the impact of climate and geophysical variables in post-fire flow response. Fire events were collected through federal and state-level databases and streamflow data were collected from U.S. Geological Survey stream gages. 263 watersheds were identified with at least 10 years of continuous pre-fire daily streamflow records and 5 years of continuous post-fire daily flow records. For each watershed, percent changes in runoff ratio (RO), annual seven day low-flows (7Q2) and annual seven day high-flows (7Q10) were calculated from pre- to post-fire. Numerous independent variables were identified for each watershed and fire event, including topographic, land cover, climate, burn severity, and soils data. The national watersheds were divided into five regions through K-clustering and a lasso linear regression model, applying the Leave-One-Out calibration method, was calculated for each region. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) was used to determine the accuracy of the resulting models. The regions encompassing the United States along and west of the Rocky Mountains, excluding the coastal watersheds, produced the most accurate linear models. The Pacific coast region models produced poor and inconsistent results, indicating that the regions need to be further subdivided. Presently, RO and HF response variables appear to be more easily modeled than LF. Results of linear regression modeling showed varying importance of watershed and fire event variables, with conflicting correlation between land cover types and soil types by region. The addition of further independent variables and constriction of current variables based on correlation indicators is ongoing and should allow for more accurate linear regression modeling.",

            "abstract": "The upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will detect water bodies and measure water surface elevation throughout the globe. Within its continental high resolution mask, SWOT is expected to deliver measurements of river width, water elevation and slope of rivers wider than ~50 m. The definition of river reaches is an integral step of the computation of discharge based on SWOT’s observables. As poorly defined reaches can negatively affect the accuracy of discharge estimations, we seek strategies to break up rivers into physically meaningful sections. In the present work, we investigate how accurately we can classify water surface profiles based on simulated SWOT observations. We assume that most river sections can be classified as either M1 (mild slope, with depth larger than the normal depth), or A1 (adverse slope with depth larger than the critical depth). This assumption allows the classification to be based solely on the second derivative of water surface profiles, with convex profiles being classified as A1 and concave profiles as M1. We consider a HEC-RAS model of the Sacramento River as a representation of the true state of the river. We employ the SWOT instrument simulator to generate a synthetic pass of the river, which includes our best estimates of height measurement noise and geolocation errors. We process the resulting point cloud of water surface heights with the RiverObs package, which delineates the river center line and draws the water surface profile. Next, we identify inflection points in the water surface profile and classify the sections between the inflection points. Finally, we compare our limited classification of simulated SWOT-derived water surface profile to the “exact” classification of the modeled Sacramento River. With this exercise, we expect to determine if SWOT observations can be used to find inflection points in water surface profiles, which would bring knowledge of flow regimes into the definition of river reaches.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies on the long term evolution of large and low slope mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers showed that 1) alluvial-bedrock and bedrock-alluvial transitions can be stable features in fluvial systems, and 2) the morphodynamics of these transitions depend on the magnitude of the bedrock slope Sb relative to the alluvial equilibrium slope Sa. These studies, however, were performed for the case of uniform bed material and they did not provide any information on the longitudinal sorting patterns that can be expected in the mixed bedrock-alluvial reaches. We thus derived and implemented a one-dimensional mathematical formulation that is able to model bedload transport, erosion and deposition of non-uniform material in mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers. Our numerical results reveal that a stable M2 backwater curve is associated with an alluvial-bedrock transition and a pattern of downstream fining, while a stable pattern of downstream coarsening forms and stabilizes in the presence of an M1 backwater curve and the associated bedrock-alluvial transition. Our numerical model is based on a rather simplifying assumption to compute bedload transport in the mixed bedrock-alluvial reach: we multiply the bedload transport capacity of the flow for the alluvial cover fraction of the reach. Further, the alluvial cover fraction of the reach is assumed to be a linear function of the average local bed elevation. To validate our bedload formulation in the mixed bedrock-alluvial reach we are performing laboratory experiments at the University of South Carolina with non-uniform material in the sand range. The experiments are currently in progress in a 20 cm wide, 8 m long and 0.9 m deep sediment feed flume. We present the laboratory scale validation of the bedload transport model and the comparison between the numerical results and experimental data at mobile bed equilibrium for the experiments with alluvial-bedrock and bedrock-alluvial transitions.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) over the Indian Ocean is directly connected with circulation, winds, precipitation, humidity, etc. over India. Increased SSTs are a major consequence of climate change driven largely by anthropogenic factors. Recent literature points to weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon possibly because of decreased land-sea temperature gradient due to faster rate of warming of the oceans compared to land regions. We examine changes in the SST over the Indian Ocean using two observational datasets; HadISST (v1.1) and ERSST (v3b). Based on trend differences between two time periods (1979-2009 and 1948-1978) we identify four regions in the Indian Ocean with different signatures of change - Bay of Bengal (BOB), Arabian Sea (AS), Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), and Southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO).\nWe first quantify the extent to which the SST trends over multiple time-scales (20, 30, 50 and 100-years) are outside of the range expected from internal variability of the climate system. We make use of output data from long control run simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 (CMIP5) database in order to estimate the contribution of external forcings to the observed trends. Using optimal fingerprint Detection and Attribution methods we quantify the contributions of various natural and anthropogenic forcings by making use of the suite of experiments (piControl, historical, historicalNat, historicalAnt, historicalGHG, and historicalAA) from CMIP5 are used in this study. We will also address the question of what drives the observed weakening of land-ocean temperature gradients.",

            "abstract": "Snow accumulations on the ground are an important source of water in many parts of the world. Mapping the accumulation, usually represented as the snow water equivalent (SWE), is valuable for water resource management. The longest record of regional and global maps of SWE are from orbiting microwave radiometers, which do not directly measure SWE but rather measure the scatter darkening from the snow pack. Robustly linking the scatter darkening to SWE eludes us to this day, in part because the snow pack is highly variable in both time and space. The data needed is currently collected by hand in \"snow pits,\" and the labor-intensive process limits the size of the data sets that can be obtained. In particular, time series measurements are only a one or two samples per day at best, and come at the expense of spatial sampling.\nWe report on the development of a low-power wireless device that can be embedded within a snow pack to report on some of the critical parameters needed to understand scatter darkening. The device autonomously logs temperature, the microwave dielectric constant and infrared backscatter local to the device. The microwave dielectric constant reveals the snow density and the presence of liquid water, while the infrared backscatter measurement, together with the density measurement, reveals a characteristic grain size of the snow pack. The devices are made to be inexpensive (less than $200 in parts each) and easily replicated, so that many can be deployed to monitor variations vertically and horizontally in the snow pack. The low-power operation is important both for longevity of observations as well as insuring minimal anomalous metamorphism of the snow pack. The hardware required for the microwave measurement is intended for wireless communications, and this feature will soon be implemented for near real-time monitoring of snow conditions.\nWe will report on the design, construction and initial deployment of about 30 of these devices in northern lower Michigan, and, data permitting, on the measurements that these novel devices have acquired.",

            "abstract": "Ebullition is an important pathway for methane (CH4) to the atmosphere in wetlands. Water level changes have been suggested to trigger ebullition, especially in tidally flooding areas. Bubble transport in submerged sediments results from a multi-phase, dynamic interaction between gaseous and solid phases under the modulation of a liquid phase. To improve understanding of how cyclic ebbing and flooding tides trigger ebullition events, a continuous dynamic dual-chamber system was designed and installed in a non-vegetated mudflat site of an estuarine temperate marsh. Episodic sharp increases in methane concentration signaling ebullition events were primarily observed during ebbing tides (15 events of total 19 events) and occasionally during flooding tides (four events). Laboratory chamber measurements on a mud monolith from the site confirmed that the flooding tide could trigger ebullition releases of gas bubbles. We developed a conceptual sediment fracturing model associated with bubble expansion to unify these observations, arguing that decreases in water level lower the effective stress surrounding isolated gas bubbles and enable trapped bubbles to move upwards via bubble expansion and fracturing of overlying sediments. Increases in relative permittivity measured on the monolith with ground penetrating radar suggest that more water may invade macropores during the initial stage of flooding; subsequent matrix expansion under lowered effective stress then leads to fracture propagation and bubble release. Melting of the surface frozen layer during the spring thaw resulted in increases of methane concentration, comparable in strength to the ebullition fluxes which were associated with large fluctuations in water level around spring tides. Our findings demonstrate the importance of water level changes in triggering ebullition from non-vegetated mudflat areas in tidal wetlands, modulated by the mechanical properties of shallow, soft sediments.",

            "abstract": "The Sea of Marmara is located between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to which it is connected with the İstanbul (Bosporus) and Çanakkale (Dardanelles) straits having sill depths of 35 and 65 m below the present sea level, respectively. It is presently characterized by a two-way flow system consisting of the upper Black Sea and lower Mediterranean waters separated with a permanent halocline at -25 m.\nA 28.88 m long RV Marion Dufresne core MD01-2430 from the western high provides a continuous stratigraphic record for the last ca 70 ka. This record shows only one lacustrine-marine transition at ~ 12.6 cal ka BP over this period, indicating that the Sea of Marmara was under lacustrine conditions disconnected from the Mediterranean Sea from the beginning of Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS-4) to the early MIS-1. Soon after the reconnection, the Marmara sapropel started depositing under dysoxic-suboxic conditions during 12.33-5.7 cal ka BP.\nThe periods of high inorganic (carbonate) and organic carbon production and burial in the Sea of Marmara correlate very closely with the Greenland Intertadials (GI) recorded in the NGRIP oxygen isotope and Black Sea Ca data sets. The two partly overlapping Ca peaks in the Sea of Marmara record corresponding to ~12.6 cal ka BP and 14.5 cal ka BP represent the authigenic carbonate deposition that resulted from the mixing of lacustrine Marmara and saline Mediterranean waters during the latest marine reconnection and the Greenland Interstadial-1 (GI-1) high productivity period, respectively. Low δ18O (down to -9‰) and high δ13C (+2.4‰) values of bulk carbonate during the GIs strongly suggest high input of fresh waters from the Black Sea and high organic productivity in the lacustrine Marmara under warm and humid conditions. Low “carbonate-free” K concentrations during the GIs suggest low detrital input in the Marmara “Lake”, which in turn indicates low erosion rates in the catchment with a high vegetation density. In contrast, the highest detrital input occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and deglaciation (22-15 ka BP) under cold-dry and low lake level conditions.",

            "abstract": "Refractory inclusions in meteorites show evidence for fractionation of refractory lithophile elements relative to one another. For bulk planetary materials, it is most often assumed that refractory lithophile elements (e.g., Ca, Al, Ti, REEs) are in proportions similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites, which is taken to be a proxy for solar composition. A diagnostic feature of REE patterns in refractory inclusions in meteorites is the presence of thulium anomalies, arising from the fact that this heavy REE is more volatile than the highly refractory HREEs surrounding it (Tm/Tm* is defined relative to either Er-Yb or Er-Lu). Tm anomalies thus represent an excellent diagnostic tool to test the assumption that refractory lithophile elements have uniform relative abundances at a bulk planetary scale. Prior to this work, high precision Tm measurements were lacking because it is mono-isotopic and as such is not amenable to high-precision single spike measurements. We have developed a multi-collector REE abundance measurement technique to measure all REEs at high precision, including the mono-isotopic ones. This technique was used to revise the abundance of CI and PAAS REE abundances (Pourmand et al. 2012) and the CI composition agrees well with an independent study (Barrat et al. 2012). The same technique was applied to measure REE patterns in 41 chondrites as well as terrestrial rocks (Dauphas and Pourmand, 2015). Our results reveal the presence of Tm anomalies of about -4.5 % in terrestrial rocks, enstatite and ordinary chondrites, relative to carbonaceous chondrites including CIs. This demonstrates that the assumption that refractory lithophile elements are in constant proportions among planetary bodies is unwarranted. It also shows that carbonaceous chondrites cannot be a major constituent of the Earth. The presence of Tm anomalies in meteorites and terrestrial rocks suggests that either (i) the material in the inner part of the solar system was formed from a gas reservoir that had been depleted in refractory dust or (ii) CI are enriched in refractory dust and are not representative of solar composition for refractory elements.\nBarrat J.A. et al.

Atmospheric chemical fields are simulated by WRF-CMAQ (horizontal resolution: 12km × 12km), applying the dynamical downscaling technique from a global climate-chemistry model under the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario (RCP 8.5). Future air quality results predict that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration will decrease nationwide, especially in the eastern US and west coast. However, the ozone concentration is projected to decrease in the Eastern US but increase in the Western US. Future mortality is assessed under two scenarios (1) holding future population and baseline incidence rate at the present level and (2) using the projected baseline incidence rate and population in 2050. For PM2.5, the entire continental US presents a decreasing trend of PM2.5-related mortality by the 2050s in Scenario (1), primarily resulting from the emissions reduction. While in Scenario (2), almost half of the continental states show a rising tendency of PM2.5-related mortality, due to the dominant influence of population growth. In particular, the highest PM2.5-related deaths and the biggest discrepancy between present and future PM2.5-related deaths will both occur in California in 2050s. For the ozone-related premature mortality, the simulation shows nation-wide rising tendency in 2050s under both two scenarios, mainly due to the projected increase of methane, ozone concentration and population.",

To this end, real-time flood forecasting and satellite-based detection systems have been developed at global scale. However, due to the limited availability of up-to-date ground observations, the reliability of these systems for real-time applications have not been assessed in large parts of the globe. In this study, we performed comparative evaluations of the commonly used satellite-based global flood detections and operational flood forecasting system using 10 major flood cases reported over three years (2012-2014). Specially, we assessed the flood detection capabilities of the near real-time global flood maps from the Global Flood Detection System (GFDS), and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the operational forecasts from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) for the major flood events recorded in global flood databases. We present the evaluation results of the global flood detection and forecasting systems in terms of correctly indicating the reported flood events and highlight the exiting limitations of each system. Finally, we propose possible ways forward to improve the reliability of large scale flood monitoring tools.",

            "abstract": "The magnetohydrodynamics of stars and planetary cores is usually dominated by the overwhelming importance of rotation compared to other forces. Under these conditions the fluid motions are characterized by a strong invariance along the rotation axis. In the presence of a background magnetic field, magnetohydrodynamic oscillations can be triggered. Among these, of particular interest are the torsional waves, azimuthal perturbations of the fluid that are axisymmetric and invariant along the vertical direction. Their periods depend solely on the intensity of the magnetic field component aligned with the radial direction of propagation.\nAs the detection of the fundamental period could constrain the magnetic field intensity in the Earth’s outer core there is a long history of attempted detection of torsional waves from geomagnetic data. There is however a fundamental lack of knowledge concerning the propagation and reflection properties of these waves, as observational studies suggests behaviors that are different from theoretical expectations. In particular, recent findings (Gillet et al., 2011) suggest the lack of reflection at the equator and at the rotation axis.\nThrough numerical simulation and analytical techniques we analyze the temporal evolution of diffusionless torsional waves in spherical geometry, with particular attention on the reflection at the equator and the pseudo-reflection at the rotation axis. We develop a novel analytical solution to the torsional wave eigenvalue problem whose behavior at the boundaries helps us to illustrate the meaning of the boundary conditions. Furthermore we find that for any acceptable magnetic background field, reflections at both boundaries are allowed and we illustrate how the WKBJ approximation is an efficient tool for investigating them.",

            "abstract": "The quality of atmospheric forcing plays important role on land surface simulation using decoupled land surface modeling system. In the present study, the influence of the various atmospheric forcing parameters on land surface simulation is assessed through sensitivity experiments. Numerical experiments are conducted towards preparation of land surface analysis for the period Jan-2011 - Dec-2013 using offline 2D-Noah land surface model (LSM) based land data assimilation system (LDAS) over Indian region (5 - 39N, 60 - 100E) hereafter referred as LDASI. The surface temperature, specific humidity, horizontal winds and pressure as atmospheric forcing parameters are derived from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). The downward (solar and thermal) radiation and precipitation is obtained from European Centre for Medium Range Forecast (ECMWF) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) respectively. The sensitivity experiments are conducted by introducing perturbation in one atmospheric forcing parameter at a time keeping the other parameters unchanged. Influence of temperature, specific humidity, downward (shortwave and long wave) radiation, rain-rate and wind speed is investigated by conducted 13 numerical experiments. It is observed that the land surface analysis from LDASI is most sensitive to the downward longwave radiation and least sensitive to wind speed. The analysis is also substantially influenced by the surface air temperature. The annual mean soil moisture at 5 cm is decreased by 12-15% if the downward long-wave radiation is increased by 20% and it is increased by 15% if the downward long-wave radiation is decreased by 20%. The influence is even more in the Himalayan region but the increase in long-wave radiation leads to increase in soil moisture and similar influence on decrease because downward long-wave radiation leads glacier melting. The annual mean soil temperature in the analysis is increased by 2.2 K if surface air temperature is increased by 1%. The soil temperature is also increased by about 1.8 K in over Indian landmass and 2.8 K over Pakistan if long wave radiation is increased by 20%. The land surface heterogeneity in both soil temperature and moisture is dominated by annual rainfall distribution over the region.",

In this work we investigate the influence of fire on O3 abundances over the contiguous United States. Using co-located observations of particulate matter (PM2.5) and the National Weather Service Hazard Mapping System smoke data, we identify summertime days between 2005 and 2014 that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) O3 monitors are influenced by smoke. We then compare O3 mixing ratio distributions for smoke-free and smoke-impacted days for each O3 monitor. We observe that the mean O3 abundance measured on smoke-impacted days is higher than on smoke-free days. The magnitude of the effect varies by location with a range of 0 to 37 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). We find that smoke is present on a non-negligible proportion of days when the 8-hour average O3 mixing ratio exceeds the EPA limit of 75 ppbv in regions and locations with significant O3 issues, including the Northeast urban corridor, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Kansas City. Most U.S. cities maintain a similar proportion of smoke-impacted exceedence days when they are held against a more stringent limit of 65 ppbv for an 8-hour average. We show that smoke-impacted O3 mixing ratios are most elevated in U.S. cities with the highest emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX).",

Adverse health effects resulting from urban pollution exposure are dependent on proximity to emission sources and atmospheric mixing, necessitating models with high spatial and temporal resolution. As urban emission sources co-emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and criteria pollutants (CAPs), efforts to reduce specific pollutants would synergistically reduce others.\nWe present emissions inventories and modeled concentrations for CO2 and CAPs: carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and sulfur oxides (SOx) for Salt Lake County, Utah. We compare the resulting concentrations against stationary and mobile measurement data and present a systematic quantification of uncertainties.\nThe emissions inventory for CO2 is based on the Hestia emissions data inventory that resolves emissions at an hourly, building and road link resolution as well as hourly gridded emissions with a 0.002o x 0.002o spatial resolution. Two methods for deriving criteria pollutant emission inventories were compared. One was constructed using methods similar to Hestia but downscales total emissions based on the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The other used Emission Modeling Clearinghouse spatial and temporal surrogates to downscale the NEI data from annual and county-level resolution to hourly and 0.002o x 0.002o grid cells. The gridded emissions from both criteria pollutant methods were compared against the Hestia CO2 gridded data to characterize spatial similarities and differences between them. Correlations were calculated at multiple scales of aggregation.\nThe CALPUFF dispersion model was used to transport emissions and estimate air pollutant concentrations at an hourly 0.002o x 0.002o resolution. The resulting concentrations were spatially compared in the same manner as the emissions. Modeled results were compared against stationary measurements and from equipment mounted atop a light rail car in the Salt Lake City area. The comparison between both approaches to emissions estimation and resulting concentrations highlights spatial locations and hours of high variability and uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 50 years, connections between climate change and streamflow trends have been observed in many regions of the Western US. However, much of the work to detect climate change signals in historical hydrologic records has focused on surface water changes in relatively undeveloped basins. While this is necessary to isolate any climate change signal from uncertain water management operations, it also excludes interactions with the concurrent human development that has occurred over the last 100 years. In highly utilized groundwater systems, such as the High Plains Aquifer, groundwater mining has already been linked to streamflow depletions at local to regional scales; but no prior studies have evaluated the role of groundwater declines in historical changes of groundwater surface water interactions at the continental scale. Here we isolate the influence of groundwater depletions from water management operations (e.g. irrigation and surface water diversions) to systematically evaluate how subsurface storage losses alter large-scale hydrologic interactions. Using a fully integrated groundwater surface water model of the contiguous US we simulate dynamic equilibrium conditions of a predevelopment system and a system with groundwater depletions equivalent to all of the groundwater development of the 20th century. Results illustrate the effect of persistent drawdown on streamflows, recharge and groundwater surface water exchanges across many spatial scales. In addition, we run transient simulations to evaluate the effect of these shifts on seasonal surface water variability. Simulations demonstrate the widespread trends in groundwater surface water interactions that have already resulted from ubiquitous groundwater mining in the United States and the potential for such changes to influence future response to climate variability.",

            "abstract": "The diffusive flux of greenhouse gases can be considered as a two-step process: dissolved gases must be brought to the air-water interface and they must subsequently be transported across it. Internal waves are ubiquitous features in aquatic ecosystems. Via internal wave induced upwelling, dissolved gases can directly reach surface waters and their breaking, combined with eddies from cooling, can deliver them to the interface. Whether turbulence is greater near the air-water interface during periods with convective cooling or surface heating with high frequency near-surface internal waves is an unsettled question. Using data from time series temperature and oxygen arrays and turbulence computed from temperature-gradient microstructure profilers, we provide examples of fluxes from these processes in a tropical reservoir, a floodplain lake, a temperate lake during fall cooling, and an arctic lake at ice off and subsequent stratification.",

            "abstract": "The Himalaya is the result of on-going convergence and collision of India and Asia. Knowledge of the configuration of the Indian plate prior to collision with Asia is often over-looked, despite its importance in controlling the subsequent evolution of the orogen. Three fault-bounded northeast-trending paleotopographic ridges of Precambrian Indian basement underlie the Ganga Basin south of the Himalaya. Analysis of spectrally filtered Bouguer gravity data and edges in its horizontal gradient at different source depths suggests that they extend as far north as the underplated Indian lithosphere beneath the Asia crust (Bagong suture), and as deep as the base of the Indian lithosphere. Along-strike diachronous deformation and metamorphism within the Himalayan metamorphic core in west-central Nepal, documented by U-Th/Pb geochronology, as well as lateral ramps in the foreland thrust belt, spatially correspond to faults in the Indian basement bounding the subsurface Faizabad ridge.\nAnalogue centrifuge modeling confirms that offset along such deep-seated basement faults can affect the location, orientation, and type of structures developed in the mid- and upper crust at various stages of orogenesis. Our models suggest that (1) deep-seated, reactivated basement faults can localize structures in the upper crust during different stages of orogen evolution, and (2) it is mechanically feasible for movement along a basement fault to influence the mid- and upper crust and for strain to propagate through a low-viscosity medium.\nWe suggest that these major orogenic cross-strike structures may have affected the ramp-flat geometry of the basal Main Himalayan thrust, in turn partition the Himalayan range into distinct zones, and ultimately contribute to lateral variability in tectonic evolution along the orogen’s strike. Our interpretation also suggests that south Tibet graben are spatially related to deep-seated lithospheric-scale faults rooted in the underplated Indian crust.",

The melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, for example, induces changes in the crustal stress field, which could result in the activation of existing faults and the generation of destructive earthquakes. Such glacially induced earthquakes are known to have occurred in Fennoscandia 10,000 years ago. Within a new project (“Glacially induced earthquakes in Greenland”, start in October 2015), we will analyse the potential for glacially induced earthquakes in Greenland due to the ongoing melting. The objectives include the development of a three-dimensional (3D) subsurface model of Greenland, which is based on geologic, geophysical and geodetic datasets, and which also fulfils the boundary conditions of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling. Here we will present an overview of the project, including the most recently available datasets and the methodologies needed for model construction and the simulation of GIA induced earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "We examined deformation microstructures of an analog two-phase system of the lower mantle using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Halite (NaCl) and neighborite (NaMgF3) were used as analogs to lower mantle minerals ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O and bridgmanite MgSiO3, respectively, and deformed to 30% strain at 4 GPa in the D-DIA. We have adapted techniques previously used for EBSD preparation of halite (NaCl) (e.g. Pennock et al. 2002, Journal of Microscopy, v205; Staiger et al. 2010, Materials Characterization, v61) to prepare halite and neighborite for EBSD. Because halite is soft and hydrophilic, it is tricky to prepare for high quality EBSD. On the other hand, neighborite is much harder than halite (with a bulk modulus 5 times that of halite) and requires high quality polishing for longer and through various polishing-medium sizes. EBSD maps were obtained by polishing with very fine colloidal alumina, followed by etching or a final polish in a precision ion polishing system (PIPS).\nDistribution of phases, grain size and shape, and crystallographic preferred orientation were examined to determine which phase controls the deformation and which deformation mechanisms dominate. Preliminary results show the softer halite is likely interconnected at just 25 volume % or less and controls the deformation through a mechanism that does not promote development of crystallographic preferred orientation. This suggests that periclase may control deformation in the lower mantle resulting in a weaker, more viscous lower mantle and may help to explain why the bulk of the lower mantle is mostly isotropic.",

Scenarios of global change have been incorporated in all NCAs to date, although such scenarios have typically been developed late in the assessment cycle, limiting the depth of their use in regional and sectoral assessments. This lack of use is particularly notable for scenarios focused on aspects other than climate and associated projections of temperature and precipitation. Here, we review how scenarios have been incorporated in previous NCAs and present potential options for both the development and inclusion of a wider range of scenarios topics in future quadrennial NCA reports and other sustained assessment activities within USGCRP and federal agencies. Incorporating a broad range of U.S. scenarios will present both intellectual and programmatic challenges, as scenario developers from relatively disparate communities will need to come together to create internally consistent assumptions within each type of scenario (e.g. climate, land cover and land use, population) for sub-national scales. As USGCRP moves forward with a sustained assessment process, a richer set of scenarios can serve as a bridge between the research community, decision makers, and practitioners.",

Kauri preserve well in anoxic swamp and wetland environments in the lowlands across Northland and buried, subfossil samples of this species are commonly termed ‘swamp kauri’. Subfossil kauri have been recently employed as a proxy to reconstruct past climate and establish a long dendrochronological records that have direct use for building the radiocarbon calibration curve. One component of work related to interpreting ancient kauri tree ring records is improving the understanding of the stratigraphic and geomorphic history of former lowland kauri environments to outline the role of environmental change in preserving this ancient wood resource.\nThis study contributes to improving general understanding the subsurface stratigraphy of former lowland swamp kauri sites. A combination of ground penetrating radar, sediment cores, probing transects and trench exposures, provide details for the stratigraphic relationships for one type of swamp kauri site –relic coastal dune sequences- that will form a basis for future sediment and geochemistry work. Based on GPR and trenches, the stratigraphy includes several units –Peat, woody debris, dune sand, and coastal sand. Thickness of the peat, which usually contains the subfossil kauri, varies from thin veneers over antecedent coastal deposits 10-50cm to > 2.2m, with the thickest peat accumulation located between relic foredune ridges.\nPrior work at locations nearby have shown Rotoehu Tephra (>45ka) has been observed as a 40 cm thick deposit. Early sedimentary analysis suggests the Rotoehu is present at our study site, but it is possibly disseminated and bioturbation may have mixed the tephra into the underlying peat sediments. OSL samples and peat sediment samples were recovered for future chemical and chronological analysis from selected locations based on GPR and trench sections.",

            "abstract": "Heavy ions (Z>4) observed near 1 AU, especially in fast solar wind, tend to have thermal speeds that are approximately equal, indicative of a mass proportional temperature. The fact that these heavy ions have similar thermal speeds implies that they have very different temperatures, and furthermore, that they are far from thermal equilibrium. By comparing the observed heavy ion temperatures amongst species with different mass and charge values we can critically evaluate heating theories for the solar wind.\nUtilizing improved data processing techniques, results from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) are used to analyze the thermal properties of the heavy ion population at 1 AU. We have shown in previous work that Coulomb Collisional relaxation has a significant effect on these heavy ion populations, and now we investigate how Coulomb Collisions effect the observed temperature ratios of different heavy ion species. We observe that the heavy ion to proton temperature ratio scales with the mass and charge values of species analyzed. These dependencies are compared to current heating theories to determine which best explains the observations. The results of this work are valuable for comparison with coronal spectroscopic observations of ion temperatures, existing solar wind observations at different distances from the Sun, and for predictions of the environment to be encountered by Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.",

            "abstract": "Using carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a promising technology for emissions management because CO2-EOR can dramatically reduce carbon sequestration costs in the absence of greenhouse gas emissions policies that include incentives for carbon capture and storage. This study develops a multi-scale approach to perform CO2 accounting and risk analysis for understanding CO2 storage potential within an EOR environment at the Farnsworth Unit of the Anadarko Basin in northern Texas. A set of geostatistical-based Monte Carlo simulations of CO2-oil-water flow and transport in the Marrow formation are conducted for global sensitivity and statistical analysis of the major risk metrics: CO2 injection rate, CO2 first breakthrough time, CO2 production rate, cumulative net CO2 storage, cumulative oil and CH4 production, and water injection and production rates. A global sensitivity analysis indicates that reservoir permeability, porosity, and thickness are the major intrinsic reservoir parameters that control net CO2 injection/storage and oil/CH4 recovery rates. The well spacing (the distance between the injection and production wells) and the sequence of alternating CO2 and water injection are the major operational parameters for designing an effective five-spot CO2-EOR pattern. The response surface analysis shows that net CO2 injection rate increases with the increasing reservoir thickness, permeability, and porosity. The oil/CH4 production rates are positively correlated to reservoir permeability, porosity and thickness, but negatively correlated to the initial water saturation. The mean and confidence intervals are estimated for quantifying the uncertainty ranges of the risk metrics. The results from this study provide useful insights for understanding the CO2 storage potential and the corresponding risks of commercial-scale CO2-EOR fields.",

            "abstract": "While few dispute the significance of within-canopy sources or sinks of reactive gaseous and particulate compounds, their estimation continues to be the subject of active research and debate. Reactive species undergo turbulent dispersion within an inhomogeneous flow field, and may be subjected to chemical, biological and/or physical deposition, emissions or transformations on leaves, woody elements, and the forest floor. This system involves chemical reactions and biological processes with multiple time scales and represents the terrestrial ecosystem’s exposure to nutrient and acid deposition and atmospheric oxidants. The quantification of these processes is a first step in better understanding the ecological impact of air pollution and feedback to atmospheric composition. Hence, it follows that direct measurements of sources or sinks is difficult to conduct in the presence of all these processes. However, mean scalar concentration profiles measured within the canopy can be used to infer the profile distribution of effective sinks and sources if the flow field is known. This is commonly referred to as the ‘inverse problem’. In-canopy and above-canopy multi-level concentration measurements of reactive nitrogen compounds (ammonia, nitric acid, nitrous acid), as well as other compounds that are highly reactive to ammonia and its secondary products (hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide), are presented within a deciduous second-growth 180 year old oak-hickory forest situated within the Southeastern U.S. Two different approaches are used to solve for the source-sink distribution from the measured mean scalar concentration profiles: (1) an Eulerian high-order closure model that solves the scalar flux budget equation and (2) a new Lagrangian stochastic model that estimates the dispersion matrix. As each of these methods is subject to different assumptions, the combination of the two can be used to constrain the solution to the inverse problem and permit inference on the fate of reactive compounds within forested vegetation.",

            "abstract": "High-affinity methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) play a crucial role in regulating the sink strength for atmospheric methane (CH4) in upland soils. Community structure and activity of MOB have been extensively studied in developed soils. However, little is known about their ecosystem service in young, developing soils. Examples of developing soils are found in Alpine glacier forefields, which progressively expand due to glacial retreat. Glacier forefields exhibit diverse geomorphological landforms, which may differ in biogeochemical properties. Also, glacier forefields are subject to seasonal variability in environmental parameters such as soil temperature and water content, which may affect MOB community structure and activity. We recently showed that glacier-forefield soils are a sink for atmospheric CH4, but a comprehensive understanding of crucial factors affecting MOB community structure and activity is still missing.\nIn this study we assessed soil-atmosphere CH4 flux and MOB community structure in three different glacier-forefield landforms (sandhills, floodplains, terraces) throughout a snow-free sampling season. Specifically, we quantified CH4 flux using the soil-gas-profile method and static flux chambers. The MOB community structure was assessed using next-generation sequencing technology (Illumina-MiSeqTM) targeting the functional gene pmoA. We observed substantial differences in CH4 flux between soils of different landforms, with largest fluxes observed in well-drained sandhills (up to ‑2.2 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) and considerably smaller fluxes in other landforms. Methane flux showed a prominent seasonal variability, which was attenuated in older forefield soils.

            "abstract": "Meteorological conditions are the primary driver of variations in the annual volume of groundwater pumped for irrigation from the High Plains aquifer (HPA), one of the largest aquifers of the world. Correlations between climatic indices (such as the Standardized Precipitation Index [SPI]) and mean annual water-level changes and water use have been shown to be valuable tools for assessing the aquifer’s response to various climatic scenarios in the semi-arid Kansas HPA (Whittemore et al., 2015). The correlations are generally better for a relatively large area (region) of the aquifer (such as that encompassed by a climatic division) because of the number of weather stations from which the climatic indices are computed. Correlations can be poor for county-sized and smaller areas (less than a few to several hundred km2) because of the low density of weather stations. Since 2005, radar precipitation data have been served online by the National Weather Service. The radar data are adjusted based on ground observations and are available at a spatial resolution of ~4x4 km. Correlations between radar precipitation and mean annual water-level changes and water use are comparable to those using SPI for the same region. Correlations using radar precipitation data are generally higher than with SPI computed for smaller areas, such as for counties and areas around individual monitoring wells. The optimum correlations for radar precipitation are determined using sums of different spans of monthly mean precipitation that include the irrigation season for the area of interest. Coefficients of determination, R2, for radar precipitation versus annual water-level change and water use can exceed 0.8 for counties and monitoring well areas in the Kansas HPA. These correlations are being used to assess the impact of drought and water-use management on HPA sustainability. These correlations can also be used to assess the quality of the reported water-use data.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between aboveground and belowground processes are crucial to understand if we are to forecast feedbacks between terrestrial carbon (C) dynamics and future climate. To test if climate induced changes in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) will drive changes in C loss by soil respiration (Rs) we integrated data across a European temperature and precipitation gradient. Six European shrublands were exposed to year-round, night time warming (+1.5 oC) or repeated drought (-30% annual rain) during the plants growth season for over a decade, using an identical experimental approach. As a result, drought reduced ecosystem C gain as ANPP by 50% (compared to an untreated control) at the driest xeric site with effects reducing in intensity across the aridity gradient to a 15% ANPP-C gain at the wettest hydric site (slope=1.2, R2=0.76). In contrast, reductions in Rs-C loss were of a lower magnitude (0-15%) and increased in intensity across the aridity gradient (slope=-0.44, R2=0.76) if the hydric site was excluded. These results suggest (i) above and belowground C fluxes responses do not track each other in response to drought and (ii) whilst ANPP at our hydric sites follows that predicted from an aridity gradient, Rs responses did not. Results from the warming treatments were generally of lower magnitude and opposite direction indicating different mechanisms were driving responses. Overall, these results suggest that ANPP is more sensitive than Rs to climate stresses and soil respiration C fluxes are not predictable from changes in plant productivity. Indirect effects on soil properties and/or microbial communities need to be explored. As we observed no acclimation of either ANPP or Rs after over a decade of treatments, feedbacks between the terrestrial C cycle and climate may not weaken over decadal timescales at larger, continental scales.",

            "abstract": "Volcanoes exhibit variable eruption frequencies and styles, from near-continuous eruptions of effusive lavas to more intermittent, explosive eruptions. The monitoring frequency necessary to capture precursory signals at any volcano remains uncertain, as some warnings allot hours for evacuation. Likewise, no precursory signal appears deterministic for each volcano. Volcanic activity manifests in a variety of ways (i.e. tremor, deformation), thus requiring multiple monitoring mechanisms (i.e. geodetic, geochemical, geothermal). We are developing databases to compare relationships among remotely sensed volcanic unrest signals and eruptions. Satellite remote sensing utilizes frequent temporal measurements (daily to bi-weekly), an essential component of worldwide volcano monitoring. Remote sensing methods are also capable of detecting diverse precursory signals such as ground deformation from satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar—InSAR— (multiple space agencies), degassing from satellite spectroscopy (i.e. OMI SO2 from NASA), and hot spots from thermal infrared (i.e. MODIS from NASA). We present preliminary results from seven SAR satellites and two thermal infrared satellites for 24 volcanoes with prominent SO2 emissions. We find near-continuous emissions at Ibu (Indonesia) since 2008 corresponded with hotspots and 10 cm of subsidence, with degassing and comparable subsidence observed at Pagan (Marianas). A newcomer to volcano monitoring, remote sensing data are only beginning to be utilized on a global scale, let alone as a synthesized dataset for monitoring developing eruptions. We foresee a searchable tool for rapidly accessing basic volcanic unrest characteristics for different types of volcanoes and whether or not they resulted in eruption. By including data from multiple satellite sensors in our database we hope to develop quantitative assessments for calculating the likelihood of eruption from individual events.",

The mission consisted of two spacecraft with Ka-band inter-satellite tracking complemented by tracking from Earth. The mission had two phases: a primary mapping mission from March 1 until May 29, 2012 at an average altitude of 50 km, and an extended mission from August 30 until December 14, 2012, with an average altitude of 23 km before November 18, and 20 and 11 km after. High-resolution gravity field models using both these data sets have been estimated, with the current resolution being degree and order 1080 in spherical harmonics. Here, we focus on aspects of the analysis of the GRAIL data: we investigate eclipse modeling, the influence of empirical accelerations on the results, and we discuss the inversion of large-scale systems. In addition to global models we also estimated local gravity adjustments in areas of particular interest such as Mare Orientale, the south pole area, and the farside. We investigate the use of Ka-band Range Rate (KBRR) data versus numerical derivatives of KBRR data, and show that the latter have the capability to locally improve correlations with topography.",

            "abstract": "Occurrence of ice particles in the polar summer mesopause region is an intriguing phenomenon that can be observed either optically as Noctilucent Clouds (NLC) / Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC) or by radar as (Polar) Mesosphere Summer Echoes ((P)MSE). The relation of both phenomena is well understood and allows insights into atmospheric properties like temperature, humidity, winds, turbulence and electron density. Simultaneous observations of NLC and PMSE require sufficient electron density (for the radar observation) and therefore daylight conditions that may hinder optical observations by lidar. Up to now, simultaneous observations of NLC and PMSE are mainly limited to polar latitudes, while data from mid-latitudes are lacking.\nSince 2010 we operate a new RMR lidar at our site at Kühlungsborn/Germany (54°N, 12°E). From the best of our knowledge this lidar allows for the first time observations of mid-latitude NLC independent of solar elevation, i.e. during night and day. With our new RMR lidar and the co-located OSWIN radar we are for the first time able to compare the occurrence and altitude structure of NLC and MSE at mid-latitudes. It turns out that the lower edges of simultaneously observed NLC/MSE typically agree, as expected from higher latitudes. Though, the top edge of MSE is observed about 500 m above the NLC edge, indicating the presence of particles being too small to be observed by lidar. Nevertheless, height difference is small compared to the typical layer widths and smaller than observed at higher latitudes. This hints at different size distributions and, by this, different growing conditions at mid-latitudes. We will present a statistical overview on the comparison of simultaneously observed NLC and MSE layers and their main characteristics. Simultaneous NLC and MSE are of additional importance if observed during twilight conditions. The onset or disappearance of MSE during morning and evening twilight is directly related with changing electron densities. While twilight conditions at polar latitudes are limited to the end of NLC season, at our mid-latitude station this happens twice a day. We will present case studies of the onset of MSE during ice conditions observed as NLC, e.g. showing an altitude dependence of the minimum electron density required for MSE.",

            "abstract": "The effects of velocity distribution functions (VDFs) that exhibit a power-law dependence on the high-energy tail have been the subject\nof intense research by the space plasma community. Such functions, known as kappa or superthermal distributions, have been\nfound to provide a better fitting to the VDF measured by spacecraft in the solar wind. One of the problems that is being addressed on this new light is the temperature anisotropy of solar wind protons and electrons. An anisotropic kappa VDF contains a large amount of free energy that can excite waves in the solar wind. Conversely, the wave-particle interaction is important to determine the shape of the\nobserved particle distributions.\nIn the literature, the general treatment for waves excited by (bi-)Maxwellian plasmas is well-established. However, for kappa distributions, either isotropic or anisotropic, the wave characteristics have been studied mostly for the limiting cases of purely parallel or perpendicular propagation. Contributions for the general case of obliquely-propagating electromagnetic waves have been scarcely reported so far. The absence of a general treatment prevents a complete analysis of the wave-particle interaction in kappa plasmas, since some instabilities, such as the firehose, can operate simultaneously both in the parallel and oblique directions.\nIn a recent work [1], we have obtained expressions for the dielectric tensor and dispersion relations for the low-frequency, quasi-perpendicular dispersive Alfvén waves resulting from a kappa VDF. In the present work, we generalize the formalism introduced by [1] for the\ngeneral case of electrostatic and/or electromagnetic waves propagating in a kappa plasma in any frequency range and for arbitrary angles.\nWe employ an isotropic distribution, but the methods used here can be easily applied to more general anisotropic distributions,\nsuch as the bi-kappa or product-bi-kappa.\n[1] R.

During the night of March 1, 2011, the imager identified a mesoscale gravity wave structure in the OH airglow that had a wave period of 2 hours, propagated along an azimuthal direction (clockwise) with an angle of 163° , a phase speed of 73 m/s, and a horizontal wavelength of 566 km. Simultaneous measurements provided by the sodium lidar also showed a perturbation in the sodium layer with a 2-hour period. Based on the SABER/TIMED and radar data, we estimated that the momentum flux and the energy flux of the gravity wave were approximately 0.61 m2/s2 and 0.22 mW/m2, respectively. Ray-tracing analysis showed that the gravity wave was likely generated in the northwest of Lake Baikal owing to the existence of a jet- front system in the upper troposphere at that time.",

On the smallest scale, it mediates the fluxes of gases across the air-water interface; at intermediate scales, that is, the size of within lake eddies, it brings gases to the air-water interface; on a larger scale, eddies in the unstable atmospheric boundary layers transport gases away from water bodies and maintain concentration gradients and further, help sustain fluxes by inducing within lake turbulence. The winds and cooling which induce within-lake turbulence and over-lake boundary layers are moderated by weather patterns dependent on even larger scale physical processes. Using time series measurements of lake temperatures, surface meteorology, and profiles of temperature-gradient microstructure in Alaskan arctic lakes ranging from 0.1 to 150 ha in surface area, we quantify the dependency of turbulence in the water column and at the air-water interface on surface meteorology and lake size. We show the lake size dependent variability in the stability of atmospheric boundary layers. We illustrate the resulting lake-size and weather dependent variability in gas transfer coefficients and within lake mixing. Using cluster analysis, we identify dominant weather patterns in the Alaskan Arctic Region and link them to within lake mixing dynamics. We then illustrate the dependency of greenhouse gas emissions on variability in local weather, lake size, and weather patterns.",

            "abstract": "Among the several large strike-slip faults that participate into the eastward motion of the Tibetan plateau, the Kunlun fault has hosted two major instrumental earthquakes, in 1997 and 2001. These two events, respectively of magnitude Mw=7.6 and Mw=7.8, have ruptured together a section of about 600km along the west end of the fault. This is about half of the total length of the Kunlun fault. Magnitude 7 to 7.5 earthquakes have also been reported in 1937 and 1963 along the eastern section of the Kunlun fault, indicating almost total failure of the fault in less than a century. The central segment of Xidatan-Dongdatan, about 150km long, is the only one segment where no instrumental and historical rupture is clearly documented.\nThe 2001 earthquake has provided us with a unique opportunity to document in details co-seismic deformation, based on correlation of optical satellite images, high resolution imagery and extensive field measurements. Comparison with cumulative slip documented in several sites brings new evidences for characteristic slip behavior along specific section of this rupture. Ruptures along the eastern segments of the Kunlun fault had not been documented in details at the time of earthquake. Using high-resolution imagery in conjunction with field survey, we bring new constrains on the extent of 1937 earthquake rupture and its related co-seismic offsets. Two paleoseismic trenches have been opened along the segments where no instrumental or historical events are known. One trench is open across the Xidatan segment, along the central part of the Kunlun fault. The second trench has been opened across the Maqen segment, along the most eastern segment of the fault. Both trenches show recent activity with 3 to 4 events visible in each trench. Preliminary dating indicates that 4 events have occurred along the Xidatan segment since 2400BP. The last event is probably younger than 663BP. These data allow us to propose a tentative earthquake history of the Kunlun fault, to be compared to the few other strike-slip faults that are well documented and to test if one can improve our understanding of the way large strike-slip faults rupture.",

            "abstract": "Marmara Region has witnessed many devastating earthquakes where some of them caused tsunami. Many geological field surveys and geophysical studies indicated that 1912, Sarkoy-Murefte event, occurred on the Ganos Fault Zone, was one of the largest earthquake in the western Marmara Sea and caused tsunami. The same is also valid for 04.01.1935, 14:41, M=6.4 and 16:20 M=6.3 Erdek-Marmara Island, and 18.09.1963, 16:58, M=6.3 Cinarcik earthquakes. The aim of this study is to contribute to the seismotectonics of this region by examining the source parameters of these shocks using seismic waveforms, which were previously not carried out by modern techniques. In this study, the original seismograms from various countries for 1912 Sarköy-Mürefte, 1935, Erdek Marmara Island and 1963, Cinarcik earthquakes were digitized. The magnitude Mw, seismic moment Mo, the radius of circular source zone R and stress drop values were redetermined from displacement spectra of the digitized seismic waveforms. A large number of seismic station bulletins have been consulted for the instrumental information to remove the instrument response. In addition, the epicentral locations have been calculated using available readings from original records and ISS bulletins for the 1935 and 1963 earthquakes. For the 1912 event, the magnitude Mw=7.13 and radius of the fault area R=41 km were determined. Also, 04.01.1935-14:41 and 16:20 earthquakes showed a fault radius of about 15 km with magnitudes Mw=6.0 and Mw=5.9, respectively. The epicenter determinations showed that the first event in 04.01.1935 was located at 40.72 N- 27.72 E while the second one occurred at 40.61 N-27.43 E. Another finding is of the 1963 event, which gave a fault radius of approximately 13 km with a magnitude Mw=5.9. The 1963 event was located at 40.80 N-29.18 E. Furthermore; moment tensor inversion method was applied on these earthquakes by using original seismograms collected from various observatories. The fault mechanisms for 04.01.1935-14:41 and 16:20 earthquakes were determined using moment tensor inversion from the original seismic waveforms for the first time. Likewise, fault mechanism for the 1963 Cinarcik earthquake was also obtained. The results showed that these earthquakes have normal fault mechanism.",

The biogeochemical processes related to the greenhouse gas release from mineral cryosols, however, have not been fully explored. To this end, seventeen intact cores of active layer and underlying permafrost of mineral cryosol from Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut, Canada, were subjected to 85 weeks of thawing at 4.5°C under various treatment regimes. The fluxes of CO2 and CH4 across the atmosphere-soil boundary and vertical profiles of the gas and water chemistry and the metagenomes were determined. The flux measurements were compared to those of microcosms and field measurements. The main conclusions were as follows: 1) CO2 emission rates from the intact cores do not behave in the typical fast to slow carbon pool fashion that typify microcosm experiments. The CO2 emission rates from the intact cores were much slower than those from the microcosm initially, but steadily increased with time, overtaking and then exceeding microcosm release rates after one year. 2) The increased CO2 flux from thawing permafrost could not be distinguished from that of control cores until after a full year of thawing. 3) Atmospheric CH4 oxidation was present in all intact cores regardless of whether they are water saturated or not, but after one year it had diminished to the point of being negligible. Over that same time the period the metagenomic data recorded a significant decline in the proportion of high-affinity methanotrophs. 4) Thaw slumps in the cores temporarily increased the CH4 oxidation and the CO2 emission rates. 5) The microbial community structures varied significantly by depth with methanotrophs being more abundant in above 35 cm depth than below 35 cm depth. 6) Other than the diminishment of Type II methanotrophs, the microbial community structure varied little after one week of thawing, nor even after 18 months of thaw.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based remote sensing observations from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun-sky radiometers have recently shown several instances where cloud-aerosol interaction had resulted in modification of aerosol properties and/or in difficulty identifying some major pollution transport events due to aerosols being imbedded in cloud systems. Major Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON) field campaigns involving multiple AERONET sites in Japan and South Korea during Spring of 2012 have yielded observations of aerosol transport associated with clouds and/or aerosol properties modification as a result of fog interaction. Analysis of data from the Korean and Japan DRAGON campaigns shows that major fine-mode aerosol transport events are sometimes associated with extensive cloud cover and that cloud-screening of observations often filter out significant pollution aerosol transport events. The Spectral De-convolution Algorithm (SDA) algorithm was utilized to isolate and analyze the fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AODf) signal from AERONET data for these cases of persistent and extensive cloud cover. Satellite retrievals of AOD from MODIS sensors (from Dark Target, Deep Blue and MAIAC algorithms) were also investigated to assess the issue of detectability of high AOD events associated with high cloud fraction. Underestimation of fine mode AOD by the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) and by the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis For Research And Applications Aerosol Re-analysis (MERRAaero) models at very high AOD at sites in China and Korea was observed, especially for observations that are cloud screened by AERONET (Level 2 data). Additionally, multi-year monitoring at several AERONET sites are examined for climatological statistics of cloud screening of fine mode aerosol events. Aerosol that has been affected by clouds or the near-cloud environment may be more prevalent than AERONET data suggest due to inherent difficulty in observing aerosol properties near clouds from remote sensing observations.",

            "abstract": "As the most frequent natural disaster in Sri Lanka, drought greatly affects crop production and livelihoods. Over half of all agricultural crop damage in Sri Lanka is currently due to drought; the frequency and severity of drought in the country is only expected to increase with the changing climate. Previous work indicates that the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are capable of capturing agricultural drought patterns (between 1881-2010) in the island nation. In this work, PDSI and SPI from 13 long-term meteorological stations will be projected into the future using a combination of artificial neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average models. The impacts of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (such as the Niño 3.4 index, a measure of sea surface temperature) and lead times on projection accuracy will also be explored. Model projections will be compared to weather data since 2010 to determine if the 2014 drought could have been forecasted using these methods. Since agricultural systems are strongly influenced by both natural and human systems, it is important to frame these physical findings within a social context. This work is part of an interdisciplinary project that assesses the perceptions of and adaptations to drought by rice farmers in Sri Lanka; disciplines represented in the group include hydrology, social psychology, ethnography, policy, and behavioral economics. Insights from the diverse research perspectives within the group will be drawn upon to highlight the social implications of the physical results.",

            "abstract": "Mountain streams and lakes across the front range of Colorado are increasingly saturated with N in the form of NO3 from deposition. These historically oligotrophic ecosystems have responded to these changes in a number of ways that have been documented in previous work, but new effects of this deposition continue to appear This added N is likely responsible for new algal blooms that have been observed in lakes above the tree line in recent years. Streams and lakes in this region are often C limited, with excessive dissolved NO3 being exported downstream before being processed. What is uncertain, however, is how the microbial communities in these streams and lakes will respond to an increase of available C from decaying algae. In this study, we collected longitudinal stream emission data from a high elevation watershed impacted by N deposition where algal blooms were being observed for the first time. We additionally conducted incubations of stream sediment and water that were amended with live and dead algal cells to determine potential implications of a sudden influx of C. All stream reaches sampled were net sources of both CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere throughout the open water season, but the magnitude of these emissions appears to be tied to stream discharge. Incubated sediments demonstrated an increased potential for the production of CH4 and a weak increase in the potential production of N2O. These results suggest that N impacted streams have some degree of resiliency to changes in the availability of both C and N. With the continued decrease and stabilization of N deposition, these streams may revert to their pre-impacted status.",

Global change also occurs against a background of ecosystem dynamics over the long term. We followed ecosystem production of an annual grassland in California to all possible combinations of experimentally warming (+80 W/m2), added precipitation (+50%), elevated CO2 (+300 ppm), nitrogen deposition (+7 g/m2), and fire disturbances over 17 years. We examined ecosystem-level net primary production (NPP) and its aboveground (ANPP) and belowground components (BNPP), by integrating both the temporal and experimental dimensions as a modulator of responses and as a way to transform treatments from categorical to continuous scales. We developed a model-based approach to investigate these high-dimensional spatial-temporal data.\nAcross the experiment, we found that main effects of the four long-term treatment factors were substantial, increasing or decreasing production by up to 20%. Temperature had negative effects; precipitation had a positive effect on BNPP, but a negative effect on ANPP; CO2 had a positive effect on ANPP, a slight negative effect on BNPP; and nitrogen had positive effects. Relative to their main effects, most interactions among these four global change factors were small, particularly for ANPP and NPP, indicating that most responses to the global change factors were additive. As single factor effects, the 2003 wildfire and 2011 prescribed burn were similar, with strong positive effects on ecosystem productivity in the following growing season by up to 40%, especially for ANPP. All these multi-factor long-term ecosystem productivity results provide a starting point and a foundation to understand ecosystem performance in a wide range of future global change scenarios.",

Tethered balloons can provide greater temporal resolution but are difficult to acquire, hard to manage and limited in vertical resolution. UAVs appear to offer a more cost-effective method for gathering low-level meteorological data in situ, with a strong possibility of adding atmospheric chemistry. This potential is enhanced by the availability of new generations of small sensors along with dramatic advances in low-cost UAVs, especially rotary-wing.\nInterMet is using its experience in radiosonde design and manufacturing to develop sensor packages for fixed and rotary-wing UAVs, with the goal of delivering high-quality data at low cost. The challenge is to adapt affordable, high-accuracy sensors to the different UAV flight modes. Equally important is learning from the research community what is required for this data to have useful scientific value.\nSpecific topics to be covered include data sampling and output rates, sensor response times, calibration, sensor placement, data storage and transfer, power consumption, integration with flight management systems and wind calculations. Beta test results for the iMet-XQ and iMet-XF sensor packages will be presented if available.",

            "abstract": "The greater availability of remote sensing data stimulates the scientific community to resort to these new data sources in order to pursue a greater spatial coverage of hydraulic models, even in remote and data-sparse areas. However, the accuracy of hydrological and hydraulic models performed in absence of measured topography data suffers from the lack of knowledge of the river bathymetry, which cannot be directly inferred from satellite instruments. This work, adopting the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) for representing the riverbed and floodplain morphology, tests two different procedures for inferring the river bathymetry under the water surface level, thus enhancing the accuracy of space-borne digital elevation model and its suitability for hydraulic applications. Referring to a river stretch of about 140 km of the Po river, the study investigates the suitability of 1) altimetry data (i.e., ERS-2 and ENVISAT) and 2) SRTM-based river cross-sections modified according to two approaches (Channel Bankfull depth (CB) and Slope-Break (SB) approach), for the implementation and calibration of 1D numerical models. Simulation results are compared with those obtained by means of a quasi-2D model implemented with detailed topographical data (i.e. airborne LiDAR), and show that both SRTM-based models based on CB and SB approaches appear accurate enough to reproduce the hydrometric regime of the river stretch. In particular, despite the SB approach does not require any field data, it provides efficiency values (NSs) and errors of the same order of LiDAR-based model. Even though the accuracy of SRTM-based models is still not adequate for detailed analysis (i.e., local flood-risk estimate), the study further emphasizes the suitability of space-borne topography data (e.g. SRTM), combined with remotely sensed altimetry data (i.e., ERS-2 and ENVISAT), for the implementation of large-scale analysis (i.e., global flood risk analysis), even in absence of field measurements.",

This experiment is designed to enable the study of aerosols, tropical clouds, convections and their interactions. To support modeling studies of these processes with data collected from the GoAmazon2014/5 campaign, we have developed a large-scale forcing data (e.g., vertical velocities and advective tendencies) during the second intensive operational period (IOP) of GoAmazon2014/5 from 1 Sep to 10 Oct, 2014. The method used in this study is the constrained variational analysis method in which the large-scale state fields are constrained by the surface and top-of-atmosphere observations (e.g. surface precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation) to conserve column-integrated mass, moisture and dry static energy. To address potential uncertainties in the derived forcing data due to uncertainties in surface precipitation, two sets of large-scale forcing data are developed based on the ECMWF analysis constrained by the two precipitation products respectively from SIPAM radar and TRMM 3B42 products. Our initial analysis shows large differences in these two precipitation products, which causes considerable differences in the derived large-scale forcing data. Potential uncertainties in the large-scale forcing data to other surface constraints such as surface latent and sensible fluxes will be explored. The characteristics of the large-scale forcing structures for selected cases will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "From 7 March to 30 April 2014, NodalSeismic, Nanometrics, and IRIS PASSCAL conducted a collaborative, spatially-dense seismic survey with several thousand nodal short-period geophones complemented by a backbone array of broadband sensors near Sweetwater, Texas. This pilot project demonstrates the efficacy of industry and academic partnerships, and leveraged a larger, commercial 3D survey to collect passive source seismic recordings to image the subsurface. This innovative deployment of a large-N mixed-mode array allows industry to explore array geometries and investigate the value of broadband recordings, while affording academics a dense wavefield imaging capability and an operational model for high volume instrument deployment.\nThe broadband array consists of 25 continuously-recording stations from IRIS PASSCAL and Nanometrics, with an array design that maximized recording of horizontal-traveling seismic energy for surface wave analysis over the primary target area with sufficient offset for imaging objectives at depth. In addition, 2639 FairfieldNodal Zland nodes from NodalSeismic were deployed in three sub-arrays: the outlier, backbone, and active source arrays. The backbone array consisted of 292 nodes that covered the entire survey area, while the outlier array consisted of 25 continuously-recording nodes distributed at a ~3 km distance away from the survey perimeter. Both the backbone and outlier array provide valuable constraints for the passive source portion of the analysis.\nThis project serves as a learning platform to develop best practices in the support of large-N arrays with joint industry and academic expertise. Here we investigate lessons learned from a facility perspective, and present examples of data from the various sensors and array geometries. We will explore first-order results from local and teleseismic earthquakes, and show visualizations of the data across the array. Data are archived at the IRIS DMC under stations codes XB and 1B.",

To estimate uncertainties in space-based temperature measurements, we reprojected the MODIS Ice Surface Temperature (IST) into 0.5 by 0.5 degree spatial resolution. We also re-gridded AIRS Skin Temperature (Ts) with same spatial resolution but classified with different cloud conditions and surface types. These co-located data sets make intercomparison between the two instruments relatively straightforward. By this approach, the spatial comparison between AIRS Ts and MODIS IST monthly mean is in good agreement with RMS less than 2K during May 2012. This approach also allows the detection of any long-term calibration drift and the careful examination of calibration consistency in MODIS and AIRS temperature data record.\nThe temporal correlations between temperature data are also compared with those from in-situ measurements from GC-Net and NOAA stations. The most significant diurnal difference is found during spring season (April and May) in high altitude regions, when interannual variability is relatively smaller than summer and winter.",

            "abstract": "Projections of future terrestrial carbon uptake vary greatly between simulations. Net primary production (NPP), wild fires, vegetation dynamics (including biome shifts) and soil decomposition constitute the main processes governing the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle in a changing climate. While primary production and soil respiration are relatively well studied and implemented in all global ecosystem models used to project the future land sink of CO2, vegetation dynamics are less studied and not always represented in global models. Here we used a detailed second generation dynamic global vegetation model with advanced representation of vegetation growth and mortality and the associated turnover and proven skill in predicting vegetation distribution and succession. We apply an emulator that describes the carbon flows and pools exactly as in simulations with the full model. The emulator simulates ecosystem dynamics in response to 13 different climate or Earth system model simulations from the CMIP5 ensemble under RCP8.5 radiative forcing at year 2085. We exchanged carbon cycle processes between these 13 simulations and investigate the changes predicted by the emulator. This method allowed us to partition the entire ensemble carbon uptake uncertainty into individual processes. We found that NPP, vegetation dynamics (including biome shifts, wild fires and mortality) and soil decomposition rates explained 49%, 17% and 33% respectively of uncertainties in modeled global C-uptake. Uncertainty due to vegetation dynamics was further partitioned into stand-clearing disturbances (16%), wild fires (0%), stand dynamics (7%), reproduction (10%) and biome shifts (67%) globally. We conclude that while NPP and soil decomposition rates jointly account for 83% of future climate induced C-uptake uncertainties, vegetation turnover and structure, dominated by shifts in vegetation distribution, represent a significant fraction globally and regionally (tropical forests: 40%), strongly motivating their representation and analysis in future C-cycle studies.",

            "abstract": "Mn/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifers have been purported to be indicators of terrestrial input, marine oxidation-reduction reactions and sea surface productivity in the eastern tropical Pacific. We investigated this hypothesis using Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca data from five species of planktonic foraminifers in 32 core tops from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), five species from 12 core tops in the western equatorial Pacific, and two species from 15 core tops on the Rio Grande Rise. We present Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca data from Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globorotalia menardii, Globigerina bulloides, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata and Globorotalia tumida from the eastern and western equatorial Pacific and from Globorotalia truncatulinoides and Globorotalia inflata on the Rio Grande Rise. We find that the environmental parameter depicted by Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios depends on the species of foraminifer from which the data was derived. Fe/Ca from N. dutertrei in the EEP have statistically significant and quantifiable relationships with apparent oxygen utilization, dissolved phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration in the habitat depths of this species. The Mn/Ca ratio from P. obliquiloculata and G. tumida are highest in regions of greatest productivity in the EEP. On the Rio Grande Rise, we explored the effect of dissolution in the sediments on Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios from planktonic foraminifers. We used the G. menardii fragmentation index as our sedimentary dissolution indicator, and found that dissolution does not have a strong effect on the Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios measured from foraminifers tests.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is globally associated with 3.2 million premature deaths annually. Satellite retrievals of total column aerosol optical depth (AOD) from instruments such as MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS are related to PM2.5 through local aerosol vertical profiles and optical properties. A globally applicable and geophysically-based AOD to PM2.5 relationship can be calculated from chemical transport model (CTM) simulations. This approach, while effective, ignores the wealth of ground monitoring data that exist in some regions of the world. We therefore use ground monitors to develop a geographically weighted regression (GWR) that predicts the residual bias in geophysically-based satellite-derived PM2.5. Predictors such as the AOD to PM2.5 relationship resolution, land cover type, and chemical composition are used to predict this bias, which can then be used to improve the initial PM2.5 estimates.\nThis approach not only allows for direct bias correction, but also provides insight into factors biasing the initial CTM-derived AOD to PM2.5 relationship. Over North America, we find significant improvement in bias-corrected PM2.5 (r2=0.82 versus r2=0.62), with evidence that fine-scale variability in surface elevation and urban factors are major sources of error in the CTM-derived relationships. Agreement remains high (r2=0.78) even when a large fraction of ground monitors (70%) are withheld from the GWR, suggesting this technique may add value in regions with even sparse ground monitoring networks, and potentially worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) is responsible for implementing Adaptive Phased Management, the approach selected by the Government of Canada for long-term management of used nuclear fuel generated by Canadian nuclear reactors. The ultimate objective of APM is the centralized containment and isolation of Canada’s used nuclear fuel in a Deep Geological Repository in a suitable crystalline or sedimentary rock formation. In May 2010, the NWMO published and initiated a nine-step site selection process to find an informed and willing community to host a deep geological repository for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. The site selection process is designed to address a broad range of technical and social, economic and cultural factors.   The site evaluation process includes three main technical evaluation steps: Initial Screenings; Preliminary Assessments; and Detailed Site Characterizations, to assess the suitability of candidate areas in a stepwise manner over a period of many years. By the end of 2012, twenty two communities had expressed interest in learning more about the project. As of July 2015, nine communities remain in the site selection process.   To date (July 2015), NWMO has completed Initial Screenings for the 22 communities that expressed interest, and has completed the first phase of Preliminary Assessments (desktop) for 20 of the communities. Phase 2 of the Preliminary Assessments has been initiated in a number of communities, with field activities such as high-resolution airborne geophysical surveys and geological mapping. This paper describes the approach, methods and criteria being used to assess the geoscientific suitability of communities currently involved in the site selection process.",

This study investigates the performance of two hybrid models for real-time flood forecasting at different subcatchments of Ley Creek watershed, a heavily urbanized watershed in the vicinity of Syracuse, New York. Hybrid models include Wavelet-Based Artificial Neural Network (WANN) and Wavelet-Based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WANFIS). Both models are developed on the basis of real time stream network sensing. The wavelet approach is applied to decompose the collected water depth timeseries to Approximation and Detail components. The Approximation component is then used as an input to ANN and ANFIS models to forecast water level at lead times of 1 to 10 hours. The performance of WANN and WANFIS models are compared to ANN and ANFIS models for different lead times. Initial results demonstrated greater predictive power of hybrid models.",

Responding to these new demands, universities and research institutions are developing data services to support their scientists and scholarly communities. As more organizations extend their operations to research data, a better understanding of the staff roles and expertise required to support data-intensive research services is needed. What is data expertise - knowledge, skills, and roles? This study addresses this question through a case study of an exemplar research center, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, CO.\nThe NCAR case study results were supplemented and validated with a set of interviews of managers at additional geoscience data centers. To date, 11 interviews with NCAR staff and 19 interviews with managers at supplementary data centers have been completed. Selected preliminary results from the qualitative analysis will be reported in the poster:\nData professionals have cultivated expertise in areas such as managing scientific data and products, understanding use and users, harnessing technology for data solutions, and standardizing metadata and data sets.\nStaff roles and responsibilities have evolved over the years to create new roles for data scientists, data managers/curators, data engineers, and senior managers of data teams, embedding data expertise into each NCAR lab.\nExplicit career paths and ladders for data professionals are limited but starting to emerge.\nNCAR has supported organization-wide efforts for data management, leveraging knowledge and best practices across all the labs and their staff.\nBased on preliminary results, NCAR provides a model for how organizations can build expertise and roles into their data service models. Data collection for this study is ongoing. The author anticipates that the results will help answer questions on what are the knowledge and skills required for data professionals and how organizations can develop data expertise.",

Although reconnection may play a key role in controlling ion escape processes at Mars, the fundamental properties of local physics and global dynamics of magnetic reconnection in the Martian environment remain unclear owing to the lack of simultaneous measurements of ions, electrons, and magnetic fields by modern instrumentation. Here we present comprehensive MAVEN observations of reconnection signatures in the near-Mars magnetotail. The observed reconnection signatures include (i) Marsward bulk flows of H+, O+, and O2+ ions, (ii) counterstreaming ion beams along the current sheet normal direction, (iii) Hall magnetic fields, and (iv) trapped electrons with two-sided loss cones. The measured velocity distribution functions of different ion species exhibit mass-dependent characteristics which are qualitatively consistent with previous multi-species kinetic simulations and terrestrial tail observations. The MAVEN observations demonstrate that the near-Mars magnetotail provides a unique environment for studying multi-ion reconnection.",

            "abstract": "The issue of scales in linking climatic processes with diarrheal diseases is perhaps one of the most challenging aspect to develop any predictive algorithm for outbreaks and to understand impacts of changing climate. Majority of diarrheal diseases have shown to be strongly associated with climate modulated environmental processes where pathogens survive. Using cholera as an example of characteristic diarrheal diseases, this study will provide methodological insights on dominant scale variability in climatic processes that are linked with trigger and transmission of disease. Cholera based epidemiological models use human to human interaction as a main transmission mechanism, however, environmental conditions for creating seasonality in outbreaks is not explicitly modeled. For example, existing models cannot create seasonality, unless some of the model parameters are a-priori chosen to vary seasonally. A systems based feedback approach will be presented to understand role of climatic processes on trigger and transmission disease. In order to investigate effect of changing climate on cholera, a downscaling approach using support vector machine will be used. Our preliminary results using three climate models, ECHAM5, GFDL, and HADCM show that varying modalities in future cholera outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "In low-relief landscapes, the hillslope diffusion equation approximates the rate of topographic evolution due to disturbance driven sediment transport. Whereas this expression is appealing and performs well, the physical meaning of a hillslope diffusivity remains unclear. Here, a study of the disturbances that redistribute sediment on hillslopes clarifies a physical interpretation. We conceptualize the cumulative hillslope diffusivity, which is a rate constant for topographic degradation at large scales, as the aggregate of all surface disturbing processes. A numerical model that generates pit and mound topography from tree throw events illustrates this idea. Using the diffusion equation, we model the degradation of pits and mounds by all smaller scale disturbances. However, when examined at a larger scale, the effective hillslope diffusivity is composed of the small scale diffusivity plus the effect of tree throw. We also present a method to determine the background hillslope diffusivity using the extant hillslope roughness and rates of roughness production. Numerical simulations show that the variance of the surface roughness of a hillslope as introduced by pit and mound topography reaches a steady state when the rate of variance production (tree throw) is constant. The magnitude of the steady state variance is a function of variance production and decay (small scale diffusivity), so there is an opportunity to determine hillslope diffusivity values if the rates of variance production are known. This method yields estimates of the modern hillslope diffusivity which are useful in problems involving the human and climate change time scales.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is directly linked to soil quality, food security, and land use/global environmental change. We use publicly available information on SOC and couple it with digital elevation models and derived terrain attributes using a machine learning approach. We found a strong spatial dependency of SOC across the United States, but less spatial dependency of SOC across Mexico. Using High Performance Computing (HPC) we derived a 1 km resolution map of SOC across Mexico and the United States. We tested different machine learning methods (e.g., kernel based, tree based and/or Geo-statistics approaches) for computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. Using random forest combined with geo-statistics we were able to explain >70% of SOC variance for Mexico and >40% in the case of the United States via cross validation. These results compare with other published estimates of SOC at 1km resolution that only explain <30% of SOC variance across the world. Topographic attributes derived from digital elevation models are freely available globally at fine spatial resolution (<100 m), and this information allowed us to make predictions of SOC at fine scales. We further tested this approach using SOC information from the International Soil Carbon Network to predict SOC in other regions of the world. We conclude that this approach (using public information and open source platforms for data analysis) could be implemented to predict detailed explicit information of SOC across different spatial scales.",

            "abstract": "Interdecadal climate variability is of marked socioeconomic importance around the world and recent studies suggest that it may also affect the rate of global warming (Here, interdecadal variability refers broadly to variability on time scales of 10-100 years.) Our understanding of interdecadal climate variability is at present limited by a short instrumental record constituting only a few cycles. To improve climate prediction over the coming decades, a better understanding of interdecadal climate variability is critical. An increasing number of annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records present a means to extend the temporal coverage of the record of interdecadal variability. In so doing, we may begin to address the following questions. What were the amplitudes and timescales of known modes of interdecadal variability, such as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) or the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), before the instrumental era? Is interdecadal variability in different ocean basins related? Are there any yet undiscovered modes of interdecadal variability? To answer these questions we construct a network of annually-resolved proxy records collected from the NOAA paleoclimatology data archive and perform various statistical analyses without any a priori assumptions about modes of variability. During the instrumental period, this network reasonably captures the observed interdecadal variability in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We are currently extending these analyses beyond the instrumental record to reconstruct past variability. The new insight gained from the proxies will be assessed through the analysis of CMIP5 climate model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Surface air temperature (Ta) is largely determined by surface net radiation (Rn) and its partitioning into latent (LE) and sensible heat fluxes (H). Existing model evaluations of the absolute values of these fluxes are less helpful because the evaluation results are a blending of inconsistent spatial scales, inaccurate model forcing data and inaccurate parameterizations. This study further evaluates the relationship of LE and H with Rn and environmental parameters, including Ta, relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (WS), using ERA-interim reanalysis data at a grid of 0.125°×0.125° with measurements at AmeriFlux sites from 1998 to 2012. The results demonstrate that ERA-Interim can reproduce the absolute values of environmental parameters, radiation and turbulent fluxes rather accurately. The model performs well in simulating the correlation of LE and H to Rn, except for the notable correlation overestimation of H against Rn over high-density vegetation (e.g., deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), grassland (GRA) and cropland (CRO)). The sensitivity of LE to Rn in the model is similar to the observations, but that of H to Rn is overestimated by 24.2%. In regions with high-density vegetation, the correlation coefficient between H and Ta is overestimated by more than 0.2, whereas that between H and WS is underestimated by more than 0.43. The sensitivity of H to Ta is overestimated by 0.72 Wm-2 °C-1, whereas that of H to WS in the model is underestimated by 16.15 Wm-2/(ms-1) over all of the sites. Considering both LE and H, the model cannot accurately capture the response of the evaporative fraction (EF=LE/(LE+H)) to Rn and the environmental parameters.",

            "abstract": "We present three-dimensional full-kinetic electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs). Using the implicit particle-in-cell code iPic3D, we confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the lunar surface forming a mini-magnetosphere, as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. In contrast to earlier MHD and hybrid simulations, the full-kinetic nature of iPic3D allows to self-consistently investigate space charge effects, and in particular the electron dynamics dominating the near-surface lunar plasma environment. We describe the general mechanism of the interaction of both a horizontal and vertical dipole model embedded just below the lunar surface focussing on the ion and electron kinetic behaviour of the system. It is shown that the configurations are largely dominated by electron motion, because the LMA scale size is small with respect to the gyro-radius of the solar wind ions. The formation of mini-magnetospheres is an electrostatic effect. Additionally, we discuss typical particle trajectories as well as complete particle distribution functions covering thermal and suprathermal energies, within the interaction region and on viable spacecraft altitudes. \nOur work opens new frontiers of research toward a deeper understanding of LMAs and is ideally suited to be compared with field or particle observations from spacecraft such as Kaguya (SELENE), Lunar Prospector or ARTEMIS. The ability to evaluate the implications for future lunar exploration as well as lunar science in general hinges on a better understanding of LMAs.\nThis research has received funding from the European Commission’s FP7 Program with the grant agreement EHEROES (project 284461, www.eheroes.eu).

            "abstract": "The radiative forcing of cirrus clouds is influenced by microphysical (e.g., ice crystal number concentration and size distribution) and macroscopic properties. Currently it is still unclear how the formation of cirrus clouds and their microphysical properties are influenced by anthropogenic emissions.\nIn this work, we use airborne in-situ observations to compare cirrus cloud properties between polluted and pristine regions. Our dataset includes: the NSF HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) Global campaign (2009-2011), the EU Interhemispheric Differences In Cirrus Properties from Anthropogenic Emissions (INCA) campaign (2000) and the NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) campaign (2014). The combined dataset include observations of both extratropical (HIPPO and INCA) and tropical (ATTREX) cirrus, over the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nWe use the in-situ measured carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratio as a pollution indicator, and compare ice microphysical properties (i.e., ice crystal number concentration (Nc) and number-weighted mean diameter (Dc)) between air masses with higher and lower CO. All analyses are restricted to T ≤ -40°C. By analyzing ice crystals (Fast-2DC, 87.5-1600 µm) in HIPPO, we found that Dc decreases with increasing CO concentration at multiple constant pressure levels. In addition, analysis of INCA data shows that Nc and extinction of small ice particles (FSSP 3-20 µm) increases with increasing CO. Particles < 87.5 µm in Fast-2DC data are not considered due to uncertainty in sample volume, and the FSSP measurements are subject to possible shattering.\nWe further analyze the ice crystals (SPEC FCDP, 1-50 µm) in the tropical tropopause layer in ATTREX. At -70°C to -90°C, we found that the average Nc (Dc) increases (decreases) at higher CO. Overall, our results suggest that extratropical and tropical cirrus are likely to have more numerous small ice particles, when sampled in the more polluted background. Back trajectory analysis will be used to separate cirrus formed by recent convection from the in-situ generated ones. Other pollution tracers will also be used to examine if similar features exist. Overall, these analyses will help to improve the estimation of the impacts from anthropogenic emissions on cirrus cloud formation.",

            "abstract": "During MESSENGER’s four years in orbit, its X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) measured Mercury’s surface abundances of Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe. Analysis of the distribution of these key rock-forming elements revealed the presence of several distinct geochemical terranes with boundaries that do not always correlate with mapped geological units or other datasets. Later measurements, made during MESSENGER’s low-altitude campaign near the end of the mission, have unveiled smaller-scale chemical heterogeneities within the geochemical terranes. Updated global Mg/Si and Al/Si maps as well as a new Al/Mg map are now sufficiently high in resolution to correlate some compositional heterogeneities with geological features identified in other datasets. For example, the interior smooth plains of Caloris basin were already known to feature among the lowest Mg/Si and highest Al/Si ratios on the planet, but the low-altitude data have allowed us to resolve the higher Mg/Si and lower Al/Si of the low-reflectance material (LRM) excavated by craters within the basin. Similarly, Rachmaninoff basin now shows an interesting substructure in which its bright interior smooth plains are consistent with lower Mg/Si than the rest of the basin floor. An area of high Mg/Si within the basin, however, does not match the distribution of LRM along the basin edges. The preponderance of additional chemical trends that correlate with craters, fresh deposits, and low-reflectance material demonstrates that Mercury’s crust is both laterally and vertically heterogeneous.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of particulates on P loading captured during a single storm event. The Everglades Agricultural Area of Florida comprises 280,000 hectares of organic soil farmland artificially drained by ditches, canals and pumps. Phosphorus (P)-enriched suspended particulates in canals are susceptible to transport and can contribute significantly to the overall P loads in drainage water. A settling tank experiment was conducted to capture particulates during tropical storm Isaac in 2012 from three farms approximately 2.4 to 3.6 km2 in size. Farm canal discharge water was collected in a series of two 200 liter settling tanks over a seven-day drainage period, during tropical storm Isaac. Water from the settling tanks was siphoned through Imhoff settling cones, where the particulates were allowed to settle and collected for P-fractionation analyses, and compared to intact sediment cores collected from the bottom of the canals. The discharged particulates contained higher organic matter content (OM), total P, and labile P fractions compared to the canal bottom sediments. Based on the equilibrium P concentrations, surface sediments behave as a source of P to the water column. A seven-day continuous drainage event exported 4.7 to 11.1 metric tons of suspended solids per farm, corresponding to 32 to 63 kg of particulate P being lost to downstream ecosystems. Drainage associated to a single seven-day storm event exported up to 61% of the total annual farm P load. It is evident from this study that short-term, high-intensity storm events can skew annual P loads due to the export of significantly higher particulate matter from farm canals. Exported particulates rich in P can provide a supplemental source of nutrients if captured and replenished back into the farmlands, as a sustainable farming practice.",

The tropical MLT zonal winds show clear seasonal variations with eastward flow during the solstices and westward flow during the equinoxes. In addition to the seasonal variation, MLT zonal winds show clear interannual variation mainly during boreal spring equinox. Mesospheric spring equinox enhancements (MSEE) in the zonal winds appear with a periodicity of 2–3 years, suggesting a modulation by the quasi-biennial oscillation. These enhancements are identified during the weak stratospheric westward winds. The underlying mechanism is a local forcing of the MLT region by gravity waves (GWs) due to less filtered westward waves enforcing large westward winds. Although the stratospheric westward winds are weak during 2004 and 2006, the spring equinox westward winds at MLT show small amplitudes. These unexpected small winds occur in these years are due to early spring transition, which is connected to the global circulation anomalies associated with strong sudden stratospheric warmings. Spatial distribution of meteor radar observations enables us to study the latitudinal variation of the mesospheric semiannual oscillation (MSAO) and the QBO modulation on MLT winds. Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA) runs also support the latitudinal behavior of MSAO and QBO modulation on MLT winds.",

            "abstract": "Oxidation of isoprene by OH can significantly influence concentrations of important atmospheric pollutants such as ozone and secondary organic aerosols, but the chemistry that describes the relationships between these species is complex and not fully understood. Debate on the topic has led to differences in the isoprene oxidation schemes of several gas-phase chemical mechanisms currently applied in air chemistry models. We use the University of Washington Chemical Model (UWCMv3) to evaluate these mechanisms with respect to isoprene chemistry based on observations from the SENEX and SEAC4RS aircraft campaigns. The campaigns provide constraints on compounds measured over the Southeast United States, where isoprene concentrations are high and other conditions (e.g., NOx levels) vary widely. The payloads for both missions include observations of a wide range of isoprene oxidation products, which can provide insight into specific oxidation pathways. Analysis will focus on the characterization and comparison of isoprene oxidation chemistry for established gas-phase mechanisms that are prevalent in atmospheric modeling today, including the Carbon Bond mechanism (CB05 and CB6r2) and the Master Chemical Mechanism (versions 3.2 and 3.3).",

We simulate coronal jets with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) [van der Holst (2014)] and focus our study on the thermodynamical evolution of the plasma. AWSoM solves the two-temperature MHD equations with electron heat conduction, which not only addresses the thermodynamics of individual species, but also allows for the construction of synthetic images from the EUV and soft X-ray wavelength range. Our jet model takes the form of a slowly rotating bipole field imbedded in the open magnetic field of a coronal hole; a topology suggested by observations. We follow the formation and evolution of polar jets starting from the chromosphere and extending into the outer corona. The simulations show small-scale eruptive reconnection events that self-consistently heat and accelerate the solar wind. Our results provide a quantitative comparison to observations made in the EUV and X-ray spectrum.",

Sea ice melt and formation are thus closely coupled with boundary layer clouds and turbulent exchange. Coordinated observations of boundary layer processes and cloud dynamics are sparse in over the Arctic Ocean. This holds especially for observations that extend over the entire ice melt season.\nMeasurements with surface-based remote-sensing instruments and near-surface meteorological sensors as well as through radiosoundings were perfomed during the 3-month Arctic Clouds in Summer Experiment (ACSE) in the East Siberian Arctic Ocean during the summer and early autumn of 2014. We will present a detailed view of cloud and fog properties in connection with boundary layer structure (e.g. inversions, stratification), vertical mixing processes, and the effect of a variety of surface conditions from open water, through marginal ice to dense pack ice on the overlaying cloud layers over. Most of the observed clouds showed a base height of 300 m or less. Strongly stable near-surface conditions with fog were often observed during the beginning of the cruise (summer season), whereas deeper surface-based mixed layers capped by mixed-phase clouds occured more frequently in autumn.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the linkages between energy and water cycles through evapotranspiration (ET) in the western U.S. is uniquely challenging given the climatic and ecological heterogeneity coupled with the added complexities of population growth, land use change and ongoing disturbance (beetle infestation, wildfire, etc.). A number of models have been developed to estimate ET based primarily on remote-sensing observations [MODIS global ET (MOD16) and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop)]. However, the scale of MOD16 and SSEBop (1km/monthly) may be too large to provide information on the spatial and temporal variability of ET that occurs over regions with acute or chronic land cover change and precipitation driven fluxes. The current study aims to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of ET utilizing only satellite-based observations by incorporating a previously developed potential evapotranspiration (PET) methodology with satellite-based soil moisture estimates. Initially, remotely-sensed soil moisture observations (AMSR2) are compared to ground-based estimates (AmeriFlux) and land-surface model (NLDAS) outputs at four sites within the Colorado River Basin. Soil moisture estimates are then downscaled to a final 250m resolution to estimate ET. Final values are compared to ground-based estimates, satellite-based estimates (SSEBop, MOD16), as well as land-surface model estimates (NLDAS). Results indicate poor AMSR2 performance, with slightly improved estimates reported by the downscaling approach (average RMSE of 0.076 m3/m3 and 0.065 m3/m3, respectively). However, the approach provides an improved spatial resolution, capable of deciphering small scale changes in soil moisture following a precipitation event. Subsequently calculated ET estimates display patterns representative of the basin’s elevation and vegetative characteristics, with improved spatial resolution and temporal heterogeneity when compared to MOD16 and SSEBop.",

            "abstract": "An interactive tool called the Forest Health Index (FHI) has been developed for the Roaring Fork watershed of Colorado, with the purpose of improving public understanding of local forest management and ecosystem dynamics. The watershed contains large areas of White River National Forest, which plays a significant role in the local economy, particularly for recreation and tourism. Local interest in healthy forests is therefore strong, but public understanding of forest ecosystems is often simplified. This can pose challenges for land managers and researchers seeking a scientifically informed approach to forest restoration, management, and planning. Now in its second iteration, the FHI is a tool designed to help bridge that gap. The FHI uses a suite of indicators to create a numeric rating of forest functionality and change, based on the desired forest state in relation to four categories: Ecological Integrity, Public Health and Safety, Ecosystem Services, and Sustainable Use and Management. The rating is based on data derived from several sources including local weather stations, stream gauge data, SNOTEL sites, and National Forest Service archives. In addition to offering local outreach and education, this project offers broader insight into effective communication methods, as well as into the challenges of using quantitative analysis to rate ecosystem health. Goals of the FHI include its use in schools as a means of using local data and place-based learning to teach basic math and science concepts, improved public understanding of ecological complexity and need for ongoing forest management, and, in the future, its use as a model for outreach tools in other forested communities in the Intermountain West.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide, human activities are exposing all ecosystems to increases in atmospheric CO2, N and temperature. Precipitation also is being altered globally, but increases in precipitation variability and extremes are expected to have greater impacts on ecosystem function than changes in means. Determining how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to precipitation extremes (i.e., drought) is key to forecasting future ecosystem structure and function at the global scale. Coordinated multi-site experiments can be invaluable for assessing differential sensitivity of ecosystems (deserts, grasslands, forests, etc.) to precipitation extremes. However, determining treatment levels in these experiments presents unique problems because extremes in precipitation are defined statistically, based on historical context, and thus can differ dramatically among sites. Therefore, while multi-site experiments with fixed treatment levels may be appropriate for assessing ecosystem sensitivity to CO2 or warming, they may provide less mechanistic insight for studying extremes. We propose that for multi-site experiments focused on variability and extremes, the amount of precipitation removed or added to impose precipitation extremes should be site-specific (not fixed across sites) and matched to the historical climate record. Further, because extreme wet and dry years differ from each other in other attributes (event size, number of events, consecutive dry days, etc.) treatments should incorporate realistic alterations in these precipitation attributes as well. We show that for most ecosystem types globally, experimental infrastructure that passively reduces each rainfall event can realistically simulate drought, with the addition of a few large precipitation events realistically simulating extreme wet years. Thus, while treatment levels required to impose extreme precipitation years should vary among ecosystems, alterations in precipitation attributes can be imposed uniformly.",

            "abstract": "In summer-time Arctic coastal waters that are strongly influenced by river run-off, extreme stratification severely limits wind mixing, making it difficult to effectively sample the surface ‘mixed layer’, which can be as shallow as 1 m, from a ship. During two expeditions in southwestern Hudson Bay, off the Nelson, Hayes, and Churchill River estuaries, we confirmed that sampling depth has a strong impact on estimates of ‘surface’ pCO2 and calculated air-sea CO2 fluxes. We determined pCO2 in samples collected from 5 m, using a typical underway system on the ship’s seawater supply; from the ‘surface’ rosette bottle, which was generally between 1 and 3 m; and using a niskin bottle deployed at 1 m and just below the surface from a small boat away from the ship. Our samples confirmed that the error in pCO2 derived from typical ship-board versus small-boat sampling at a single station could be nearly 90 μatm, leading to errors in the calculated air-sea CO2 flux of more than 0.1 mmol/(m2s). Attempting to extrapolate such fluxes over the 6,000,000 km2 area of the Arctic shelves would generate an error approaching a gigamol CO2/s. Averaging the station data over a cruise still resulted in an error of nearly 50% in the total flux estimate. Our results have implications not only for the design and execution of expedition-based sampling, but also for placement of in-situ sensors. Particularly in polar waters, sensors are usually deployed on moorings, well below the surface, to avoid damage and destruction from drifting ice. However, to obtain accurate information on air-sea fluxes in these areas, it is necessary to deploy sensors on ice-capable buoys that can position the sensors in true ‘surface’ waters.",

            "abstract": "Subalkaline intraplate volcanic rocks of the Black Rock Desert (BRD) and Markagunt Plateau (MP) of south-central Utah are a diverse suite of rocks that show marked geochemical differences with other intraplate volcanic suites. Previous studies of major and trace element bulk rock geochemistry show a diverse range of geologic settings operating in the region including pre-rift, oceanic (mid ocean ridge), and continental plate subduction. These studies have also established the MP and BRD to be a complicated ‘transition zone’. Previous bulk rock studies suffer from homogenization of phenocrysts/xenocrysts with the melt/groundmass eliminating the subtle differences of these unique chemical markers. In situ analyses of glass and individual crystals have never been carried out for this suite of rocks, to this end we have carried out in situ analysis of olivine grains and basaltic glass for samples throughout the region. Our initial results show there are quantifiable differences between major, trace, and REE distributions for both crystals and glass across both fields, as well as variability within individual fields. Additionally, our results suggest differences in mantle redox conditions exist below the MP and BRD. These preliminary results also demonstrate that in situ analysis allows for better interpretation of complex geochemical settings, like the MP and BRD of Utah. Continual work with this suite of rocks will improve our understanding of the mantle and history of intraplate volcanism within this region including the possibility of slab windows, plumes, and/or enriched mantle sources. Additionally this research will direct future studies ranging from volcanic hazard potential of Utah, to locating and developing geothermal resources.",

            "abstract": "Acetone is one of the most abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere, but estimates of the global source of acetone vary widely. A better understanding of acetone sources is essential because acetone serves as a source of HOx in the upper troposphere and as a precursor to the NOx reservoir species peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Although there are primary anthropogenic and pyrogenic sources of acetone, the dominant acetone sources are thought to be from direct biogenic emissions and photochemical production, particularly from the oxidation of iso-alkanes. Recent work suggests that the photochemical degradation of monoterpenes may also represent a significant contribution to global acetone production. We investigate that hypothesis using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model.\nIn this work, we calculate the emissions of eight terpene species (α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, Δ3-carene, myrcene, sabinene, trans-β-ocimene, and an ‘other monoterpenes’ category which contains 34 other trace species) and couple these with upper and lower bound literature yields from species-specific chamber studies. We compare the simulated acetone distributions against in situ acetone measurements from a global suite of NASA aircraft campaigns. When simulating an upper bound on yields, the model-to-measurement comparison improves for North America at both the surface and in the upper troposphere. The inclusion of acetone production from monoterpene degradation also improves the ability of the model to reproduce observations of acetone in East Asian outflow. However, in general the addition of monoterpenes degrades the model comparison for the Southern Hemisphere.",

One study even suggested that individuals respond markedly better to infographic messages than text-based messages regardless of their learning style or visual literacy.

They are crucial components of larger Earth system models that are aimed at understanding the effects of land surface processes on the global carbon cycle. The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) is the land-surface model used by the UK Met Office. It has been automatically differentiated using commercial software from FastOpt, resulting in an analytical gradient, or ‘adjoint’, of the model. Using this adjoint, the adJULES parameter estimation system has been developed, to search for locally optimum parameter sets by calibrating against observations. adJULES presents an opportunity to confront JULES with many different observations, and make improvements to the model parameterisation. In the newest version of adJULES, multiple sites can be used in the calibration, to giving a generic set of parameters that can be generalised over plant functional types. We present an introduction to the adJULES system and its applications to data from a variety of flux tower sites. We show that calculation of the 2nd derivative of JULES allows us to produce posterior probability density functions of the parameters and how knowledge of parameter values is constrained by observations.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, shear wave splitting (SWS) parameters (fast polarization orientations and splitting times) have been widely measured to reveal the orientation and strength of mantle anisotropy. One of the most popularly used techniques for obtaining station averaged SWS parameters is the multiple-event stacking technique (MES). Results from previous studies suggest that the splitting times obtained using MES are frequently smaller than those derived from simple averaging of splitting times obtained using the event-specific technique of Silver and Chan (1991) (SC). To confirm such apparent discrepancies between the two popularly used methods and to explore the causes, we conduct numerical experiments using both synthetic and observed data. The results show that when the anisotropic structure can be represented by a horizontal single layer of anisotropy with constant or spatially varying splitting times, MES can accurately retrieve the splitting parameters. However, when the fast orientations or both splitting parameters vary azimuthally due to lateral heterogeneities or double-layer anisotropy, the station averaged fast orientations from MES and SC are mostly comparable, but the splitting times obtained using MES are underestimated. For laterally varying fast orientations in the vicinity of a station, the magnitude of the underestimation is dependent on the arriving azimuth of the events participated in the stacking; for two-layer models of anisotropy, the resulting splitting parameters using MES are biased towards those of the top layer, due to the dominance of events with a back azimuth parallel or orthogonal to the fast orientation of the lower layer. Obviously, MES can still be applied in areas with complex or spatially varying anisotropy to obtain reliable results by stacking events from narrow back-azimuthal windows, especially when limited amounts of high-quality data are present.",

            "abstract": "Ground deformation at active volcanoes is one of the key precursors of volcanic unrest, monitored by InSAR and GPS techniques at high spatial and temporal resolution, respectively. Modelling of the observed displacements establishes the link between them and the underlying subsurface processes and volume change. The so-called Mogi model and the rectangular dislocation are two commonly applied analytical solutions that allow for quick interpretations based on the location, depth and volume change of pressurized spherical cavities and planar intrusions, respectively. Geological observations worldwide, however, suggest elongated, tabular or other non-equidimensional geometries for the magma chambers. How can these be modelled? Generalized models such as the Davis’s point ellipsoidal cavity or the rectangular dislocation solutions, are geometrically limited and could barely improve the interpretation of data.\nWe develop a new analytical artefact-free solution for a rectangular dislocation, which also possesses full rotational degrees of freedom. We construct a kinematic model in terms of three pairwise-perpendicular rectangular dislocations with a prescribed opening only. This model represents a generalized point source in the far field, and also performs as a finite dislocation model for planar intrusions in the near field. We show that through calculating the Eshelby’s shape tensor the far-field displacements and stresses of any arbitrary triaxial ellipsoidal cavity can be reproduced by using this model. Regardless of its aspect ratios, the volume change of this model is simply the sum of the volume change of the individual dislocations. Our model can be integrated in any inversion scheme as simply as the Mogi model, profiting at the same time from the advantages of a generalized point source.\nAfter evaluating our model by using a boundary element method code, we apply it to ground displacements of the 2015 Calbuco eruption, Chile, observed by the Sentinel-1 satellite. We infer the parameters of a deflating elongated source located beneath Calbuco, and find significant differences to Mogi type solutions. The results imply that interpretations based on our model may help us better understand source characteristics, and in the case of Calubuco volcano infer a volcano-tectonic coupling mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how water and solutes move through watersheds and the associated travel times remains a key research frontier in hydrology. Here we integrate long-term data (6 years of weekly isotope measurements in rainfall and runoff) into a tracer-aided conceptual modelling approach to provide fresh insights into the complex interrelationships between catchment storage dynamics, hydrological connectivity and resulting non-stationary stream water ages. We show that in a wet Scottish upland catchment dominated by runoff generation from riparian peats (histosols) with high water storage capacity, the storage dynamics of different landscape units (e.g. hillslope vs. riparian zones) regulate both mixing processes and the strength of hydrological connectivity that govern water and solute fluxes and determine catchment travel times. We also found that the frequency and longevity of hydrological connectivity and the associated relative importance of dynamic flow paths control the contribution of younger (< 1 month) or older (>4 years) waters to the stream. Water and solute transport is mainly facilitated by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network even during smaller events. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff “switches off” and stream water is dominated by older groundwater. The saturated riparian soils represent large mixing zones that buffer the time variance of water age and act as “isostats” damping variable inputs. These zones also integrate catchment-scale partial mixing processes. Although simulations depend on model performance, which is influenced by stochastic variation in isotope inputs, a longer-term storage analysis using this tracer-aided model allowed us to examine the sensitivity of the catchment response and transit times to extreme hydroclimatic variability. These insights were validated using a more recent high resolution dataset (3 years of daily isotope data) which also improved constraints on water age and storage estimates.",

Based on this mapping and on geological data, we have identified forty cumulative tectonic displacements ranging from few meters to several kilometres allowing to decipher how deformations have affected this area over the Pliocene to the present-day situation.\nThe Late Pleistocene period was mainly investigated using 36Cl-exposure dating of displaced geomorphic markers combined with the existing chronologies of the glacial-interglacial landscape evolution in the area (e.g Monegato et al., 2007 ; Fontana et al., 2008). The presented results yield 3.1±0.9 mm/yr of active right-lateral faulting along the Northern Dinarides.

The ADVANCE program aims to increase the number of women on the faculty in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) departments through grants to individuals and to entire institutions. These grants target a change in institutional culture so that faculty from non-majority groups will succeed and thrive. Mentoring programs are generally designed to fit the particular institution(s) or target population (e.g., meteorologists at the beginning of their careers). A successful mentoring program makes the implicit knowledge necessary for faculty success explicit: policies and practices are made transparent; routes for finding answers are clarified or generated with faculty input; faculty overcome a sense of isolation and develop a community. Mentoring programs may be formal, with assigned mentors and mentees, or informal, with opportunities for beginning, middle and advanced career STEM faculty to mingle, generally over food and sometimes with a formal speaker. The programs are formally evaluated; in general, attention to mentoring generates better outcomes for all faculty. Research indicates that most successful scientists have a network of mentors rather than relying on one person to help navigate department, institution, and profession.\nThe University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s (UNL) award, ADVANCE-Nebraska, offered opportunities for faculty to informally network over luncheons with women speakers, advanced in their careers. We also offered after-hours networking receptions. In response to faculty feedback, we shifted to a series of panel discussions entitled “Conversations”. Most panels were conducted by successful UNL faculty; about one-third had an outside expert on a given topic. Topics were chosen based on faculty feedback and targeted specifically to beginning faculty (How to Start Up a Lab; How to Balance Teaching and Writing), mid-career faculty (Putting Together Your Promotion Packet; Balancing Service and Innovation); and/or fully promoted faculty (Professional Society Service; Successful Award Nomination Packets). One unexpected outcome from the panel discussions was the development of collaborations among faculty across departments and colleges.",

While much work has been done to improve spatial-temporal estimates of agricultural changes, we still know more about the extent of row-crop agriculture than livestock-grazed land. The gap between cropland and pastureland estimates exists largely because it is challenging to characterize natural versus grazed grasslands from a remote sensing perspective. However, the impasse of pastureland estimates is set to break, with an increasing number of spaceborne sensors and freely available satellite data. The Landsat satellite archive in particular provides researchers with immense amounts of data to improve pastureland information. Here we focus on South America, where pastureland expansion has been scrutinized for the past few decades. We explore the challenges of estimating pastureland using temporal Landsat imagery and focus on key agricultural countries, regions, and ecosystems. We focus on the suggested shift of pastureland from the Argentine Pampas to northern Argentina, and the mixing of small-scale and large-scale ranching in eastern Paraguay and how it could impact the Chaco forest to the west. Further, the Beni Savannahs of northern Bolivia and the Colombian Llanos—both grassland and savannah regions historically used for livestock grazing—have been hinted at as future areas for cropland expansion. There are certainly environmental concerns with pastureland expansion into forests; but what are the environmental implications when well-managed pasture systems are converted to intensive soybean or palm oil plantation? Tropical, grazed grasslands are important habitats for biodiversity, and pasturelands can mitigate soil erosion when well managed. Thus, we must improve estimates of grazed land before we can make informed policy and conservation decisions. This talk presents insights into pastureland estimates in South America and discusses the feasibility to improve current areal, land use, and scale estimates of livestock grazing using satellite imagery.",

            "abstract": "For vegetation canopies of sufficient density, the effect of canopy elements on the flow can be parameterized as a distributed drag calculated as the product of the square of velocity, the canopy density and a drag coefficient. The high-order turbulence statistics are sensitive to the dependence of drag coefficient on velocity, and therefore an accurate drag coefficient model is critical for large-eddy simulation (LES) models to reproduce the structure of turbulence and the transport of scalars within and above the canopy. For statistically stationary flows over a horizontally homogeneous canopy, the mean canopy drag balances the vertical gradient of mean vertical momentum flux and the streamwise mean pressure gradient. Direct measurements of the pressure gradient are unavailable for terrestrial canopies, and thus traditional estimates of the mean drag are only reliable for the upper canopy region, where the streamwise mean pressure gradient is negligible in the force balance. In this work, a practical approach is proposed to fit the streamwise mean pressure gradient, which then provides reliable estimates of the mean drag for the lower canopy region. The resulting relationship between a preliminary estimate of the drag coefficient and the characteristic velocity scale resembles the imposed drag coefficient models. Starting from the preliminary estimate, iterative approaches are proposed for drag coefficient models following a power-law or a capped power-law of velocity, which represent the effect of bending and streamlining of flexible canopy elements. Compared with the traditional approach that typically underestimates the power-law exponent by 20%--40%, the iterative approaches require the same input data (i.e., instantaneous velocity obtained at grids that are sufficient to resolve the vertical gradient of mean vertical momentum flux within the canopy), but yield remarkable improvement in estimating the drag coefficients.",

            "abstract": "Businesses are bound to play an integral role in global and local climate change adaptation efforts, and integrating climate science into business decision-making can help protect companies’ bottom-line and the communities which they depend upon. Yet many companies do not have good means to measure and manage climate risks. There are inherent limiting factors to incorporating climate data into existing operations and sourcing strategies. Spatial and temporal incongruities between climate and business models can make integration cumbersome. Even when such incongruities are resolved, raw climate data must undergo multiple transformations until the data is deemed actionable or otherwise translatable in dollar terms. However, the predictability of future impacts is advancing along with the use of second-order variables such as Cooling Degree Days and Water-Limited Crop productivity, helping business managers make better decisions about future energy and water demand requirements under the prospect of rising temperatures and more variable rainfall. This presentation will discuss the methods and opportunities for transforming raw climate data into business metrics. Results for the 2015 Corporate Adaptation Survey, led by Four Twenty Seven and in partnership with Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, will also be presented to illustrate existing gaps between climate science and its application in the business context.",

            "abstract": "We present here a study of the Saturn’s 1990 equatorial major storm based on numerical simulations. Six planetary scale storms, nicknamed as Great White Spots (GWS) have been observed since the nineteenth century, three of them at the equatorial region in 1876 (~ +8º), 1933 (~ +2º), and 1990 (+12º), on the broad prograde equatorial jet where equatorial dynamics dominated producing a storm nucleus, with rapid expansion to the east and west to become a planetary-scale disturbance (Sánchez-Lavega, CHAOS 4, 341-353, 1994). We have detailed information, ground-based CCD imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, for the 1990 event. Numerical experiments on the 1990 storm indicate that the onset of the storm can only be reproduced if the Voyager era background zonal flow is used, which suggests that it dominated the circulation dynamics at the storm’s outbreak region at that time. We review the possible impact of the 1990 storm on the equatorial jet, storm dynamics, and how it relates to the observed storm morphology and zonal wind measurements derived from HST observations (Barnet et al., Icarus 100, 499-511, 1992). Observations also describe the formation of equatorial planetary waves and instabilities during the disturbance. We discuss the impact of major energy and mass injection by a planetary-scale convective event on the equatorial dynamics following our simulation results.",

            "abstract": "Brazil is developing its own atmosphere-ocean-biosphere-cryosphere Global Circulation Model - the Brazilian Earth System Model (BESM). BESM simulations demonstrate potential results on global climate change. Brazilian climate modeling community can significantly contribute to the international efforts on global climate change research. Currently, the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies of the National Institute for Space Research (CPTEC/INPE), Brazil is implementing and testing the aerosol component in BESM. A priori knowledge of the overall performance of the existing state-of-the-art aerosol models is necessary for the implementation. This work analyzes the performance of the aerosol component, their distribution over Brazil in particular, of two Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCM), the European Centre’s Model - Hamburg Aerosol Model (ECHAM-HAM) and the Community Atmosphere Model - Modal Aerosol Model (CAM5-MAM3) against the observations. We evaluated the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from both the simulations and Angström exponent from ECHAM-HAM. The results are compared with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground station measurements, and satellite observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study was done for four cities in Brazil - São Paulo, Cuiabá, Rio Branco, and Alta Floresta during 2001-2006. Both models underestimate AOD for all the four cities. However, CAM5-MAM3 has greater negative bias in the Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil where biomass burning is more frequent during the dry season. Better performance is seen during January-June and November-December, but not consistent during July to October (i.e., the dry season), when fire occurrences are more frequent. CAM5-MAM3 model has small negative bias for this period. The Angström parameter is reasonably reproduced by ECHAM-HAM, except for Cuiabá, indicating that the particle size distribution is correctly represented in most cities.",

            "abstract": "Floods constitute one of the most significant and frequent natural hazard in mountainous regions. Satellite-based precipitation products offer in many cases the only available source of QPE. However, satellite-based QPE over complex terrain suffer from significant bias that limits their applicability for hydrologic modeling. In this work we investigate the potential of a new correction procedure, which involves the use of high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model simulations to adjust satellite QPE. Adjustment is based on the pdf matching of satellite and NWP (used as reference) precipitation distribution. The impact of correction procedure on simulating the hydrologic response is examined for 15 storm events that generated floods over the mountainous Upper Adige region of Northern Italy. Atmospheric simulations were performed at 1-km resolution from a state-of-the-art atmospheric model (RAMS/ICLAMS). The proposed error correction procedure was then applied on the widely used TRMM 3B42 satellite precipitation product and the evaluation of the correction was based on independent in situ precipitation measurements from a dense rain gauge network (1 gauge / 70 km2) available in the study area. Satellite QPE, before and after correction, are used to simulate flood response using ARFFS (Adige River Flood Forecasting System), a semi-distributed hydrologic model, which is used for operational flood forecasting in the region. Results showed that bias in satellite QPE before correction was significant and had a tremendous impact on the simulation of flood peak, however the correction procedure was able to reduce bias in QPE and therefore improve considerably the simulated flood hydrograph.",

            "abstract": "Quartz commonly displays cathodoluminescence (CL) zoning correlated with elevated Ti concentrations. This zoning has been attributed to changes in magmatic intensive variables, suggesting for example, that in the Bishop Tuff (BT) magma bodies, bright-CL rims on quartz phenocrysts grew during a late-stage eruption-triggering thermal event. Yet, these rims are not ubiquitous, discounting their origin by variation in equilibrium growth conditions.\nHuang & Audetat (2012) suggest that Ti contents in quartz depend strongly on growth rate. Diffusion chronometry indicates that BT bright-CL quartz rims crystallized rapidly (days-weeks) at growth rates of 10-7-10-8 m/s, while interiors grew over centennial-millennial timescales (10-11-10-13 m/s). This result is consistent with CSD analyses that suggest eruptive decompression began <1 year before eruption.\nWe use a numerical model based on the crystal growth equation of Lasaga (1982) to test if BT bright-CL rims could have resulted from elevated syn-eruptive growth rates. Results indicate that Ti contents at the quartz-melt boundary are strongly dependent on growth rate if it exceeds ~10-9 m/s. At 10-8 m/s, enrichment of 1.5-2.5 times the initial concentration is achieved at the boundary in a time frame of days-a week. At 10-7 m/s, enrichment jumps to 4-8 times over the same period. BT quartz interiors contain ~50 ppm Ti, while bright-CL rims have ~75-100 ppm (Wark et al. 2007). Our modeling successfully reproduces these concentrations using the growth rates, and over the timescales, indicated by diffusion chronometry. It also suggests that the rims grew chiefly at a rate of ~10-8 m/s; slower rates do not produce enrichment, and faster rates result in over-enrichment, relative to that observed in natural crystals. We conclude that high-Ti, bright-CL rims on BT quartz resulted from increased growth rates due to eruptive decompression, rather than late-stage fluctuations in magmatic intensive variables, over timescales of days to weeks.",

Previous efforts have emphasized the magnitude of export-related emissions; however, their health consequences on the Chinese population have not been quantified. Here, we present an interdisciplinary study to estimate the health impact of export-related air pollution. The results show that export-related emissions elevated the annual mean population weighted PM2.5 by 8.3mg/m3 (15% of the total) in 2007, causing 157,000 deaths and accounting for 12% of the total mortality attributable to PM2.5-related air pollution. Compared to the eastern coastal provinces, the inner regions experience much larger export-related health losses relative to their economic production gains, owing to huge inter-regional disparities in export structures and technology levels. A shift away from emission-intensive production structure and export patterns, especially in inner regions, could significantly help improve national exports while alleviating the inter-regional cost-benefit inequality. Our results provide the first quantification of health consequences from air pollution related to Chinese exports. The proposed policy recommendations, based on health burden, economic production gains and emission analysis, would be helpful to develop more sustainable and effective national and regional export strategies.",

            "abstract": "The recent tsunamigenic Tohoku earthquake (2011) strongly affirms, again, after the 26 December 2004, the necessity to open new paradigms in oceanic monitoring. Detection of ionospheric anomalies following the Sumatra earthquake tsunami (e.g., Occhipinti et al. 2006) demonstrated that ionosphere is sensitive to earthquake and tsunami propagation: ground and oceanic vertical displacement induces acoustic-gravity waves propagating within the neutral atmosphere and detectable in the ionosphere. Observations supported by modelling proved that tsunamigenic ionospheric anomalies are deterministic and reproducible by numerical modeling via the ocean/neutral-atmosphere/ionosphere coupling mechanism (Occhipinti et al., 2008). To prove that the tsunami signature in the ionosphere is routinely detected we show here perturbations of total electron content (TEC) measured by GPS and following tsunamigenic eartquakes from 2004 to 2010 (Rolland et al. 2010, Occhipinti et al., 2013), nominally, Sumatra (26 December, 2004 and 12 September, 2007), Chile (14 November, 2007), Samoa (29 September, 2009) and the recent Tohoku-Oki (11 Mars, 2011). In addition to GPS/TEC observations close to the epicenter and measured by GEONET network, new exciting measurements in the far-field were performed by Airglow measurement in Hawaii: those measurements show the propagation of the IGWs induced by the Tohoku tsunami in the Pacific Ocean (Occhipinti et al., 2011). Based on the observations close to the epicenter, mainly performed by GPS networks located in Sumatra, Chile and Japan, we highlight the TEC perturbation observed within the first hour after the seismic rupture. This perturbation contains informations about the ground displacement, as well as the consequent sea surface displacement resulting in the tsunami. In this talk we present all this new tsunami observations in the ionosphere and we discuss, under the light of modelling, the potential role of ionospheric sounding in the oceanic monitoring and future tsunami warning system by GPS, Airglow and OTH radar (Coisson et al., 2011).

            "abstract": "Seasonal sea ice prediction is challenging because of high variability in diverse atmospheric and oceanic influences, and because the Arctic climate is changing in ways without precedent for at least the past millennium. A recent modeling study that employed a prognostic melt pond model in a stand-alone sea ice model found that September Arctic sea ice extent can be accurately predicted from the melt pond fraction in May. Here we show that satellite observations do not support the model-based finding that the melt pond fraction in May has the strongest impact on September sea ice extent. Instead, we see no evidence of predictive skill in May. We find that a significantly strong relationship first emerges as the melt pond fraction is integrated from early May to late June, with a persistent strong relationship only occurring after late July. Our results highlight that late spring to mid summer melt pond information is required to improve the prediction skill of the seasonal sea ice minimum. Furthermore, satellite observations indicate a much higher percentage of melt pond formation in May than does the aforementioned model simulation, which points to the need to reconcile model simulations and observations, in order to better understand key mechanisms of melt pond formation and evolution and their influence on sea ice state.",

            "abstract": "This study develops a novel methodology to resolve the cause of typhoon-induced precipitation using principle component analysis (PCA) and to develop a long lead-time precipitation prediction model. The discovered spatial and temporal features of rainfall are utilized to develop a state-of-the-art descriptive statistical model which can be used to predict long lead-time precipitation during typhoons. The time series of 12-hour precipitation from different types of invasive moving track of typhoons are respectively precede the signal analytical process to qualify the causes of rainfall and to quantify affected degree of each induced cause. The causes include: (1) interaction between typhoon rain band and terrain; (2) co-movement effect induced by typhoon wind field with monsoon; (3) pressure gradient; (4) wind velocity; (5) temperature environment; (6) characteristic distance between typhoon center and surface target station; (7) distance between grade 7 storm radius and surface target station; and (8) relative humidity. The results obtained from PCA can detect the hidden pattern of the eight causes in space and time and can understand the future trends and changes of precipitation. This study applies the developed methodology in Taiwan Island which is constituted by complex diverse terrain formation and height. Results show that: (1) for the typhoon moving toward the direction of 245° to 330°, Causes (1), (2) and (6) are the primary ones to generate rainfall; and (2) for the direction of 330° to 380°, Causes (1), (4) and (6) are the primary ones. Besides, the developed precipitation prediction model by using PCA with the distributed moving track approach (PCA-DMT) is 32% more accurate by that of PCA without distributed moving track approach, and the former model can effectively achieve long lead-time precipitation prediction with an average predicted error of 13% within average 48 hours of forecasted lead-time.",

A key example is the extremely large WWV that appeared in the spring of 2014 that failed to develop into the expected strong El Niño in the following seasons. While the ability of sea surface temperature (SST) to influence the atmosphere has been long demonstrated in numerous modeling and observational studies, the precise mechanisms by which the atmosphere feeds back to the ocean to enhance or suppress ENSO development is still unclear. Such atmospheric impacts are examined here for the 2014 El Niño in the context of coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulations, leading to the identification of ENSO predictability.",

            "abstract": "Waves of various spatial and temporal scales, including acoustic waves, gravity waves, tides, and planetary waves, modify the dynamics of the terrestrial atmosphere at all altitudes. Perturbations caused by the natural and mankind activities on the ground, such as volcano eruptions, earthquakes, explosions, propagate upward and impact the upper atmosphere. Among these waves, propagation of the atmospheric acoustic waves is particularly sensitive to the fine structure of the background atmosphere. However, the fine-structured gravity waves (smaller than 1° x 1°) are currently poorly measured especially at the altitudes above 100 km and are computationally too expensive for most models to incorporate properly. The Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) allows for non-hydrostatic solutions and has a flexible resolution. Thus, it is ideal for the study of vertical propagating waves. In this study, the ionospheric and thermospheric response to acoustic-gravity waves is first presented with an artificial source of various frequencies, followed by a case study of the 2014 Tohoku tsunami. Additionally a time-varying spectral gravity wavefield propagated from the ground is implemented into GITM to capture the statistical background structures that is crucial to the upper atmospheric models. Our results show the importance of consideration of background small-scale structures to interpretation of the observed ionospheric and thermospheric perturbations, such as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and traveling atmospheric disturbances (TADs).",

The CMEs can be associated with interplanetary shocks and this associated with type II radio-burst emissions. Some of the CMEs carry a magnetic configuration that can generate geomagnetic storm, the main interest in space weather. It is therefore important to predict arrival times of CMEs that are potential to generate a geomagnetic storm. We used a number of hydrodynamic (viscous and inertial) drag force models to approximate the trajectory of a CME. We focus on obtaining proportionality constants to achieve good approximations to CME arrivals. We analized a set of fast CMEs by finding the appropiate drag coefficients that simultaneusly approximated: the in-situ arrivals of the events, their associated type II radio-burst and satellite observations of these phenomena. Our results suggest that quadratic and inertial drag are the dynamic agent that prevails for fast CMEs propagation. Our studies may contribute to future ‘space weather forescasting’ at the Earth.",

            "abstract": "The lack of energy balance closure is a long-standing problem in eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The energy balance equation is defined as Rn – G = H + λE, where Rn is net radiation, G is the ground heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux and λE is the latent heat flux. In most cases of energy imbalance, either Rn is overestimated or the ground heat and turbulent fluxes are underestimated. Multiple studies have shown that calculations, incorrect instrument installation/calibration and measurement errors alone do not entirely account for this imbalance. Rather, research is now focused on previously neglected sources of heat storage in the soil, biomass and air beneath the EC station. This project examined the potential of five “minor flux terms” – soil heat storage, biomass heat storage, energy consumption by photosynthesis, air heat storage and atmospheric moisture change, to further close the energy balance gap. Eddy covariance measurements were conducted at a maize (Zea mays) field in southwest Germany during summer 2014. Soil heat storage was measured for six weeks at 11 sites around the field footprint. Biomass and air heat storage were measured for six subsequent weeks at seven sites around the field footprint. Energy consumption by photosynthesis was calculated using the CO2 flux data. Evapotranspiration was calculated using the water balance method and then compared to the flux data processed with three post-closure methods: the sensible heat flux, the latent heat flux and the Bowen ratio post-closure methods. An energy balance closure of 66% was achieved by the EC station measurements over the entire investigation period. During the soil heat flux campaign, EC station closure was 74.1%, and the field footprint soil heat storage contributed 3.3% additional closure. During the second minor flux term measurement period, closure with the EC station data was 91%. Biomass heat storage resulted in 1.1% additional closure, the photosynthesis flux closed the gap by an additional 7.8%, air heat storage closure was -0.3% and atmospheric moisture change was negligible with an additional closure of <0.01%. These four terms resulted in a total additional closure of 8.6% over the EC station measurements. The Bowen Ratio post-closure method yielded values most similar to the water balance method over the entire season.",

            "abstract": "This study reports oxygen isotope ratios determined by laser fluorination of mineral separates and in situ Sr isotope ratios (mainly plagioclase) from andesitic to dacitic composition lava flows erupted from Volcán Uturuncu in the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). Variation in δ18O values (6.6-11.8‰ relative to SMOW) for the lava suite is large and the data as a whole exhibit no simple correlation with any parameter of compositional evolution. Plagioclase separates from nearly all rocks have δ18O values (6.6-11.8‰) higher than expected for production of the magmas by partial melting of little evolved basaltic lavas erupted in the back arc regions of the CVZ. Most Uturuncu magmas must therefore contain high 18O crustal material. This hypothesis is further supported by textures and isotopic variation (87Sr/86Sr= 0.7098-0.7165) within single plagioclase phenocrysts suggesting repeated mixing followed by crustal contamination events occurring in the shallow crustal reservoir. The dacite composition rocks show more variable and extend to higher δ18O ratios than andesite composition rocks. These features are interpreted to reflect assimilation of heterogeneous upper continental crust by low 18O andesitic magmas followed by mixing or mingling with similar composition hybrid magmas with high 18O. Conversely, the δ18O values of the andesites suggest contamination of the magmas by continental crust modified by intrusion of mantle derived basaltic magmas. These results demonstrate on a relatively small scale the strong influence that intrusion of mantle-derived mafic magmas can have on modifying the composition of pre-existing continental crust in regions of melt production. Given this result, similar, but larger-scale, regional trends in magma compositions may reflect an analogous but more extensive process wherein the continental crust becomes progressively hybridized beneath frontal arc localities as a result of protracted intrusion of subduction-related basaltic magmas.",

Oil and gas production in the area have been explored and produced since 1861, and the oldest gas field is still producing gas until now. To understand the nature and the geometry of the reservoirs in this area, 82 wells were drilled in the Chinshui Field, which is one of the important gas fields in the Hsinchu-Miaoli area. However, the subsurface structures and fracture distribution of these fields are still unclear, and the reason for the long time producing is also unknown. Fractures in the oil-bearing reservoir might be one of the important factors of the long time gas producing, but the fracture reservoirs attaining hydrocarbons associated with fault-related folding need to be further clarified.\nFirst, we represent a new structural interpretation of Chinshui and adjacent Chuhuangkeng anticlines by a geological cross section across from Miaoli offshore to inner foothills. By comparing the total shortening distances among several published cross sections and the profile in this study, we construct the deformation pattern model in Hsinchu-Miaoli area. Furthermore, we then use Discrete Element Method (DEM) to reconstruct the evolution model of the Chinshui anticline based on the cross sections in the study area. This model can provide fracture densities of Chinshui anticline and also the geometry of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs.\nAccording to the result of our restoration, the total shortening distance of the geological cross section is about 20.3km and the entire slip of the deep thrust faults in Chinshui anticline is 5.8 km. This result is similar with previous published cross sections around this region. And the structural evolution of Chinshui anticline would further apply in the model of fracture distribution and densities.",

            "abstract": "In the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the presence of a plant canopy significantly changes the dynamics of the flow and these changes can have an important impact on the turbulent transport of momentum, heat, gases and particles. In numerical studies using the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) technique, resolving the flow inside the canopy requires fine grid resolutions. For simulation of the entire ABL, this can lead to high computational cost. In coarser LES and in large-scale atmospheric models, the effect of the plant canopy is usually represented as a roughness length scale applied to the wall model. However, the effect of plants in turbulent transport is much more complex than a simple “enhanced roughness”. In this work we evaluate the use of the One-Dimensional Turbulence (ODT) model as a wall model for LES of ABL flows. In particular, we focus in application in which the flow inside and immediately above the canopy is resolved in the ODT model, which is then two-way coupled with a coarser LES. The ODT model resolves the filtered 1-dimensional version of the Navier-Stokes equation in the vertical direction, replacing the non-linear term with a stochastic representation of eddies. In order to use the ODT to represent the canopy flow, a sub-grid scale eddy viscosity model was developed, and the effects of plant canopy and atmospheric thermal stability on the flow were included. The use of the LES-ODT coupling to represent different types of plant canopies is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Compositional and compressible two-phase flow in fractured media has wide applications including CO2 injection. Accurate simulations are currently based on the discrete fracture approach using the cross-flow equilibrium model. In this approach the fractures and a small part of the matrix blocks are combined to form a grid cell. The major drawback is low computational efficiency. In this work we use the discrete-fracture approach to model the fractures where the fracture entities are described explicitly in the computational domain. We use the concept of cross-flow equilibrium in the fractures (FCFE). This allows using large matrix elements in the neighborhood of the fractures. We solve the fracture transport equations implicitly to overcome the Courant-Freidricks-Levy (CFL) condition in the small fracture elements. Our implicit approach is based on calculation of the derivative of the molar concentration of component i in phase (cαi ) with respect to the total molar concentration (ci ) at constant volume V and temperature T. This contributes to significant speed up of the code. The hybrid mixed finite element method (MFE) is used to solve for the velocity in both the matrix and the fractures coupled with the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to solve the species transport equations in the matrix, and a finite volume (FV) discretization in the fractures. In large scale problems the proposed approach is orders of magnitude faster than the existing models.",

The discoveries of the MESSENGER fundamentally changed our view of Mercury. It revealed a surface that has been reshaped by volcanism over large parts of geological history. Volatile elements like sulfur have been detected with unexpectedly high abundances of up to 4%. MESSENGER imagined structures that are most likely formed by pyroclastic eruptions in recent geologic history. Among the most exciting discoveries of MESSENGER are hollows – bright irregularly shaped depressions that show sign of ongoing loss of material.\nBepiColombo will be building on what has been learned from the MESSENGER mission and extend the knowledge. Due to its more circular orbit BepiColombo will provide good spatial resolution for both hemispheres of Mercury. The mission will give us the first good look at the southern hemisphere of the planet.\nAll spectral instruments are imaging and cover a wider spectral range than the instruments on MESSENGER. Some instruments will provide us datasets that have not been obtained by MESSENGER in any form. MERTIS will for example provide the first temperature map of Mercury and will map the surface composition of the planet for the first time in the thermal infrared. The telescopic imaging channel of the XRS instrument will provide elemental composition at an unprecedented spatial resolution.\nThe MESSENGER results will be key to formulate the observation plan for the surface instruments on BepiColombo.

            "abstract": "The ~400 km long and two km high Shillong Plateau is the only major raised topography in the Himalayan foreland. Debates over the timing of uplift and implication for erosion-climate-tectonic couplings, strain partitioning within the Himalaya and the palaeodrainage history of the palaeo-Brahmaputra are important. Grujic et al, (2006) proposed that the uplift of the plateau has affected the exhumation of Himalayan rocks to the north in Bhutan, due to the creation of a regional climatic change in the plateau’s rain shadow. By contrast, Coutand et al. (2014) suggest that the local decrease in erosion rates in the eastern Bhutan Himalaya is best explained by the decrease in overthrusting rates at 5-6 Ma, which might be potentially related to late Miocene to Pliocene changes in the India-southern Eurasia convergence partitioning, with shortening taken up by faults bounding the Shillong Plateau, i.e. by its uplift. The exhumation of the Shillong Plateau has been proposed to initiate by 8–15 Ma (Biswas et al, 2007; Clark & Bilham, 2008) whilst surface uplift, decoupled from exhumation, of Miocene (Chirouze et al 2013), Pliocene (Johnson and Nur Alam 1991; Biswas et al., 2007) and Early Quaternary (Najman et al, in review) have been proposed.\nOur study uses the foreland basin Siwalik sedimentary record preserved to the north of the Shillong Plateau in Bhutan, to constrain the plateau’s uplift history. Provenance is characterized by U-Pb dating on detrital zircons, which allows specifically documenting an Indus-Yarlung suture-zone and therefore paleo-Brahmaputra signature. We document the timing that the palaeo-Brahmaputra was shunted north and west by the rising plateau, using this U/Pb provenance technique to detect first appearance of the river and to a minor degree the Namche Barwa syntaxe signature. The results allow to better constrain the period of uplifting of the Shillong Plateau and thus better inform the implications through a study of the palaeodrainage of the Brahmaputra river.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust directly influences Earth’s climate by altering the radiative balance and by depositing micronutrients in the surface ocean, affecting global biogeochemical cycling. In addition, mineral dust particles provide observational evidence constraining past atmospheric circulation patterns. Because dust can originate from both local and distant terrestrial sources, knowledge of dust provenance can substantially inform our understanding of past climate history, atmospheric transport pathways, and differences in aerosol characteristics between glacial and interglacial climate states.\nDust provenance information from Antarctic ice cores has until now been limited to sites in East Antarctica. Here we present some of the first provenance data from West Antarctica. We use Sr-Nd isotopes to characterize dust extracted from late Holocene ice (~1000-1800 C.E.) from the Siple Dome ice core. The data form a tight array in Sr-Nd isotope space, with 87Sr/86Sr ranging between ~0.7087 and 0.7102, and εNd ranging between ~ -7 and -16. This combination is unique for Antarctica, with low Nd and low Sr isotope ratios compared to high-elevation East Antarctic sites, requiring a dust source from ancient (Archean to early Proterozoic) and unweathered continental crust, which mixes with young volcanic material. Both components are likely sourced from Antarctica. We also observe significant, systematic variability in Sr and Nd isotopic signatures through time, reflecting changes in the mixing ratio of these sources, and hypothesize that these changes are driven by shifts in circulation patterns. A large change occurs over about 10 years at ca. 1125 C.E. (ΔεNd = +3 and Δ87Sr/86Sr = -0.0014). This shift coincides with changes in climate proxies in Southern Hemisphere paleoclimate records reflecting variability in the Westerlies. We therefore interpret the shift in dust provenance at Siple Dome to be related to larger-scale circulation changes. In general, the observed shifts in the particle source signatures indicate that dust transport pathways to and around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are highly responsive to perturbations in atmospheric circulation, and can record rapid shifts in provenance.",

Cast Stone is made of a dry blend 47% blast furnace slag, 45% fly ash, and 8% ordinary Portland cement, mixed with a low-activity waste (LAW). To improve the retention of Tc and/or I in Cast Stone, materials with a high affinity for Tc and/or I, termed “getters,” can be added to provide a stable domain for the radionuclides of concern. Previous testing conducted with a variety of getters has identified Tin(II)-Apatite and Silver Exchanged Zeolite as promising candidates for Tc and I, respectively. Investigation into the sequence in which getters are added to Cast Stone was performed following two methods: 1) adding getters to the Cast Stone dry blend, and then mixing with liquid waste, and 2) adding getters to the liquid waste first, followed by addition of the Cast Stone dry blend. Cast Stone monolith samples were prepared with each method and leach tests, following EPA method 1315, were conducted in either distilled water or simulated vadose zone porewater for a period of up to 63 days. The leachate was analyzed for Tc, I, Na, NO3-, NO2- and Cr with ICP-MS, ICP-OES and ion chromatography and the results indicated that the Cast Stone with getter addition in the dry blend mix (method 1) has lower rates of Tc and I leaching. The mechanisms of radionuclide release from the Cast Stone were also investigated with a variety of solid phase characterization techniques of the monoliths before and after leaching, such as XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM/SAED and other spectroscopic techniques.",

Components of water balances are taken from datasets produced by the GRACE, MODIS, PRISM, and AMSR-E satellites. The GRACE-derived estimates have been tested through comparisons with in-situ measurements. The agreement between the two datasets is good, suggesting that remotely-sensed tools are a flexible, cost-effective alternative to traditional methods of regional groundwater monitoring, e.g., observations of water levels in wells. The study has also compared estimates of total water storage derived from GRACE with an alternate water balance equation that is based on independent data. The results indicate that GRACE measurements can be used effectively in regional groundwater management.",

            "abstract": "Many times each year explosive volcanic eruptions loft ash into the atmosphere. Global travel and trade rely on aircraft vulnerable to encounters with airborne ash. Volcanic ash advisory centers (VAACs) rely on dispersion forecasts and satellite data to issue timely warnings. To improve ash forecasts model developers and satellite data providers need realistic information about volcanic ash microphysical and optical properties. In anticipation of future large eruptions we can study smaller events to improve our remote sensing and modeling skills so when the next Pinatubo 1991 or larger eruption occurs, ash can confidently be tracked in a quantitative way.\nAt distances >100km from their sources, drifting ash plumes, often above meteorological clouds, are not easily detected from conventional remote sensing platforms, save deriving their quantitative characteristics, such as mass density. Quantitative interpretation of these observations depends on a priori knowledge of the spectral optical properties of the ash in UV (>0.3µm) and TIR wavelengths (>10µm). Incorrect assumptions about the optical properties result in large errors in inferred column mass loading and size distribution, which misguide operational ash forecasts. Similarly, simulating ash properties in global climate models also requires some knowledge of optical properties to improve aerosol speciation. \\\nRecent research has identified a wide range in volcanic ash optical properties among samples collected from the ground after different eruptions. The database of samples investigated remains relatively small, and measurements of optical properties at the relevant particle sizes and spectral channels are far from complete. Generalizing optical properties remains elusive, as does establishing relationships between ash composition and optical properties, which are essential for satellite retrievals.\nWe are building a library of volcanic ash optical and microphysical properties. In this presentation we show preliminary results of the measured ash properties. We invite discussion of all aspects essential for building an optical ash database that can be used by modeling and remote sensing communities.

            "abstract": "It is rare for prominence eruptions to be observable far from the Sun in the inner heliosphere, either in imaging or with in situ plasma instruments. Nevertheless, we here discuss two examples of particularly bright eruptions that are continuously trackable all the way to 1 AU by imagers on the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. The two events are from 2011 June 7 and 2012 August 31. Only these two examples of clear prominence eruptions observable this far from the Sun could be found in the STEREO 2007-2014 image database, consistent with the rarity of unambiguous cold prominence material being observed in situ at 1 AU. Full 3-D reconstructions are made of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that accompany the prominence eruptions. For the 2011 June event, a time-dependent 3-D reconstruction of the prominence structure is made using point-by-point triangulation, which unfortunately is not possible for the August event due to a poor viewing geometry. However, for the 2012 August event, shock normals computed from plasma measurements at STEREO-B and Wind using the shock jump conditions agree well with expectations from the image-based CME reconstruction. Unlike its accompanying CME, the 2011 June prominence exhibits little deceleration from the Sun to 1 AU, as a consequence moving upwards within the CME. Detailed analysis of the prominence’s expansion reveals that deviation from self-similar expansion is never large, but close to the Sun the prominence expands somewhat more rapidly than self-similarity, with this effect decreasing with time.",

In this presentation we introduce a new dataset: the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) v2.0, developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center. This new quasi-global precipitation product is available at daily to seasonal time scales, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°, and a 1981 to near real-time period of record. The three main types of information used in the CHIRPS are: (1) global 0.05° precipitation climatologies, (2) gridded precipitation estimates derived from time-varying cold cloud duration, and (3) in situ precipitation observations.\nThe Climate Hazards Group (CHG) has developed an extensive database of in situ daily, pentadal, and monthly precipitation totals with over a billion daily observations worldwide. A screening procedure was developed to flag and remove potential false zeros from the daily GTS and GSOD data. These potentially spurious data can artificially suppress CHIRPS rainfall totals.\nUsing GPCC v7 as the best-available standard, we compare CHIRPS with ARC2, CFS-Reanalysis, CHIRP, CMORPH, CPC-Unified, ECMWF, PERSIANNE, RFE2, TAMSAT, TRMM-RT7, and TRMM-V7. The CHIRPS is shown to have higher correlation, and lower systematic errors (bias) and mean absolute errors with GPCC v7 than the other datasets. Comparison with independent validation data suggests that the CHIRPS performance is similar to research quality products like the GPCC and GPCP, but with higher resolution and lower latency. We conclude by looking at the change in availability of station data within a monitoring time frame, contrasting countries with and without near real time data.",

The enhancement of the ring current particles produces magnetic depressions and disturbances to the Earth's magnetic field known as geomagnetic storms, which have been modeled using the comprehensive inner magnetosphere-ionosphere (CIMI) model. The purpose of this model is to identify and understand the physical processes that control the dynamics of the geomagnetic storms. The basic procedure was to use the CIMI model for the simulation of 15 storms since 2009. Some of the storms were run multiple times, but with varying parameters relating to the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field, particle fluxes, and boundary conditions of the inner-magnetosphere. Results and images were placed in the TWINS online catalog page for further analysis and discussion. Particular areas of interest were extreme storm events. A majority of storms simulated had average DST values of -100 nT; these extreme storms exceeded DST values of -200 nT. The continued use of the CIMI model will increase knowledge of the interactions and processes of the inner-magnetosphere as well as lead to a better understanding of extreme solar storm events for the future advancement of space weather physics.",

            "abstract": "The Snæbýlisheiði unit, SE Iceland, is a ca. 26 km³ elongate, flat-topped ridge of volcaniclastic debris coupled with and intruded by coherent basalt stretching over 34 km from the eruption site perpendicular to the rift fissure source. It formed from a single subglacial flood basalt eruption during a recent glaciation, and its elongation reflects glacial control on dispersal via the hydraulic potential gradient at the glacier's base, which drove towards the glacier terminus the meltwater+debris formed during the eruption by quenching and fragmentation. High magma discharge and outgassing drove segregation of magma into down-flow propagating intrusions. Edifice growth was mediated by the extent of ice melting, extent and efficiency of meltwater+debris drainage, and hydraulic gradients locally favoring meltwater accumulation. Eruption style reflected magma flux, edifice stability, and accessibility of water to the vent area via flooding or infiltration. Deposits reflect these competing factors in their chaotic internal organization and stratigraphy, limited lithofacies continuity, and diverse particle populations from multiple source vents. Linear growth of the ridge down-gradient from the eruption site was driven primarily by propagation and continuous fragmentation of shoaling intrusions that formed an interconnected intrusive complex with extensive peperites. Advance was along gently meandering and locally bifurcating sub-ice conduits within hyaloclastite with sheet-lobe levees and lobate fingered intrusions. Irregular dikes, apophyses, horns, and tendrils extended from the main body and generated voluminous lapilli tuff and contorticlasts while providing additional heat to the system. Prolonged transport and deposition of debris produced complexly bedded volcaniclastic deposits derived from and intruded by the basalt sheet. The bedding and depositional features of volcaniclastic debris and relationship to their adjacent intrusions suggest transport and deposition through a complex network of migrating and converging tunnels evolving with time under multiple flow regimes and sudden outbursts floods, rather than from a single jökulhlaup or within a single tunnel.",

            "abstract": "Large wood along rivers influences entrainment, transport, and storage of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter. We review how wood alters sediment dynamics and explore patterns among volumes of instream wood, sediment storage, and residual pools for dispersed pieces of wood, logjams, and beaver dams. We hypothesized that: volume of sediment per unit area of channel stored in association with wood is inversely proportional to drainage area; the form of sediment storage changes downstream; sediment storage correlates most strongly with wood load; and volume of sediment stored behind beaver dams correlates with pond area. Lack of data from larger drainage areas limits tests of these hypotheses, but analyses suggest a negative correlation between sediment volume and drainage area and a positive correlation between wood and sediment volume. The form of sediment storage in relation to wood changes downstream, with wedges of sediment upstream from jammed steps most prevalent in small, steep channels and more dispersed sediment storage in lower gradient channels. Use of a published relation between sediment volume, channel width, and gradient predicted about half of the variation in sediment stored upstream from jammed steps. Sediment volume correlates well with beaver pond area. Historically more abundant instream wood and beaver populations likely equated to greater sediment storage within river corridors. This review of the existing literature on wood and sediment dynamics highlights the lack of studies on larger rivers.",

            "abstract": "Data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) was used to study the development of the global Birkeland currents. The integrated total current was used to identify onsets of Birkeland currents preceded by periods of quiescence. Onset events were identified automatically by requiring quiescence for three hours preceding onset, an increase of a specified total current within 40 minutes, and sustained enhanced total current for 30 minutes. Three ranges of total current increase were chosen representing equal numbers of events: 1 to 1.2 MA; 1.2 to 1.5 MA, and greater than 1.5 MA. A Fermi function fit to the total current was used to identify an objective onset time used in superposed epoch analysis. The current onsets are closely correlated with enhancements of magnetospheric forcing as indicated by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BZ and the solar wind electric field. The dayside current quiescent baseline is seasonally dependent but the time profile preceding and through onset is consistent for all seasons. The average nightside total current baseline and onset profile are independent of season. The nightside onset is delayed relative to the increase of the dayside current and is 2.8 times more rapid than the dayside current increase. The fit AMPERE magnetic perturbations and radial currents were averaged to determine the average spatial development of the currents. While the dayside patterns of Birkeland currents depend on the IMF as expected for convection dependence on IMF BY, the nightside current distributions develop consistently regardless of the sign of the IMF BY and display a persistent Harang discontinuity signature. The analyses reveal that the development and intensification of nightside currents corresponds to strengthening of the currents at all local times. Unexpectedly, the strongest nightside onset occurs first in the post-midnight sector and not near the average sub-storm onset local time.",

            "abstract": "Multiscale fluctuations in large and complex data are usually characterized by a power law with a scaling exponent but many systems require more than one exponent and thus exhibit crossover behavior. The scaling exponents, such as Hurst exponents, represent the nature of correlation in the system and the crossover shows the presence of more than one type of correlation. An accurate characterization of the crossover behavior is thus needed for a better understanding of the inherent correlations in the system, and is an important method of Big Data analysis. A multi-step process is developed for accurate computation of the crossover behavior. First the detrended fluctuation analysis is used to remove the trends in the data and the scaling exponents are computed. The crossover point is then computed by a Hyperbolic regression technique, with no prior assumptions. The time series data of the magnetic field variations during substorms in the Earth’s magnetosphere is analyzed with these techniques and yields a crossover behavior with a time scale of ~4 hrs. A Langevin model derived from the data provides an excellent fit to the crossover in the scaling exponents and a good model of magnetospheric dynamics. The combination of fluctuation analysis and mathematical modeling thus yields a comprehensive approach in the analysis of Big Data.",

            "abstract": "Simulations of strong tropical cyclones, category 3 to 5, in models without convective parameterization typically require a high horizontal resolution on the order of several kilometers, which is currently not feasible for global climate models. In this study we apply the hypohydrostatic rescaling, also referred to as RAVE (Reduced Acceleration in the Vertical, e.g. Kuang et al. 2005), as a means to improve the representation of tropical cyclones in a cloud-resolving model that explicitly represents moist convection (SAM). In effect, RAVE reduces the scale separation between convective and larger-scale motions, enabling the simultaneous and explicit representation of both types of flow in a single model. At a given horizontal resolution, using RAVE increases peak storm intensity and reduces the time needed for tropical cyclogenesis, effects apparently caused by the environmental moistening produced by RAVE. In fact, using RAVE in this model within a global aqua-planet beta-plane configuration improves representation of both the mean tropical climate (eliminating the double-ITCZ problem) and of tropical cyclones (generating storms up to category 5).\nFurther, we present results of these simulations in which we vary the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and focus on the key characteristics of tropical cyclones, including the total number of cyclones, their genesis, strength and latitudinal distribution, and interaction with extra-tropical storms. We find that the tropical cyclone activity changes non-monotonically with reduction in the oceanic meridional temperature gradient – for small changes the cyclone activity decreases, but for larger changes it strongly increases, mainly because of the strong reduction in wind shear in mid-latitudes for weak meridional temperature gradients. The increase in tropical cyclone activity in warm climates is accompanied by the merging between the characteristics of extra-tropical storms and tropical cyclones, as seen in the paths of the storms as well as their property distributions. We discuss these results in the context of the past and future climate change.",

The study outcrop comprises of three valley systems. Light detection and ranging derived digital outcrop models have been used to characterize shale length, width, thickness and frequency of each valley systems. Shale geometry and frequency calculated for the valley fills correlate with the degree of tidal influence and channel sinuosity. The long and infrequent shales in Valley-1 (mean length 7.8 m; mean frequency 1.5 m-1) were deposited in a low tidal influence and braided setting. On the contrary, the short and frequent shales in Valley-2 and Valley-3 (mean length, 4.3 m and 4.1 m; mean frequency 2.7 m-1 and 3.5 m-1, respectively) were deposited by more tidally-influenced single-thread meandering rivers. To estimate the effect of shales, a sand/shale model was utilized. The unique character of each architectural unit within the incised valley fills resulted in different kv/kh distributions. The valley fill deposits, V1, V2, and V3 had an average kv/kh ratio of 0.074, 0.016 and 0.011, respectively. It was demonstrated that the extent of tidal influence determined the shale character of different compartments of the compound fluvial valley fill, which, in turn, uniquely described the potential for fluid flow through these compartments. Therefore, it is important to consider the shale character and related permeability distributions in fluvial valley fill deposits when modeling analogous reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "The commonly applied surface energy balance for land (SEBAL) and its variant, mapping evapotranspiration (ET) at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) models require manual selection of endmember (i.e. hot and cold) pixels to calibrate sensible heat flux. Current approaches for automating this process are based on statistical methods and do not appear to be robust under varying climate conditions and seasons. In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on simple machine learning tools and search algorithms that provides an automatic and time efficient way of identifying endmember pixels for use in these models. The fully automated models were applied on over 100 cloud-free Landsat images with each image covering several eddy covariance flux sites in Florida and Oklahoma. Observed land surface temperatures at automatically identified hot and cold pixels were within 0.5% of those from pixels manually identified by an experienced operator (coefficient of determination, R2, ≥ 0.92, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, ≥ 0.92, and root mean squared error, RMSE, ≤ 1.67 K). Daily ET estimates derived from the automated SEBAL and METRIC models were in good agreement with their manual counterparts (e.g., NSE ≥ 0.91 and RMSE ≤ 0.35 mm day-1). Automated and manual pixel selection resulted in similar estimates of observed ET across all sites. The proposed approach should reduce time demands for applying SEBAL/METRIC models and allow for their more widespread and frequent use. This automation can also reduce potential bias that could be introduced by an inexperienced operator and extend the domain of the models to new users.",

At the global level, changing arctic and boreal systems are increasing becoming the focus of policy discussions at all levels of decision-making.

In this presentation, we will discuss the conceptual basis for the ABOVE Field Campaign, describe Science Team composition and timeline, and update the community on activities.

            "abstract": "Waterfalls are ubiquitous in steep landscapes and have been documented to retreat upstream at rates far outpacing standard fluvial incision into bedrock. While the formation of waterfalls following changes in climate and base-level lowering have been well-documented, little work has explored the formation of waterfalls via the internal dynamics from interacting flow hydraulics, sediment flux, and evolving channel morphology. Distinguishing between waterfalls formed via external versus internal forcing is important, as waterfall formation and retreat rate is often applied in inverse to determine the timing of external forcing. Here, we present results from a laboratory experiment designed to explore channel incision and waterfall formation. We fed water and sediment at constant rates over an initially planar surface at 19.5% slope. A channel rapidly incised into the artificial bedrock substrate, and small-wavelength variations in erosion rate created steps and pools which grew in amplitude. As pools deepened, erosion was focused on the upstream pool faces creating steep segments in the channel bed. At the topographic breaks between these steep segments and their upstream treads, water detached from the bed forming ventilated waterfall jets which impacted the plunge pools below. Continued pool deepening led to sediment deposition on the pool floors, locally inhibiting vertical incision while the upstream and downstream surfaces were free to erode. Amplified erosion at the waterfall lip incised a new pool into the bedrock previously composing the waterfall face while simultaneous lowering of the downstream pool lip resulted in the destruction of the original pool. Repetition of this process in our experiment suggests that interactions between bedrock erosion and sediment cover can result in the formation of a series of plunge pools which retreat upstream, and that care must be taken to distinguish between autocyclic versus allocyclic waterfall formation in studies examining landscape response to external forcing.",

On one hand, it is the driving force behind convection; on the other, in imaging efforts, it serves to discriminate between thermal and compositional heterogeneities. Despite its importance, the Earth's 3D density structure remains difficult to infer from surface observations. Gravity measurements, for instance, are sensitive to density but suffer from inherent and strong non-uniqueness. The travel times of seismic body and surface waves are only weakly sensitive to density, and trade-offs with velocity structure are often large.\nNew opportunities for the recovery of density in the Earth may arise from recently developed full-waveform inversion methods that go beyond traditional traveltime tomography.\nIn this study, we assess to which extent, and in which way, full-waveform inversion can be combined with gravity and other geodetic measurements to better constrain global-scale density structure. To this end, we perform synthetic tests in 2D in which we systematically assess the effect on density recovery of different (joint) inversion schemes, types of data used and constraints applied.\nOur synthetic inversions are based on numerical wave propagation and adjoint techniques to compute seismic Fréchet sensitivity kernels, which are combined with synthetic gravity data to drive gradient-based optimisation schemes. Additional constraints such as a predefined velocity structure, or Earth’s mass and inertia tensor, may be imposed using a projected descent scheme.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall is one of the fundamental drivers that control hydrologic responses including runoff production and transport phenomena that consequently drive changes in aquatic ecosystems. Quantifying the hydrologic responses to changing scenarios (e.g., climate, land use, and management) using environmental models requires a realistic representation of probable rainfall in its most sensible spatio-temporal dimensions matching that of the phenomenon under investigation. Downscaling projected rainfall from global circulation models (GCMs) is the most common practice in deriving rainfall datasets to be used as main inputs to hydrologic models which in turn are used to assess the impacts of climate changes on ecosystems. Downscaling assumes that local climate is a combination of large-scale climatic/atmospheric conditions and local conditions. However, the representation of the latter is generally beyond the capacity of current GCMs. The main objective of this study was to develop and implement a synthetic rainfall generator to downscale expected rainfall trends to 1 x 1 km rainfall daily patterns that mimic the dynamic propagation of probability distribution functions (pdf) derived from historic rainfall data (rain-gauge or radar estimated). Future projections were determined based on actual and expected changes in the pdf and stochastic processes to account for variability. Watershed responses in terms of streamflow and nutrients loads were evaluated using synthetically generated rainfall patterns and actual data. The framework developed in this study will allow practitioners to generate rainfall datasets that mimic the temporal and spatial patterns exclusive to their study area under full disclosure of the uncertainties involved. This is expected to provide significantly more accurate environmental models than is currently available and would provide practitioners with ways to evaluate the spectrum of systemic responses to changing scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Food aid is a critical component of the global food system, particularly when emergency situations arise. For the first time, we evaluate the water footprint of food aid. To do this, we draw on food aid data from theWorld Food Programme and virtual water content estimates from WaterStat. We find that the total water footprint of food aid was 10 km3 in 2005, which represents approximately 0.5% of the water footprint of food trade and 2.0% of the water footprint of land grabbing (i.e., water appropriation associated with large agricultural land deals). The United States is by far the largest food aid donor and contributes 82% of the water footprint of food aid. The countries that receive the most water embodied in aid are Ethiopia, Sudan, North Korea, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Notably, we find that there is significant overlap between countries that receive food aid and those that have their land grabbed. Multivariate regression results indicate that donor water footprints are driven by political and environmental variables, whereas recipient water footprints are driven by land grabbing and food indicators.",

            "abstract": "The simplicity of the Curve Number (CN) method, which summarizes an area’s hydrologic soil group, land cover, treatment, and hydrologic condition into a single number, make it a consistently popular choice for modelers. When multiple land cover types are present, a weighted average of the CNs is used. However, the weighted CN does not account for the spatial distribution of different land cover types within the watershed. To overcome this limitation, it becomes necessary to discretize the model into homogenous subunits, perhaps even to the hillslope scale, leading to a more complex model application. The objective of this study is to empirically derive CN values that reflect the effects of placements of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within agricultural landscapes. We derived CN values using precipitation and runoff data from (May 1 – Sept 30 over a 7 year period (2008 – 2014) for 9 ephemeral watersheds in Iowa (USA) ranging from 0.47 to 3.19 ha. The watersheds were planted with varying extents of NPV (0%, 10%, 20%) in different watershed positions (footslope vs. contour strips), with the rest of the watershed as row crop. The derived CN values from watersheds with all row crop were consistent with published values and watersheds with NPV had an average CN reduction of 6.4%, with a maximum reduction of 11.6%. Four of the six sites with treatment had a lower CN than one calculated using a weighted average of look-up values, indicating that accounting for placement of vegetation within the landscape is important for modeling runoff with the CN method. The derived CNs were verified using the leave-one-year-out method (computing CN using data from 6 of the 7 years, and then estimating runoff on the seventh year with that CN). Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values for the estimated runoff typically ranged from 0.4-0.6. Our results suggest that the new CNs could confidently be used in future modeling studies to explore the hydrologic impacts of the NPV treatments at increasingly larger watershed scales.",

            "abstract": "Madagascar is considered as a key region with respect to the assembly and break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana. Following the collision between East- and West-Gondwana (~700-650 Ma), its position was central to the Pan-African orogeny and later to the break-up between East-Africa, India and Antarctica. Today, Madagascar consists of different tectonic units; the eastern two thirds of the island are composed mainly of Precambian rocks, whereas the western part is dominated by sedimentary deposits. Southern Madagascar is characterized by several NS to NW-SE trending shear zones. To increase our understanding of these structures and related tectonic processes, we installed a dense temporary seismic network in southern Madagascar. It consisted of 50 stations, which were in operation for up to 2 years between 2012 and 2014.\nWe present results from shear-wave splitting analyses to infer the seismic anisotropy of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system in response to deformational processes. The polarization of the fast shear wave and the delay time between the fast and slow waves provide constraints on the anisotropic fabric. For our study, we use core phases from up to 22 events. We first apply a conventional single-event splitting analysis by minimizing the transverse component. For stations that do not show a significant azimuthal dependence of the splitting parameters, we also apply a joint inversion involving all recorded waveforms from several events. Our results exhibit delay times between 0.4 and 1.5 s. In the center of the E-W profile, fast axes are mainly oriented NNW-SSE, whereas east of the Ranotsara zone, fast axes are oriented NE-SW. We apply full-waveform FD modeling to examine the effects of various anisotropic models of the crust and mantle. Our results indicate that recently proposed mantle flow models are insufficient to explain the small scale variations of splitting parameters observed along our profile. Our observations are best characterized by asthenospheric anisotropy, consistent with the absolute plate motion direction of ~50°, in combination with a block of fossil anisotropy located within the lithosphere exhibiting a symmetry axis of -40°. The latter may be related to the indentation of the Antananarivo block into the metasedimentary southern part of Madagascar during the Pan-African orogeny.",

With strict criteria of region identification using the particle data, a survey of Poynting flux in different dayside polar cap boundary regions has been performed, with a focus on whether the Poynting flux enhancement happens and when it happens in different regions. Meanwhile, a statistical study of the Poynting flux in the mid-altitude cusp (~ several Re) as measured by the Cluster spacecraft has been conducted. The conjugated measurements of Poynting flux and particle precipitation in the cusp region at the two different altitudes (DMSP, Cluster) have been compared.

            "abstract": "The occurrence of global dust storms (GDS) in some Mars years and not in others is recognized as an outstanding unsolved problem of atmospheric physics. While GDS exhibit a clear seasonality as to when they occur (centered loosely around Mars’ perihelion), prior efforts to replicate GDS phenomena using general circulation models (GCMs) have not been entirely successful.\nA recently developed non-tidal orbit-spin coupling hypothesis predicts that variations in the orbital angular momentum of Mars may give rise to instantaneously small but cumulatively significant changes in the circulation of the Mars atmosphere. Through the use of the MarsWRF GCM, we are able to quantify the time-varying magnitude of this ‘coupling term acceleration’ (CTA) and relate it to changes in the martian atmospheric circulation and subsequently to observations of the presence or absence of a GDS in particular Mars years. The MarsWRF output shows interannual variability that is derived largely from year-to-year differences in the CTA magnitude and direction, which varies significantly with time and exhibits variable phasing with respect to Mars’ annual insolation cycle.\nA record of the definitive occurrence or non-occurrence of GDS on Mars dating back to 1924 is used in this study. Conditions favorable for the occurrence of GDS, specifically including a constructive strengthening of the overturning meridional circulation, and an enhancement of near-surface wind speed and surface stress, are reproduced by the GCM in all of the Mars years in which a solstice-season GDS was positively identified. In a majority of the Mars years lacking GDS, CTA during the southern summer season are found to be small or nonexistent, or interfere destructively with the meridional overturning circulation, thereby inhibiting GDS initiation. We continue to explore the relationships between the CTA and the martian dust cycle and the modulation of large-scale circulatory flows on Mars due to orbit-spin coupling.",

Photoelectrons are important for the heating related to plasma temperatures, ionization and airglow production in planetary atmospheres. Measured electron fluxes provide insight into sources and sinks of energy in the Martian upper atmosphere. Suprathermal electron fluxes measured by the SWEA (Solar Wind Electron Analyzer) instrument onboard the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) are providing insight into sources and sinks of energy in the Martian upper atmosphere. A two-stream electron transport code was used to interpret these observations including Auger electrons associated with K-shell ionization of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. External electron fluxes from the Martian magnetosheath or tail, are also included. Electron and ion temperatures are found from numerical solutions of the energy equations and comparisons are made with the electron temperature measured by the MAVEN Langmuir Probe (e.g., Ergun et al., 2015). The overall implications of the plasma energetics for the Martian ionosphere will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural, industrial, and urban development have all contributed to increased salinity in streams and rivers, but the likely effects of future development and climate change are unknown. We developed two empirical models to estimate how these combined effects might affect salinity by the end of this century. The first model predicts natural background specific electrical conductivity (EC, a measure of salinity) from static (i.e., geology, long-term atmospheric deposition, and soils) and dynamic (i.e., climate and vegetation) environmental factors. This model explained 78% of the variation in EC among minimally impacted sites. We applied this model to 2001 sites chosen probabilistically from all streams in the conterminous US and compared estimated background EC to current measurements. At 34% of these sites EC was > 50% greater than the predicted natural background. The second model predicts deviation of EC from natural background as function of land use and other static and dynamic environmental factors. This model explains 60% of the variation in deviation from natural background. We then predicted the effects of climate change on EC at end of the century by replacing dynamic variables (climate and land use) in both models with published projections of future conditions based on the A2 emissions scenario used in global climate models. By end of century, EC is expected to increase 234 µS/cm on average with over 50% of streams having > 50% increases in EC and 35% more than doubling their EC. However, most of the change is due to development, with climate change accounting for less than 10% of the increase. Previous changes in EC have occurred primarily in the Midwest and Plains, but future changes shift to the South. In extreme cases, increased salinity may make water unsuitable for agricultural or municipal use. However, widespread moderate increases are a greater threat to stream biota due to the elimination of low EC habitats.",

The expansive dataset containing high accuracy and precision measurements of δ18O, δD, and the d-excess allow us to validate and benchmark the treatment of the atmospheric hydrological cycle’s processes in General Circulation Models using simulations nudged to reanalysis products.\nRecent findings from both Antarctica and Greenland have documented strong interaction between the snow surface isotopes and the near surface atmospheric water vapor isotopes on diurnal to synoptic time scales. In fact, it has been shown that the snow surface isotopes take up the synoptic driven atmospheric water vapor isotopic signal in-between precipitation events, erasing the precipitation isotope signal in the surface snow.\nThis highlights the importance of using General or Regional Climate Models, which accurately are able to simulate the atmospheric water vapor isotopic composition, to understand and interpret the ice core isotope signal.\nWith this in mind we have used three isotope-enabled General Circulation Models (isoGSM, ECHAM5-wiso, and LMDZiso) nudged to reanalysis products. We have compared the simulations of daily mean isotope values directly with our in-situ observations. This has allowed us to characterize the variability of the isotopic composition in the models and compared it to our observations. We have specifically focused on the d-excess in order to characterize why both the mean and the variability is significantly lower than our observations.\nWe argue that using water vapor isotopes to benchmark General Circulation Models offers an excellent tool for improving the treatment and parameterization of the atmospheric hydrological cycle. Recent studies have documented a very large inter-model dispersion in the treatment of the Arctic water cycle under a future global warming and greenhouse gas emission scenario. Our results call for action to create an international pan-Arctic monitoring water vapor isotope network in order to improve future projections of Arctic climate.",

            "abstract": "Forests in high subarctic fell regions of Fennoscandia belong to the most northern forests in the world, a dynamic ecosystem vulnerable under a changing climate with treelines moving further north and also higher up slopes. An ecosystem is characterised by the interaction between micrometeorology, macroecology and the underlying terrain and topography. The current study is carried out at 68° North (Värriö strict nature reserve), the most sensitive zone of the high subarctic in Finnish Lapland. As the treeline is climbing up the slopes trees and eventually forests establish along the slopes leading to a greening of the area (“Greening of the Arctic” effect) and to an increase in CO2 uptake, also as a result of rising air temperatures and Nitrogen fertilization effects. Such developments and the little grazing (in this area) are leading to an increase in photosynthesising biomass. In order to fully understand the atmosphere – forest interaction in the fell region of Finnish Lapland, several important aspects are taken in consideration: its high latitudinal location, on-going climate change, polar day, its topographic characteristic and the dynamic of the progressing tree line. All these physiognomies cumulate in the capacity and efficiency of high latitude biomes in converting energy into photosynthate and contributing to removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.\nCarrying out CO2 and energy exchange measurements at ecosystem level in such extreme environments are challenging in particular when trying to follow and fulfil established assumptions set out by the application of the eddy covariance technique. Results from the first four consecutive snow free growing seasons show this site to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2. We are investigating the orographic effect on the observed fluxes and evaluate the performance of the flux setup determining if the topography has any systematic effects on fluxes or whether its external properties bias the carbon balance.",

Reflections of the GNSS signals have been used to sense soil moisture, snow depth, and wind speed while refraction of the signals through the atmosphere has provided data on the electron density in the ionosphere as well as water vapor and temperature in the troposphere. Now analysis at the University of Colorado has shown that the attenuation of GNSS signals by volcanic ash plumes can be used to measure the presence and structure of the ash plume. This discovery is driving development of a distributed GNSS sensor network to complement existing optical and radar based ash plume monitoring systems. A GNSS based sensing system operating in L-band is unaffected by weather conditions or time of day. Additionally, the use of an existing signal source greatly reduces the per sensor cost and complexity compared to a radar system. However since any one measurement using this method provides only the total attenuation between the GNSS satellite and the receiver, full tomographic imaging of a plume requires a large number of sensors observing over a diversity of geometries.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the ongoing development of the GNSS sensor system. Evaluation of low priced commercial GNSS receivers will be discussed, as well as details on the inter sensor network. Based on analysis of existing GPS receivers near volcanic vents, the baseline configuration for an ash plume monitoring network is a 1km spaced ring of receivers 5km from the vent updating every 5 seconds. Preliminary data from field tests will be presented to show the suitability of the sensor system for this configuration near an active volcano.",

Specific objectives include: (1) strengthening elementary and secondary STEM Teacher Preparation courses and curricula, (2) alignment of STEM teacher preparation programs across Washington State with the NGSS and CCSS, (3) development of action plans to support implementation of STEM Teacher Preparation program improvement at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) across the state, (4) stronger collaborations between HEIs, K-12 schools, government agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and STEM businesses, involved in the preparation of preservice STEM teachers, (5) new teacher endorsements in Computer Science and Engineering, and (6) development of a proto-type model for rapid, adaptable, and continuous improvement of STEM teacher preparation programs. A 2015 NGSS gap analysis of teacher preparation programs across Washington State indicates relatively good alignment of courses and curricula with NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas and Scientific practices, but minimal alignment with NGSS Engineering practices and Cross Cutting Concepts. Likewise, Computer Science and Sustainability ideas and practices are not well represented in current courses and curricula. During the coming year teams of STEM faculty, education faculty and administrators will work collaboratively to develop unique action plans for aligning and improving STEM teacher preparation courses and curricula at their institutions.",

            "abstract": "The firn of the McMurdo shear zone within the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica is intensively crevassed, and may also contain crevasses within its meteoric and marine ice. However, the surface crevassing prevents ordinary vehicle access to investigate its structure geophysically. We used a lightweight robotic vehicle to tow 200 and 400 MHz ground-penetrating radar antennas simultaneously along 100 evenly spaced transects over a 28 km2 grid spanning the shear zone width. Transects were mainly orthogonal to ice flow. Total firn and meteoric ice thickness was about 160 m. Firn crevasses profiled at 400 MHz were up to 16 m wide, under snow bridges up to 10 m thick, and with strikes near 50–55° to general flow direction. From top down, 200-MHz profiles reveal firn diffractions originating to about 40 m depth, no discernible structure within the meteoric ice, a discontinuous transitional horizon, and at least 20 m of disturbed and stratified marine ice. Freeboard ranging from 28–31 m shows more marine ice exists. We interpret the transitional horizon to be a thin saline layer, and marine ice hyperbolic diffractions and reflections to be responses to localized fractures and to crevasses of various widths, filled with unstratified marine ice, and at strikes mainly between 41–63°. We interpret off-nadir, marine ice horizons to be responses to linear and folded faults, the structure and orientation of which are similar to some in firn. The coinciding and synchronously folded areas of fractured firn and marine ice suggest the visibly unstructured meteoric ice is also fractured, but either never crevassed, or crevassed and sutured without sea water penetration, and that any bottom crevasses that occurred near grounding lines have been thermally eroded. Consequently any fractures in the meteoric ice beneath our grid are likely to have formed far from any grounding area, but it is unclear why there is no evidence of sea water penetration given the fractured and crevassed marine ice.",

            "abstract": "For over three decades the most widely used atmospheric correction approach for deriving sea surface temperature (SST) in the 11-12μm has been the Non-Linear SST algorithm (NLSST). The NLSST form is used for both the NOAA Pathfinder SST, and the MODIS and VIIRS SST datasets produced by NASA. A variant is also the basis of the night-time algorithms using measurements in the mid-infrared window. Since 1981 ten IR sensors, with 4 different designs, and slightly different overpass times, are used to create a satellite based consistent record of SST. The AVHRR-2’s were flown from 1981-1997, AVHRR-3’s began in 1998, and in 2000 the MODIS era began. The most recent sensor, VIIRS, began collecting data in 2012 and begins a unique period with four polar orbiting IR sensors concurrently collecting SST, along with the measurements from the AMSR-2 microwave sensor. These dataset provide an opportunity to evaluate the consistency between SST from the different IR sensors in the 30-year record. A number of factors, relating to real geophysical differences in measurements, must be taken into account when making comparisons. These include depth of measurement, potential for diurnal heating, and differences in the time and space aggregation method used to create global files. Figure 1 shows the global daily 9km MODIS Aqua day and night SST relative to the Reynolds OI SST analysis (Panel A and B) and a composite microwave Windsat SST (Panel C). The comparison to the NCEP Reynolds OI, with a measurement depth referenced to buoys, suggests strong diurnal heating of the Arctic sea surface skin in the late summer. Presumably the diurnal signal is strongest in late summer due to more open ice free water, compared to spring and early summer when the day length is actually the longest of the year, but more ice may obscure the sea surface. Biases may also be present in the Reynolds field as fewer buoy observations at these latitudes guide the OI analysis. The day-time MODIS SST compared to Windsat SST (panel C), with a subsurface measurement depth of a few millimeters, is less warm relative to MODIS than the Reynolds fields, as might be expected,however the overall patterns are similar between the Windsat and Reynolds SST differences. Additional inter sensor and in situ comparisons and analysis for AVHRR, MODIS, VIIRS, and AMSR2 will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In a changing climate, future inundation of the United States’ Atlantic coast will depend on both storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and the rising relative sea-levels on which those surges occur. We seek to analyze the risk of future coastal inundation for New York City in the context of a long-term historical analysis of storm surge events and sea level rise. In order to overcome the limitation of a short and incomplete observational record of tropical cyclones in the north Atlantic, we use proxy sea-level records, and downscale three CMIP5 models to generate large synthetic tropical cyclone data sets for the north Atlantic basin; driving climate conditions span from AD 850 to AD 2005. Combining results from a storm surge model with relative sea-level data, we find that mean flood heights for the region have increased by ~1.24 m from ~AD 850 to the present, a result that is significant at the 99% confidence level. In addition, changes in tropical cyclone characteristics have led to increases in the extremes of the types of storms that create the largest storm surge events for the New York City region. These results indicate that storm surge risk for the New York City region has increased considerably over the past millennium; as sea-levels continue to rise and storms possibly become more active, the risk of coastal inundation for the region is also likely to increase significantly in coming centuries. Thus, we combine future sea level rise projections with modeled storm surge heights for synthetic tropical cyclones downscaled from CMIP5 models. Results from this work will allow us to investigate the potential for future coastal inundation in the New York City region in the context of our historical analysis.",

            "abstract": "Modern remote sensing technologies allow for detecting the absolute temperature at the surface of volcanic lava, and the heat flow could be then inferred from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Is it possible to use these surface thermal data to constrain the thermal and dynamic conditions inside the lava? We propose a quantitative approach to reconstruct temperature and velocity in the steady-state volcanic lava flow from thermal observations at its surface. This problem is reduced to a combination of the direct and inverse problems of mass- and heat transport. Namely, using known conditions at the lava surface we determine the missing condition at the bottom of lava (the inverse problem) and then search for the physical properties of lava – temperature and flow velocity – inside the lava (the direct problem). Assuming that the lava rheology and the thermal conductivity are temperature-dependent, we determine the flow characteristics in the model domain using an adjoint method. We show that in the case of smooth input data (observations) the lava temperature and the flow velocity can be reconstructed with a high accuracy. The noise imposed on the smooth input data results in a less accurate solution, but still acceptable below some noise level.",

            "abstract": "The low-frequency complex conductivity response of charged porous media reflects a combination of three polarization processes occuring at different frequency ranges. One polarization process corresponds to the membrane polarization phenomenon, which is the polarization mechanism associated with the back-diffusion of salt ions through different pore spaces of the porous material (ions-selective zones and zones with no selectivity). This polarization process generally occurs at the lowest frequency range, typically in the frequency range [mHz Hz] because it involves polarization mechanism occurring over different pore spaces (the relaxation frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the polarization process). Another polarization process corresponds to the electrochemical polarization of the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains. In the grain polarization model, the diffuse layer is assumed to not polarize because it is assumed to form a continuum in the porous medium. The compact Stern layer is assumed to polarize because the Stern layer is assumed to be discontinuous over multiple grains. The electrochemical polarization of the Stern layer typically occurs in the frequency range [Hz kHz]. The last polarization process corresponds to the Maxwell-Wagner polarization mechanism, which is caused by the formation of field-induced free charge distributions near the interface between the phases of the medium. In this presentation, the grain polarization model based on the O’Konski, Schwarz, Schurr and Sen theories and developed later by Revil and co-workers is showed. This spectral induced polarization model was successfully applied to describe the complex conductivity responses of glass beads, sands, clays, clay-sand mixtures and other minerals. The limits of this model and future developments will also be presented.",

However, the relationship between ENSO activity and δ18O anomalies is subject to a high degree of uncertainty owing to both observational limitations and poorly understood dynamical processes. The isotope-enabled Regional Ocean Modeling System (isoROMS) is designed to address some of these uncertainties; isoROMS is a flexible modeling framework capable of simulating δ18O over an arbitrary domain at a variety of spatial resolutions. Initial results for isoROMS simulations at the central equatorial Pacific Line Islands chain over the 1979-2009 period are presented, using water isotopologue fluxes taken from the isotope-enabled NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (iCAM). Mesoscale ocean processes can significantly impact temperature and seawater δ18O variability under certain conditions, particularly during strong La Nina events. The variability in the ENSO/δ18O relationship is then investigated over the 20th century using a suite of isoROMS simulations conducted with combinations of atmosphere and ocean reanalysis products, in an effort to determine the optimal form of 'forward models' for predicting δ18O given local conditions. Implications for our ability to quantitatively reconstruct ENSO amplitude and the properties of El Nino/La Nina events are discussed.",

Exposures in exhumed accretionary wedges present an opportunity to study seismogenic subduction thrusts in detail. In the Marin Headlands, a series of thrusts imbricates mechanically distinct lithologic units of the Mesozoic Franciscan Complex including pillow basalt, radiolarian chert, black mudstone, and turbidites.\nWe examine variations in distribution and character of structure and vein occurrence in two exposures of the Rodeo Cove thrust, a fossil plate boundary exposed in the Marin Headlands. We observe a lithologic control on the degree and nature of fault localization. At Black Sand Beach, deformation is localized in broad fault cores of sheared black mudstone. Altered basalts, thrust over greywacke, mudstone, and chert, retain their coherence and pillow structures. Veins are only locally present. In contrast, mudstone is virtually absent from the exposure 2 km away at Rodeo Beach. At this location, deformation is concentrated in the altered basalts, which display evidence of extensive vein-rock interaction. Altered basalts exhibit a pervasive foliation, which is locally disrupted by both foliation-parallel and cross-cutting carbonate-filled veins and carbonate cemented breccia. Veins are voluminous (~50%) at this location. All the structures are cut by anastomosing brittle shear zones of foliated cataclasite or gouge. Analyses of vein chemistry will allow us to compare the sources of fluids that precipitated the common vein sets at Rodeo Beach to the locally developed veins at Black Sand Beach.\nThese observations lead us to hypothesize that in the absence of a mechanically weak lithology, elevated pore fluid pressure is required for shear failure. If so, the vein-rich altered basalt at Rodeo Beach may record failure of an igneous basement asperity.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between modern barrier island morphology and offshore bathymetry to better understand the development history of Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS), Texas, USA. The widely accepted hypothesis for the development of PAIS is that the dunes on the mainland were partially submerged during the Holocene transgression, resulting in distinct islands that eventually coalesced by sediment transported alongshore; however, this hypothesis does not follow the development history of other barrier islands throughout the Gulf of Mexico. This study uses electromagnetic inductance (EMI) surveys, bathymetric contours, and island morphometrics to better understand the development of PAIS. A 100km long EMI survey was conducted to aid in identifying infilled subsurface paleochannels that dissect the island. Bathymetric contours were extracted from NOAA digital elevation models (DEMs) up to 7km offshore by offsetting the shoreline east in 1km intervals. Island width and volume, beach width and volume, and dune height and volume were extracted from a 100 km LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) using an automated approach. Apparent conductivity at all three frequencies (from the EMI survey), bathymetric contours, and island morphometrics were subsequently decomposed using a continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Beach width, dune height, and dune volume exhibit a very similar waveform that coincides spatially with an inflection point in the waveform for the offshore bathymetric contours. Portions of the island proximal to the infilled paleochannels tend to have a wider beach and taller/higher volume dunes. The high degree of similarity between the subsurface paleochannels, offshore bathymetry, and island morphometrics support a new theory of development for PAIS. We argue that PAIS is not a series of partially submerged relict dunes, as previously proposed, rather that framework geology is an important factor affecting modern island morphology; and that the island transgressed landward during the Holocene similar to other barrier islands throughout the Gulf or Mexico.",

            "abstract": "The thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) has been developed over the last decade as a rigorous, formal method of deriving mechanistic mathematical models that describe a wide range of porous medium systems. TCAT models are consistent across length scales and provide explicit linkages between important physics known to be operative at the microscale and larger scale models. This produces a straightforward mechanism to evaluate macroscale quantities based on information generated from microscale simulations or experiments as way to inform model development. TCAT models inherently include interface, common curve, and common point properties in models that admit such entities. Elements of the TCAT theory are discussed, model hierarchies are derived and summarized, and specific aspects of TCAT models are examined in detail. Comparisons of TCAT model constructs with both experimental data and high-resolution microscale simulations illustrate that, contrary to common belief, virtually all capillary pressure vs. saturation data that is available for two-fluid-phase systems is not equilibrium data. Agreement between theory and observation for TCAT models is demonstrated, and aspects of the models posed are validated.",

            "abstract": "The formation of canopy gaps is fundamental for shaping forest structure and is an important component of ecosystem function. Recent time-series of airborne LIDAR have shown great promise for improving understanding of the spatial distribution and size of forest gaps. However, such work typically looks at gap formation across multiple years and important intra-annual variation in gap dynamics remains unknown. Here we present findings on the intra-annual dynamics of canopy gap formation within the 50 ha forest dynamics plot of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing. High-resolution imagery (7 cm GSD) over the 50 ha plot was obtained regularly (≈ every 10 days) beginning October 2014 using a UAV equipped with a point and shoot camera. Imagery was processed into three-dimensional (3D) digital surface models (DSMs) using automated computer vision structure from motion / photogrammetric methods. New gaps that formed between each UAV flight were identified by subtracting DSMs between each interval and identifying areas of large deviation. A total of 48 new gaps were detected from 2014-10-02 to 2015-07-23, with sizes ranging from less than 20 m2 to greater than 350 m2. The creation of new gaps was also evaluated across wet and dry seasons with 4.5 new gaps detected per month in the dry season (Jan. – May) and 5.2 per month outside the dry season (Oct. – Jan. & May – July). The incidence of gap formation was positively correlated with ground-surveyed liana stem density (R2 = 0.77, p < 0.001) at the 1 hectare scale. Further research will consider the role of climate in predicting gap formation frequency as well as site history and other edaphic factors. Future satellite missions capable of observing vegetation structure at greater extents and frequencies than airborne observations will be greatly enhanced by the high spatial and temporal resolution bridging scale made possible by UAV remote sensing.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing and geodetic measurements are providing a new wealth of spatially distributed, time-series data that have the ability to improve our understanding of co-seismic rupture and post-seismic processes in subduction zones. We formulate a Bayesian inverse problem to infer the slip distribution on the plate interface using an elastic finite element model and GPS surface deformation measurements. We present an application to the co-seismic displacement during the 2012 earthquake on the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, which is uniquely positioned close to the Middle America Trench and directly over the seismogenic zone of the plate interface. The results of our inversion are then used as an initial condition in a coupled poroelastic forward model to investigate the role of poroelastic effects on post-seismic deformation and stress transfer. From this study we identify a horseshoe-shaped rupture area with a maximum slip of approximately 2.5 meters surrounding a locked patch that is likely to release stress in the future. We model the co-seismic pore pressure change as well as the pressure evolution and resulting deformation in the months after the earthquake. The results of the forward model indicate that earthquake-induced pore pressure changes dissipate quickly near the surface, resulting in relaxation of the surface in the seven to ten days following the earthquake. Near the subducting slab interface, pore pressure changes are an order of magnitude larger and may persist for many months after the earthquake.",

Long-term research on high elevation precipitation patterns and soil moisture has been limited in the intermountain West of the United States. This information can provide increasingly valuable insight into ecosystem dynamics at high elevations, especially in light of climate change projections for the region and montane areas in general. The network currently ranges in elevation from roughly 1,980m to 2,700m with additional stations slated for installation this summer that will broaden that range from 1,880m to 3,000m elevation. Stations take measurements every 20 minutes on soil moisture at three depths, air temperature, relative humidity, rain, and soil temperature. Data from these stations are publicly shared on an interactive, educational website that offers context for observed changes in the local watershed, as well as opportunities for feedback and inquiry. Not only will these data have value for local land management and restoration decisions, they also will be distributed to regional, national, and international research communities as a valuable data set on long term soil moisture trends across an elevational-gradient. Collaborators include, towns, counties, non-profits and the private sector. It is intended that this data set will be continuously collected over the span of coming decades.",

In the context of the global change, long-term observations are required to i) gain understanding in eco-hydrological processes over this highly contrasted region, ii) help their representation in Earth System Models, and iii) detect trends and infer their impacts on water resources and living conditions.\nIt is made of three meso-scale sites (~ 1°x1°) in Mali, Niger and Benin, extending along the West African eco-climatic gradient. Within this regional window (5° by 9°), each of the three sites comprises a multi-scale set-up which helps documenting the components of the hydrologic budget and the evolutions of the surface conditions over a range of time scales: raingages, piezometers, river discharge stations, soil moisture and temperature profiles, turbulent fluxes measurements, LAI/biomass monitoring.\nThis observation system has been continuously generating coherent datasets for 10 to 25 years depending on the datasets. It is jointly operated by French and African (Mali, Niger and Benin) research institutions. The data-base is available to the community through the website (www.amma-catch.org). AMMA-CATCH is a member of the French critical zone observatory network “Réseau des Bassins Versants”, (RBV). AMMA-CATH participates to several global or regional observation networks, such as FluxNet, CarboAfrica, International Soil Moisture Networks (ISMN) and to calibration/validation campaigns for satellite missions such as SMOS (CNES, ESA), MEGHA-TROPIQUES (France/India) or SWAP(NASA). AMMA-CATCH fills a gap over a region, West Africa, where environmental data are largely lacking, and thus, it can usefully contribute to the international networking effort for environmental monitoring and research. Recent results on regional evolution of land cover, rainfall intensity and their consequences on eco-hydrological processes and hydrosystems will be presented.",

The AMF3 is operated through Sandia National Laboratories and hosts instrumentation collecting continuous measurements of clouds, aerosols, precipitation, energy, and other meteorological variables.\nThe Arctic region is warming more quickly than any other region due to climate change and Arctic sea ice is declining to record lows. Sparsity of atmospheric data from the Arctic leads to uncertainty in process comprehension, and atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM) are understood to underestimate low cloud presence in the Arctic. Increased vertical resolution of meteorological properties and cloud measurements will improve process understanding and help AGCMs better characterize Arctic clouds.\nSNL is developing a tethered balloon system capable of regular operation at AMF3 in order to provide increased vertical resolution atmospheric data. The tethered balloon can be operated within clouds at altitudes up to 7,000’ AGL within DOE’s R-2204 restricted area. Pressure, relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction are recorded at multiple altitudes along the tether. These data were validated against stationary met tower data in Albuquerque, NM. The altitudes of the sensors were determined by GPS and calculated using a line counter and clinometer and compared. Wireless wetness sensors and supercooled liquid water content sensors have also been deployed and their data has been compared with other sensors.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the balloons, sensors, and test flights flown, and will provide a preliminary look at data from sensor validation campaigns and test flights.",

            "abstract": "The geomagnetic field is known to show oscillations and variability on a wide range of timescales. These are believed to be the observable consequence of the rich dynamics taking place in the outer core of the Earth, where fluid motions driven mainly by thermochemical convection generate and constantly modify the geomagnetic field.\nOn short timescales it has been demonstrated that, because of the overwhelming importance of rotation compared to other forces acting on the fluid, motions are organized in columns and are essentially 2-D. This approximation is called Quasi-Geostrophy (QG) and allows us to build models that strongly simplify our description of the core dynamics.\nThe QG approximation has been applied in previous works to geomagnetic data inversion to retrieve the flows at the surface of the core. But these techniques provide only a static picture of the core flows and do not offer insights into the magnetic field below the CMB.\nWe are developing a dynamical numerical model based on the QG approximation. This is the first step toward a Data Assimilation system, in which we will constrain the evolution of the numerical model with real geomagnetic observations to obtain a dynamical picture of the magnetic and velocity fields below the CMB. As this is an inverse problem, it is essential to first characterize the forward model. We will illustrate the normal modes sustained by our system and compare them with known results. In particular we retrieve the splitting between “fast” hydrodynamic modes and “slow” magneto-hydrodynamic modes. The latter are one of the best candidates to explain the westward drift, a well known feature of the geomagnetic secular variation.",

            "abstract": "It was suggested by Sivkov et al. (2002) that muddy contourite drifts are formed not only in the deep ocean but also in the shallow Baltic Sea. Such drifts are formed in southern and central subbasins of the Baltic Sea where so-called “major inflows” of the relatively saline water from the northeast Atlantic (North Sea) penetrate. Today, major inflows occur sporadically (every few years) and circulate mainly as along-slope geostrophic (contour) currents. Here we present new evidence of elongated mounded drift which have been recognized in the central part of the Baltic Sea (the Gotland Deep), hereafter, the Gotland Drift. Elongation is generally parallel to the margin, but progradation leads to the drift being extended almost perpendicular to the margin. The Gotland Drift spans several 10s of kilometers with width about 10 km. The main feature of the drift is that it composed of the highly gas-saturated contourite sediments. This is manifested in large numbers of pockmarks on the drift surface. Non-depositional (not erosional!) discontinuities in the Gotland Drift typically result from a non-depositional period reflecting decreased bottom current intensity. Each period of intensified bottom current is linked to hydrological events (transgressions). Such events can have either climatic (variations in ocean/sea level) or tectonic origin. For example, the bathymetric conditions at sills and gateways that control bottom water exchange between ocean and the Baltic Sea. A total of 4 possible transgressions which occurred during the last 8 ka, i.e. since the Danish straits became open, linking the ocean with European Seas, are established. The similarity between the Baltic Sea and deep-sea contourite drifts allow to use the shallow Baltic Sea as “natural laboratory” to study of along-slope contouritic processes in the oceans.\nThis work was supported by Russian Scientific Fund (grant No. 14-37-00047).",

It was assumed that the first mode (3-8 µm) is formed as the result of normal pelagic sedimentation and the second mode (10-30 µm) appears under the bottom currents influence. The sediments with bimodal grain-size distribution (the second mode varies from 10 to 28 µm) correlate with increased SS (up to 18-23 µm) in the Hatton and Snorry Drifts, indicating an increase in contour currents intensity during MIS 1, 3 and 5e. In contrast, there are no any relationships between grain size distribution (high SS values, appearance of bimodal distributions) and climatic cyclicity of variations in contour currents intensity at the Gloria Drift. Moreover, the Gloria Drift sediments differ from the contourite sediments of the Snorry and Hatton Drifts by shifting of the second mode toward the coarse particles (25-40 µm), higher sedimentation rates and higher IRD content. This evidence puts in doubt the contourite origin of the Gloria Drift.\nAt the same time, we have identified the similarity between the Gloria Drift sediments and IRD-containing hemiturbidites of Labrador Sea (Hesse and Khodabakhsh, 2006). Fine-grained sediment lofting has been inferred for ice marginal regions of the northwest Labrador Sea. Sediment failure on the Labrador Slope predominantly produces muddy turbidity currents, because the slope sediments are mud-dominated. Their deposits are the indicative muddy spill-over turbidites of the NAMOC levees and the levees of the tributaries to the NAMOC. Dispersal of the IRD throughout the graded mud layers is evidence that the two processes, ice rafting and the delivery of the fines by lofting, occurred simultaneously.\nThis work was supported by Russian Scientific Fund (grant No. 14-50-00095).",

            "abstract": "Glaciers are key resources of water for hydropower, irrigation, and drinking water. The extensive debris cover often covers glaciers in ablation part of the Himalayan region; hence, it is essential to assess the effect of debris on glacier ice melt. In this study, the main objective is to estimate the sub-debris melt using debris temperature at Lirung Glacier of Nepal Himalayas. Three field campaigns are carried out in monsoon (2013), winter (2013) and pre-monsoon (2014) season during which 2 set of thermistors are installed at different debris thickness. Debris temperature data are collected in different layers of debris from atmosphere/debris interface to debris/ice interface using temperature sensors during each season. Surface temperature for monsoon season is calculated from meteorological data measured at Glacier. Ice melting under debris is calculated for three different seasons and found highest during monsoon season and lowest during winter season. Similarly, seasonal vertical temperature gradients are calculated and vertical debris temperature profiles are generated. The daily linear gradient of the vertical debris temperature profile with depth are -21.38, 1.81, -10.53 oC m–1 in monsoon, winter, and pre-monsoon seasons, respectively. Based on the measured daily ice melt in monsoon, winter and pre-monsoon, positive degree-day factors are estimated for Lirung debris-covered Glacier. Similarly, the debris temperature profile shows higher fluctuation of temperature near surface and lower fluctuation in lower layers with increasing lag time. This study is useful to understand the melting patterns of debris covered glaciers in different seasons, which will be helpful to estimate water availability from glacierized river basins with debris-covered glaciers in the Himalayan region.",

            "abstract": "Marine Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides may provide an opportunity to reconstruct the dissolved metal composition of past oceans, as these phases often precipitate directly from seawater. Recent work has demonstrated Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides chemically leached from core top sediments preserve the Nd isotopic composition of seawater. However, one challenge to applying this tracer of terrestrial weathering and water mass movements down core is that oxyhydroxide phases are readily reduced as dissolved oxygen levels decrease in sediment porewaters. The initial step we take to evaluate downcore preservation of the oxyhydroxide Nd isotope composition is to target sites in the South Pacific Gyre, where oxygen has been shown to penetrate the entire sediment column.\nExtracted Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide and published fossil fish debris Nd data at DSDP Site 596 and IODP Site 1370 record the same values downcore (i.e. εNd(t) = -7.4 to -7.8). Previous studies indicate that Paleogene circulation consisted of two distinct systems in the Pacific and Atlantic. Sites 596 and 1370 are ideally situated to observe the evolution of the isotopic composition of bottom water as it moves out of the Southern Ocean during the transition from two separate ocean systems to modern global overturning circulation. At Site 596 the Nd isotopes were relatively constant from ~70 to 38 Ma indicating a stable water mass influence over that time period. From 38 Ma until 10 Ma they varied significantly with a notable swing measured both in the fish teeth and oxide coatings from -7.3 εNd(t)  at 20.7 Ma to -3.4 εNd(t) at 18.4 Ma. At Site 1370, the more southern site, there is a general trend towards less radiogenic values from -5.3 εNd(t) at ~60 Ma to -7.3 at ~10 Ma, and no corresponding radiogenic swing. This indicates a potential divergence of water mass sources between the sites and the influence of a less radiogenic (North Atlantic or Ross Sea) source mixing into the Southern Ocean bottom water.",

            "abstract": "Cropland and pasture burning are common agricultural management practices that negatively impact air quality at a local and regional scale, including contributing to short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). This research focuses on both cropland and pasture burning in European Russia, Lithuania, and Belarus. Burned area and fire detections were derived from 500 m and 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), 30 m Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. Carbon, particulate matter, volatile organic carbon (VOCs), and harmful air pollutants (HAPs) emissions were then calculated using MODIS and Landsat-based estimates of fire and land-cover and land-use. Agricultural burning in Belarus, Lithuania, and European Russia showed a strong and consistent seasonal geographic pattern from 2002 to 2012, with the majority of fire detections occurring in March – June and smaller peak in July and August. Over this 11-year period, there was a decrease in both cropland and pasture burning throughout this region. For Smolensk Oblast, a Russian administrative region with comparable agro-environmental conditions to Belarus and Lithuania, a detailed analysis of Landsat-based burned area estimations for croplands and pastures and field data collected in summer 2014 showed that the agricultural burning area can be up to 10 times higher than the 1 km MODIS active fire estimates. In general, European Russia is the main source of agricultural burning emissions compared to Lithuania and Belarus. On average, all cropland burning in European Russia as detected by the MCD45A1 MODIS Burned Area Product emitted 17.66 Gg of PM10 while annual burning of pasture in Smolensk Oblast, Russia as detected by Landsat burn scars emitted 494.85 Gg of PM10, a 96% difference. This highlights that quantifying the contribution of pasture burning and burned area versus cropland burning in agricultural regions is important for accurately calculating carbonaceous emissions and emissions that negatively impact air quality.",

Education as a key strategy identified under Agenda 21 has been incorporated into the efforts of various educational institutions as a means of mitigating climate change and enhancing sustainability. Climate Change education offers many opportunities and benefits for educators, researchers, learners, and for wider society, but there are also many challenges, which can hinder the successful mainstreaming of climate change education. The study aims at understanding barriers for Climate Change Education in selected tertiary institutions in Ghana. The study was conducted among Geoscience Departments of the 7 main public universities of Ghana and also juxtapose with the WASCAL graduate school curriculum. The transcript analysis identified issues that hinders the mainstreaming of Climate Change, these includes existing levels of knowledge and understanding of the concept of climate change, appreciating the threshold concepts, ineffective teaching of Climate Change and some Departments are slow in embracing Climate Change as a discipline. Hence to develop strategies to mainstream climate change education it is important to recognize that increasing the efficiency and delivery of Climate Change education requires greater attention and coordination of activities and updating the educators knowledge and skill’s. Institutions and Educator should be encouraged to undertake co-curricula activities and finding ways to make Climate Change education practical.",

            "abstract": "14C reservoir ages of surface waters are crucial for dating marine sediment records of the last 40,000 yr. In the low-latitude Atlantic, time series of 14C reservoir ages were reconstructed for five sites using the 14C plateau-tuning technique and supplemented by a reservoir age record from southern mid-latitudes (Skinner et al., 2010). Results suggest small-scale spatial and short-term (multi-centennial-scale) changes in reservoir age over last glacial-to-deglacial times, thus modify previously assigned calendar age chronologies by up to 500–2500 yr. During late peak glacial, enhanced summer winds off South Brazil and strengthened southerly trades off Namibia induced local reservoir ages of up to 900–1100 yr, whereas surface water ages in the Cariaco lagoon fell close to zero, a result of dominant CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Near 16.05 ka, reservoir ages dropped to a minimum of 170–420 yr all over the South Atlantic, possibly the response to an immediately preceding short-term major rise in atmospheric pCO2 and East Antarctic temperatures. Our 14C reservoir ages provide a first basis for systematic data-model comparisons. They largely confirm model-based estimates for the LGM (Butzin et al., 2012) that have been derived from changes in both atmospheric 14C concentration and reductions in AMOC. Deviations are constrained to coastal upwelling zones in part insufficiently resolved by numerical models.",

Traditionally, infrasound data is collected with sensors and arrays that are installed on the ground. For most applications this is sufficient but can be limiting when observing non-isotropic sources, such as underground explosions, at close range.\nTo develop and test the airborne infrasound platform we recorded data from a seismo-acoustic hammer source at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). During early field-testing of the hammer source we found that, as the 13 metric ton mass hit the ground, a significant downward deflection of the surrounding surface imparted an observable infrasound pressure wave into the atmosphere. We compared waveforms collected at various vertical and horizontal offsets from the hammer source and found that the peak frequencies differed when observed directly above the source compared to the horizontal offsets.\nThis work was done under award number DE-AC52-06NA25946.

            "abstract": "To provide people with more specific information about tornado threats, the National Weather Service has replaced its county-wide warnings with smaller warning polygons that more specifically indicate the risk area. However, tornado warning polygons do not have a standardized definition regarding tornado strike probabilities (ps) so it is unclear how warning recipients interpret them. To better understand this issue, 155 participants responded to 15 hypothetical warning polygons. After viewing each polygon, they rated the likelihood of a tornado striking their location and the likelihood that they would take nine different response actions ranging from continuing normal activities to getting in a car and driving somewhere safer. The results showed participants inferred that the ps was highest at the polygon’s centroid, lower just inside the edges of the polygon, still lower (but not zero) just outside the edges of the polygon, and lowest in locations beyond that. Moreover, higher ps values were associated with lower expectations of continuing normal activities and higher expectations of seeking information from social sources (but not environmental cues) and higher expectations of seeking shelter (but not evacuating in their cars). These results indicate that most people make some errors in their ps judgments but are likely to respond appropriately to the ps they infer from the warning polygons. Overall, the findings from this study and other research can help meteorologists to better understand how people interpret the uncertainty associated with warning polygons and, thus, improve tornado warning systems.",

Recognizing that geopolitical stability is tied to human health, agricultural productivity, and natural ecosystems’ vitality, NGA partnered with NASA Ames Research Center to use satellite remote sensing to assess water quality in West Africa, specifically the Niger River Basin. Researchers from NASA Ames used MODIS and Landsat imagery to apply two water quality indices-- the Floating Algal Index (FAI) and the Turbidity Index (TI)--to large rivers, lakes and reservoirs within the Niger Basin. These indices were selected to evaluate which observations were most suitable for monitoring water quality in a region where coincident in situ measurements are not available. In addition, the FAI and TI indices were derived using data from the Hyperspectral Imagery for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) sensor for Lake Erie in the United States to determine how increased spectral resolution and in-situ measurements would improve the ability to measure the spatio-temporal variations in water quality. Results included the comparison of outputs from sensors with different spectral and spatial resolution characteristics for water quality monitoring. Approaches, such as the GEOnarrative, that incorporate water quality will enable analysts and decision-makers to recognize the current and potentially future impacts of changing water quality on regional security and stability.",

            "abstract": "A large collection of in situ snow data was collected in a support of ESA SnowSAR airborne acquisitions in Northern Finland (Lemmetyinen et al., 2014). The purpose was to demonstrate the mission concept of the proposed ESA CoReH2O (Cold Regions Hydrology High-resolution Observatory, Rott et al., 2010) mission, a candidate in the ESA Earth Explorer series of Earth observing satellites. Around 21400 snow depth measurements, 600 SWE measurements and a number of distributed snow pit measurements were collected during 19 days between December 2011 and March 2012.\nIn this study, these field measurements will be used to analyse the snow property variation within and between different land-cover types in North boreal and tundra environments. The wide heterogeneity of snow properties forms a challenge for remote snow information retrieval as even in flat areas the amount and type of heterogeneity vary in a number of different scales. Especially, information of hemispheric scale SWE variation is suffering from large uncertainties, although, assimilation of ground-based and space-borne information and algorithms specific for a land-cover type have lowered these remaining uncertainties (Takala et al., 2011). This study aims to contribute to this future work for more reliable SWE retrievals by statistically describing the snow parameter variation in these northern environments.\nLemmetyinen, J., J.

            "abstract": "Much of the previous geologic analysis of the Conamara Chaos region has focused on the history and reconstruction of the crustal blocks within the chaos itself. To better understand the geologic context of this relatively young outcrop of disrupted crust, its relation to regional geologic events, and the evolution of the entire area over time, we have performed comprehensive geologic mapping. Using image data centered at 10°N, 271°W with a resolution of 180 m/pixel and covering an area of approximately 90,000 km2, the interrelation between tectonic structures (arrays of bands, ridges, and fractures) and cryovolcanic units is established. Our analysis shows that in addition to the major outcrop of chaos (~75x100 km), there are approximately 80 additional smaller (10’s of km across) areas of chaos or lenticulae. By identifying key cross cutting and superposition relations, it is possible to identify a set of distinct trends in the formation of tectonic features. The tectonic stratigraphy shows an alternating and cyclical pattern with one set of ~N20°W tectonic features subsequently superposed by ~N30°E bands and ridges. This sequence appears to repeat three times over the history of the region. The identification of a fracture that cross cuts older regional units but is preserved in some of the larger crustal blocks within Conamara indicates that the chaos postdates both the adjacent Astenus and Agave Lineae. The mapping shows little or no emplacement of cryovolcanic deposits in the earliest history of this region. Instead, volcanic processes appear to be a part of later geologic activity.\nRegional geologic mapping reveals tectonic patterns that are consistent with those mapped over a more limited area [Spaun et al., 2003]. The restriction of cryovolcanism to the latter part of the history, suggests a change in geologic setting and possibly crustal structure with time. Data to be collected by the Europa mission now in formulation will allow: (1) the mapped contact relations to be examined in greater detail, providing higher clarity of geologic relations; (2) the extension of regional-scale mapping to adjacent unimaged parts of Europa, through a global map at regional scale and; (3) insight into the structure of the crust (through radar sounding) to aid in better understanding cryovolcanic processes.",

            "abstract": "The Nile River Basin (NRB) is one of the largest trans-boundary watercourses; it is the lifeline for more than 300 million people belonging to 11 African nations sharing the NRB. The riparian countries are challenged by their infirm relationships, lack of information sharing and insufficient monitoring stations. Thus, to understand the water future along the NRB under the changing climate, reliable, and sufficient information are needed. This to assess and understand: whether will be more rainfall and induced flooding events, or the drought conditions with less surface runoff will be dominant over the Nile Basin? In addition, to what extent the available remote sensing and model reanalysis data can substitute the lack of detailed ground information, and help to determine the size and risk associated to the climatic impact on the Nile Basin?\nIn the current study, we utilizing multi-scale remote sensing, and model reanalysis datasets for hydrologic monitoring along the NRB in Africa. The list of remote sensing, and model reanalysis datasets that implemented: several MODIS satellite products such as the NDVI, LAI, LST, and LULC datasets. Three GRACE satellite derivative products: TWS, EWT, and DTWS, and TRMM satellite precipitation product. In addition to number of model reanalysis datasets including Global Precipitation Climatological Center (GPCC) datasets, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) products, Climate Research Unit (CRU) datasets, Physical Science Division (PSD) gridded climate dataset, and in situ Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) datasets. The main objective of our research is to monitor the hydrological changes and the variation in water balance along the NRB. The study approach accomplished through: (1) developing a distributed storage changes based grid, (2) trend analysis and inter-annual variability shift detections using regime shift analysis, (3) define the water stress and water deficit periods along the Nile Basins, (4) applying multi regression statistical approach to understand the relation between total water storage and other hydrological variables. The primary trend analysis and shift detection indicated that the basin area was influenced by different fluctuation period. This mainly subjected the Nile Basin region to several water stress and water deficit periods.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental weather records in southern Africa are largely limited to the last 100 years and documentary weather-related data are rare prior to the 1800s, hindering our understanding of the natural and/or anthropogenic factors that influence climate variability over this region. Measuring stable isotopes ratios (commonly 13C/12C and 18O/16O) in tree rings can provide a good proxy for extending climate data beyond the instrumental record. The objective of this study is to characterize historical variations in the climatology underlying extreme climatic events in Zimbabwe using instrumental climate records (precipitation and temperature) and a multi-proxy approach (ring width, δ18O, and δ13C) for dendroclimatic proxy reconstructions. A 90-year (1900-1990) δ18O and δ13C tree ring record using four Pterocarpus angolensis samples is being developed and compared to tree ring width, monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation totals, meteoric water δ18O values, and mean monthly and seasonal temperature. Preliminary results indicate significant correlations between the average δ18O record and the previous year December precipitation totals (r=0.41, p<0.0001), current year January precipitation totals (r=0.45, p<0.0001), and combined total precipitation for the previous year November and December and current year January (r=0.57, p<0.0001).  Furthermore, we find that the δ18O values are strongly influenced by maximum temperature during the previous year December (r=0.39, p=0.0001) and current year January (r=0.40, p=0.0001), and average maximum temperature during the months of the previous year December and current year January and February (r=0.47, p<0.001). We thus present one of the first studies to integrate a multi-proxy approach to investigate historical climate variability in southern Africa using ring widths, and tree ring δ18O and δ13C values of trees growing in Zimbabwe.",

We observed mean maximum fog occurrence during December (~23 days) followed by January (~21 days), November (~20 days), February (~14 days) and October (~11 days) respectively. A remarkable increase has been noticed in fog occurrence during October-to-February in last four decades. During 1971-80 to 2001-2010 the mean frequency of fog occurrence had increased by 205.5% in October month and 50.2% in November month. Similarly, mean frequency of fog occurrence increased by 51%, 97% and 119% during December, January and February respectively over the same period. We observed statistically significant increasing trend in fog occurrence from October-to-February during the study period at 95% confidence level. The magnitude of trend is 0.50, 0.47, 0.30, 0.39 and 0.37 for October, November, December, January and February, respectively. The magnitude of trend is highest in October but the occurrence frequency is highest in December. The forecast values obtained from ARIMA model indicates that the number of fog days is going to increase further during October-to-February in the forthcoming years. The data combined with knowledge of meteorology and topography suggested significant conclusions about increase in the fog events in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The GNSS is widely used nowadays either for geodetic positioning or scientific purposes. The GNSS currently includes GPS, GLONASS, Galileo among other emerging systems. The GPS and GLONASS are currently operational with a full satellite constellation. The GPS is still the most used nowadays and both GPS and GLONASS are under a modernization process. The geodetic positioning by using data from multi-constellation can provide better accuracy in positioning and also more reliability. The PPP is benefited once the satellite geometry is crucial in this method, mainly for kinematic scenarios. The satellite geometry can change suddenly for data collected in urban areas or in conditions of strong atmospheric effects such as Ionospheric Scintillation (IS) that causes weakening of signals with cycle slips and even loss of lock. The IS is caused by small irregularities in the ionosphere layer and is characterized by rapid change in amplitude and phase of the signal being stronger in equatorial and high latitudes regions. In this work the PPP is evaluated with GPS and GLONASS data collected by monitoring receivers from Brazilian CIGALA/CALIBRA network under IS conditions. The PPP processing was accomplished by using the GPSPPP software provided by Natural Resources Canadian (NRCAN). The IS effects were analyzed taking account the S4 and PHI60 indices. Considering periods with moderate IS effects, the use of only GPS data in the PPP presented several peaks in the coordinate time series due to cycle slips and loos of lock. In cycle slip conditions the ambiguity parameter are reinitialized by GPSPPP and considering loss of lock few satellites can be available in some epochs affecting the positioning geometry and consequently decreasing accuracy. In such situations, the PPP using GPS and GLONASS data presented improvements in positioning accuracy of the order to 70% in height component when compared with PPP using only GPS data. Analyses of GDOP and ambiguities parameters were also performed.",

            "abstract": "Effects of early diagenesis on the magnetic mineralogy in marine sediments have long been investigated, including oxidation/reduction reactions, magnetic dilution, formation of iron sulfides and oxides, magnetization acquisition mechanisms and reliability of paleomagnetic record. In this study, we analyze the mineral magnetic properties and downcore magnetite contents on Late Holocene sediments from Alfonso Basin, Gulf of California. Volcanic-derived terrigenous and biogenic input represents major sediment sources, with low-oxygen environments allowing preservation of finely laminated sequences. Susceptibility logs show high values at the top sediments and small amplitude low frequency fluctuations downcore. Magnetic hysteresis loops indicate low coercivity saturation characteristic of magnetites and low-Ti titanomagnetites, with varying paramagnetic contributions. Intensity of natural remanent magnetization, saturation isothermal magnetization and coercivity parameters show similar patterns with depth. In particular, the susceptibility log shows magnetic enhancement in the upper sediments of up to 4 times the values along the core. Below 40 cm depth the exponential decay relates to diagenetic changes and magnetite authigenesis associated with organic matter oxidative decomposition during dewatering and compaction occurring above the iron reduction zone. Results support presence of recent and old dissolution fronts resulting from preservation of enriched PSD/MD magnetite in between the dissolution fronts. Oxidation/reduction conditions in turn relate to climatic and water/sediment interface factors that control dissolution processes, which occur in sub-oxic to anoxic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Ceres and Vesta are the most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. They have witnessed 4.6 Ga of solar system history. Dawn’s objective is to interview these two witnesses. These bodies are relatively simple protoplanets, with a modest amount of thermal evolution and geochemical alteration. They are our best archetypes of the early building blocks of the terrestrial planets. In particular siderophile elements in the Earth’s core were probably first segregated in Vesta-like bodies, and its water was likely first condensed in Ceres-like bodies.\nVesta has provided copious meteorites for geochemical analysis. This knowledge was used to infer the constitution of the parent body. Dawn verified that Vesta was consistent with being that body, confirming the geochemical inferences from these samples on the formation and evolution of the solar system.\nCeres has not revealed itself with a meteoritic record nor an asteroid family. While the surface is scarred with craters, it is probable that the ejecta from the crater-forming events created little competent material from the icy crust and any such ejected material that reached Earth might have disintegrated upon entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.\nCeres’ surface differs greatly from Vesta’s. Plastic or fluidized mass wasting is apparent as are many irregularly shaped craters, including many polygonal crater forms. There are many central-pit craters possibly caused by volatilization of the crust in the center of the impact. There are many central-peak craters but are these due to rebound or pingo-like formation processes? Bright spots, possibly salt deposits, dot the landscape, evidence of fluvial processes beneath the crust. Observations of the largest region of bright spots may suggest sublimation from the surface of the bright area, consistent with Herschel water vapor observations. Ceres is not only the most massive body in the asteroid belt but also possibly the most active occupant of the main belt.",

In the Colorado River Basin, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) provides forecasts of water supply conditions to resource managers throughout the basin using Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) methods that are largely driven by historical observations of temperature and precipitation. Currently, the CBRFC does not have a way to incorporate information from climatic teleconnections such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO describes warming sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that typically correlate with cool and wet winter precipitation events in California and the Lower Colorado River Basin during an El Niño event. Past research indicates the potential to identify analog ENSO events to evaluate the impact to reservoir storage in the Colorado River Basin. Current forecasts indicate the potential for one of the strongest El Niño events on record this winter.\nIn this study, information regarding the upcoming ENSO event is used to inform water supply forecasts over the Upper Colorado River Basin. These forecasts are then compared to traditionally derived water supply forecast in an attempt to evaluate the possible impact of the El Niño event to water supply over the Colorado River Basin.",

The USDA Agricultural Research Service operates several experimental watersheds which contribute to the validation of SMAP soil moisture products. These watersheds consist of a network of in situ sensors that measure soil moisture at a variety of depths including the 5 cm depth, which is critical for satellite validation. Comparisons of the in situ network estimates to the satellite products are ongoing, but initial results have shown strong correlation between satellite estimates and in situ soil moisture measurements once scaling functions were applied. The scaling methodologies for the in situ networks are being reviewed and evaluated. Results from the Little Washita, Fort Cobb, St. Joseph’s and Little River Experimental Watersheds show good agreement between the satellite products and in situ measurements. Walnut Gulch results show high accuracy, although with the caveat that these domains are semi-arid with a substantially lower dynamic range. The South Fork Watershed is examined more closely for its detailed scaling function development as well as an apparent bias between satellite and in situ values.",

Three pairs of 7-year control and pseudo global warming simulations (with horizontal grid spacings of 4, 12, and 36 km) are used to study how the SAF modifies the regional climate response to a large-scale thermodynamic perturbation. The SAF substantially enhances warming within the Headwaters domain, locally as much as 5 °C in regions of snow loss. The SAF also increases the inter-annual variability of the springtime warming within Headwaters domain under the perturbed climate.\nLinear feedback analysis is used quantify the strength of the SAF. The SAF attains a maximum value of 4 W m-2 K-1 during April when snow loss coincides with strong incoming solar radiation. On sub-seasonal timescales, simulations at 4 km and 12 km horizontal grid-spacing show good agreement in the strength and timing of the SAF, whereas a 36km simulation shows greater discrepancies that are tired to differences in snow accumulation and ablation caused by smoother terrain.\nAn analysis of the regional energy budget shows that transport by atmospheric motion acts as a negative feedback to regional warming, damping the effects of the SAF. On the mesoscale, this transport causes non-local warming in locations with no snow.\nThe methods presented here can be used generally to quantify the role of the SAF in other regional climate modeling experiments.",

Ice clouds (i.e. cirrus) cause problems with these cloud property retrieval algorithms because of their variability in ice mass as a function of particle size. Assumptions regarding the microphysical properties, such as mass-dimensional (m-D) relationships, are often necessary in retrieval algorithms for simplification, but these assumptions create uncertainties of their own. Therefore, ice cloud property retrieval uncertainties can be substantial and are often not well known. To investigate these uncertainties, reflectivity factors measured by CloudSat are compared to those calculated from particle size distributions (PSDs) to which different m-D relationships are applied. These PSDs are from data collected in situ during three flights of the Small Particles in Cirrus (SPartICus) campaign. We find that no specific habit emerges as preferred and instead we conclude that the microphysical characteristics of ice crystal populations tend to be distributed over a continuum and, therefore, cannot be categorized easily. To quantify the uncertainties in the mass-dimensional relationships, an optimal estimation inversion was run to retrieve the m-D relationship per SPartICus flight, as well as to calculate uncertainties of the m-D power law.",

The Mexican Array Radio Telescope (MEXART) is a single-station instrument operating at 140 MHz, fully dedicated to perform solar-wind studies employing the IPS technique. We present MEXART solar-wind measurements (scintillation indices and solar-wind speeds), reporting the first observations of four IPS sources (3C273, 3C283, 3C286, 3C298) detected by MEXART during October-December 2014. We present the first MEXART measurements of the transit of an IPS radio source (3C298) from weak to strong scattering regions, and the initial MEXART heliographic maps of solar wind conditions. The MEXART observations will complement the solar wind IPS studies using other frequencies, and the tracking of solar wind disturbances by other stations located at different longitudes. These solar wind measurements, provided in real time, can have space weather forecasting applications.",

            "abstract": "Floods are among the most devastating natural hazards and the ability to produce an accurate and timely flood assessment before, during, and after an event is critical for their mitigation and response. Remote sensing technologies have become the de-facto approach for observing the Earth and its environment. However, satellite remote sensing data are not always available. For these reasons, it is crucial to develop new techniques in order to produce flood assessments during and after an event.\nRecent advancements in data fusion techniques of remote sensing with near real time heterogeneous datasets have allowed emergency responders to more efficiently extract increasingly precise and relevant knowledge from the available information. This research presents a fusion technique using satellite remote sensing imagery coupled with non-authoritative data such as Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and tweets.\nA new computational methodology is proposed based on machine learning algorithms to automatically identify water pixels in CAP imagery. Specifically, wavelet transformations are paired with multiple classifiers, run in parallel, to build models discriminating water and non-water regions. The learned classification models are first tested against a set of control cases, and then used to automatically classify each image separately. A measure of uncertainty is computed for each pixel in an image proportional to the number of models classifying the pixel as water.\nGeo-tagged tweets are continuously harvested and stored on a MongoDB and queried in real time. They are fused with CAP classified data, and with satellite remote sensing derived flood extent results to produce comprehensive flood assessment maps. The final maps are then compared with FEMA generated flood extents to assess their accuracy. The proposed methodology is applied on two test cases, relative to the 2013 floods in Boulder CO, and the 2015 floods in Texas.",

            "abstract": "Accurately initializing snow model states, and in particular snow water equivalent (SWE), in hydrologic prediction models is important for predicting future snowmelt, water supplies and flooding potential. While ground-based snow observations give the most reliable information about snowpack conditions, they are spatially limited and quite sparse in regions such as the north-central USA. Satellites are the most likely source of snow observations to fill this data gap. Using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation framework, we test the assimilation of AMSR-E SWE into the US National Weather Service (NWS) SNOW17 model for seven watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River basin. SNOW17 is coupled with the NWS Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SACSMA) model, and both simulated SWE and discharge are evaluated. Prior to assimilation, AMSR-E data is bias corrected using data from the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) airborne snow survey program. Updating occurs on a daily cycle for water years 2006-2011. Results show improved discharge for five of the seven study sites as compared to the SNOW17 without assimilation. The assimilation of AMSR-E SWE produced high skill for peak flows during periods of snow melt, with one study site displaying a 36% improvement in simulated peak flow. As calibrated, the SNOW17 consistently underestimates the SWE and snow melt rates in these basins. Overall results indicate that updating SNOW17 SWE with AMRS-E data is a viable and effective solution for improving simulations of the operational forecast models.",

These seismic arrivals are often labeled as “artifacts” (or “spurious arrivals”) due to their unrealistic apparent velocities and non-causal arrival times. We discuss the appearance in both reflection profiles produced by auto-correlation as well shot gathers generated using cross-correlations of seismograms from sources with various depth distributions. We show that relatively deep sources (below the imaged interface) produce stronger and more coherent \"conventional\" reflections, especially at small offsets. Shallow sources are more effective in retrieving direct and refracted arrivals. We also show how energy associated with critically refracted energy can be shifted during cross-correlation with corresponding loss of information about the depth of velocity gradient causing the refraction. Furthermore, we describe how the contribution of such artifacts can be minimized by proper design of recording arrays, and how useful information can be extracted from the artifacts themselves by modeling.",

            "abstract": "Significant areas of the Brazilian Amazon have been deforested over the past few decades, with fire being the dominant method through which forests and vegetation are cleared. Fires emit large quantities of particulate matter into the atmosphere, degrading air quality and negatively impacting human health. Since 2004, Brazil has achieved substantial reductions in deforestation rates and associated deforestation fires. Here we assess the impact of this reduction on air quality and human health. We show that dry season (August – October) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by satellite over southwest Brazil and Bolivia is positively related to Brazil’s annual deforestation rate (r=0.96, P<0.001). Observed dry season AOD is more than a factor two greater in years with high deforestation rates compared to years with low deforestation rates, suggesting regional air quality is degraded substantially by fire emissions associated with deforestation. This link is further demonstrated by the positive relationship between observed AOD and satellite-derived particulate emissions from deforestation fires (r=0.89, P<0.01). Using a global aerosol model with satellite-derived fire emissions, we show that reductions in fires associated with reduced deforestation have reduced regional dry season mean surface particulate matter concentrations by ~30%. Using concentration response functions we estimate that this reduction in particulate matter may be preventing 1060 (388-1721) premature adult mortalities annually across South America. Future increases in Brazil’s deforestation rates and associated fires may threaten the improved air quality reported here.",

            "abstract": "Significant in the transport and dispersal of energy, matter, and biota within riverine environments, hydrologic connectivity has become fundamental in understanding river-floodplain process and concepts associated with environmental flows. Hydrologic connectivity between a river and its floodplain is dependent on floodplain geomorphology, channel hydraulics, land cover, and groundwater dynamics. In this study, we examine the floodplain morphology of the Mission River on the Coastal Bend of Texas. Utilizing a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model, we develop a relative digital elevation model (RDEM), with respect to river-stage, for a reach of the river-floodplain system. To assess the dominant flow directions, and thus, characterize the connectivity within the floodplain, we determine hydrological facets—landscape patches with their own respective outlet and high internal surface water connectivity. Guided by historical streamflow records, we systematically threshold the RDEM to determine the spatial characteristics of floodplain inundation under various river-stages. The increasing aerial extent of floodplain inundation from increases in river-stage results in distinct patterns of river channel–floodplain connectivity. We analyze the spatial arrangement of facets with regard to inundation in order to quantify floodplain connectivity and complexity at various river-stages using graph theory and landscape metrics. Our results indicate that floodplain connectivity and complexity change nonlinearly with increases in river-stage; with the greatest increases in connectivity and complexity occurring well below bankfull discharge. Floodplains provide valuable ecosystem services and this study helps improve our understanding of process-form relationships in river-floodplain systems’ that informs environmental policy for effective management of these services.",

We analyze 13 solar occultations observed by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS), of which 4 occultations show a clear signature of diffracted sunlight. The magnitude and scattering angle of the diffraction signal suggest the presence of a significant population of micron-sized dust particles; however, the lack of a detection of diffracted light in other solar occultations implies that such a population is transient or spatially variable. Initial comparisons with images from the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) suggest that a diffraction signal is detected in UVIS occultations that coincide with a recent collisional event in the F ring core, as seen in the ISS images. This implies that such events release a significant population of dust, which can then be measured by the diffraction signature in the UVIS data. We use a forward-modeling approach to place constraints on the particle size distribution of the F ring during each solar occultation. We present these measurements of the size distribution and our comparisons of the F ring dust population as measured by UVIS with the ISS images of the ring.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic imaging of strain and stress during rupture enables unprecedented observations of key rupture features as well as decoding the nature of friction. We present the dynamic evolution of strains and stresses in our dynamic rupture experiments. We employ a laboratory earthquake setup to study dynamic ruptures in a highly instrumented setting, where we produce both supershear and sub-Rayleigh events. Earthquakes are mimicked in the laboratory by dynamic rupture propagating along the inclined frictional interface of two quadrilateral Homalite plates prestressed in compression and shear. The diagnostics previously employed in this setup include temporally accurate but spatially sparse laser velocimetry measurements as well as a sequence of full-field photoelastic images. These measurements have been successfully employed to capture important rupture features but they do not give enough information to characterize the full-field strains and stresses. In this study, we obtain the experimental sequences of full-field displacements, velocities, strains and stresses produced under a wide range of slip rates by our newly developed technique of ultra high-speed digital image correlation (DIC). This is the first technique capable of imaging spatial and temporal variations in strains and stresses during spontaneously developing experimental dynamic rupture. This technique combines pattern-matching algorithms with ultra-high-speed photography and highly tailored analysis to obtain full-field time histories. We have verified the accuracy of the measurements by comparing the velocity time-histories at selected locations with the measurements using the well-developed technique of laser velocimetry. The newly developed ultra-high-speed full-field imaging technique can also be used to obtain unprecedented measurements of evolving dynamic friction during dynamic rupture, and we will report on our initial results on the dynamic friction evolution.",

            "abstract": "Pacaya volcano is a persistently active basaltic cone complex located in the Central American Volcanic Arc in Guatemala. In May, 2010, violent VEI-3 eruptions caused significant topographic changes to the edifice, including the dispersion of ~20 cm of tephra and ash on the cone, the emplacement of a ~5.4 km long lava flow, and 3 m of co-eruptive movement of the southwest flank. For this study, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images (interferograms) processed from both spaceborne Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and aerial Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data were used to measure post-eruptive deformation events. Interferograms suggest four distinct deformation processes after the May 2010 eruption: (1) magma intrusion near the vents of the 2010 lava flow; (2) subsidence of the 2010 lava flow; (3) slow deflation of an elongated magma source near the summit, and; (4) settlement of the material involved in the co-eruptive slope movement. Our results provide insights into Pacaya’s complex magmatic plumbing system and the postemplacement behavior of lava flows. The detection of several different deformation events emphasizes the utility of measuring volcanic deformation using high-resolution remote sensing techniques with broad spatial coverage.",

            "abstract": "Full-scale carbon capture and storage in deep saline aquifers implies injecting important quantities of carbon in order to significantly reduce greenhouse gases emissions. At the basin scale, impacts related to CO2 injection are pressure perturbation as well as brine migration into freshwater aquifers. In this study, potential impacts of an industrial-scale carbon capture and storage project in Bécancour (Quebec, Canada), in the St. Lawrence Lowlands basin, are discussed, as well as the role played by regional normal faults that divide the basin into multiple compartments. The basin is 300 km long and 90 km wide, formed by sub-horizontal Paleozoic formations on top of which the Utica and Lorraine shale formations represent the caprock of the potential CO2reservoir. These formations cover most of the basin, except in its eroded northwestern part, located between 10 to 40 km away from the potential injection sites.\nThree injection scenarios were considered, corresponding to greenhouse gases emissions from large emitters located; in Bécancour industrial park, in a larger area that allow affordable transport and in the entire basin without considering transport costs (1, 5, 10 Mt/yr). The numerical model FEFLOW was used to simulate CO2 injection into different compartments to evaluate pressure build up propagation and brine migration in order to define which compartments are best suited for long-term storage. The simulations considered an injection period of 100 years and post-injections period of 1000 years.\nNumerical simulations indicate that normal faults, which exhibit a low hydraulic conductivity, play a major role orienting pressure build-up and brine migration. Due to the presence of normal faults, no pressure build up occurred close to the surface. Similarly, preliminary mass transport simulations show very limited brine migration. These first results indicate that basin-scale impacts of carbon injection are low for the 3 injection scenarios, however, the significant uncertainty about hydrodynamics parameters of formations and faults calls for an extensive sensitivity analysis.",

            "abstract": "One of the scientific objectives of the enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (e-POP) Radio Receiver Instrument (RRI) is to study ionospheric density structure and its impact on High Frequency (HF) radio wave propagation. We present a survey of several ePOP RRI transits through isolated beams of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) Saskatoon and Rankin Inlet radars. It reveals that the spreading of a SuperDARN beam beyond its nominal azimuthal beam width of 3.24° is a common occurrence at auroral and polar latitudes. Furthermore, on multiple occasions, lateral deviations of a beam’s power peak by several beam widths was measured, indicating the presence of significant plasma density gradients along the ray path. The e-POP RRI measurements illustrate that our understanding and recognition of plasma density gradients and their influence on HF radio wave propagation is limited. We report on the results of employing HF ray tracing techniques to quantify the impact of ionospheric structuring on HF radio wave propagation, and consider the source of the gradients contributing to the spreading of the SuperDARN beams.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that incorporating prior information into tomographic inversion problems can reduce non-uniqueness and improve imaging resolution. In many cases, useful information is available that can be used to constrain the inversion beyond the standard forms of Occam’s type regularization constraints. For example, the sign of the change in some estimated property may be known across some physical (e.g. borehole, water table) or temporal boundary (e.g. after a tracer injection). Or, some estimate of the probability that an estimated parameter takes on a particular value in a particular region of the model may be available. In this talk, we present a flexible method of incorporating such information into static and time lapse inversion problems using iteratively reweighted least squares. The approach uses combinations of weighting functions and structural metrics to encourage a particular condition via inequality constraints. Using electrical resistivity tomography, we demonstrate several examples where incorporating relatively simple forms of prior information dramatically alter the inverse solution and significantly improve imaging resolution.",

            "abstract": "The structure, composition and evolution of Mercury, the innermost planet, are puzzling, as its high uncompressed density implies a body highly enriched in metallic iron, whilst the existence of Mercury’s magnetic field and observations of its longitude librations [1] suggest at least a partially molten core. This study uses a combination of experimental and ab-initio computer simulation techniques to determine the properties of Fe-S-Si (relative atomic percentages, 80:10:10) throughout the conditions of the interior of the planet Mercury, and evaluates the implications of this material for the structure and evolution of the planet’s core. Previous studies have considered the addition of sulphur to the pure iron system, as this can significantly depress the melting curve of iron, and so may possibly allow Mercury’s core to remain molten to the present day [2]. However, important constraints placed by the MESSENGER spacecraft on Mercury’s surface abundance of iron [3] suggest that the planet formed in highly reduced conditions, in which significant amounts of silicon could have also dissolved into the core [4]. First-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the thermodynamic properties of liquid Fe-S-Si, alongside laser-heated diamond-anvil-cell experiments to determine the melting behaviour of the same composition, reveal the slopes of the adiabatic gradient and melting curve respectively, which together may allow insight into the evolution of our solar system’s smallest planet.\n[1] Margot, J.

Several studies have been focused in this crater structure due its association with the Cretaceous/Paleogenous boundary events. The aim of this study is document the abrupt climate changes during the K/Pg and P/E boundaries based on the stratigraphy, magnetic properties (magnetic susceptibility) and geochemical (major elements) records in the Yaxcopoil-1 (Yax-1) borehole in the Chicxulub impact crater.\nThe Yax 1 was drilled at 20° 44' 38.45'' N, 89° 43' 6.70'' W. Two intervals from 830 to 750 and between 750 and 700 m depth were selected for this study. Magnetic susceptibility logs and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) measures were taken every 10 cm using a Bartington magnetic susceptibility meter and a Thermo Scientific Niton XL3tGOLDD XRF analyzer.\nResults show variations in magnetic susceptibility logs and major elements (Ca, Si, Fe, Ti and Si) content in the K/Pg boundary at ca. 794 m depth. Magnetic susceptibility decrease abruptly, Ca values increase, and the other elements show low values.\nGeochemical results, manly the Ca-record, suggest that the P/E boundary might have happened around 745 m depth. These values are compared with 13C isotopes and they coincide with the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE), suggesting their relationship with the abrupt climate change and with the ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "Many inverse problems in geophysics are solved within the Bayesian framework, in which a prior probability density function of a quantity of interest is optimally updated using newly available observations. A maximum likelihood of the posterior probability density function is estimated using a model of the physics that relates the variables to be optimized to the observations. However, in many practical situations the number of observations is much smaller than the number of variables estimated, which leads to an ill-posed problem. In practice, this means that the data are informative only in a subspace of the initial space. It is both of theoretical and practical interest to characterize this \"data-informed\" subspace, since it allows a simple interpretation of the inverse solution and its uncertainty, but can also dramatically reduce the computational cost of the optimization by reducing the size of the problem. In this presentation the formalism of dimension reduction in Bayesian methods will be introduced, and different optimality criteria will be discussed (e.g., minimum error variances, maximum degree of freedom for signal). For each criterion, an optimal design for the reduced Bayesian problem will be proposed and compared with other suboptimal approaches. A significant advantage of our method is its high scalability owing to an efficient parallel implementation, making it very attractive for large-scale inverse problems. Numerical results from an Observation Simulation System Experiment (OSSE) consisting of a high spatial resolution (0.5°x0.7°) source inversion of methane over North America using observations from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) instrument and the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model will illustrate the computational efficiency of our approach. Although only linear models are considered in this study, possible extensions to the non-linear case will also be discussed",

            "abstract": "An expert panel was tasked with estimating the percent of the nitrogen (N) load from septic systems that was lost in the flow path from a typical home to third-order streams as part of the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). These losses were referred to as attenuation factors. We developed values for the soil (unsaturated) zone and for the Piedmont and Coastal Plain groundwater zones. For the soil zone, we used the Soil Treatment Unit MODel (STUMOD) to estimate loses due to denitrification for all 12 soil textural classes and then averaged the results over three textural groups. Assuming hydraulic loading at the design rate and a conventional system, the attenuation factors were 16% for sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and loam soils; 34% for silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and silt soils; and 54% for sandy clay, silty clay, and clay soils. Attenuation factors increased in the more clayey soils due to wetter conditions and more losses due to denitrification. Attenuation factors were also developed for reduced hydraulic loading rates and for systems using advanced N pre-treatment. For the Piedmont groundwater zone, we used data from a recent study in Georgia of small suburban streams with high-density septic systems. Stream base-flow load was estimated using simultaneous measurements of total N concentration and discharge and compared to the estimated groundwater input load, resulting in an attenuation factor of 81%. For the Coastal Plain groundwater zone, literature values of groundwater N concentrations within septic system plumes in Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida were used to estimate an attenuation factor of approximately 60% at 100m downgradient from the drainfield. These attenuation factors will be used to estimate the contribution of N to the Chesapeake Bay in the Phase 6 TMDL models.",

While past resource practices addressed these resource issues separately, both the scientific and the policy communities now acknowledge the close connections between them. Substantial work has been done quantifying and analyzing water requirements of both specific energy systems and integrated scenario projections. Less (albeit some) work has been done evaluating and analyzing the energy and greenhouse gas implications of building and operating water systems. But acknowledging and even quantifying these links is not the same as truly integrating them into decisions about water or energy use, changing policies or infrastructure to account for the connections, or actually advancing sustainable resource management.

The vast majority of the effort in this area has focused on the water needs of electricity generation, but other fuel-cycle components also entail significant water demands and threats to water quality. Recent work for the State of California (managed by the California Council on Science and Technology – CCST) has produced a new state-of-the-art assessment of a range of potential water risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and related oil and gas extraction, including volumetric water demands, methods of disposal of produced water, and aquifer contamination. For example, this assessment produced new information on the disposal of produced water in surface percolation pits and the potential for contamination of local groundwater (see Figure). Understanding these risks raises questions about current production and future plans to expand production, as well as tools used by state and federal agencies to manage these risks. This talk will summarize the science behind the CCST assessment and related policy recommendations for both water and energy managers.",

            "abstract": "Storage of CO2 in aquifers is one of several options for reducing the emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere. Generally this option requires sealing integrity through layers of clay or shale. Many reservoirs have regions of temperature and pressure inside hydrate formation conditions. Whether hydrate formation can provide long term extra sealing still remains unverified in view of all co-existing phases that affect hydrate stability. Yet another storage option for CO2 is in the form of hydrate through exchange of in situ CH4 hydrate.\nInjection of CO2 into hydrate filled sediments is challenging due to the partial filling of pores with hydrate which results in low porosity and low permeability. Formation of new hydrate from injected CO2 will enhance these problems, Mixing N2 gas with the CO2 will increase permeability and will reduce driving forces for formation of new hydrate from pore water and injection gas.\nHydrate can generally not reach thermodynamic equilibrium due to Gibbs' phase rule and the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics. These thermodynamic constraints on distribution of masses over co-existing phases are dynamically coupled to local mass- and heat-transport. Reservoir simulations are one possible method for investigation of possible scenarios related to injection of CO2 with N2 into aquifers containing CH4 hydrate.\nIn this work we have developed prevoiusly modified RetrasoCodeBrite (RCB) simulator to handle injection of CO2/N2 gas mixtures. Hydrate formation and dissociation were determined by investigating Gibbs free energy differences between hydrate and hydrate formers. Gibbs free energy differences were calculated from changes in chemical potentials, which were obtained using non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach.\nFurther extension of RCB has been implemented in this work through adding on-the-fly thermodynamic calculations. Correspondingly, hydrate phase transitions are calculated directly inside the code as a result of super-saturation and under-saturation with respect to pressure and CO2 gas mole-fraction. Classical nucleation theory is used to investigate the rate of hydrate formation and dissociation towards the water and gas phases.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is of fundamental importance to many hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes, plays an important role in the development and evolution of convective weather and precipitation, and impacts water resource management, agriculture, and flood runoff prediction. The launch of NASA’s Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission in 2015 promises to provide global measurements of soil moisture and surface freeze/thaw state at fixed crossing times and spatial resolutions as low as 5 km for some products. However, there exists a need for measurements of soil moisture on smaller spatial scales and arbitrary diurnal times for SMAP validation, precision agriculture and evaporation and transpiration studies of boundary layer heat transport. The Lobe Differencing Correlation Radiometer (LDCR) provides a means of mapping soil moisture on spatial scales as small as several meters (i.e., the height of the platform) .Compared with various other proposed methods of validation based on either situ measurements [1,2] or existing airborne sensors suitable for manned aircraft deployment [3], the integrated design of the LDCR on a lightweight small UAS (sUAS) is capable of providing sub-watershed (~km scale) coverage at very high spatial resolution (~15 m) suitable for scaling scale studies, and at comparatively low operator cost.\nThe LDCR on Tempest unit can supply the soil moisture mapping with different resolution which is of order the Tempest altitude.",

            "abstract": "To date, elevated Ir levels in continental sediments proximal to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (TJB) have been reported only from Upper Triassic strata of the Newark and Fundy basins, below the basal extrusive units of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. We report here the first occurrence of elevated Ir above the oldest volcanic units, as well as additional horizons of Ir enrichment from other basins of the Newark Supergroup. In the Fundy Basin (Nova Scotia, Canada), lacustrine sediments of the Scots Bay Member of the McCoy Brook Formation that directly overlie the North Mountain Basalt contain Ir up to 413 pg/g in fish-bearing strata very close to the palynological TJB. Higher in the formation the strata lack significant Ir enrichment. Similarly, sedimentary strata from between flows of North Mount Basalt show no Ir appreciable enrichment. The Deerfield Basin (Massachusetts) extension of the Hartford Basin contains only one CAMP extrusive unit, the Lower Jurassic Deerfield Basalt. Very modest Ir enrichment, up to 90 pg/g, occurs in the Fall River Beds of the Sugarloaf Formation, several meters below the basalt, and up to 70 pg/g in the Turners Falls Formation less than 2 meters above the basalt. The uppermost New Haven Formation (Upper Triassic) at the Silver Ridge locality (Guilford, CT) in the Hartford Basin contains abundant plant debris, but no evidence of elevated Ir. At the Clathopteris locality to the north (Holyoke, MA), potentially correlative strata that are fine grained and rich in plant remains have Ir enriched to 542 pg/g, an order of magnitude higher than in the coarser-grained strata in direct stratigraphic contact. The high-Ir beds also have elevated REEs relative to other Hartford Basin samples, although there is no evidence of HREE enrichment. We consider the basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, widely accepted as the driver of Late Triassic extinctions, as the origin of the elevated Ir levels in the Newark Supergroup.",

            "abstract": "The mini-LEO hill slope, located at Biosphere 2, is a small-scale catchment model that is used to study the ways landscapes change in response to biological, chemical, and hydrological processes. Previous experiments have shown that soil heterogeneity can develop as a result of groundwater flow; changing the characteristics of the landscape. To determine whether or not flow has caused heterogeneity within the mini-LEO hill slope, numerical models were used to simulate the observed seepage flow, water table height, and storativity.\nTo begin a numerical model of the hill slope was created using CATchment Hydrology (CATHY). The model was then brought to an initial steady state by applying a rainfall event of 5mm/day for 180 days. Then a specific rainfall experiment of alternating intensities was applied to the model. Next, a parameter calibration was conducted, to fit the model to the observed data, by changing soil parameters individually. The parameters of the best fitting calibration were taken to be the most representative of those present within the mini-LEO hill slope. Our model concluded that heterogeneities had indeed arisen as a result of the rainfall event, resulting in a lower hydraulic conductivity downslope. The lower hydraulic conductivity downslope in turn caused in an increased storage of water and a decrease in seepage flow compared to homogeneous models. This shows that the hydraulic processes acting within a landscape can change the very characteristics of the landscape itself, namely the permeability and conductivity of the soil. In the future results from the excavation of soil in mini-LEO can be compared to the models results to improve the model and validate its findings.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation foliage clumping significantly alters its radiation environment and therefore affects vegetation growth as well as water and carbon cycles. The clumping index is useful in ecological and meteorological models because it provides new structural information in addition to the effective leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from mono-angle remote sensing and allows accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in the canopy. Not accounting for the foliage clumping in LAI retrieval algorithms leads to substantial underestimation of actual LAI, especially for needleleaf forests. Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been previously used to retrieve global clumping index maps from POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER) data at ~6 km resolution, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product at 500 m resolution. Most recently the algorithm was applied with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 275 m resolution over selected areas. In this presentation we characterize and intercompare the three products over a set of sites representing diverse biomes and different canopy structures. The products are also directly validated with both in-situ vertical profiles and seasonal trajectories of clumping index. We illustrate that the vertical distribution of foliage and especially the effect of understory needs to be taken into account while validating foliage clumping products from remote sensing products with values measured in the field. Satellite measurements respond to the structural effects near the top of canopies, while ground measurements may be biased by the lower vegetation layers. Additionally, caution should be taken regarding the misclassification in land cover maps as their errors can be propagated into the foliage clumping maps. Our results indicate that MODIS data and MISR data with 275 m resolution in particular can provide good quality clumping index estimates at pertinent scales for modeling local carbon and energy fluxes.",

Recently, second stage anvil, which was loaded inside the diamond anvil cell (DAC), had been reported by various groups. This method could generate pressure over 300 GPa, or above 600 GPa from the EoS measurement of Re metal between the tiny anvil or 2 half-spheres. Several alternative approaches, using ruby balls, or glassy carbon, or diamond, with single sphere, 2 half-spheres, or multi spheres geometry inside DAC, were tested. The NIST X-ray powder standard, ZnO was selected as pressure marker. Focused ion beam (FIB) was used to cut the half-sphere from diamond anvil top directly to avoid the difficulty of alignment. The synchrotron x-ray diffraction with fine beam size down to 100 nm using zone plate set-up was used to map the pressure gradient at the sphere or half-sphere zone inside DAC. The pressure could be boosted at center of sphere by up to 10 - 70 GPa at about 200 GPa conditions. From broken anvils, trace element analysis using fine focusing synchrotron x-ray fluorescence method revealed the potential anvil damage from FIB cutting the diamond anvil tip, which might decrease the strength of anvils. Fine touch from FIB cutting at final stage using low ion beam current is suggested.",

This uncontrolled and huge amount of migration brings out urbanization and socio – economic problems. The demand on settling the industrial areas and commercial activities nearby the city centers results with a negative change in natural land cover on cities. Negative impacts of human induced activities on natural resources and land cover has been continuously increasing for decades. The main human activities that resulted with destruction and infraction of forest areas can be defined as mining activities, agricultural activities, industrial / commercial activities and urbanization.\nTemporal monitoring of the changes in spatial distribution of forest areas is significantly important for effective management and planning progress. Changes can occur as spatially large destructions or small infractions. Therefore there is a need for reliable, fast and accurate data sources. At this point, satellite images proved to be a good data source for determination of the land use /cover changes with their capability of monitoring large areas with reasonable temporal resolutions. Spectral information derived from images provides discrimination of land use/cover types from each other. Developments in remote sensing technology in the last decade improved the spatial resolution of satellites and high resolution images were started to be used to detect even small changes in the land surface.\nAs being the megacity of Turkey, Istanbul has been facing a huge migration for the last 20 years and effects of urbanization and other human based activities over forest areas are significant. Main focus of this study is to determine the destructions and infractions in forest areas of Istanbul, Turkey with 2.5m resolution SPOT 5 multi-temporal satellite imagery. Analysis was mainly constructed on threshold based classification of multi-temporal vegetation index data derived from satellite images. Determined changes were exported to GIS environment and spatial overlay and intersection analyses were performed with use of forest type maps and authorized area maps in order to demonstrate the actual situation of destructions and infractions.",

            "abstract": "Radiative transfer (RT) computations form the engine of atmospheric retrieval codes. However, full treatment of RT processes is computationally expensive, prompting usage of two-stream approximations in current exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval codes [Line et al., 2013]. Natraj et al. [2005, 2010] and Spurr and Natraj [2013] demonstrated the ability of a technique using principal component analysis (PCA) to speed up RT computations. In the PCA method for RT performance enhancement, empirical orthogonal functions are developed for binned sets of inherent optical properties that possess some redundancy; costly multiple-scattering RT calculations are only done for those few optical states corresponding to the most important principal components, and correction factors are applied to approximate radiation fields. Kopparla et al. [2015, in preparation] extended the PCA method to a broadband spectral region from the ultraviolet to the shortwave infrared (0.3-3 micron), accounting for major gas absorptions in this region.\nHere, we apply the PCA method to a some typical (exo-)planetary retrieval problems. Comparisons between the new model, called Universal Principal Component Analysis Radiative Transfer (UPCART) model, two-stream models and line-by-line RT models are performed, for spectral radiances, spectral fluxes and broadband fluxes. Each of these are calculated at the top of the atmosphere for several scenarios with varying aerosol types, extinction and scattering optical depth profiles, and stellar and viewing geometries. We demonstrate that very accurate radiance and flux estimates can be obtained, with better than 1% accuracy in all spectral regions and better than 0.1% in most cases, as compared to a numerically exact line-by-line RT model. The accuracy is enhanced when the results are convolved to typical instrument resolutions. The operational speed and accuracy of UPCART can be further improved by optimizing binning schemes and parallelizing the codes, work on which is under way.",

The method aims at reducing model error through improvement of urban parameterization and representation of observations employed as input data. The multi-scale variation of parameter values are demonstrated for several methods of utilizing input.

Modeling studies suggest that coarse mode mineral dust and sea salt aerosol are the dominant contributors to aerosol optical depth throughout much of the globe. Lab and field studies indicate that larger aerosol particles tend to be more efficient ice nuclei, and recent airborne measurements confirm the dominant role of mineral dust on cirrus cloud formation. However, our ability to simulate coarse mode particle abundance in large scale models is limited by a lack of validating measurements above the earth’s surface. We present airborne measurements of coarse mode aerosol abundance and composition over several mid-latitude, sub-tropical, and tropical regions from the boundary layer to the stratosphere. In the free troposphere the coarse mode constitutes 10-50% of the total particulate mass over a wide range of environments. Above North America mineral dust typically dominates the coarse mode, but biomass burning particles and sea salt also contribute. In remote environments coarse mode aerosol mainly consists of internally mixed sulfate-organic particles. Both continental and marine convection can enhance coarse aerosol mass through direct lofting of primary particles and by secondary accumulation of aerosol material through cloud processing.",

            "abstract": "It has been known for some time that positive leaders exhibit impulsive charge motion and optical emissions as they extend. However, laboratory and field observations have not produced any evidence of a process analogous to the space leader mechanism of negative leader extension. Instead, observations have suggested that the positive leader tip undergoes a continuous to intermittent series of corona streamer bursts, each burst resulting in a small forward extension of the positive leader channel. Traditionally, it has been held that lightning positive leaders extend in a continuous or quasi-continuous fashion. Lately, however, many have become concerned that this position is incongruous with observations of impulsive activity during lightning positive leader extension. It is increasingly suggested that this impulsive activity is evidence that positive leaders also undergo “stepping”.\nThere are two issues that must be addressed. The first issue concerns whether or not the physical processes underlying impulsive extension in negative and positive leaders are distinct. We argue that these processes are in fact physically distinct, and offer new high-speed video evidence to support this position. The second issue regards the proper use of the term “step” as an identifier for the impulsive forward extension of a leader. Traditional use of this term has been applied only to negative leaders, due primarily to their stronger impulsive charge motions and photographic evidence of clearly discontinuous forward progression of the luminous channel. Recently, due to the increasing understanding of the distinct “space leader” process of negative leader extension, the term “step” has increasingly come to be associated with the space leader process itself. Should this emerging association, “step” = space leader attachment, be canonized? If not, then it seems reasonable to use the term “step” to describe impulsive positive leader extension. If, however, we do wish to associate the term “step” with space leader attachment, a process unique to negative leaders, should we devise a term for those process(es) that underly impulsive positive leader extension?",

To achieve the first objective, we compiled a dataset of 5 proxies from seven locations across the Yucatan Peninsula, to be compared with temperature and precipitation output from the Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), which is part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) past1000 experiment. The proxy dataset includes oxygen isotopes from speleothems and gastropod/ostrocod shells (11 records); and sediment density, mineralogy, and magnetic susceptibility records from lake sediment cores (3 records). The proxy dataset is supplemented by a compilation of reconstructed temperatures using pollen and tree ring records for North America (archived in the PAGES2k global network data). Our preliminary analysis suggests that many of these datasets show evidence of drier and warmer climate on the Yucatan Peninsula around the T.C.P. when compared to modern conditions, although the amplitude and timing of individual warming and drying events varies between sites. This comparison with modeled output will ultimately be used to inform backward shift factors that will be input to a stochastic weather generator. These shift factors will be based on monthly changes in temperature and precipitation and applied to a modern daily climate time series for the Yucatan Peninsula to produce a daily climate time series for the T.C.P.",

            "abstract": "Data on the frequency, duration and elevation of cloud immersion is essential to improve estimates of cloud water deposition in water budgets in cloud forests. Here, we present a methodology to detect local cloud immersion in remote tropical forests using time-lapse photography. A simple approach is developed to detect cloudy conditions in photographs within the canopy where image depth during clear conditions may be less than 10 meters and moving leaves and branches and changes in lighting are unpredictable. A primary innovation of this study is that cloudiness is determined from images without using a reference clear image and without minimal threshold value determination or human judgment for calibration. Five sites ranging from 600 to 1000 meters elevation along a ridge in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico were each equipped with a trail camera programmed to take an image every 30 minutes since March 2014. Images were classified using four selected cloud-sensitive image characteristics (SCICs) computed for small image regions: contrast, the coefficient of variation and the entropy of the luminance of each image pixel, and image colorfulness. K-means clustering provided reasonable results to discriminate cloudy from clear conditions. Preliminary results indicate that 79-94% (daytime) and 85-93% (nighttime) of validation images were classified accurately at one open and two closed canopy sites. The euclidian distances between SCICs vectors of images during cloudy conditions and the SCICs vector of the centroid of the cluster of clear images show potential to quantify cloud density in addition to immersion. The classification method will be applied to determine spatial and temporal patterns of cloud immersion in the study area. The presented approach offers promising applications to increase observations of low-lying clouds at remote mountain sites where standard instruments to measure visibility and cloud base may not be practical.",

To capture this process, we have developed a three-dimensional, time-dependent, and physics-based model WP-GITM (Wave Perturbation – Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model). WP-GITM consists of two dynamically coupled components: 1) an analytical model that solves for atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves at 100 km altitude given ground or ocean displacements; and 2) the first-principles model GITM that describes the responses of the upper atmosphere between 100 km and 600 km altitudes. We report recent WP-GITM developments and simulations of actual earthquake and tsunami events. We validate the simulated TEC perturbations through Global Positioning System (GPS) observations and have found reasonable agreement. As an advanced modeling tool, WP-GITM can provide many insights of ionospheric signatures generated by a variety of natural hazards.",

Some examples of science planning include priority-setting for research, knowledge translation, stakeholder engagement, improved coordination, and international collaboration. The International Study of Arctic Change recently initiated an analysis of the extent to which alignment exists among stated science priorities, recognized societal needs, and funding patterns of the major North American and European agencies. In this paper, we present a decade of data on international funding patterns and data on two decades of science planning. We discuss whether funding patterns reflect the priority research questions and identified needs for information that are articulated in a myriad of Arctic research planning documents. The alignment in many areas remains poor, bringing into question the purpose of large-scale science planning if it does not lead to funding of those priorities identified by Arctic stakeholder communities (scientists, Arctic Peoples, planners, policy makers, the private sector, and others).",

We present the PAGA velocities, realized in a South America fixed reference frame, in the context of the regional crustal velocity field derived from established cGPS networks in the region. We rotate a subset of seven of the velocities, which form a thrust-perpendicular transect, into a thrust front perpendicular/parallel coordinate system to investigate the magnitude and distribution of interseismic strain accumulation. From this subset, we document ~8 mm/yr of thrust-perpendicular shortening accommodated over ~400 km. Additionally, we utilize published regional balanced cross sections and geologically determined frontal thrust slip rates to constrain an elastic edge-dislocation model for the décollement and quantify the degree misfit between the model and the observed crustal velocity field. Finally, we explore penetrative deformation within the wedge, rigid block rotation and ramp-flat detachment geometry as potential sources of motion to reduce the discrepancy between observed and model predicted shortening rates.",

            "abstract": "Shield deserts have developed on ancient crystalline bedrocks and mainly composed of folded and faulted rocks hardened by heat and pressure over millions of years. They were unearthed by erosion and form steep-sided hills and basins filled with sediments. The Sahara, Arabian, southern African, central Kavir and Australian deserts are in this group. Their ranges usually supply groundwater resources or in some regions contain huge oil reservoirs. Geomorphological segmentation of shield deserts is one of the fundamental tools in their land use or site investigation planning as well as in their surface water and groundwater management. In many studies the morphology of shield deserts has been investigated by limited qualitative and subjective methods using limited number of simple parameters such as surface elevation and slope. However the importance of these regions supports the need for their accurate and quantitative morphologic classification. The present study attempts to implement a quantitative method, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), for geomorphological classification of a typical shield desert within Kavir Desert, Iran. The area is tectonically stable and characterized by flat clay pans, playas, well-developed pediments around scattered and low elevation ranges. Twenty-two multi-scale morphometric parameters were derived from the first- to third-orders partial derivatives of the surface elevation. Seven optimized parameters with their proper scales were selected by Artificial Neural Networks, Optimum Index Factor, Davies-Bouldin Index and statistic models. Finally, the area was segmented to seven homogeneous areas by SOM algorithm. The results revealed the most distinguishing parameter set (MDPS) for morphologic segmentation of shield deserts. The same segmentation results through using MDPS for another shield deserts in Australia proves the applicability of MDPS for shield deserts segmentation.",

            "abstract": "Communities across the world are experiencing the effects of unsustainable water management practices. Whether the problem is a lack of water, too much water, or water of degraded quality, finding acceptable solutions requires community-level efforts that integrate sound science with local needs and values. Our project develops both a software technology (agent-based hydrological modeling) and a social technology (a participatory approach to model development) that will allow communities to comprehensively address local water challenges. Using agent-based modeling (ABM), we are building a modeling system that includes a semi-distributed hydrologic process model coupled with agent (stakeholder) models. Information from the hydrologic model is conveyed to the agent models, which, along with economic information, determine appropriate agent actions that subsequently affect hydrology within the model. The iterative participatory modeling (IPM) process will assist with the continual development of the agent models. Further, IPM creates a learning environment in which all participants, including researchers, are co-exploring relevant data, possible scenarios and solutions, and viewpoints through continuous interactions. Our initial work focuses on the impact of flood mitigation and conservation efforts on reducing flooding in an urban area. We are applying all research elements above to the Squaw Creek watershed that flows through parts of four counties in central Iowa. The watershed offers many of the typical tensions encountered in Iowa, such as different perspectives on water management between upstream farmers and downstream urban areas, competition for various types of recreational services, and increasing absentee land ownership that may conflict with community values. Ultimately, climate change scenarios will be incorporated into the model to determine long term patterns that may develop within the social or natural system.",

This is especially true in North Dakota, where climate change can have significant consequences on agriculture, its traditionally strongest economic sector. This region of the country shows a high variability in precipitation, especially in the summer months and so the focus of this study is on warm season processes over decadal time scales. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used to dynamically downscale two Global Circulation Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 ensemble in order to determine the microphysical parameterization and nudging techniques (spectral or analysis) best suited for this region. The downscaled domain includes the entirety of North Dakota at a horizontal resolution of 5 km. In addition, smaller domains of 1 km horizontal resolution are centered over regions of focused hydrological importance. The dynamically downscaled simulations are compared with both gridded observational data and statistically downscaled data to evaluate the performance of the simulations. \nPreliminary results have shown a marked difference between the two downscaled GCMs in terms of temperature and precipitation bias. Choice of microphysical parameterization has not shown to create any significant differences in the temperature fields. However, the precipitation fields do appear to be most affected by the microphysical parameterization, regardless of the choice of GCM. Implications on the unique water resource challenges faced in this region will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has long been suggested that fractures that are critically oriented with respect to the in situ stress field are the most likely to be hydraulically conductive. This observation is revisited from the point of view of chemically mediated compaction processes, using numerical multi-physics, multi-scale simulations. Fracture contact is computed explicitly for discrete fracture networks, to find local displacements and contact tractions, which govern the initial permeability of the fractures. Subsequent flow simulations compute the full permeability tensor of the network. Local normal tractions then inform a series of transient reactive-transport, elastic-contact simulations at the grain scale that model the compaction of the fracture void space due to pressure-solution and free-face precipitation, assuming the pore-fluid in equilibrium concentration. The ensuing change of fracture transmissivity feeds back to the discrete fracture network model, wherein changes in the permeability tensor are evaluated. The eigenvectors of the initial permeability tensor reflect the higher permeability of fractures having shear/normal stress ratios near 0.6, which are characterized by relatively high permeability due to their combination of shear displacement and normal compression. The resulting preferred flow direction of the network becomes more pronounced over time as fractures that are subject to larger normal stresses experience stronger compaction, for two reasons. Firstly, larger normal traction over the surfaces provides a stronger drive for pressure solution at the contacting asperities. Secondly, these fractures are subject to smaller shear displacement. Their void space has less pronounced channels and is more sensitive to hydraulic sealing due to contact-zone percolation during the compaction process. It is concluded that mechanically-chemically mediated closure processes contribute to critically stressed fractures being likely hydraulic conduits.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, occult precipitation has been difficult to measure, especially given that it can take two predominant forms: fogs and dews. Recent studies have shown that estimates of fog deposition can be made using constructed fog collectors of various styles. Leaf-wetness sensors have also been deployed to try and estimate the relative wetness of leaves during fog events, but coastal systems can integrate both fog deposition and dew condensation, which cannot be differentiated with such sensors alone.\nWe measured fog interception with Decagon Leaf Wetness Sensors (LWSs) outfitted with a 1m2 mesh passive fog collector in areas adjacent to the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) sites in the Pajaro Valley. The LWSs that were deployed were covered with a partial shield or left uncovered. Covering the LWS creates a microclimate that allows discrimination between fog events that horizontally advect droplets that impact individual leaves, and dew events, which condense once dew point temperature is reached. By measuring fog with a standard measurement device (mesh fog collector), and comparing it to LWSs that have either fog exposure or fog exclusion (covered LWSs), we can partition the relative contribution of dew to overall occult precipitation. This would be the first study quantifying the amount of water inputs (horizontally advecting fog) to the amount of recycled water (dew) to gain a greater understanding of the role of occult precipitation in catchment water balances across coastal California.",

            "abstract": "It has long been known that generally the warmer the sea surface temperature (SST), the more possible tropical cyclone (TC) genesis is, assuming the atmosphere is supportive. The conventional wisdom has been that – apart from what the TC cools through upwelling -- one value of SST represents the state of the ocean surface in the region of the storm's inner circulation. With the advent of the satellite era and fine resolution SST datasets now becoming available, we know that in reality there are gradients of SST across which developing TCs move. The influence of those gradients on tropical convection and TCs is largely unknown at this time.\nPrevious studies have shown that SST gradients can significantly impact the overlying ocean surface winds leading to areas of enhanced convergence/divergence and Vorticity (Chelton et al. 2004; O'Neill et al. 2005, 2010). The magnitude of this effect approximately increases as the surface wind increases. Work by Minobe et al. (2008) concluded that a sharp SST Gradient, over the Gulf Stream for instance, could produce enough surface wind convergence to maintain a band of precipitation along the ocean front. The authors seek to understand whether the conclusions made in previous works can be applied in the case of a TC.\nTo address this, the effects of an idealized sea surface temperature (SST) gradient on a simulated TC are investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 2km grid spacing. An idealized analytic vortex with no accompanying background wind is used to simulate the TC in one run with a horizontal north-south SST gradient and in a second run with the SST gradient flipped south-north. A third model run with constant 28oC SST everywhere is also conducted. Model runs with the SST gradient show asymmetries in convection and structure develop quickly before and after the cyclone develops. In these runs the cyclone drifts one direction depending on the location of colder SST. This is consistent with a thermal wind which forms due to the SST gradient. The SST gradient runs develop the storm faster and with higher peak intensity than in the constant SST run.",

            "abstract": "Our recent time-dependent MHD study suggests that the Mars crustal magnetic field acts as the primary internal driving force of variability in total planetary ion escape. In our global numerical simulation, we assume quiet solar wind conditions and consider the continuous local time change of crustal anomalies due to planetary rotation. Significant fluctuations of ~20% and ~50% are obtained during the entire rotation period for O+ and for O2+ and CO2+, respectively. From the MHD perspective, the control is exerted mainly through two processes. First, the crustal magnetic pressure over the subsolar regime controls solar wind penetration and mass loading and therefore the escaping planetary ion source. There is a strong negative correlation between the dayside magnetic pressure and ion loss with a significant time lag. Second, the crustal magnetic pressure near the terminator region controls the cross section area between the induced magnetospheric boundary and 100 km altitude at the terminator. The change in day-night connection regulates the extent to which planetary ions created in the dayside can be ultimately carried away by the solar wind and escape Mars. There is a strong positive correlation between the terminator crustal pressure and ion loss, with a shorter time lag. As the planet rotates, the dayside process and the terminator process work together to control the total amounts of escaping planetary ions. In the present work, we aim to test this theory by analyzing planetary ion escape observed by the SupraThermal and Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC) instrument onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. The upstream solar wind plasma observation by the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) and IMF observation by Magnetometer (MAG) are used to provide an estimate of the external driving force of the Mars-solar wind interaction. We will examine the relationship between the MAVEN observed escaping planetary ion flux and Mars orientation to the Sun, and compare our finding with what we learn from the MHD model.",

            "abstract": "Severe, prolonged droughts are predicted to occur more frequently due to global climate change. We used a combination of satellite imagery and eddy covariance data to evaluate a numerical model of drought impacts on the productivity (plant growth) of grasslands in the U.S. Great Plains. We compared simulations using the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB4) to observations during a period that included extreme drought in various temperate grassland sites in the U.S. Great Plains from 2010-2012. Changes in phenology (seasonal greening and browning) were evaluated over this three-year time period at various grassland sites by comparing simulated leaf area index (LAI) from SiB4 to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon, gross primary production (GPP), latent heat flux (LH) and sensible heat flux (H) values from SiB4 and flux tower sites were then analyzed over the same three-year time period. These selected variables were chosen to aid in the evaluation of the onset and duration of drought in the model compared to observations. Observed west-to-east gradients in grassland productivity were generally well-captured by the model. Growing season onset tends to be too late in the model relative to observations and peak LAI tends to last too long in the autumn. Changes in seasonal plant allocation mitigated some of these problems. Response to drought, indicated in the observations by reduced LAI and GPP and elevated Bowen ratio, was also simulated by the model. In several cases, simulated drought responses were weaker than observed. We explore reasons for this discrepancy.",

At the local level, the choice of building materials and urban geometry are vital in determining the UHI magnitude of a city. At the city scale, economic growth, population, climate, and land use dynamics are the main drivers behind changes in UHIs. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive assessment of UHI based on these “macro variables” at regional and global scale. We based our analysis on published research for Europe, North America, and Asia, reporting data for 83 cities across the globe with unique climatic, economic, and environmental conditions. Exploratory data analysis including Pearson correlation was performed to explore the relationship between UHI and PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤5 microns), PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 microns), vegetation per capita, built area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population density and population. Additionally, dummy variables were used to capture potential influences of climate types (based on Koppen classifications) and the ways by which UHI was measured. We developed three linear regression models, one for each of the three continents (Asia, Europe, and North America) and one model for all the cities across these continents. This study provides a unique perspective for predicting UHI magnitudes at large scales based on economic activity and pollution levels of a city, which has important implications in urban planning.",

            "abstract": "Confined ice shelves restrain flow of non-floating ice, allowing ice sheets to grow larger than they otherwise would. Ice shelves lead a precarious existence, subject to fragmentation if sufficient meltwater fills crevasses, and very sensitive to even slight warming of water beneath. Ice shelves tend to exist in the coldest waters in the world ocean, often overlying warmer, more-saline waters. Changes in water temperature or circulation generally shrink existing ice shelves and raise sea level by unbuttressing the non-floating ice, and this is likely the most important control on marine-ending parts of land ice, exceeding the influence of sea-level or accumulation-rate changes. Advance of an ice-shelf grounding line into warmer, deeper water will increase melting rates, reduce buttressing, and tend to stabilize the grounding line near or above the upper limit of that warmer water. This physical understanding indicates that the oceanographic state, and its interaction with tributary ice streams, must have been central in the extent of Arctic ice shelves once sufficient cooling occurred to allow extensive advance of land ice into the ocean.",

            "abstract": "After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, an effort was organized to reassure potential settlers that the city was safe from future earthquake damages. The effort was quite small compared to, say, opposition to evolution and the great antiquity of the Earth, and there did not exist a modern body of seismological risk analyses for the San Francisco boosters to reject. Nonetheless, some groups organized a response that did not immediately seek to use and advance the best science of the day; the risk assessments and earthquake engineering that underpin the modern city came later, and with much vigorous discussion. As Geoscientists, our job description is to go to great places with wonderful people, learn what no one knows about the Earth and our interactions with it, and use that knowledge to help society. But, advancing the greater good often has short-term costs for some people, and as in 1906 San Francisco, this has led to a long history of rejection of parts of our science, often by people who ultimately would benefit from using that science, as San Francisco now benefits. Thus, as we Geoscientists push the frontiers of knowledge, it is increasingly important for us to pay attention to lighting the path for people to follow in using that knowledge for good. Weather forecasters have long known that it is not enough to tell people that a hurricane or tornado is coming; once good information is available, it must be supplied in a way that is credible and promotes optimal responses. Recent successes show that this can be done well. On some issues, however, Geoscientists have been much less successful, so there is room for new approaches from new as well as old faces in making our science more broadly useful.",

            "abstract": "Top melting of ice-wedges and subsequent ground subsidence is now a widespread phenomenon across the Arctic domain. We show field and remote sensing observations that document extensive ice-wedge degradation, which initially has resulted in increased wetness contrast across the landscape (i.e. both a drying and a wetting), a shift in pond type and an overall drying in later stages. The differential ground subsidence at cold continuous permafrost regions appear to be linked to press and pulse climate forcing. Here, the process of crossing the local threshold for ice-wedge stability may be favored by a press occurrence such as long-term, gradual increases in summer air temperature, mean annual air temperature and/or possibly winter precipitation, but our observations suggest it is most likely initiated by pulse atmospheric forcing such as extreme summer warmth and/or winter precipitation. Field measurements of water levels, frost tables and snow accumulation across the main ice-wedge polygon types and their respective features support dramatic shifts in the hydrologic regime with altered topography and a complexity that ultimately affect the larger-scale hydrologic system. For example, our numerical model experiments show that a connected trough-network reduces inundation and increases runoff and that changing patterns of snow distribution due to the differential ground subsidence play a crucial role in altering lowland tundra water balance. These fine-scale (10’s cm) geomorphic changes are expected to further expand and amplify in rapidly warming permafrost regions and likely will dramatically modify land-atmosphere and land-ocean fluxes and exchange of carbon, water, and energy.",

            "abstract": "Theory and past observations have provided evidence that atmospheric tides and other global scale waves may nonlinearly interact to produce additional secondary waves throughout the space-atmosphere interaction region. However, very few studies have investigated the generation region of nonlinearly secondary waves, and as a result, the manifestations and impacts of these waves are still poorly understood. This study focuses on the nonlinear interaction between the quasi two-day wave (QTDW) and the migrating diurnal tide (DW1), two of the largest global scale waves in the atmosphere. The fundamental goal of this effort is to characterize the forcing region of the secondary waves and understand how it relates to their manifestation on a global scale. First, techniques are applied to Aura-MLS and TIMED-SABER satellite observations to compute the secondary waves, and their momentum and thermal forcing. These quantities are used to force the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) in order to calculate secondary wave responses. Results using the GSWM show that the secondary waves are significant well into the lower thermosphere-ionosphere system, and thus are likely to produce significant dynamo electric fields. Additionally, numerical experiments with the GSWM are conducted to further elucidate the relationship between the forcing and response of the secondary waves arising from QTDW-DW1 interaction.",

As a result, the current generation of land surface models may not adequately describe the turbulent exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and the surface over vineyards. Using data collected during 2014 as a part of the Grape Remote Sensing Atmospheric Profiling and Evapotranspiration Experiment (GRAPEX), an ongoing multi-agency field campaign conducted in the Central Valley of California, this study sought to characterize the variations in the turbulent structure over vineyards. Focusing on unstable daytime conditions, the study compared the turbulent structure at three above-canopy heights: 2.5 m, 3.75 m, and 8 m, agl. Both wavelet and Fourier-based spectral analysis of the wind velocity components indicates a strong tendency for the spectral peak to broaden and shift to lower frequencies as the measurement height increases. Also, beginning with the highest-frequency eddies, the turbulent structure at differing heights become increasingly decoupled as the distance between the measurements increases. In other terms, eddies contributing to a measurement at one height act independently of similarly-sized eddies at another height. As a result, the overall correlation between the turbulent flows measured at differing heights decreases exponential with increasing separation distance. While this effect was seen for all of the periods analyzed, the magnitude of the effect does appear to vary in response to the direction of the wind relative to the vineyard rows.",

This volcano is very similar to the Italian Stromboli Volcano in both eruptive style and edifice morphology. The field experiment aimed at investigating degassing and explosive dynamics using a combination of GPS synchronized devices deployed in direct view of the active vent: i) a high-speed visible camera acquiring images at 500 frames per second (fps),ii) a thermal infrared (FLIR) camera acquiring at 50-200 fps, iii) a visible time lapse camera (GO-PRO) acquiring at 0.2-0.5 Hz (2 - 5 s interval), iv) two broadband microphones (Freq. range of kHz to 0.1 Hz) sampled at 10 kHz. Explosions can be discriminated in type according to their visual, thermal and acoustic features.Some explosions are characterized by a first sudden radial ejection of large spatter and bombs (main pulse), eventually followed by other similar events (secondary pulses), with very little amount of ash involved. In these eruptions, infrasonic waveforms are characterized by a first, high amplitude transient, with a first positive peak pressure followed by rapid dampening, typical of a Strombolian eruption.Other explosions are characterized by the sustained ejection of a dense jet of ash, with abundant decimeter to meter sized spatter and hot blocks.These eruptions are not accompanied by a maximum peak pressure at the eruption onset. Spectrograms show a high frequency component propagating for the entire duration of the signal.These two distinct types are sometimes overlapping and eruptions show a high amplitude transient followed by a high frequency coda.

DOE has recently invested in improvements to facilities and infrastructure to support operations of unmanned aerial systems for science missions in the Arctic and North Slope of Alaska. A new ground facility, the Third ARM Mobile Facility, was installed at Oliktok Point Alaska in 2013. Tethered instrumented balloons were used to make measurements of clouds in the boundary layer including mixed-phase clouds.\nA new Special Use Airspace was granted to DOE in 2015 to support science missions in international airspace in the Arctic. Warning Area W-220 is managed by Sandia National Laboratories for DOE Office of Science/BER. W-220 was successfully used for the first time in July 2015 in conjunction with Restricted Area R-2204 and a connecting Altitude Reservation Corridor (ALTRV) to permit unmanned aircraft to operate north of Oliktok Point.\nSmall unmanned aircraft (DataHawks) and tethered balloons were flown at Oliktok during the summer and fall of 2015.\nThis poster will discuss how principal investigators may apply for use of these Special Use Airspaces, acquire data from the Third ARM Mobile Facility, or bring their own instrumentation for deployment at Oliktok Point, Alaska.\nThe printed poster will include the standard DOE funding statement.",

Consistent with earlier results from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM, Liu and Zipser 2005), deep convection frequently overshoots tropopause over tropical land, especially over Argentina, Panama, Central Africa and Congo basin. At the mid and high latitudes, the GPM has observed numerous convective storms reaching tropopause over northern hemisphere land, especially those over central North America. The mean overshooting area is generally larger in the storms at mid and high latitudes than those in tropics. The zonal distribution of convection at tropopause shows two main peaks, one at tropics and another at northern mid and high latitudes.

Some dramatic effects of these halogen species are known (e.g. ozone depletion, mercury deposition), but changes in atmospheric composition related to this halogen chemistry, particularly those related to increasing sea ice loss and the transformation of Arctic sea ice cover, are unknown. In March 2012, the Bromine, Ozone, Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) provided an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of halogen chemistry in the vicinity of Barrow, Alaska. During BROMEX, we used Multiple Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to measure BrO lower tropospheric vertical column densities (LT-VCD) and near-surface mixing ratios at Barrow, as well as on land-fast ice 40 km north east of Barrow, and a drifting platform on seasonal sea ice west of Barrow. Concurrently, an aircraft equipped with the Heidelberg Airborne Imaging DOAS Instrument (HAIDI) collected airborne BrO data at altitudes up to 3 km. These measurements showed several instances of spatial gradients in BrO between measurement sites, as well as times when BrO was present up to 1km aloft. We explore explanations for these features using local and synoptic meteorology, back-trajectory modelling, MODIS and airborne imagery, as well as satellite-instrument-based maps of synoptic sea ice classes and tropospheric BrO.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the evolution of the internal dynamics of magmatic plumbing systems and identifying the key parameters that drive the dynamics are major goals of volcanology. We present a novel petrological approach that combines kinetic modelling of the diffusive relaxation of chemical zoning patterns in olivine crystals with thermodynamic modelling (MELTS) to constrain the thermodynamic parameters (e.g. P, T, water content, oxygen fugacity and bulk composition of melt) of magma storage beneath Mt. Etna between 1991 and 2008. For this purpose we have studied the compositional zoning patterns in 180 olivine crystals, and the mineral chemistry of associated clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides. The minerals span a wide compositional range and show a large variability (e.g. a single thin section can contain olivines showing four different compositional ranges and zoning patterns). The olivine zoning data has been organized using the tool of Systems analysis to identify five different magmatic environments (MEs) characterized by different core- and rim-plateau olivine compositions: M0 (=Fo79-83), M1 (=Fo75-78), M2 (=Fo70-72), M3 (=Fo65-69) and mm1 (=Fo73-75). We developed a forward modeling approach using thermodynamic calculations with the MELTS software aiming to identify the key intensive variables associated with the different magmatic environments. In this approach the observed populations of mineral compositions (e.g. Fo79-83), rather than individual compositions, are associated with thermodynamic parameters (P, T, H2O, fO2 and bulk composition of melt) to identify the most plausible set corresponding to each ME. We found that temperature, water content, and oxidation state, are the main distinguishing features of the different MEs. Combined with kinetic modelling the duration of residence and the time of magma transfer between these MEs can be determined. The method is applicable to active as well as temporarily remote (dormant) volcanoes and its application allows identification of different points of residence of magma along certain pathways in a plumbing system as well as the quantification of their environmental (e.g. water content, oxidation state) and temporal (duration and timing of recharge of different MEs) parameters to reconstruct the dynamics of the plumbing system.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate cements in accretionary prims record the fluid history of the subduction system during deformation, and may provide a record of faulting and related fluid flow. Site C0002 is the deepest hole ever drilled for scientific exploration at a depth of 3056 meters below sea floor as part of the IODP NanTroSEIZE project. Interstitial fluids were not successfully collected in the deep prism, but carbonates serve as proxy for fluid chemistry. Stable isotope analysis was used to determine if carbonates in the Nankai accretionary prism formed from 1) locally derived fluids, or 2) fluids migrated from depth and are related to deeper consolidation and deformation in the subduction zone. Carbonates are dominantly calcite and occur both as pore-filling cements and veins; the latter commonly exhibit slickenlines or slickenfibers. δ18O values range from 0.34 to -11.81 ‰ PDB; δ13C values range from -0.82 to -11.74 ‰ PDB. Carbonate cements typically have higher δ18O values (mean = -5.50 ‰ PDB), whereas veins have more 18O-depleted values (mean = -9.29 ‰ PDB). δ18O values of the isotopically most 18O-depleted veins show a trend of decreasing δ18O values with depth. The isotopic data can be explained if the cements formed earlier (or shallower) than veined samples, which appear to record a different fluid source. The lowest δ18O value in carbonate occurs just below the cored fault interval suggesting a conduit for deeper, warmer fluids is possible. Oxygen isotope paleothermometry results from carbonate isotopes parallel temperature extrapolations from thermal gradients calculated in geophysical studies, but the carbonate results are consistent with a gradient roughly 20°C cooler. Alternatively, fluids present during vein formation might have been 18O-enriched. Temperature is a key parameter controlling seismogenic behavior and will be further evaluated in this study with carbonate clumped isotope analysis, which will provide temperature control and initial δ18O values for interstitial waters.",

A RSL reconstruction from this region is needed to fill a spatial gap in sea-level records which can be used to support coastal management, contribute geologic data for Earth-Ice models estimating late Holocene land-level change and serve as the basis for which future projections of sea-level rise must be superimposed. Further, this dataset is crucial to understanding the presence/absence and non-synchronous timing of small sea-level oscillations (e.g. rise at ~ 1000 A.D.; fall at ~ 1400 A.D.) during the past 2000 years on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States that may be linked to climate anomalies. We present the results of a high-resolution RSL reconstruction based on the sediment record of two salt marshes on the eastern margin of the Gulf of Mexico. Two ~1.3m cores primarily composed of Juncus roemeranius peat reveal RSL changes over the past ~2000 years in the southern end of Tampa Bay and in Charlotte Harbor, Florida. Two study sites were used to isolate localized factors affecting RSL at either location.\nLithostratigraphic analysis at both sites identifies a transition from sandy-silt layers into salt-marsh peat at the bottom of each core. The two records show continuous accumulation of salt-marsh peat with Juncus roemeranius macrofossils and intermittent sand horizons likely reflecting inundation events. We used vertically zoned assemblages of modern foraminifera to assign the indicative meaning. The high marsh is dominated by Ammoastuta inepta, Haplophragmoides wilberti, and Arenoparella mexicana, with low marsh and tidal flats identified by Ammobaculites spp. and Miliammina fusca. Chronologies for these study sites were established using AMS radiocarbon dating of in-situ plant macrofossils, Cs137, Pb210 and pollen and pollution chronohorizons. Our regional RSL curve will add additional data for constraining the mechanisms causing RSL change.",

            "abstract": "During the winter of 2014 snow samples were collected from Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park (elevation 2600 m) for the determination of the organic constituents. Samples were collected from the middle of the snowpack during January - April (referred to as \"snowpack\" samples), from three depths in a cross-sectional pit dug in mid April (\"snow pit\" samples) and from fresh snow collected during two snowstorms (\"snowstorm\" samples). Samples were frozen immediately after collection in sealed glass containers and thawed just prior to analysis. The DOC concentration of snowpack samples varied from 0.9 - 1.7 mg C/L; the DOC of snowstorm samples had much lower values (0.3 - 0.4 mg C/L). DOC concentrations of snow taken from the top third of the snow pit in mid-April was much higher (6.6 mg C/L), but this sample had large amounts of \"debris\"; the snow samples from the middle and bottom of the snow pit had concentrations similar to the snowpack samples.\nSnows were fractionated into hydrophobic, transphilic and hydrophilic acid fractions (HPOA, TPIA and HPIA, respectively); HPOA comprised between 30 and 44% of the total, TPIA ranged from 8-16% and HPIA ranged from 19-28%. Samples collected from the snow pit at the end of the winter always had lower percentages of TPIA and HPIA than those taken from the snowpack during the winter. All snow samples were also analyzed for low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) via ion chromatography, and all samples contained trace amounts of formate, acetate and oxalate, with acetate generally being predominant. A few of the samples showed evidence of trace amounts of propionate and butyrate, but no other organic acids could be positively identified. If it is assumed that the LMWOA fraction consisted of the three anions above (acetate, formate and oxalate), then the percentage of the HPIA which was LMWOA ranged from 5-15% with uniformly higher percentages occurring in the snowpack samples than in the snow pit samples taken at the end of the winter.\nUnderstanding the composition and differences in the organic makeup of snow has implications ranging from atmospheric flow paths and sources of pollution through biologically-derived transformation reactions in the post-depositional hydrologic cycle to chemical weathering rates and geochemical reactions. Future work will focus on these aspects.",

            "abstract": "Changes in extreme weather may produce some of the largest societal impacts from anthropogenic climate change: present-day weather damages are dominated by rare events that happen only every several decades or more. However, it is intrinsically difficult to estimate changes in those rare events from the short observational record. We therefore look for insight to climate models, where we can generate long simulations. In this work we use millennial runs from the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) in equilibrated pre-industrial and future (700 and 1400 ppm CO2) conditions. We examine both how extremes change using 1000-year timeseries, and how well these changes can be estimated based on shorter pieces of these runs. We estimate changes to distributions of future annual temperature extremes (wintertime minima and summertime maxima) in the contiguous United States by fitting generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions using the block maxima approach. Our results show that the magnitude of summer warm extremes largely shifts in accordance with mean shifts in summertime temperatures, and their distribution does not otherwise change significantly. In contrast, winter cold extremes warm more than mean shifts in wintertime temperatures, with changes in spread and skewness at inland locations that lead to substantial changes in tail behavior. We then examine uncertainties that result from using shorter model runs. In principle, GEV modeling allows us to predict infrequent events using timeseries shorter than the recurrence frequency of those events. To investigate how well this approach works in practice, we estimate 20-, 50-, and 100-year extreme events, first in the full 1000-year model timeseries and then using segments of 20 and 50 years. We find that even with GEV modeling, timeseries that are of comparable length or shorter than the return period of interest can lead to very poor estimates. These results suggest caution when attempting to use short observational timeseries/model runs to infer infrequent extremes. For evaluating changes in extremes, future model intercomparison exercises may need to include longer runs or more extensive ensembles.",

            "abstract": "The Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) is a critical hydrogeologic feature in southern Ontario. Although previous research has highlighted the implications of spatially-focused recharge in closed topographic depressions for regional groundwater resources, such depression-focused recharge (DFR) has not been empirically demonstrated on the ORM. Permeable surficial sands and gravels mantling much of the ORM imply that water fluxes will largely be vertical recharge rather than lateral downslope transfer into depressions. Nevertheless, lateral fluxes may occur in winter and spring, when concrete frost development encourages surface runoff of rainfall and snowmelt. The potential for DFR was examined under forest and agricultural land cover with similar soils and surficial geology. Soil water contents, soil temperatures and ground frost thickness were measured at the crest and base of closed depressions in two agricultural fields and two forest stands on permeable ORM outcrops. Recharge from late-fall to the end of spring snowmelt was estimated via 1-d water balances and surface-applied bromide tracing. Both forest and agricultural sites experienced soil freezing; however, greater soil water contents prior to freeze-up at the latter led to concrete soil frost development. This resulted in lateral movement of snowmelt and rainfall into topographic depressions and surface ponding, which did not occur in forest depressions. Water balance recharge exceeded estimates from the bromide tracer approach at all locations; nevertheless, both methods indicated DRF exceeded recharge at the depression crest in agricultural areas with little difference in forest areas. Water balance estimates suggest winter-spring DFR (1300 – 2000 mm) is 3-5× recharge on level agricultural sites. Differences in the potential for DFR between agricultural and forest land covers have important implications for the spatial variability of recharge fluxes and the quality of recharging water on the ORM.",

            "abstract": "Feldspar is a common igneous mineral that can shed light on parent magma temperatures, pressures, and compositions. During the first 801 sols of the NASA Mars Science Laboratory mission, we have detected 125 possible feldspar grains using the ChemCam LIBS instrument. We analyzed spectra from successive laser shots at the same location and approximate whole rock compositions for each target. Feldspar-containing targets range from tephrite-basanite to trachyandesite. The most common feldspar type is andesine; no targets are >An60. Over 30% are anorthoclase, and ~10% have potassium contents up to Or60. Individual shot measurements in a single spot suggest some feldspars are zoned. Most of these rocks are either float or incorporated into conglomerates, and thus we do not know their provenance. Many of the samples may originate from the Gale crater walls, indicative of Southern Highland ancient crust. Some may also be flung from further away (e.g., emplaced by impact processes). Hence, these rocks may give us a general clue to the variety of evolved igneous materials on Mars. The ubiquity of feldspars at Gale suggests that they have been significantly underestimated for the Southern Highlands, if not for the whole of Mars. For example, significant abundance of andesitic feldspars in both the southern highland and northern lowlands of Mars would imply that Martian volcanism has produced a greater extent of evolved igneous materials to a greater degree than previously thought. Remote sensing instruments are insensitive to plagioclase due to dust cover, lack of exposures, or low feldspar FeO content. However, the Mars 2020 rover will be equipped with 3 new instruments, the arm-mounted SHERLOC Raman, PIXL µXRF, and the mast-mounted SuperCam combined Raman-LIBS instruments, which should help characterize Martian feldspars. Additionally, the SuperCam instrument plans to include three feldspars in its suite of 20+ onboard standards to improve feldspar chemical analysis.",

Analysis yielded quantitative observations of hydrometeor size and charge data in selected regions of storms with relatively low concentrations of charged particles. In most regions hydrometeor concentrations were so high that there were multiple charged particles in the probe sample volume at the same time and quantitative charge analysis was not possible. While it is impossible to reliably determine individual particle charges in these high concentration regions, we can use Poisson statistics to estimate the total number concentration of charged particles based on the fraction of records with just one particle in them. We compare these number concentrations for different thunderstorm regions, including updrafts, flanking cells, core precipitation regions, and trailing stratiform regions, at approximately the -10 C level, in several thunderstorms. We will discuss the implications of these results for understanding charge-separation processes in thunderstorms.",

            "abstract": "Magmas fragment forming a transiently granular material, which can weld back to a fluid-continuum. This process results in dramatic changes in the gas-volume fraction of the material, which impacts the gas permeability. We collate published data for the gas-volume fraction and permeability of volcanic and synthetic materials which have undergone this process to different amounts and note that in all cases there exists a discontinuity in the relationship between these two properties. By discriminating data for which good microstructural information are provided, we use simple scaling arguments to collapse the data in both the still-granular, high gas-volume fraction regime and the fluid-continuum low gas-volume fraction regime such that a universal description can be achieved. We use this to argue for the microstructural meaning of the well-described discontinuity between gas-permeability and gas-volume fraction and to infer the controls on the position of this transition between dominantly granular and dominantly fluid-continuum material descriptions. As a specific application, we consider the transiently granular magma transported through and deposited in fractures in more-coherent magmas, thought to be a primary degassing pathway in high viscosity systems. We propose that our scaling coupled with constitutive laws for densification can provide insights into the longevity of such degassing channels, informing sub-surface pressure modelling at such volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Plant functional types in land surface models (LSMs) are broadly defined, and often represent species with different physiologies within the same category. For example, trees of opposing hydraulic strategies and traits are commonly grouped together, as is the case of red oak and red maple. As a result, LSMs generate typical patterns of errors in predictions of transpiration and production. We studied sap flux, stem water storage, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, rooting depth, and bole growth of these species at disturbed and undisturbed field sites in Michigan. Species-specific differences significantly impact temporal patterns of stomatal conductance and overall transpiration responses to both drought and disturbance. During drought, maples relied heavily on stem-stored water, while oaks did not. After disturbance, oaks increased stomatal conductance while maple conductance declined. Isotopic analysis of xylem water revealed that oak roots can access a deep groundwater source, which maple roots cannot. This deep rooting strategy permits transpiration and growth to continue in oaks during periods of water limitation, even when maples cease transpiration. Using 16 years of bole growth data, we show that maple growth is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation, yet oak growth is not. We propose a framework to incorporate these species-specific differences into LSMs using the Finite-Element Tree-Crown Hydrodynamics model version 2 (FETCH2) that resolves the fast dynamics and diurnal hysteresis of stomatal conductance at the tree level. FETCH2 uses atmospheric and biological forcings from the LSM, simulates water movement through trees as flow through a system of porous media conduits, and calculates realistic hydraulic restrictions to stomatal conductance. This model replaces the current, non-physical link which empirically connects soil moisture to stomatal conductance in LSMs. FETCH2 resolved transpiration is then easily scaled to the plot level using remote sensing data. By incorporating species-specific constraints on water flux into predictions of transpiration, growth, and mortality, we can improve simulations of the surface energy budget and global carbon and water balances.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of irrigation and associated surface water (SW) diversions and groundwater (GW) pumping on instream flows, groundwater recharge and SW-GW interactions are being examined using a watershed-scale coupled SW-GW flow model. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model GSFLOW (Markstrom et al., 2008), an integration of the USGS Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) and the Modular Ground-Water Flow Model (MODFLOW), is being utilized for this effort. Processes represented in this model include daily rain, snowfall, snowmelt, streamflow, surface runoff, interflow, infiltration, soil-zone evapotranspiration, and subsurface unsaturated and groundwater flow and evapotranspiration. The Upper Smith River watershed, an important agricultural and recreational area in west-central Montana, is being used as the basis for watershed climate, topography, hydrography, vegetation, soil properties as well as scenarios of irrigation and associated practices. The 640 square kilometer watershed area has been discretized into coincident 200 m by 200 m hydrologic response units (for climate and soil zone flow processes) and grid blocks (for unsaturated zone and GW flow processes). The subsurface GW system is discretized into 6 layers representing Quaternary alluvium, Tertiary sediments and bedrock. The model is being used to recreate natural, pre-development streamflows and GW conditions in the watershed. The results of this simulation are then compared to a simulation with flood and sprinkler irrigation supplied by SW diversion and GW pumping to examine the magnitude and timing of changes in streamflow, groundwater recharge and SW-GW interactions. Model results reproduce observed hydrologic responses to both natural climate variability and irrigation practices. Periodic irrigation creates increased evapotranspiration and GW recharge in cultivated areas of the watershed as well as SW-GW interactions that are more dynamic than under natural conditions.",

            "abstract": "We report on the results of the NanoRocks experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), which simulates collisions that occur in protoplanetary disks and planetary ring systems. A critical stage of the process of early planet formation is the growth of solid bodies from mm-sized chondrules and aggregates to km-sized planetesimals. To characterize the collision behavior of dust in protoplanetary conditions, experimental data is required, working hand in hand with models and numerical simulations. In addition, the collisional evolution of planetary rings takes place in the same collisional regime.\nThe objective of the NanoRocks experiment is to study low-energy collisions of mm-sized particles of different shapes and materials. An aluminum tray (~8x8x2cm) divided into eight sample cells holding different types of particles gets shaken every 60 s providing particles with initial velocities of a few cm/s.\nIn September 2014, NanoRocks reached ISS and 220 video files, each covering one shaking cycle, have already been downloaded from Station. The data analysis is focused on the dynamical evolution of the multi-particle systems and on the formation of cluster. We track the particles down to mean relative velocities less than 1 mm/s where we observe cluster formation. The mean velocity evolution after each shaking event allows for a determination of the mean coefficient of restitution for each particle set. These values can be used as input into protoplanetary disk and planetary rings simulations. In addition, the cluster analysis allows for a determination of the mean final cluster size and the average particle velocity of clustering onset. The size and shape of these particle clumps is crucial to understand the first stages of planet formation inside protoplanetary disks as well as many a feature of Saturn’s rings. We report on the results from the ensemble of these collision experiments and discuss applications to planetesimal formation and planetary ring evolution.",

Alcohols such as Ethanol and Methanol cause significant changes in the apparent isotope values such that the more these species are present in the water, the more erroneous the IRIS data becomes. Although activated charcoal and pre-combustion methods have typically been used to mitigate this inaccuracy, a new application of Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) using C-18 sorbents shows promising results in eliminating more organics and reducing spectral interferences more than current treatment techniques. SPE’s can be prepared in the field and can quickly treat samples upon collection: this study focuses on developing a consistent method for use both in field and lab to allow isotope hydrology measurements to be unhampered by potential organics. To study the adsorption effect of SPE’s, we used H-NMR technology to calculate absolute concentrations of Ethanol and Methanol in water pre- and post- treatment. SPE removed up to 90% Ethanol and 60% Methanol in water, and the corresponding measured isotopic values after alcohol removal were much closer to the pure water reference.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies indicate to say that the Canadian Artic Archipelago's mass loss has increased in recent years. However the role of ice dynamics changes in this area is not well known. In this study, we present a comprehensive velocity mapping of the CAA using ALOS/PALSAR, RADARSAT-1, ERS1 and Landsat data between 1992 and 2015. Glaciers speed are calculated using a speckle and feature tracking algorithm.The results reveals that three large marine-terminating glaciers have accelerated significantly after 2010, while most others have slowed down or retreated to a sill to become similar to land-terminating glaciers. By combining the velocities of these glaciers with ice thickness measurements from NASA's Operation IceBridge, we calculate their ice discharge. The fluxes of these glaciers increased significantly since 2000 with a marked increase after 2011. The comparison of ice discharge with the surface mass balance from RACMO-2, shows that these glaciers came out of balance after 2011, which is also a time period where their discharge almost doubled. The analysis of RACMO-2 reveals an increase in runoff between 1970's and today and a precipitation with no significant trend. We digitalize the calving front positions of the glaciers and show an increasing rate retreat since 1976. We conclude that global pattern of velocity changes shows that the mass losses due to surface mass balance will likely going to raise in the coming years and that ice discharge will have a smaller part in the contribution of the CAA to sea level rise.",

The model replaces detailed deterministic processes on the fault with a stochastic emergent law. Initial stress on a fault plane is heterogeneous with a power-law spectrum that is self-similar. Rupture stops naturally. Rupture extent and moment are determined primarily by the specified lowest Fourier mode of initial stress. Higher modes are random with a self-similar spectrum that is tied to the amplitude of the lowest mode. Ten random realizations are calculated with a velocity structure for a hard rock site. The calculated mean response spectrum for M7 at a distance of 10 km agrees the with the GMPE of Boore et al (2013) within 0.25 of one standard deviation at periods from 0.3 seconds to 10 seconds. The agreement could be improved by using a more refined relation of the spatial stress spectrum to the amplitude of the lowest mode. The standard deviation of the calculated ground motion is somewhat smaller than the GMPE, but it depends on other rupture parameters and needs more investigation.",

            "abstract": "Forest and woodland ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and may be strongly affected by changing climate. Here we use an individual-based approach to model piñon pine (Pinus edulis) radial growth responses to climate across gradients of environmental stress.\nWe sampled piñon pine trees at 24 sites across southwestern Colorado that varied in soil available water capacity, elevation, and latitude, obtaining a total of 552 pinon pine tree ring series. We used linear mixed effect models to assess piñon pine growth responses to climate and site-level environmental stress (mean annual climatic water deficit and soil available water capacity). Using a similar modeling approach, we also determined long-term growth trends across our gradients of environmental stress.\nPiñon pine growth was strongly positively associated with winter precipitation and strongly negatively associated with summer vapor pressure deficit. However, the strength of the relationship between winter precipitation and piñon pine growth was affected by site-level environmental stress. Trees at sites with greater climatic water deficit (i.e. hotter, drier sites) were more sensitive to winter precipitation. Interestingly, trees at sites with greater soil available water capacity were also more sensitive to winter precipitation, as these trees had much higher growth rates during years of high precipitation.\nWe found weak evidence of long-term declines in piñon growth rates over the past century within our study area. Growth trends overtime did vary across our soil available water capacity gradient: trees growing at sites with higher soil available water capacity responded more positively to the cool, wet climate conditions of the 1910s and 1980s, whereas tree growth rates at sites with lower soil available water capacity declined more linearly over the last century.\nOur findings suggest that the sensitivity of woodland ecosystems to changing climate will vary across the landscape due to differences in edaphic and physiographic factors. These results support recent dendroecology studies that emphasize the need to use a more individual-based approach to enhance our understanding of tree growth responses to climate.",

Furthermore, these electrons were seen deep within the magnetosphere at L~3.3 injected as a result of the shock impact. We present electron measurements from the Relativistic Electron-Proton Telescope (REPT) and the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) onboard the twin Van Allen Probes mission. These high-energy electron observations are complemented by the electric and magnetic field measurements from the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science (EMFISIS) instrument.

            "abstract": "The breakup of strong continental lithosphere requires more than far-field tectonic forces. Growing evidence for early-stage cratonic rift zones points to the importance of heat, magma and volatile transfer in driving lithospheric strength reduction. The relative contributions of these processes are fundamental to our understanding of continental rifting. We present a synthesis of results from geological, geochemical and geophysical studies in one of the most seismically and volcanically active sectors of the East African Rift (Kenya-Tanzania border) to investigate the role of fluids during early-stage rifting (<10 Ma). Xenolith data indicate that rifting initiated in initially thick lithosphere. Diffuse soil CO2 flux maxima occur in the vicinity of faults, with carbon isotope values exhibiting a mantle-derived signature. These faults feed aligned sets of hydrothermal springs, which have N2-He-Ar relative abundances also indicating a mantle-derived source. Geochemical and surface faulting information are integrated with subsurface imaging and fault kinematic data derived from the 38-station CRAFTI broadband seismic array. Teleseismic and abundant local earthquakes enable assessment of the state-of-stress and b-values as a function of depth. High Vp/Vs ratios and tomographic imaging suggest the presence of fluids in the crust, with high pore fluid pressures driving failure at lower tectonic stress. Together, these cross-disciplinary data provide compelling evidence that early-stage rifting in East Africa is assisted by fluids exsolved from deep magma bodies, some of which are imaged in the lower crust. We assert that the flux of deep magmatic fluids during rift initiation plays a key role in weakening lithosphere and localizing strain. High surface gas fluxes, fault-fed hydrothermal springs and persistent seismicity highlight the East African Rift as the ideal natural laboratory for investigating fluid-driven faulting processes in extensional tectonic environments.",

However, manually delineating sea ice features, such as melt ponds, submerged ice, water, ice/snow, and pressure ridges, is time-consuming and labor-intensive. An object-based classification algorithm is developed to automatically extract sea ice features efficiently from aerial photographs taken during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition in summer 2010 (CHINARE 2010) in the MIZ near the Alaska coast. The algorithm includes four steps: (1) the image segmentation groups the neighboring pixels into objects based on the similarity of spectral and textural information; (2) the random forest classifier distinguishes four general classes: water, general submerged ice (GSI, including melt ponds and submerged ice), shadow, and ice/snow; (3) the polygon neighbor analysis separates melt ponds and submerged ice based on spatial relationship; and (4) pressure ridge features are extracted from shadow based on local illumination geometry. The producer’s accuracy of 90.8% and user’s accuracy of 91.8% are achieved for melt pond detection, and shadow shows a user’s accuracy of 88.9% and producer’s accuracies of 91.4%. Finally, pond density, pond fraction, ice floes, mean ice concentration, average ridge height, ridge profile, and ridge frequency are extracted from batch processing of aerial photos, and their uncertainties are estimated.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthesis and respiration on land are the two largest carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface. The parameterization of these processes represent major uncertainties in the terrestrial component of the Earth System Models used to project future climate change. Research has shown that much of this uncertainty is due to the parameterization of the temperature responses of leaf photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration, which are typically based on short-term empirical responses. Here, we show that including longer-term responses to temperature, such as temperature acclimation, can help to reduce this uncertainty and improve model performance, leading to drastic changes in future land-atmosphere carbon feedbacks across multiple models. However, these acclimation formulations have many flaws, including an underrepresentation of many important global flora. In addition, these parameterizations were done using multiple studies that employed differing methodology. As such, we used a consistent methodology to quantify the short- and long-term temperature responses of maximum Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), maximum rate of Ribulos-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration (Jmax), and dark respiration (Rd) in multiple species representing each of the plant functional types used in global-scale land surface models. Short-term temperature responses of each process were measured in individuals acclimated for 7 days at one of 5 temperatures (15-35°C). The comparison of short-term curves in plants acclimated to different temperatures were used to evaluate long-term responses. Our analyses indicated that the instantaneous response of each parameter was highly sensitive to the temperature at which they were acclimated. However, we found that this sensitivity was larger in species whose leaves typically experience a greater range of temperatures over the course of their lifespan. These data indicate that models using previous acclimation formulations are likely incorrectly simulating leaf carbon exchange responses to future warming. Therefore, our data, if used to parameterize large-scale models, are likely to provide an even greater improvement in model performance, resulting in more reliable projections of future carbon-clime feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "The processes that cause strain localization in the lithosphere are fundamental to our understanding of plate tectonics. The relationship between localization and grain size reduction by dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is ubiquitous in natural shear zones, but whether localization by DRX persists to high strains is debated because of the potential role of grain growth. If DRX is associated with surface energy-driven grain boundary migration (γGBM), for example, grains will grow after recrystallization and localization will be cyclical or temporary. At high stress, low temperature conditions, however, migration is theoretically predicted to be driven by strain energy (ρGBM). At these conditions, grain growth may be suppressed even in monophase aggregates, and localization will persist over geologic timescales. Here we examine the conditions at which DRX leads to permanent, as opposed to transient, localization by evaluating the role of grain growth in olivine aggregates. We deformed as-is Balsam Gap dunite in axial compression using a Griggs rig and molten salt cell. We conducted 12 experiments at 1100 and 1200°C, a strain rate of 10-5 s-1, and a confining pressure of 1300 MPa. After samples reached strains of ~30%, we relaxed the stress, either with the motor off or at a strain rate of 10-6 s-1, for specific time increments before quenching. We perform detailed microstructural analyses to identify the transition from ρGBM to γGBM at these experimental conditions. We predict the microstructure (at time t1) will reflect ρGBM, with negligible net grain growth. After strain energy has been substantially reduced (time t1+n), evidence of γGBM will be observed in the microstructure as 120° triple junctions and increased grain sizes. By isolating the conditions at which γGBM becomes more important than ρGBM, we can infer the grainsize-stress conditions under which DRX may promote permanent strain localization in the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Although aerosols are usually found in boundary layer beneath clouds, they can be elevated during long-range transport and rise above low-level clouds. In fact, above-cloud aerosols (ACA) are persistently observed in several regions of the globe during certain time of the year (Devasthale and Thomas, 2011; Winker et al., 2013). For example, marine-boundary layer clouds in SE Atlantic region are persistently covered by light-absorbing smoke aerosols originating from biomass burning acativities in African Savanna during austral winter (July ~ September). ACA is an important and interesting component of the climate system for a number of reasons, above all because its shortwave direct radiative effect (DRE) can differ significantly from that of clear-sky aerosols. The DRE of aerosols at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is strongly dependent on the underlying surface. Over dark surfaces (e.g. ocean surface), the scattering effect of aerosols is generally dominant, leading to negative DRE (i.e., cooling) at TOA. In contrast, when aerosols reside above clouds, their absorption effect can be significantly enhanced by cloud reflection, and offset or even exceed the scattering effect of the aerosol leading to a less negative or even positive (i.e., warming) DRE at TOA.\nIn this study, we used 8 years of CALIOP and MODIS observations to derive the shortwave Direct of ACA over global oceans. We found in regions where ACAs are dominated by light absorbing aerosols (e.g., SE Atlantic and North Pacific), the cloudy-sky DRE at TOA due to ACA is generally positive, while in regions dominated by dust aerosols (e.g., North Atlantic and Arabian Sea) the DRE at TOA is generally negative (see Figure 7). The strongest positive TOA DRE is found in the SE Atlantic region during summer and fall with a seasonal mean over 0.4 W/m2. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to provide a global perspective on the DRE of ACA on global scale. Our results would be very useful for evaluating the improving modeling simulations of cloudy-sky DRE of aerosols. Note that global annual mean cloudy-sky DRE of aerosol ranges from −0.16 to +0.34 W/m2 in the current generation of climate models (Schulz et al., 2006). ",

            "abstract": "Summer rainfall plays an important role sustaining different types of ecosystems in the Southwestern US. The arrival of the monsoon breaks the early summer hyper-arid period in the region providing unique seasonal conditions for these ecosystems to thrive. It is unknown to what extent monsoon rainfall is used by Ponderosa pine forests, which occupy many mountain ecosystems in the Western US. While these forests clearly rely on winter snowpack to drive much of their annual net primary productivity, the extent to which they supplement winter moisture, with summer monsoon moisture needs to be clarified. It is likely that there are north–south gradients in the degree to which forests rely on monsoon moisture, as the summer monsoon system tends to become diminished as it moves progressively northward. We addressed these gaps in our knowledge about the monsoon by studying stable Carbon and Oxygen isotopes in earlywood and latewood α-cellulose from cores taken from trees in eleven sites along a latitudinal gradient extending from Southern Arizona and New Mexico toward Utah. Here we show evidence that Ponderosa pine trees from most of these sites use monsoon water to support growth during the late summer, and the fractional use of monsoon precipitation is strongest in the southernmost sites. This study provides new physiological evidence on the influence of the North American monsoon and winter precipitation on tree growth in montane ecosystems of the Western US. Using these results, we predict differences in the susceptibility of southern and northern montane forests to future climate change.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: This work was funded by an NSF Macrosystems Grant #1065790",

            "abstract": "Surface melt and mass loss of Greenland Ice Sheet may play crucial roles in global climate change due to their positive feedbacks and large fresh water storage. With few other regular meteorological observations available in this extreme environment, measurements from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) are the primary data source for the surface energy budget studies, and for validating satellite observations and model simulations. However, station tilt, due to surface melt and compaction, results in considerable biases in the radiation and thus albedo measurements by AWS. In this study, we identify the tilt-induced biases in the climatology of surface radiative flux and albedo, and then correct them based on geometrical principles. Over all the AWS from the Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net), the Kangerlussuaq transect (K-transect) and the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE), only ~15% of clear days have the correct solar noon time, with the largest bias to be 3 hours. Absolute hourly biases in the magnitude of surface insolation can reach up to 200 W/m2, with daily average exceeding 100 W/m2. The biases are larger in the accumulation zone due to the systematic tilt at each station, although variabilities of tilt angles are larger in the ablation zone. Averaged over the whole Greenland Ice Sheet in the melting season, the absolute bias in insolation is ~23 W/m2, enough to melt 0.51 m snow water equivalent. We estimate the tilt angles and their directions by comparing the simulated insolation at a horizontal surface with the observed insolation by these tilted AWS under clear-sky conditions. Our correction reduces the RMSE against satellite measurements and reanalysis by ~30 W/m2 relative to the uncorrected data, with correlation coefficients over 0.95 for both references. The corrected diurnal changes of albedo are more smooth, with consistent semi-smiling patterns (see Fig. 1). The seasonal cycles and annual variabilities of albedo are in a better agreement with previous studies (see Fig. 2 and 3). The consistent tilt-corrected shortwave radiation dataset derived here will provide better observations and validations for surface energy budget studies on Greenland Ice Sheet, including albedo variation, surface melt simulations and cloud radiative forcing estimates.",

            "abstract": "The East Anatolian plateau is a distinct geological region bordered by the Arabian continental plate to the south and the Eurasian plate to the north. Existing geological evidence suggests that ~ 2 km of uplift along the plateau occurred since the 13 Ma in conjunction with the Arabia-Eurasia collision. Previous geodynamic models suggest that the high plateau is compensated by thick lithosphere under the plateau; however seismological and petrological studies imply that significant portions of the lithosphere have been removed beneath all of present day East Anatolia. As such, the plateau may instead be supported by hot mantle after the delamination of the northern branch of the Neotethys slab and following break-off under the accretionary complex. We use geodynamical models to test the applicability of delamination and break-off hypothesis to the geodynamic evolution of Eastern Anatolia. By using thermo-mechanical numerical experiments, we investigate the influence of lower crust rheology/composition, plate convergence velocity, Moho temperature variation and strain weakening in the crust that represent model constraints on the lithospheric evolution from ocean subduction to delamination. Model predictions for the surface topography, crustal thickness, and Moho temperature evolution as well as delaminating hinge migration have been tested against geophysical and geological observations for Eastern Anatolia. Our findings indicate that wider orogenic crust delaminates from the mantle lithosphere, –with 2 km of surface uplift and 50 km of crustal thickening- when felsic granulite lower crustal rheology is used without any plate velocity. Lithospheric delamination is more subdued with mafic granulite, diabase and wet peridodite lower crustal rheologies because there is more coupling between the crust and the mantle lithosphere and at the hinge location crustal thickening exceeds 54 km. Furthermore, a higher plate convergence velocity promotes faster slab steepening of the delaminating slab and its break-off, while there is less lithospheric delamination. The surface uplift of 5 km occurs with 5 cm/year convergence velocity. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of rheological, thermal and boundary effects in the lithospheric delamination process for East Anatolia.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are the primary conduits for water and solute movement to the sea, and are increasingly recognized as venues for intensive biogeochemical reactivity. As water and solutes move downstream and exchange with adjacent sediments, important reactions occur that can reduce or enhance solute export. Potential ecosystem degradation due to elevated nitrogen and phosphorus availability makes retention of these solutes particularly important. Our knowledge of riverine nutrient processing has been enhanced by new field sensors capable of high temporal resolution measurements that align with time scales of flow variation and ecosystem processes (e.g., event, diel time scales). While sensor-based methods have emerged for open-channel reach-scale dynamics, they hold limited experimental value, and can be ambiguous about retention or release pathways. To better constrain rates and pathways of nutrient retention, we deployed the same sensors in clear benthic chambers. This allowed us to examine nutrient dynamics at below-ambient concentrations, assess benthic controls on net nutrient fluxes, and enumerate the pathways, timing and kinetics of retention. We present results from the Rainbow River, a nutrient rich spring-fed river in Florida. Chambers revealed rapid net N retention dominated by denitrification, which clearly follows first-order kinetics, suggesting source limitation. A second N retention pathway is plant assimilation, revealed from diel concentration variation. This pathway covaried with biomass density and plant type (i.e., vascular plant vs. filamentous algae), and followed zero-order kinetics (independent of concentration). Phosphate dynamics were dominated by rapid P diffusion from the sediments. There was also evidence of diel phosphate variation, the magnitude of which was consistent with autotrophic uptake, but which retained a small fraction of the diffusive flux. Concordance between measurements of nutrient processing and ecosystem metabolism at chamber and whole-reach scales is quite promising. Our results suggests benthic boxes and in situ sensors can provide an important new tool for disaggregating river systems, and therefore better understand riverine dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Numerous modeling studies indicate that emissions from one continent influence air quality over others. Reducing air pollutant emissions from one continent can therefore benefit air quality and health on multiple continents. Here, we estimate the impacts of the intercontinental transport of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on premature human mortality by using an ensemble of global chemical transport models coordinated by the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). We use simulations of 20% reductions of all anthropogenic emissions from 13 regions (North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Former Soviet Union, Middle East, East Asia, South Asia, South East Asia, Central Asia, and Australia) to calculate their impact on premature mortality within each region and elsewhere in the world. To better understand the impact of potential control strategies, we also analyze premature mortality for global 20% perturbations from five sectors individually: power and industry, ground transport, forest and savannah fires, residential, and others (shipping, aviation, and agriculture). Following previous studies, premature human mortality resulting from each perturbation scenario is calculated using a health impact function based on a log-linear model for O3 and an integrated exposure response model for PM2.5 to estimate relative risk. The spatial distribution of the exposed population (adults aged 25 and over) is obtained from the LandScan 2011 Global Population Dataset. Baseline mortality rates for chronic respiratory disease, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer are estimated from the GBD 2010 country-level mortality dataset for the exposed population. Model results are regridded from each model’s original grid to a common 0.5°x0.5° grid used to estimate mortality. We perform uncertainty analysis and evaluate the sensitivity of mortality estimates to a low-concentration threshold for ozone and a log-linear risk model for PM2.5. Our results allow us to identify the contributions of emissions from different source regions and sectors to air pollutant concentrations and premature human mortality in each region.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost makes up one-quarter of the Earth’s terrestrial surface and, as global temperatures continue to increase, it is at risk of thawing. Thawing permafrost has the potential to release twice the amount of carbon than is currently in the atmosphere. A multi-year field campaign has begun in collaboration with the University of Alaska – Fairbanks, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and our group at George Washington University to study carbon feedbacks during a springtime thaw at the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research site near Fairbanks, Alaska.\nHere we present initial results from our near-infrared open-path instrument for the detection of ambient concentrations of carbon dioxide (in subsequent field campaigns a second channel for methane detection will be added). The optics launch-box portion of the instrument couples a near-infrared distributed feedback laser operating near 1605 nm for carbon detection with a visible laser for alignment purposes. The outgoing beam is directed through a 3.2-mm hole in a parabolic mirror and the launch-box is oriented using a two axis, alt-azi telescope mount so that the beam will hit the retroreflector target at a set distance downfield. The beam then retraces the path back to the launch-box where the light is collected on the surface of the parabolic mirror and focused onto a multi-mode fiber for detection. Using a National Instruments data acquisition system we are able to collect 500 scans per second which allows for long-term data averaging and subsequently increases the signal-to-noise ratio of our signal. The entire system has the ability to run on less than 40 W of power. In June 2015, the instrument was deployed to a thermokarst collapse scar bog in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. With a 90 meter total pathlength we were able to resolve carbon dioxide absorption signals on the order of 0.5%.",

            "abstract": "The atomic Hydrogen is one of the most abundant species in many planetary exospheres, such as on Earth, on planets in the Solar System and on Hot Jupiters. Because the exosphere is a quasi-collisionless medium, the atomic Hydrogen can reach several planetary radii without collisions and its motion is only determined by external forces such as the gravity and the radiation pressure. However, the exosphere still remains a complex medium : 1) to model because, on one hand, this is a region of interaction between the interplanetary medium and the planetary atmosphere and, on another hand, the fluid approach is not appropriate and a kinetic should be used instead, 2) to observe because of the extremely low densities. Currently, the most used analytical model to determine the neutral density profiles is the well-known Chamberlain’s one, which however includes only the gravity. We have developed an analytical model based on the previous work by Bishop and Chamberlain (1989) with a Hamiltonian approach, taking into account both the gravity and the radiation pressure. We extend their previous 1D model (density profiles on the Sun-planet axis only) into a 2D model depending on the distance from the planet and the zenith angle to derive density profiles (Beth et al. 2015b, in review). Moreover, we derived an analytical formula for the thermal escape to compare with the classical Jeans’ escape flux.\nWe thus show that the radiation pressure induces :\nStrong density asymmetries at high altitudes in the planetary exospheres, leading to the phenomenon of “geotail” at Earth,\nNatural existence of an external limit (or exopause) for the exosphere, whose location is analytically determined,\nIncrease of the exospheric densities compared with Chamberlain profiles without radiation pressure (e.g. up to +150% at 5 Martian radius),\nSignificant increase of the thermal escape flux (up to 30/35% for Earth/Mars today), until a “blow-off” regime with a constant escape flux for an extreme radiation pressure. The influence of the radiation pressure on the escape flux may thus bring conditions on the size of primary atmospheres, because of a strong radiation pressure in the Sun’s young years.\nSame effects on exoplanets, in particular on the hot Jupiters that are also subject to additional effects : centrifugal force and stellar gravity.",

            "abstract": "Short-lived geomagnetic events are reflections of geodynamo behavior at small length scales. A rigorous documentation of the anatomy, timing, duration, and frequency of centennial-to-millennial scale geomagnetic events can be invaluable for theoretical and numerical geodynamo models, and for the understanding the finer dynamics of the Earth’s core. A critical ingredient for characterizing such geomagnetic instabilities are tightly constrained age models that enable high-resolution magnetostratigraphies. Here we focus on a North American speleothem geomagnetic record of the Laschamp excursion, which was the first geomagnetic excursion recognized and described in the paleomagnetic record, and remains the most studied event of its kind. The geological significance of the Laschamp lies chiefly in the fact that it constitutes a global time-synchronous geochronological marker. The Laschamp excursion occurred around the time of the demise of Homo neanderthalensis, in conjunction with high-amplitude, rapid climatic oscillations leading into the Last Glacial Maximum, and precedes a major supervolcano eruption in the Mediterranean. Thus, the precise determination of the timing and duration of the Laschamp would help in elucidating major scientific questions situated at the intersection of geology, paleoclimatology, and anthropology. Here we present a geomagnetic record from a stalagmite collected in Crevice Cave, Missouri, which we have dated using a combination of high-precision 230Th ages and annual layer counting using confocal microscopy. We have found a maximum duration for the Laschamp that spans the interval 42,250−39,700 years BP, and an age of 41,100 ± 350 years BP for the height of the excursion. During this period relative paleointensity decreased by an order of magnitude and the virtual geomagnetic pole was located at southerly latitudes. Our chronology provides the first robust bracketing for the Laschamp excursion, and improves on previous age determinations based on 40Ar/39Ar dating of lava flows, and orbitally-tuned sedimentary and ice-core records.",

            "abstract": "Clues concerning dynamic aspects of planetary interiors can be obtained through the characterization of volcano distribution at a global scale. On past years, results obtained from global distribution of volcanism on Earth and Venus have been presented, and compared with each other. In this work, the global distribution of volcanism on Io (the innermost of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites and the most volcanically active body in the Solar System) is explored using the same tools. Volcanic centers on Io can be divided in two groups: The first including positive thermal anomalies, or hotspots, and the second formed by volcano-tectonic depressions called paterae. Approximately 20% of the documented patera coincide with hotspots, but not all of Io’s current volcanic activity is directly associated to paterae. It is uncertain whether hotspots located outside paterae represent volcanic systems still lacking a caldera-like structure, or they represent an entirely different type of volcanism. To account for this source of uncertainty, the analysis reported here was completed on different databases (hotspots, paterae, patera floor units and a combination of hotspots and paterae referred to as volcanic systems). In addition, the distribution of Io’s mountains also was studied. As a result, we show that the main clusters of volcanism on Io support the existence of mantle convection patterns that include a combined heating between the astenosphere and the deep mantle (with the former source being more important, but not necessarily on a 2:1 proportion), takes place at moderate to high Reynolds numbers, and includes some degree of impermeability between the astenosphere and the mantle. We also show that although the long-wavelength volcano distribution is controlled by the patterns of mantle convection, the astenosphere serves as a buffer zone where magma is distributed laterally giving place to volcanic activity away from the zones of influence of the hot mantle isotherms. The processes discussed serve to explain the long-wavelength anticorrelation that exists between volcanic activity and mountain building.",

            "abstract": "Many studies in the past have revealed that hydrologic response of a basin carries imprints of its channel network. However, accurate representation of channel networks in hydrologic models has been a challenge. In addition, dominating flow processes during high flow periods are not the same as those during recession periods, and there is a need for models that can represent these varying behaviors. In this study, we develop two model structures that aim to address the challenges above. The first model assumes that flow processes can be classified into two main categories: i) pure surface flow (PSF) and ii) mixed surface-subsurface flow (MSSF). The second model is a special case of the first model which neglects PSF. Using channel networks extracted from digital elevation models, we develop instantaneous unit hydrographs (IUHs) separately for PSF (PSFIUHs) and MSSF (MSSFIUHs). PSFIUH is descried by the channel ‘network width function’, whereas MSSFIUH is obtained by modifying a recently developed channel network morphology based recession flow model. To obtain the simulated streamflow time series for a basin, we convolute the PSFIUH and the MSSFIUH with the respective effective rainfall time series. The effective rainfall time series is obtained by using the probability distributed model (PDM). For comparison purposes, we also use a dual linear-bucket model for routing flow. Comparing model performance across 78 watersheds in the United States using the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), we find that the two model structures that incorporate channel network information outperform the linear-bucket model in 56 watersheds. Further testing model performance using indicators that capture frequency and duration of low and high flows shows that the two developed models outperform the linear-bucket model in four out of five indicators.",

            "abstract": "High-grade metamorphic rocks provide an archive of tectonic processes and record conditions in the deep roots of orogenic belts. Granulites typically preserve chemical and mineralogical evidence of the peak temperature to which crustal rocks may be subjected, and they commonly preserve a multitude of textural and chemical features that allow a rather detailed reconstruction of their cooling and exhumation. More rarely, however, is it possible to reconstruct parts of the prograde path, which would allow a reconstruction of the loading and heating of the rocks. Access to the prograde P–T path and the rates and durations involved in granulite formation would provide important constraints on the convergence part of orogenic processes.\nHere we investigated a sample of felsic granulite from the H.U. Sverdrupfjella, which is part of the high-grade Maud Belt (East Antarctica). Peak-metamorphic conditions of approximately 925 °C and 1.45 GPa persisted for a maximum of circa 14 million years and were attained shortly after 570 Ma. In addition to the short-lived temperature peak, zircon preserved evidence for protracted granulite facies conditions with temperatures above 800 °C persisting for approximately 40 million years.\nConstraints on prograde metamorphism are recorded by garnet that preserved pre-peak metamorphic growth zones, by Ti zonation in zircon and by rutile inclusions in garnet. Zr-in-rutile thermometry using rutile included in different generations of garnet is used to reconstruct the prograde P–T path documenting burial followed by heating to ultra-high temperatures at peak pressures. Complementary, Ti zonation in prograde cores of zircon grains document and date heating, whereas younger zircon rims show again lower Ti-in-zircon temperatures and date the retrograde stages of metamorphism. The highest T is recorded in rutile, but not in zircon, consistent with the dissolution rather than growth of zircon at ultra-high temperatures.\nThe clockwise loading–heating path and the peak P–T conditions indicate that the rocks preserved in Dronning Maud Land were part of the lower plate during a continent–continent collision event related to Gondwana assembly at circa 570 Ma.",

In the Connecticut River, the hydrologic and thermal regimes have been significantly altered by dams and impoundments as well as by changes in land use that include timber harvest and the clearing of land for agriculture. The impact of these alterations is expected to be more pronounced under projected climate change. We apply a spatially distributed hydrology-stream temperature modeling system, DHSVM-RBM, to evaluate the hydrologic and stream temperature changes associated with climate change, disturbance of riparian vegetation, and removal of reservoirs and impoundments. We configured DHSVM-RBM for 14 major basins in the Connecticut River Basin at a spatial resolution of 150 m and a sub-daily timescale. For existing conditions, characterized by 65 major reservoirs in the main stem of the Connecticut River, we simulated streamflows and temperatures and compared results with flow gage observations and stream temperature measurements. We then explored the relative impact of climate change, disturbance of riparian vegetation, and removal of dams/reservoirs on streamflow and water temperature variations in the Connecticut River in a spatially explicit manner at sub-daily, seasonal and inter-annual time scales. The findings will provide stakeholders with guidance regarding strategies for adapting to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the solar phenomena associated with the origin of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed on 2014 February 25 by a number of spacecraft distributed in the inner heliosphere over a broad range of heliolongitudes. These include a number of near-Earth spacecraft, the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft, STEREO-A and STEREO-B, located at ~1 AU from the Sun 153 deg ahead and 160 deg behind Earth, respectively; the MErcury Surface Space ENvironment GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission (at 0.40 AU and 31 deg west of Earth), and the Juno spacecraft (at 2.11 AU and 48 deg east of Earth). Although the footpoints of the field lines nominally connecting the Sun with STEREO-A, STEREO-B and near-Earth spacecraft were quite distant one from each other, an intense Fe-rich SEP event with fast rising intensities was observed at all three locations. The extent of the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) wave associated with the solar eruption generating the SEP event was very limited in longitude, but the white-light shock accompanying the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) extended over a broad range of longitudes. As the shock propagated into interplanetary space it extended over at least 190 deg in longitude when it arrived at ~1 AU. The release of the SEPs observed at different longitudes occurred when the shock associated with the CME was already high in the corona (>~2 solar radii above the solar surface). We argue that the expanding shock in the extended corona played a fundamental role in the injection of SEPs at different longitudes.",

            "abstract": "The Seiland Igneous Province (SIP) has an exposed area of more than 5500 km2 and is the largest complex of mafic and ultramafic intrusions in northern Fennoscandia. The SIP had a massive plumbing system with deep-seated magmatic conduits that generated more than 25000 km3of igneous melts from the mantle through the continental lithosphere to the surface, at ca 560-570 Ma. The SIP is located within the Kalak Nappe Complex, a part of the Middle Allochthon of the North Norwegian Caledonides. The tectonic development, and movement from its original emplacement onto the Baltica craton is a matter of current debate. The SIP exhibits one of the most pronounced positive Bouguer gravity anomalies in northern Fennoscandia (approximately 100 mGal above background) and a clear magnetic signature. We have identified more than 10 distinct magnetic anomalies related to the Seiland Igneous Province. Here, a 3D gravity and magnetic model of the SIP integrating petrophysical data with gravity and aeromagnetic data is presented. The selected densities for the intrusive range from 2800 to 3400 kg m3, with an average density contrast to the host complex of approximately 400 kg m3. Magnetic susceptibility values, ranging from 0.004 SI to 0.2 SI, show a good correlation with the mapped ultramafic intrusions with few exceptions on the Øksfjord peninsula.\nA multi-profile based 3D model (IGMAS+) shows the deeper structure of the SIP. Our model suggests an irregular shape with its lower boundary varying in depth from North to South from less than 3 km to 10 Km. Two deep roots have been identified located below Seiland and Sørøya islands, the first root slightly dipping southward with two branches in the upper part. The second root is approximately vertical and T- shaped. This model contributes to the understanding of the tectonic, magmatic and the paleogeographic evolution of the SIP and adds new insights to the study of the rich hydrocarbon basins of the Southern Barents Sea.",

            "abstract": "There are three main contributors to the glacial drawdown of atmospheric CO2 content: starvation of the supply of carbon to the ocean-atmosphere reservoir, excess CO2 storage in the deep sea, and surface-ocean cooling. In this talk, I explore a scenario in which all three play significant roles. Key to this scenario is the assumption that deep ocean storage is related to the extent of nutrient stratification of the deep Atlantic. The stronger this stratification, the larger the storage of respiration CO2. Further, it is my contention that the link between Milankovitch insolation cycles and climate is reorganizations of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation leading to changes in the deep ocean’s CO2 storage. If this is the case, the deep Atlantic d13C record kept in benthic foraminifera shells tells us that deep ocean CO2 storage follows Northern Hemisphere summer insolation cycles and thus lacks the downward ramp so prominent in the records of sea level, benthic 18O and CO2. Rather, the ramp is created by the damping of planetary CO2 emissions during glacial time intervals. As it is premature to present a specific scenario, I provide an example as to how these three contributors might be combined. As their magnitudes and shapes remain largely unconstrained, the intent of this exercise is to provoke creative thinking.",

            "abstract": "Developed leaders represent highly conductive plasma channels, continuously emitting a fan of streamers, termed the streamer zone. The tip moves at a speed much slower than that of individual streamers. A huge number of short-lived streamers in the corona generate the space charge field required to maintain the streamer propagation. A critical issue is the conversion from the streamer to leader phase [Da Silva and Pasko, 2013]. The objective of this paper is to present simulations of the formation and propagation of the streamer zone of a leader. In these simulations we generated a group of streamers that propagate in a discharge gap while they interact with each other. We use the modified numerical model [Likhanskii et al., 2007] developed to simulate discharge plasma actuators driven by nanosecond pulses. The model uses 2D rectangular computational box, and the discharge gap is filled with the air at normal conditions. Furthermore the model considers electrons, positive and negative ions. The plasma kinetics and interaction with neutral molecules is modeled in a drift-diffusion approximation [Likhanskii et al., 2007]. The electric field and potential are related to the density of charged species according to the Poisson equation. The latter was solved by the successive over-relaxation method. It is shown that interaction between the streamers significantly reduces their propagation velocity. Furthermore the streamer velocity depends on the distance between the streamers. The smaller is that distance the stronger is the suppression of the streamer velocity. This explains why the leader, which consists of many streamers, is much slower than a single streamer formed in the same discharge gap.\nC.L. Da Silva and V.P. Pasko, J. Geophys.

            "abstract": "The Earth comprises a single physio-chemical system that we interrogate from its surface and/or from space making observations related to various physical and chemical parameters. A change in one of those parameters affects many of the others; for example a change in velocity is almost always indicative of a concomitant change in density, which results in changes to elevation, gravity and geoid observations. Similarly, a change in oxide chemistry affects almost all physical parameters to a greater or lesser extent. We have now developed sophisticated tools to model/invert data in our individual disciplines to such an extent that we are obtaining high resolution, robust models from our datasets. However, in the vast majority of cases the different datasets are modelled/inverted independently of each other, and often even without considering other data in a qualitative sense.\nThe LitMod framework of Afonso and colleagues presents integrated inversion of geoscientific data to yield thermo-chemical models that are petrologically consistent and constrained. Input data can comprise any combination of elevation, geoid, surface heat flow, seismic surface wave (Rayleigh and Love) data and receiver function data, and MT data. The basis of LitMod is characterization of the upper mantle in terms of five oxides in the CFMAS system and a thermal structure that is conductive to the LAB and convective along the adiabat below the LAB to the 410 km discontinuity. Candidate solutions are chosen from prior distributions of the oxides. For the crust, candidate solutions are chosen from distributions of crustal layering, velocity and density parameters. Those candidate solutions that fit the data within prescribed error limits are kept, and are used to establish broad posterior distributions from which new candidate solutions are chosen.\nExamples will be shown of application of this approach fitting data from the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa and the Rae Craton in northern Canada. I will show that the MT data are the most discriminatory, requiring many millions of candidate solutions to be tested in order to sufficiently establish posterior distributions. In particular, the MT data require layered lithosphere, whereas the other data can be fit with a single lithosphere, and the MT data are particularly sensitive to the depth to the LAB.",

            "abstract": "One of the fundamental questions with regard to coastal ecotones relates to their role in the transformation, transport and storage of biogeochemically important constituents and how that role may be altered by climate change. Coastal wetlands provide a range of valuable ecosystem services including sequestering organic carbon (OC) and nutrients in their soils at rates greater than terrestrial ecosystems on a per area basis. As such the Everglades mangrove ecotone, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America, is a biogeochemical “hotspot” at the interface of freshwater marsh and the Gulf of Mexico. Over the last one hundred years this region has been impacted by a reduction in freshwater flow and a sea-level rise (SLR) of 2.3 mm/yr which combined to cause a landward shift in the ecotone. This creates an ideal setting to examine climate induced alterations in the mangrove-ecotone biogeochemical cycle. The ability of the Everglades mangrove forest to keep pace with SLR depends largely on the rate of organic matter accumulation as that accumulation is a key contributor to accretion. However, the basic threat from SLR can be exacerbated in some areas by accelerating organic matter mineralization due to increasing salinity. The increase in salinity supplies sulfate which functions as a terminal electron acceptor that soil microbes can utilize to enhance mineralization in the brackish ecotone regions of coastal wetlands. To investigate these processes, we measured mangrove forest soil accretion, OC, N and P accumulation rates over the most recent 10, 50 and 100 year periods (via 210Pb dating) from the Gulf of Mexico to the upper freshwater reaches of the mangrove forest within Everglades National Park. Lower organic carbon accumulation rates compared to the rest of the system were found in the ecotone region most susceptible to enhanced organic matter mineralization.",

            "abstract": "Volcano geodesy is in the midst of a revolution. GPS and InSAR, together with extensive ground-based sensor networks, have enabled major advances in understanding how and why volcanoes deform. Surveying techniques that produced a few bytes of information per benchmark per year have been replaced by continuously operating deformation networks and imaging radar satellites that generate terabytes of data at resolutions unattainable only a few decades ago. These developments have enabled more detailed assessments of volcano hazards, more accurate forecasts of volcanic activity, and better insights into how volcanoes behave over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Forty years ago, repeated leveling surveys showed that the floor of the Yellowstone caldera had risen more than 70 cm in the past 5 decades. Today a network of GPS stations tracks surface movements continuously with millimeter-scale accuracy and the entire deformation field is imaged frequently by a growing number of SAR satellites, revealing a far more complex style of deformation than was recognized previously. At Mount St. Helens, the 1980-1986 eruption taught us that a seemingly quiescent volcano can suddenly become overtly restless, and that accurate eruption predictions are possible at least in some limited circumstances given sufficient observations. The lessons were revisited during the volcano’s 2004-2008 eruption, during which a new generation of geodetic sensors and methods detected a range of co-eruptive changes that enabled new insights into the volcano’s magma storage and transport system. These examples highlight volcano deformation styles and scales that were unknown just a few decades ago but now have been revealed by a growing number of data types and modeling methods. The rapid evolution that volcano geodesy is currently experiencing provides an ongoing challenge for geodesists, while also demonstrating that geodetic unrest is common, widespread, and illuminating.

Recent observations reveal complex features, yet current geodynamical models generally only attempt to explain the simple hemispheres. Two major theories invoke lateral translation and differential growth to generate a hemispherical difference in age and growth rate of inner core material. Here, we simulate growth and translation, and growth plus super-rotation of the inner core to investigate whether either model can produce the sharp and shifting hemisphere boundaries. We generate age models, then forward model seismic travel times and calculate growth rate models. We then compare these results with inner core seismic data observations. Although both geodynamical models generate an east-west difference, neither produce distinct hemispheres with sharp boundaries. Instead, they generate a gradual transition across the boundaries over more than 30 degrees of longitude. Within the hemispheres, the age and growth rate calculated show no correlation to seismic properties. Super-rotation successfully creates an eastward shift in properties with depth, as observed seismically. Our results are compatible with inner core super-rotation, and indicate that further mechanisms and compositional differences are required to generate the discontinuous boundaries.",

            "abstract": "El Aguajito caldera is located in the State of Baja California Sur, it comprises an area of 450 km2 and sits within the Santa Rosalía Basin which is controlled by NE-SW extensional structures and the NW-SE Cimarron Fault that transects the caldera structure. The oldest rocks are ~90 Ma granodiorites covered by an Oligocene-Miocene volcano-sedimentary sequence, the Miocene Santa Lucia Formation and La Esperanza basalt. Pliocene volcanism is represented by La Reforma caldera, El Aguajito caldera, and the Tres Vírgenes Volcanic complex.\nThis study focuses on the cartography and stratigraphy of area in order to understand the evolution of the volcanic system. The stratigraphy from base to top consists of a series of shallow marine sediments (fossiliferous sandstones) covered by a thick sequence of ignimbrites and pyroclastic flows interbedded with volcaniclastic deposits (Gloria and El Infierno Formations). On top of these deposits is El Aguajito caldera, it consists of a 2 m thick pumice fallout followed by an ignimbrite with three transitional lithofacies: a ≤30-m thick light-pink pyroclastic flow enriched in pumice at the base that gradually becomes enrich in lithics towards the top with the occurrence of degasing pipes. On top rests a 15 m-thick light-purple ignimbrite slightly welded with fiammes and a sequence of pumiceous pyroclastic flows and fallouts. These deposits have been associate to the caldera formation with a collapse diameter of ~8 km marked by rhyolitic domes exposed along a ring collapse crowned the sequence as well as NW-SE aligned rhyolitic domes parallel to the seashore. This cartography allowed to present a preliminary new geological map with four stratigraphic units recognized so far, that were emplaced under subaerial conditions beginning with a Plinian column followed by the emplacement of El Aguajito ignimbrite with its subsequent caldera collapse and finally the extrusion of resurgent domes.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric production and removal rates of Criegee intermediates produced in alkene ozonolysis must be understood to constrain the importance of these species in VOC oxidation and other processes. To estimate these rates, reliable detection methods and laboratory measurements of the UV absorption spectra and reaction kinetics of Criegee intermediates are needed. Here, transient absorption spectroscopy was used to directly measure the UV spectrum of the C2 Criegee intermediate CH3CHOO in a flow reactor at 295 K. The UV spectrum was scaled to the absolute absorption cross section at 308 nm determined by laser depletion measurements in a molecular beam, resulting in a peak UV cross section of (1.27±0.11) × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1 at 328 nm. This spectrum represents the absorption of the syn and anti conformers of CH3CHOO under near-atmospheric conditions, both of which contribute to CH3CHOO atmospheric removal due to UV photolysis. Transient UV absorption was also used to measure the kinetics of the reaction of the C1 Criegee intermediate CH2OO with water vapor at temperatures from 283 to 324 K. The observed CH2OO decay is quadratic with respect to the H2O concentration, indicating that reaction with water dimer is the primary process affecting CH2OO loss. The rate coefficient for the reaction of CH2OO with water dimer exhibits a strong negative temperature dependence with an Arrhenius activation energy of −8.1±0.6 kcal mol–1. The temperature dependence increases the effective loss rate for CH2OO (relative to 298 K) by a factor of ∼2.5 at 278 K and 70% relative humidity, and decreases the loss rate by a factor of ∼2 at 313 K and 30% humidity, which demonstrates that variations in reaction rate due to temperature differences should be included in estimates of Criegee intermediate removal via reactions with water dimer in the atmosphere.",

These observations and their analysis represent a source of data we plan to acquire as a key component of support for the Juno mission’s atmospheric investigation. From thermal imaging and spectroscopy in the 7-25 µm region, we can derive temperatures between 10 and 500 mbar atmospheric pressure, cloud opacities between 500 mbar and 5 bars, the para-H2 fraction near 300 mbar, the 100-400 mbar distributions of ammonia and phosphine, and the distribution of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere (~1 µbar – 10 mbar). Earlier work determined atmospheric properties of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (Fletcher et al. 2010, Icarus 208, 306) and the evolution of the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) fade (whitening) in 2009-2010 (Fletcher et al. 2011 Icarus, 213, 564). We will illustrate recent results from an examination of (1) the revival (re-darkening) of the SEB in 2010-2011, (2) discovery of uniquely dry regions of the atmosphere that are identified with visible “brown barges” typically located at the northern edge of Jupiter’s North Equatorial Belt (NEB), (3) vertical structure of stratospheric waves constituting Jupiter’s Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) (Leovy et al. 1991, Nature 354, 380), and (4) previously unsuspected long-term tropospheric thermal waves uncovered in our multi-year program covering well over a Jovian year. Efforts are underway to provide mission-supporting observations using mid-infrared facility and guest instruments at several observatories during the 14-day orbits of the Juno mission, particularly – but not exclusively – the early orbits dedicated to remote sensing observations.",

            "abstract": "The direction of seismic slip constitutes an important focal mechanism parameter particularly for ancient-prehistoric earthquakes. Here I show that in most cases, the magnetic fabric of fault pseudotachylytes indicates the direction of coseismic slip as a result of the dominant simple shear nature of frictional melt flow. The magnetic fabric arises from the shape or crystallographic preferred orientation of magnetically anisotropic minerals (paramagnetic silicates or ferromagnetic oxides) in a viscous medium. This fabric, acquired in a manner similar to that of other magmas, becomes rapidly frozen as the frictional melt is quenched. This kinematic information, coupled with fault plane orientation and generation vein thickness, provides new and critical insight for the earthquake focal mechanism. The magnetic fabric of pseudotachylytes, therefore, not only constitutes a valuable kinematic criterion for these fault rocks but also could expand our knowledge on prehistoric seismic events.",

            "abstract": "The Moine Thrust Zone (MTZ), located in NW Scotland, formed as a result of the closing of the Iapetus Ocean and docking of various terranes and arcs (Scandian Phase of the Caledonian Orogeny, ca. 445-420 Ma). The MTZ as defined here comprises three major foreland-propagating thrust faults, the latest of which is the Moine Thrust itself, which emplaced Proterozoic Moine Supergroup psammites westward onto Cambro-Ordovician shelf sequence rocks and Lewisian basement gneiss. Presently, the north-south striking Moine Thrust Zone is exposed for more than 200 km along strike, and Scandian deformation can be traced up to 40 km eastward from the Moine Thrust towards the hinterland. The thrust system is thought to have been exhumed while still active, resulting in the exposure of deep structural levels of the MTZ.\nAs part of an ongoing project to study how the stress, rheology, and width of continental-scale faults vary with depth, we use the piezometer based on the grainsize of dynamically recrystallized quartz to determine the variation in magnitude of differential stress across the MTZ. We present a transect from the head of Loch Eriboll in the footwall, eastward to the base of Ben Hope in the hangingwall. Grainsize generally decreases westward and structurally downward to the Moine Thrust, where ultramylonites have grainsizes on the order of 10 µm. Higher stresses towards the foreland likely reflect lower temperatures of deformation in rocks that before thrusting were at higher structural levels, and may have triggered a switch to grainsize sensitive creep, thus resulting in localization of strain and narrowing of shear zone width.",

Here we present re-analysis of the UV measurements (BUV) from the NASA Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (N7 TOMS: 1978-1993). Ozone is the dominant atmospheric absorber in the BUV spectrum, but volcanic eruptions can produce enough SO2 to be distinguished from ozone background. Quantitative retrieval of volcanic SO2 requires:\n1) Separation of the O3 and SO2 absorption in BUV radiances;\n2) Close to zero mean SO2 background;\n3) RT forward model that accounts for the presence of volcanic ash in the plume;\n4) A priori knowledge of the ozone and SO2 vertical profiles.\nOur iterative retrieval algorithm returns O3 and SO2 column amounts, effective reflectivity and its spectral slope. The retrieval model also generates a 4 x 4 gain matrix for the SO2 free regions that is used to soft calibrate the measured 340 nm BUV radiance. The spectral slope implicitly accounts for the interference of volcanic ash, but more explicit ash treatment is required to better quantify SO2 errors in volcanic plumes heavily loaded with ash.

Thus, the surface water quality analysis in this region always brings the newer information. In this present study, multivariate statistical procedures were applied to analyze the spatial and temporal water quality in the Indian River Lagoon over the period 1998-2013. Twelve parameters have been analyzed on twelve key water monitoring stations in and beside the lagoon on monthly datasets (total of 27,648 observations). The dataset was treated using cluster analysis (CA), principle component analysis (PCA) and non-parametric trend analysis. The CA was used to cluster twelve monitoring stations into four groups, with stations on the similar surrounding characteristics being in the same group. The PCA was then applied to the similar groups to find the important water quality parameters. The principal components (PCs), PC1 to PC5 was considered based on the explained cumulative variances 75% to 85% in each cluster groups. Nutrient species (phosphorus and nitrogen), salinity, specific conductivity and erosion factors (TSS, Turbidity) were major variables involved in the construction of the PCs. Statistical significant positive or negative trends and the abrupt trend shift were detected applying Mann-Kendall trend test and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK), for each individual stations for the important water quality parameters. Land use land cover change pattern, local anthropogenic activities and extreme climate such as drought might be associated with these trends. This study presents the multivariate statistical assessment in order to get better information about the quality of surface water. Thus, effective pollution control/management of the surface waters can be undertaken.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater drought, defined as the sustained occurrence of below average availability of groundwater, is marked by below average water levels in aquifers and reduced flows to groundwater-fed rivers and wetlands. The impact of groundwater drought on ecosystems, agriculture, municipal water supply, and the energy sector is an increasingly important global issue. However, current drought monitors heavily rely on precipitation and vegetative stress indices to characterize the timing, duration, and severity of drought events. The paucity of in situ observations of aquifer levels is a substantial obstacle to the development of systems to monitor groundwater drought in drought-prone areas, particularly in developing countries. Observations from the NASA/German Space Agency’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have been used to estimate changes in groundwater storage over areas with sparse point measurements. This study incorporates GRACE total water storage observations into a Bayesian framework to assess the performance of a probabilistic model for monitoring groundwater drought based on remote sensing data. Overall, it is hoped that these methods will improve global drought preparedness and risk reduction by providing information on groundwater drought necessary to manage its impacts on ecosystems, as well as on the agricultural, municipal, and energy sectors.",

The earthquake was a low-angle thrust faulting event on the shallow décollement between the India and Eurasia plates, rupturing a section of the broader Himalaya Front that has been largely seismically quiescent since the adjacent segment to the south-east ruptured in the 1934 Nepal-Bihar M8.1 earthquake. We present a detailed multiple-event relocation analysis of earthquakes in the Himalaya region, using both teleseismic and regionally recorded data, over the half-century prior to, and approximately eight months following, the Gorkha earthquake. We also present moment tensor and finite fault analyses of the largest events, and integrate all of this information to place the Gorkha earthquake sequence into a seismotectonic context. Preliminary observations from this study include the following: 1) the Gorkha earthquake ruptured a ~120x80 km patch of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) – the décollement defining the plate boundary at depth – over an area surrounding but predominantly north of the capital city of Kathmandu, 2) relocated aftershock hypocenters primarily halo the main slip patch and occur at or near the MHT with depths generally increasing to the north beneath the higher Himalaya along flatter section of the décollement, 3) the M7.3 aftershock occurred south-east of the mainshock slip patch, on a segment of the décollement that was positively stressed towards failure by the mainshock, 4) normal faulting earthquakes have occurred in the shallow crust above the MHT, and likely reflect readjustment of the stresses in the upper plate and, 5) we observe little evidence of seismicity on the near surface portion of the Main Frontal Thrust that lies south of Kathmandu. Results from this analysis provide constraints on where earthquake hazard remains high, and thus where future-damaging earthquakes may occur in this densely populated region.",

            "abstract": "The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is designed to provide global estimates of water surface elevation, slope and discharge from space. This mission will provide increased spatial and temporal coverage compared to current altimeters. However, the temporal sampling is less frequent than current in-situ discharge observations. Thus, there is a need for methods that can utilize spatially and temporally inconsistent observations of discharge to reconstruct fields that are consistent in time and space.\nUsing the Inverse Streamflow Routing (ISR) model of Pan and Wood [2013], discharge records are derived for the Ohio River basin using data assimilation with a fixed interval Kalman smoother. ISR utilizes observed (or SWOT retrieved) discharge values at discrete (gauge) locations to generate spatially and temporally distributed fields of runoff by inverting a linear routing model. These runoff fields are then routed to produce river discharge estimates throughout the basin.\nThree experiments have been carried out to evaluate assimilating SWOT observations. The experiments are: (1) assimilating 75 in-situ gauges only, (2) using 50 in-situ gauges and 25 SWOT-retrieved “gauges”, and (3) using 75 SWOT-retrieved “gauges” only. The estimated discharges are compared to in-situ USGS gauge data from 2006 to 2009. Results show that the ISR assimilation method can be used to effectively reproduce the spatial and temporal dynamics of discharge in each of the experiments. In particular, the results of the SWOT-only data experiment indicate that despite the coarse temporal SWOT overpasses (0 to 3 over a 22 day period) significant discharge information throughout the entire basin can be retrieved. The ISR-SWOT assimilation approach will provide extremely useful discharge estimates, especially in sparsely gauged regions where spatially and temporally consistent discharge records are most valuable.\nPan, M; Wood, E F 2013 Inverse streamflow routing, HESS 17(11):4577-4588",

            "abstract": "Investigations of changes in the nature of heat waves have traditionally focused exclusively on temperature, despite substantive evidence that moisture is a key determinant of impacts associated with extreme heat. Isobaric equivalent temperature, the temperature that an air parcel would have if all associated water vapor were condensed and the resulting latent heat used to increase the temperature of the parcel, is used here to investigate historical changes in extreme heat events in the United States. Unlike apparent temperature, which given sufficiently high air temperature, can be elevated in the absence of high humidity, apparent temperature only attains extreme high values when both temperature and humidity are high. Heat waves are identified using the excess heat factor (EHF), which includes terms for both acclimatization and departure from climatology. Analysis of EHF is conducted using both temperature and equivalent temperature derived from multiple reanalysis datasets including recent reanalysis that assimilate data from multiple platforms (e.g., North American Regional Reanalysis, NCEP-DOE Reanalysis) as well as long-term reanalyses that assimilate only sea-level pressure (e.g., NCEP and ECMWF 20th Century Reanalysis products). The results will be discussed in the context of similarities and differences among the reanalysis products and time periods considered. Results based on equivalent temperature are also contrasted with those based on temperature alone.",

Overall, satellite rainfall estimates tend to underestimate the magnitude and spatial variability of heavy precipitation in complex topography. Gauge adjustment to these estimates are considered as a more reliable data source but it requires relatively dense surface networks, which is not typically available in mountainous regions. This study will evaluate the performance of the NWP-based error correction procedure applied on NOAA Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) product over three mountainous regions (Mid-Atlantic, South America and East Africa) and selected heavy precipitation events. The performance evaluation compares the NWP-adjusted CMORPH precipitation fields to the original (unadjusted) CMORPH and the gauge-adjusted CMORPH products in terms of: (i) precipitation error properties across the study domains and at different basin scales; and (ii) flood simulations driven by the different precipitation products. The results demonstrate significant improvements resulting from the NWP-adjusted CMORPH precipitation estimates in terms of both the precipitation error characteristics and associated flood simulations. These improvements are shown to be comparable to those from the post-processed gauge-adjusted CMORPH precipitation product, which is promising for advancing hydrologic uses of satellite rainfall in mountainous areas lacking ground observations.\n*1 Zhang, X. et al. 2013: Using NWP Simulations in Satellite Rainfall Estimation of Heavy Precipitation Events over Mountainous Areas.

Multiple ground-based electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) imagers were positioned at Venetie, Alaska and aimed along magnetic zenith in order to observe the brightness of different auroral emission lines (427.8, 557.7, and 844.6 nm with a 47 degree field of view) at the magnetic footpoint of the payload, near apogee. Emission line brightness data are presented at the footpoint of the rocket flight and compared with electron characteristics taken by the Acute Precipitating Electron Spectrometer (APES) on-board instrument. Ratios of different auroral emission lines are combined with previously published models in order to estimate the characteristic energy of the incident electron population, which is directly compared to the APES data for validation. Our goal is to describe the auroral emissions produced from a known precipitating electron distribution, such that we can more accurately use ground-based imaging and photometry to infer the characteristics of the precipitating electrons. These techniques can then be applied over larger scales and longer times, when only multi-spectral imaging data are available with no corresponding in situ data.",

            "abstract": "Deep earthquakes in subduction/collision zones may originate from mechanical failure of ultramafic rocks at mantle depths. Fault pseudotachylytes in peridotites have been attributed to seismic slip at depths >30 km. However, the possibility of frictional melting at shallower depths still exist.\nWhile pristine mantle rocks typically lack magnetite, postseismic serpentinization would likely involve formation of abundant multi-domain (MD) magnetite. Single-domain (SD) to pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite may also form in pseudotachylytes through breakdown of mafic silicates. Magnetite has a large magnetic susceptibility (Km). MD magnetite shows low magnetic remanence / magnetic saturation ratios (Mr/Ms) compared to SD-PSD magnetite. The formation of coseismic magnetite however would depend on fO2. Hence, in unserpentinized ultramafic pseudotachylytes, magnetite would form preferentially under shallow, high fO2 conditions. Coseismically deformed magnetite would result in a high anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS).\nHere, we present a predictive model of the magnetic properties and magnetic fabrics of ultramafic pseudotachylytes formed under four conditions:\ni) deep seismic slip and no syn- or postseismic serpentinization: low Km (<600 . 10^-6 [SI]), low Mr/Ms (<0.1), and low AMS (<1.1)\nii) deep seismic slip followed by static serpentinization: high Km (>3,000 . 10^-6 [SI]), low Mr/Ms (<0.1), low AMS (<1.1)\niii) deep or shallow seismic slip in previously serpentinized peridotites: high Km (>3,000 . 10^-6 [SI]), moderate Mr/Ms (0.1-0.5), high AMS (>1.5)\niv) shallow seismic slip with no serpentinization: moderate Km (600-3,000 . 10^-6 [SI]), high Mr/Ms (>0.5), moderate AMS (1.1-1.5)\nWe test these models using samples from the Balmuccia Massif (Italy) and the Schistes Lustrés (Corsica). These models may provide new constrains for ultramafic pseudotachylytes regarding their depth of formation and the timing of serpentinization.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial exoplanets orbiting small host stars are abundant and are also the most promising observational targets for finding life outside our Solar system. Due to their close-in orbits, these planets experience significant tidal interactions with their host stars and will tend to evolve towards spin-orbit resonances or synchronous rotation (=tidally locked). Synchronous rotation has a number of interesting implications for habitability, including the potential for atmospheric collapse on the night side if the surface temperature drops below the condensation point of the gases in the atmosphere. To understand the habitability of synchronously rotating planets, it is therefore important to work out a theory of their temperature and wind structure. Many of these planets will be rotating slowly enough that the well-known weak-temperature-gradient theory holds in the free atmosphere, but even for these planets this theory does not constrain the maximum surface temperature gradient, the planets' thermal phase curve signature, or the threshold for atmospheric collapse. Here we study tidally locked planets using theory and a large array of simulations in a global climate model (GCM) with grey radiative transfer and a full boundary layer scheme. We derive a theory for surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation on synchronously rotating planets that allows us to predict the night-side surface temperature and determine whether atmospheric collapse will occur. We find that atmospheric collapse is sensitive to both the ratio of the Rossby radius to the planetary radius and the ratio of the surface drag timescale to the radiative cooling timescale.",

Using large flume experiments we have documented the complex redox dynamics associated with dune-scale hyporheic flow. Observations, coupled with reactive transport modeling, provide insight into how flow dictates spatio-temporal distribution of redox reactions and the associated consumption and production of reactants and products. Dune hyporheic flow was experimentally produced by maintaining control over flow rates, slopes, sediment grain size, bedform geomorphology, and organic carbon content. An extensive in-situ monitoring array combined with sampling events over time elucidated redox-sensitive processes including constraints on the spatial distribution and magnitude of aerobic respiration, organic carbon consumption, sulfide deposition, and denitrification. Reactive transport modeling reveals further insight into the influence of system geometry and reaction rate. As an example application of the model, the relationship between residence times and reaction rates may be used to generate Damköhler numbers that are related to biogeochemical processes, such as the potential of streambed morphology and nitrate loading to influence production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide via incomplete denitrification.",

We aim to infer the fault properties in the area of well-studied SF and LA repeating sequences on the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault by numerical modeling, focusing on two intriguing observations: (1) the stress drops of these repeaters are inferred to be much higher, ~30 MPa, than the typical 1-10 MPa range and (2) these sequences appeared to interact irregularly before the 2004 M 6.0 Parkfield event but not after.\nOur rate-and-state fault model of the repeaters features two velocity-weakening (VW) patches embedded into a large velocity-strengthening (VS) region. One of our major findings is that interaction between patches is dominated by the effect of accelerated postseismic slip around them, and not by direct static stress changes due to coseismic slip. We are able to numerically reproduce similar seismic events as the SF and LA sequences, with comparable moment magnitude, recurrence time, triggering time, and high stress drop, by incorporating enhanced dynamic weakening of the VW patches due to thermal pressurization. We find that the stress drop of the simulated repeaters depends on the properties of the surrounding creeping segment, since those properties partially control the rupture size.\nOur current work is directed towards determining the degree of heterogeneity in the model required for the observed irregular interaction. Many smaller events (Mw < 1.5) have occurred around the two repeating sequences, and we are exploring their effect in our model by adding smaller seismogenic patches. Our preliminary results suggest that some of the observed irregular interaction of SF and LA sequences may be due to their interaction with the smaller patches.",

            "abstract": "We developed a novel scalable multi-chain Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for high-dimensional inverse problems. The method is scalable in terms of number of chains and processors, and is useful for Bayesian calibration of computationally expensive simulators typically used for scientific and engineering calculations. In this study, we demonstrate two applications of this method for hydraulic and geological inverse problems. The first one is monitoring soil moisture variations using tomographic ground penetrating radar (GPR) travel time data, where challenges exist in the inversion of GPR tomographic data for handling non-uniqueness and nonlinearity and high-dimensionality of unknowns. We integrated the multi-chain MCMC framework with the pilot point concept, a curved-ray GPR forward model, and a sequential Gaussian simulation (SGSIM) algorithm for estimating the dielectric permittivity at pilot point locations distributed within the tomogram, as well as its spatial correlation range, which are used to construct the whole field of dielectric permittivity using SGSIM. The second application is reservoir porosity and saturation estimation using the multi-chain MCMC approach to jointly invert marine seismic amplitude versus angle (AVA) and controlled-source electro-magnetic (CSEM) data for a layered reservoir model, where the unknowns to be estimated include the porosity and fluid saturation in each reservoir layer and the electrical conductivity of the overburden and bedrock. The computational efficiency, accuracy, and convergence behaviors of the inversion approach are systematically evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Large wood (LW) additions are often part of fish habitat restorations in the PNW where historic forest clear-cutting limited natural wood recruitment. These efforts’ relative successes are rarely reported in terms of ecological significance to different life stages of fish. Understanding the effectiveness of LW additions will contribute to successfully managing forest land. In this study we quantify the geomorphic change of a restoration project involving LW additions to three alluvial reaches in Mill Creek, OR. The reaches are 110-130m in plane-bed morphology and drain 2-16km2. We quantify the change in available habitat to different life stages of coho salmon in terms of velocity (v), shear stress (t), flow depth, and grain size distributions (GSD) considering existing thresholds in the literature for acceptable habitat. Flow conditions before and after LW additions are assessed using a 2D hydrodynamic model (FaSTMECH). Model inputs include detailed channel topography, discharge, and surface GSD. The spatial-temporal variability of sediment transport was also quantified based the modeled t distributions and the GSD to document changes in the overall geomorphic regime. Initial modeling results for pre wood conditions show mean t and v values ranging between 0 and 26N/m2 and between 0 and 2.4m/s, respectively for up to bankfull flow (Qbf). The distributions of both t and v become progressively wider and peak at higher values as flow increases with the notable exception at Qbf for which the area of low velocity increases noticeably. The spatial distributions of velocity results indicates that the extent of suitable habitat for adult coho decreased by 18% between flows 30 and 55% of BF. However the area of suitable habitat increased by 15% between 0.55Qbf and Qbf as the flow spreads from the channel into the floodplain. We expect the LW will enhance floodplain connectivity and thus available habitat by creating additional areas of low v during winter flows.",

            "abstract": "20% of Canada’s total freshwater is located in the province of Quebec, where 30% of the country’s energy is produced from hydropower. Hydroelectric generation uses a considerable amount of water through evaporation from the reservoirs. The blue water footprint is an indicator of the annual freshwater consumption related to hydropower production. Although environmental effects of reservoir impounding have been previously investigated, their impacts on local and regional evapotranspiration are still not well understood due to the lack of long-term observation data. This study aims to assess the blue water footprint of two large hydroelectric systems located in the Canadian boreal forest. To do so, we use hydro-meteorological data from two specially designed climate simulations (a ‘no-reservoir’ and a ‘post-impoundment’ simulation) performed by the fifth generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Land-surface processes in the CRCM5 are parameterized by the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS V3.6), while surface fluxes over the water bodies are simulated by the 1-D lake model (Flake). A ‘no-reservoir’ and a ‘post-impoundment’ simulation are carried by adjusting the water fraction on the reservoir grids. Both simulations cover a 42 years period (1970-2012) at 0.11° horizontal resolution, consisting of 300 x 300 grid points centered on the province of Quebec. The two watersheds under study (200 000 km² total) are located in Northern Quebec (49-54°N), Canada, where more than 42% of the province power generation capacity is installed with eight reservoirs covering a total area of 10 000 km². A first validation of the ‘post-impoundment’ simulation is performed using micrometeorological ground observations, complemented with available hydro-meteorological data from Environment Canada weather stations. Then, each reservoir water footprint is calculated using the ‘post-impoundment’ simulation. Finally, the net evapotranspiration and the pre and post impoundment water budgets are assessed on the watershed scale. Results from this study are expected to be useful for water resources management in Quebec and other similar boreal environments.",

            "abstract": "Titan hosts the most chemically complex atmosphere in the solar system. The first encounter of the Cassini spacecraft with Titan was in October 2004 with a closest approach altitude of 1147km. Since then the Cassini has made measurements of the ionospheric species over multiple flybys and has provided a unique opportunity to study long term effects on Titan's ionosphere including solar activity cycle. It has been shown that solar extreme ultraviolet radiation is the main source of ion production and production rates are highly dependent on solar zenith angle. We use data from the ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and the Radio and Plasma Wave Science-Langmuir probe (RPWS-LP) instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft to investigate changes in the ion composition of the ionosphere. We compare the observations with the results of our ionospheric models. Data from 21 targeted Titan flybys are used, covering the declining phase of solar cycle 23 into the double peak of solar cycle 24. We show that the ion densities have in fact increased during the high solar activity, especially at altitudes near the ionospheric peak, and unlike Earth, the Titan's thermosphere is contracted during high solar activity. Charge neutrality is assumed near the peak of the ionosphere, however difference exists between INMS total ion densities and RPWS-LP electron densities and it becomes more noticeable at high solar activity. This may be for several reasons including enhanced negative ion densities and increased electron recombination rates. The model results agree reasonably well with the in-situ measurements for most ion species at low and high solar activity conditions although overproduction exists for some ions (e.g. HCNH+) and underproduction is seen for some heavier species such as C7H7+.",

Our team, based at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center, prepared designs for a Gravity Tractor Demonstration Mission (GTDM) for the European Commission’s NEOShield initiative. We found five asteroids with well-known orbits and opportunities for efficient stand-alone demonstrations in the 2020s. We selected one object, 2000 FJ10, for a detailed design analysis.\nOur GTDM design has a 4 kW solar-electric propulsion system and launch mass of ~1150 kg. For a nominal asteroid mass of ~3 x 109 kg and diameter ~150 m, and a hovering altitude ~125 m above the asteroid’s surface, GTDM would change FJ10’s semi-major axis by ~10 km over 2 years. To measure the deflection clearly and to permit safe hovering by the spacecraft, several months of survey and characterization are required prior to the active tractoring phase of the mission. Accurate tracking is also required after the tractoring phase, to ensure that the asteroid has indeed been deflected as intended. The GTDM design includes both spacecraft and Earth-based observations of FJ10 to verify the deflection. The estimated cost of GTDM is $280 million.\nTrajectory analysis for GTDM confirmed that the outcome of a deflection of any asteroid depends on when that deflection is performed. Compared to kinetic impactor deflection, the gradual deflection from a gravity tractor produces comparable results for a given total momentum transfer. However, a gravity tractor can have greater flexibility in the direction in which the target asteroid can be deflected. Asteroid deflection scenarios must be modeled carefully on a case-to-case basis.\nWe will review implications of the results of the GTDM study to other proposed gravity tractor demonstrations, such as that included in NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission.",

This study provides an integrated ensemble approach to assessing climate change impacts on the hydrologic cycle and hydrologic extremes for all water supplies to Southern California. Output from 10 global climate models is used to force a regional climate model and hydrological model resulting in high-resolution 4.17-km output for the region. Greenhouse gas concentrations are prescribed according to historical values for the present-day (1965-2005) and the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for the near to mid term future (2010-2050). On the annual timescale, temperature, precipitation and evaporation increase throughout the majority of the study area. With increased temperatures, precipitation is less likely to fall as snow, decreasing snowpack and natural storage and shifting peak flows to earlier in the year. Daily annual maximum runoff and precipitation events are projected to significantly increase in intensity and frequency by mid-century. The 50-year event, for example, becomes approximately five times more likely in the Colorado River basin and twice as likely in the other basins. In densely populated coastal Southern Californian cities, extreme flood events become three to five times as likely substantially increasing the risk of overburdening flood control systems and potential widespread flooding. The escalating likelihood of the combined effects of runoff occurring earlier in the year and in significantly higher amounts poses a substantial flood control risk requiring adaptation measures such as water release from reservoirs. Significant snowpack reductions and increased flood risk will likely necessitate additional multiyear storage solutions for urban and agricultural regions in the Southwestern US.",

            "abstract": "Saturation excess runoff (SER) is without doubt the major runoff mechanism in the humid well vegetated areas where infiltration rates often exceed the medium rainfall intensity. Despite its preponderance, incorporating SER in the distributed models has been slow and fraught with difficulties. The short term objective of this paper to adjust the generally used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to include SER and test the results in the Catskill Mountains that is the source of most of New York City’s water. The long term goal is to use the adjusted distributed runoff mechanism in water quality models to aid in the design of effective management practices. The current version of SWAT uses information of soil plant characteristics and hydrologic condition to predict runoff and thus is implicitly based on infiltration-excess runoff. Previous attempts to incorporate SER mechanism in SWAT fell short because they were unable to distribute water from a Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) to another. In the current version called El-SWAT, this shortcoming has been overcome by redefining HRU to include landscape position through the topographic index, grouping the newly defined HRU into wetness classes and by introducing a perched water table with the ability to route interflow from “dryer” to “wetter” HRU wetness classes. Mathematically, the perched aquifer is a non-linear reservoir that generates rapid subsurface stormflow as the perched water table rises. The El-SWAT model was tested in the Town Brook watershed in the upper reaches of the West Branch of the Delaware in the Catskill Mountains. The results showed that El-SWAT could predict discharge well with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.69 and 0.84 for daily and monthly time steps. Compared to the original SWAT model, El-SWAT predicted less surface runoff and groundwater flow and a greater lateral flow component. The saturated areas in El-SWAT were concentrated in locations with high topographic index and was in agreement with field observations. With the incorporation of topography characteristics and the addition of the perched aquifer, El-SWAT gives a realistic representation of hydrological processes and will lead to better water quality models where the source of the surface runoff matters.",

            "abstract": "We discuss application of three particle in cell (PIC) codes to the problems relevant to turbulence dissipation challenge. VPIC is a fully kinetic code extensively used to study a variety of diverse problems ranging from laboratory plasmas to astrophysics. PSC is a flexible fully kinetic code offering a variety of algorithms that can be advantageous to turbulence simulations, including high order particle shapes, dynamic load balancing, and ability to efficiently run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, HYPERS is a novel hybrid (kinetic ions+fluid electrons) code, which utilizes asynchronous time advance and a number of other advanced algorithms. We present examples drawn both from large-scale turbulence simulations and from the test problems outlined by the turbulence dissipation challenge. Special attention is paid to such issues as the small-scale intermittency of inertial range turbulence, mode content of the sub-proton range of scales, the formation of electron-scale current sheets and the role of magnetic reconnection, as well as numerical challenges of applying PIC codes to simulations of astrophysical turbulence.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, aided by the advent of horizontal drilling used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, oil and gas production in basins around the United States has increased significantly. A study was conducted in two oil and gas basins during the spring and summer of 2015 to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of several atmospheric trace gases that can be influenced by oil and gas extraction including methane, ozone, and carbon dioxide. Fifteen air quality monitors were distributed across the Denver Julesburg Basin in Northeast Colorado, and the San Juan Basin, which stretches from Southwest Colorado into Northwest New Mexico in Four Corners Region. Spatial variability in ozone was observed across each basin. The presence of dynamic short-term trends observed in the mole fraction of methane and carbon dioxide indicate the extent to which each site is uniquely impacted by local emission sources. Diurnal trends of these two constituents lead toward a better understanding of local pooling of emissions that can be influenced by topography, the planetary boundary layer height, atmospheric stability, as well as the composition and flux of local and regional emissions sources.",

From its inception our unit’s archiving service has evolved considerably. While some of these changes have been internally driven so that our unit can archive quality data collections more efficiently, we have also developed archiving policies and procedures on the fly in response to researcher needs. Providing our archiving services for JHU research groups from a variety of research disciplines have surfaced different sets of expectations and needs. We have used each interaction to help us refine our services and quickly satisfy the researchers we serve (following the first agile principle).\nHere we discuss the development of our newest archiving service model, its implementation over the past several months, and the processes by which we have continued to refine and improve our archiving services since its implementation. Through this discussion we will illustrate the benefits of planning, structure and flexibility in development of archiving services that maximize the potential value of research data.\nWe will describe interactions with research groups, including those from environmental engineering and international health, and how we were able to rapidly modify and develop our archiving services to meet their needs (e.g. in an ‘agile’ way). For example, our interactions with both of these research groups led first to discussion in regular standing meetings and eventually development of new archiving policies and procedures. These policies and procedures centered on limiting access to archived research data while associated manuscripts progress through peer-review and publication.",

            "abstract": "Wave gradiometry is an array processing technique utilizing the shape of seismic wavefields captured by USArray TA stations to determine fundamental wave propagation characteristics. We first explore a compatibility relation that links spatial gradients of the wavefield with the displacements and the time derivatives of displacements through two unknown coefficients Aand B, which are solved through iterative, damped least-square inversion, to provide estimates of phase velocity, back-azimuth, radiation pattern and geometrical spreading. We show that the A-coefficient corresponds to the gradient of logarithmic amplitude and the B-coefficient corresponds approximately to the local dynamic phase velocity. These vector fields are interpolated to explore a second compatibility relation through solutions to the Helmholtz equation. For most wavefields passing through the eastern U.S., we show that the A-coefficients are generally orthogonal to the B-coefficients. Where they are not completely orthogonal, there is a strong positive correlation between the gradients of B-coefficients and changes in geometrical spreading, which can be further linked with areas of strong energy focusing and defocusing. We then obtain isotropic phase velocity maps across the contiguous United States for 20 - 150 s Rayleigh wave by stacking results from 700 earthquakes. The strong velocity variations in the western U.S. correlate well with known geological features and the am- plitude correction terms from Helmholtz equation solutions generally improve the resolution of small-scale structures for all periods analyzed. We also observe a velocity change along the approximate boundary of the early Paleozoic continental margin in the eastern U.S and two significant low velocity anomalies within the central Appalachians, one centered where Eocene basaltic volcanism has occurred, and the other within the northeastern U.S., possibly associated with the Great Meteor Hotspot track.

            "abstract": "Documenting hydrological responses to past climate changes may provide insights into how ongoing warming will alter the distribution of Earth’s water resources. Here we report evidence suggesting that wetter-than-present conditions persisted during the past millennium in the deserts of the Tarim Basin, western China, located at the heart of Asia - Earth’s largest and most populous continent. Our assessment is based on observations of landforms composed of waterlain sediments occurring throughout the Taklamakan and Lop Deserts of the Tarim Basin. These landforms are associated with subfossil phreatophyte trees, reeds, and mollusk shells. We applied 14C and dendrochronological dating techniques to construct a chronology for when the Tarim Basin was wetter than today. We also employed hydrological modeling to estimate plausible climatic conditions under which the observed wet environment could have been sustained. Our results indicate that the core of the Asian desert belt was dominantly wetter than today during the last major cold spell of the Holocene: The Little Ice Age. Wetter conditions in the Tarim Basin deserts accompanied northern cooling, snowline lowering, a strengthened boreal jet, and coeval weakening of south Asian monsoons. Southward migration of grasslands in response to wetter conditions may have aided the spread of the Mongol Empire across Asian drylands. On the other hand, net drying over the 20th century has led to drought that is unprecedented for at least the past ~830 years, and which could intensify with further warming.",

            "abstract": "The temporal dynamics of stream network is vitally important for understanding hydrologic processes including groundwater interactions and hydrograph recessions. However, observations are limited on flowing channel heads, which are usually located in headwater catchments and under canopy. Near infrared LiDAR data provides an opportunity to map the flowing channel network owing to the fine spatial resolution, canopy penetration, and strong absorption of the light energy by the water surface. A systematic method is developed herein to map flowing channel networks based on the signal intensity of ground LiDAR return, which is lower on water surfaces than on dry surfaces. Based on the selected sample sites where the wetness conditions are known, the signal intensities of ground returns are extracted from the LiDAR point data. The frequency distributions of wet surface and dry surface returns are constructed. With the aid of LiDAR-based ground elevation, the signal intensity thresholds are identified for mapping flowing channels. The developed method is applied to Lake Tahoe area based on eight LiDAR snapshots during recession periods in five watersheds. A power-law relationship between streamflow and flowing channel length during the recession period is derived based on the result.",

            "abstract": "Subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath North America played a key role in its tectonic development. Seismic constraints on the subducted remnants of the Farallon slab provide evidence needed to better understand the polarity and timing of subduction, the structure of the plate, and its relation to tectonic events like the uplift of the Rocky Mountains. Over the course of its deployment, the USArray Transportable Array (TA) has offered ideal data coverage for investigating the Farallon and related slabs in the upper mantle using seismic tomography and converted wave imaging. With its arrival in the east, data from the TA provides the crossing paths necessary to image the upper reaches of the oldest parts of the plate at mid-mantle depths.\nWe perform a global tomographic inversion using the latest P-wave traveltime picks from TA combined with global catalogue data. While the new velocity model resolves upper mantle slab structure at unprecedented detail in the east, a quantitative grasp of model uncertainty is needed to reliably relate velocity variations to the thermal and mechanical properties of the slabs. In order to quantify the uncertainty of our tomographic model, we employ Transdimensional Hierarchical Bayesian (THB) inversion. THB tomography uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to create an ensemble of velocity models that can be analyzed to statistically infer the best-fit velocities, their uncertainties, and tradeoffs.\nWe present and discuss various representations of uncertainty quantified by THB tomography—error bars, model covariance, multimodal distributions of velocity values—and demonstrate its importance for furthering our understanding of the slab fragments beneath North America. We illustrate how we are able to distinguish between spurious slab fragments from those required by the data. By examining bimodal velocity distributions, we put error bars on the spatial extent of the slabs that can then be analyzed using thermal diffusion modeling. By mapping out regions of high model covariance, we quantify smearing in the tomographic model, which allows us, for example, to assess the extent to which the deep slab fragments near the coasts are artifacts of data coverage. Preliminary results cast doubt on the interpretability of fast anomalies in the upper mantle off the west coast of the continent.",

            "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has become a popular tool for monitoring hydrologic processes. When monitoring infiltration, the thin wetted zone that occurs near the ground surface at early times may act as a dispersive waveguide. This low-velocity layer traps the GPR waves, causing specific frequencies of the signal to travel at different phase velocities, confounding standard traveltime analysis. In a previous numerical study we demonstrated the potential of dispersion analysis for estimating the depth distribution of waveguide water contents. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology when applying it to experimental time-lapse dispersive GPR data collected during a laboratory infiltration experiment in a relatively homogenous soil.\nA large sand-filled tank is equipped with an automated gantry to independently control the position of 1000 MHz source and receiver antennas. The system was programmed to repeatedly collect a common mid-point (CMP) profile at the center of the tank followed by two constant offset profiles (COP) in the x and y direction. Each collection was completed in 30 s and repeated 50 times during a 28 min experiment. Two minutes after the start of measurements, the surface of the sand was irrigated at a constant flux rate of 0.006 cm/sec for 23 minutes. Time-lapse COPs show increases in traveltime to reflectors in the tank associated with increasing water content, as well as the development of a wetting front reflection. From 4-10 min, the CMPs show a distinct shingling characteristic that is indicative of waveguide dispersion. Forward models where the waveguide is conceptualized as discrete layers and a piece-wise linear function were used to invert picked dispersion curves for waveguide properties. We show the results from both inversion approaches for multiple dispersive CMPs and show how the single layer model fails to represent the gradational nature of the wetting front.",

            "abstract": "Interpretation of compositional data from melt inclusions and their host requires that we understand the effects of the two main post-entrapment processes. First, the crystals grow from the melt inclusion at the time the host lava erupts and cools. Second, the melt inclusion and its host undergo diffusive re-equilibration. These processes have been well established for olivine in olivine-hosted melt inclusions (Danyushevsky et al., 2000; 2004). No similar study has been done for plagioclase-hosted inclusions. To better understand post entrapment crystallization in these crystals, we have conducted a set of time-series experiments on plagioclases in Plagioclase Ultraphyric Basalts (PUBs, Nielsen et al., 1995; 1998; 2011; Sours-Page et al., 2000; Lange et al., 2012; 2013). Plagioclase crystals were heated near the entrapment temperature (1200-1230°C) for 30 min, 1h, 4 h and 4 days. Based on the S content of the melt inclusions, ~80% of the melt inclusions retain their integrity with respect to S after homogenization. It is based on the assumption that S will degas if the inclusion has ruptured, that all S is present as S=, and that the melts are initially sulfide saturated. This is not true for the major element composition of the melt inclusions. For run times of 30 min to 4 hours, the melt inclusions do not show significant compositional changes. However, after 4 days, the average composition of the re-homogenized melt inclusions is shifted toward higher MgO values and lower Al2O3 concentrations regardless of run temperature. These results suggest that re-homogenization techniques held at high temperature for less than 4 hours will return information that is most relevant to the re-homogenization of the post-entrapment crystals. The long term “drift” of the major elements suggests that diffusive re-equilibration with the host crystal takes place at a rate that is too slow to be seen during typical re-homogenization times used (e.g. 20 min-2 hrs.).\nKey words: Plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions, PUBs, Time-series experiment",

The purpose of the experiment is to better understand the seismic behavior of plate boundaries and associated faults, and the source characteristics of earthquakes that result from the interaction and build-up of tectonic stress during earthquake cycles. The first phase of SeaJade was initiated in July 2010, with the deployment of 32 short-period ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) from JAMSTEC for 3 months and 10 broadband OBS’ from WHIO for one year. Phase II began in October 2013 with the deployment of 8 broadband seismometers in the Nootka Sound region of Vancouver Island, followed by the deployment of 35 OBS’ in December for 9 months with an observational emphasis on the Nootka fault zone between the Juan de Fuca plate and the Explorer plate. Using SeaJade I data, we have identified and located 1276 local earthquakes (including origin times, hypocentral locations and magnitudes), analyzed converted phases to constrain the locations and depths of seismic interfaces, and developed a seismic tomography model via joint hypocentral relocation and velocity model inversion. Preliminary results indicate that most seismic events were associated with the Nootka fault zone. At least two seismic interfaces within the Cascadia fore-arc could be identified. A comprehensive study of the Mw 6.6, April 24th 2014, Nootka earthquake sequence using the SeaJade II dataset is currently underway. Relocations of aftershocks confirms that the Nootka earthquake probably involved two seismogenic structures. In addition to the NE–SW Nootka fault zone, a NW–SE-striking fault within the Explorer subducted slab might also be involved in the rupture process.",

            "abstract": "Data Producers and Data Providers do not always collaborate to ensure that the data meets the needs of a broad range of user communities. User needs are not always considered in the beginning of the data production and delivery phases. Often data experts are required to explain or create custom output so that the data can be used by decision makers. Lack of documentation and quality information can result in poor user acceptance or data misinterpretation. This presentation will describe how new content integration tools have been created by NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to improve quality throughout the data management lifecycle.\nThe prototype integrates contents into a decision-making support tool from NOAA’s Observing System Integrated Assessment (NOSIA) Value Tree, NOAA’s Data Catalog/Digital Object Identifier (DOI) projects (collection-level metadata) and Data/Stewardship Maturity Matrices (Data and Stewardship Quality Rating Information). The National Centers for Environmental Information’s (NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN) dataset is used as a case study to formulate/develop the prototype tool and demonstrate its power with the content-centric approach in addition to completeness of metadata elements. This demonstrates the benefits of the prototype tool in both bottom roll-up and top roll-down fashion. The prototype tool delivers a standards based methodology that allows users to determine the quality and value of data that is fit for purpose. It encourages data producers and data providers/stewards to consider users’ needs prior to data creation and dissemination resulting in user driven data requirements increasing return on investment.",

            "abstract": "With rising concerns regarding the persistence of coral reefs through the 21st century, there is a crucial need to understand how these ecosystems will respond to future environmental deterioration (e.g. ocean warming, acidification, and decreased oxygenation). Several ancient events have been identified as good analogues for modern ecological changes, however, most of these correspond to mass extinction events. By studying carbon cycle perturbations that caused more minor ecosystem collapse, such as the Toarcian Ocean Anoxic Event (T-OAE), the key physiological, ecological, and environmental features that correlate with species and community survival can be assessed.\nThe Dinaric Carbonate Platform, which extends from northeastern Italy to northwestern Albania, is one of the few platforms in Europe that captures an almost continuous shallow-water record of Pliensbachian and Toarcian strata. Specifically, this comparatively poorly studied platform captures the T-OAE in shallow-water carbonates. One such outcrop on the Trnovski Gozd karst plateau in western Slovenia contains both Pleinsbachian lithiotid (bivalve) biostromes and coral bioherms (i.e. coral reefs). The occurrence of both lithiotid and coral buildups in one section is extremely rare and provides the opportunity to study the response of both communities, as well as the carbonate system as a whole, to the T-OAE. This research focuses on the lithology and chemostratigraphy from this locality, particularly identifying the T-OAE horizon more precisely. Additionally, (micro)facies analyses and paleontological analyses of the reefs themselves will be presented. These data will establish the paleoenvironmental conditions that favored reef growth in the Pliensbachian, as well as what conditions changed at the stage boundary and T-OAE to cause the collapse of the shallow-water carbonates and reef systems.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to understand the impacts on surface precipitation and mesoscale flow structures associated with ice and mixed-phase microphysical processes. Experiments are conducted in the NCAR Cloud Model 1 (CM1) using an idealized moist stable flow interacting with a Gaussian bell-shaped mountain. The control simulation uses a liquid-only (Kessler) scheme, while ice microphysics experiments are performed using two parameterizations available in CM1 (NASA-Goddard version of the Lin, Farley, Orville (LFO) scheme and the Morrison (MOR) scheme), which both contain three ice species: cloud ice, snow, and graupel/hail. LFO simulations produce flow structures that are comparable to the control run, but generate less precipitation. MOR simulations produce a completely different flow structure, exhibiting laminar flow downstream of the mountain while the LFO and control simulation produce a breaking wave and downslope windstorm. This results in a “double-peaked” precipitation distribution in MOR, with warm-rain processes seemingly dominating the first peak and melting of ice species contributing to the secondary peak. A change in the rimed ice species results in systematic differences in amount and location of precipitation received on the mountain slope. Overall, the choice of microphysics parameterization has a larger impact on the dynamical features and surface precipitation rates than the choice of rimed ice species (graupel vs. hail). These results were similarly found in simulations with different initial conditions. This presentation will focus on the microphysical processes leading to the substantial differences between the LFO and MOR experiments. ",

            "abstract": "The Reforma caldera is located at ~35 km to the northwest of Santa Rosalía in the central part of the Baja California peninsula. It has 10 km in diameter and a maximum height of 1200 masl in the center and between 100 and 500 masl in its slopes. Reforma is within a tectonic zone affected by two fault systems: A NW-SE normal fault system linked to the opening of the Gulf of California, and a NNW-SSE and NW-SE strike-slip fault system associated with an active Riedel system. Reforma was built upon Cretaceous granites that outcrop at the caldera center, Miocene to Pliocene volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Comondú group, and Miocene marine sediments of the Santa Rosalía basin. On top of these rocks outcrop at least four submarine to subaerial ignimbrites interbedded with marine fossiliferous beds and the lower Pleistocene deposits associated to the Reforma caldera. These deposits are formed by a ignimbrite that shifts to different lithofacies that change gradually their welding, here dubbed basal, transitional, intermediate, and upper (all of then enriched in black fiammes), followed by a pumice-rich, white fiammes, and vitrophyre lithofacies, which are distributed around the 9 km wide caldera and have been associated to the caldera formation episode. Deposits related to post-caldera volcanism are andesite-basaltic lava flows erupted along the caldera rim through localized feeding dikes and andesitic and rhyolitic domes, and scoria cinder cones exposed inside and outside the caldera. On top of these deposits rest the middle Pleistocene Aguajito caldera deposits.",

Here, we review the possible changes in hazard and vulnerability posed by future droughts as a result of anthropogenic global warming in the state of Texas. An ensemble of downscaled and bias corrected meteorological and hydrologic projections representing the future scenarios were used for drought analysis. Quantification of the risk posed by droughts was then performed by considering a composite Drought Risk Index (DRI). DRI consists of two components: (1) Drought Hazard expressed in terms of joint drought magnitude and frequency of occurrence, and (2) Drought Vulnerability which is expressed in terms of the potential indicators representing the future socio-economic scenario of the study region. A set of drought hazard, vulnerability, and composite risk maps were then developed. These maps serve as an aid to identify the regions vulnerable to droughts in future, thus helping in development of mitigation strategies. The results are expected to be relevant for effective water resources management in a consistently drought prone state like Texas.",

            "abstract": "In order to predict transport of solutes, upscaling techniques are often applied. After the amount of time it takes the solute to sample all of the velocities in the system, the upscaling process is well understood and fairly simple to implement. But in highly heterogeneous velocity fields, this amount of time may be prohibitively long. When there is a need to predict transport at earlier times, the upscaling process is more difficult because the solute tends to stay on or near its initial streamline, inducing a correlation between its average velocity over fixed distances (or times), which must be accounted for. A Spatial Markov model was developed in 2008 that does just that[1]. It accounts for the velocity correlation by treating the transport process as a Markov Chain. This model has been successfully applied to predict solute transport in a large variety of complicated flow fields and is becoming increasing popular. It almost seems as though it works for every situation, but so far no rigorous study has gone into determining its limitations.\nSo we have decided to take a step back and ask: when is this model valid? We understand the asymptotic behavior in the limit as t→ ∞, but what about in the limit as 1/t→ ∞ (or t→ 0)? Are the assumptions of the Spatial Markov model valid over all length (and time) scales? It turns out that the answer is no. At very early times, the transport process is diffusion dominated, leading to non-monotonic correlation between solute particles' average velocity over consecutive space and time steps. The assumptions of the Spatial Markov model only hold after this early diffusive regime ends and the correlation function peaks. We find the location of the peak in the correlation function for transport in simple stratified flows and show the effect of using the Spatial Markov model over length scales on either side of the peak.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.L.

            "abstract": "Absorption of solar radiation by aerosols plays a major role in radiative forcing and atmospheric photochemistry. Many atmospheric chemistry models tend to overestimate tropospheric OH concentrations compared to observations. Accurately representing aerosol absorption in the UV could help rectify the discrepancies between simulated and observed OH concentrations. We develop a simulation of the Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI), using the 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem coupled with the Vector Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer model (VLIDORT). The simulation is applied to interpret UVAI observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Simulated and observed values are highly consistent in regions where mineral dust dominates the UVAI, but a large negative bias (-0.4 to -1.0) exists between simulated and observed values in biomass burning regions. We implement optical properties for absorbing organic aerosol, known as brown carbon (BrC), into GEOS-Chem and evaluate the simulation with observed UVAI values over biomass burning regions. The spectral dependence of absorption after adding BrC to the model is broadly consistent with reported observations for biomass burning aerosol, with Absorbing Angstrom Exponent (AAE) values ranging from 2.7 in the UV to 1.3 across the UV-Near IR spectrum. The addition of absorbing BrC decreases the mean bias between simulated and OMI UVAI values from -0.60 to -0.08 over North Africa in January, from -0.40 to -0.003 over South Asia in April, from -1.0 to -0.24 over southern Africa in July, and from -0.50 to +0.34 over South America in September. We assess the effect of the additional UV absorption by BrC on atmospheric photochemistry by examining ozone photolysis frequencies (J(O(1D))) and tropospheric OH concentrations in GEOS-Chem. The inclusion of BrC decreases J(O(1D)) and OH by up to 35% over biomass burning regions, and reduces the global bias in OH.",

            "abstract": "During the past decades urbanization has proceeded at unprecedented – yet varied – rates across urban areas globally. The social and environmental transformations implied by urban development have put many regions at risk of transforming the very characteristics that make them attractive and healthy. Meanwhile, climate change is adding new sources of risk and an array of uncertainties to the mix. These changes create risks that vary according to the characteristics of the demographic, economic, ecological, built-environment (technological) and governance dimensions of urbanization and urban areas as socioecological systems.\nHowever, few studies have explored the variation in these dimensions across urban areas. I will present a comprehensive analytical framework that explores, in urban areas, patterns of interplay, synergy and tradeoff between socio-demographic, economic, technological, ecological, and governance (SETEG) factors as they shape two issues, traditionally analyzed by separate disciplinary domains: resource use and resilience to climate hazards. Three questions guide this effort:\n1) What indicators can be used to socio-demographic, economic, technological, ecological, and governance (SETEG) determinants of urban populations’ resource use and resilience to climate hazards?\n2) What indicators are important?\n3) What combinations (i.e., tradeoffs, synergies) of causal factors better explain urban populations’ resource use and resilience to hazards?\nThe interplay between these factors as they shape a population’s resource use and resilience is not exempted from synergies and tradeoffs that require careful analysis. Consider population density, a key indicator of urban form. Scholars have found that while more compact cities are more energy efficient and emit less GHG, heat stress is much worse in more compact cities. This begs the question of which combination of urban form factors need to be considered by urban planners when designing effective urban/environmental interventions. The framework, that builds on empirical work globally and in the cities of Buenos Aires, Mexico, Santiago and Mumbai, is intended to inform the design of more effective urban mitigation and adaptation policies.",

In the absence of such high resolution climate models we highlight the deficiencies of two relatively coarse spatial resolution CMIP5 models with respect to the warm western boundary current of the Gulf Stream. As a consequence it affects the coastal SST and the land-ocean contrast, affecting the rainy summer seasonal precipitation accumulation over peninsular Florida. We also show this through two sensitivity studies conducted with a regional coupled ocean atmosphere model with different bathymetries that dislocate and modulate the strength of the Gulf Stream that locally affects the SST in the two simulations. These studies show that a stronger and more easterly displaced Gulf Stream produces warmer coastal SST’s along the Atlantic coast of Florida that enhances the precipitation over peninsular Florida relative to the other regional climate model simulation.

            "abstract": "In the United States, men outnumber women in many science and engineering fields by nearly 3 to 1. In fields like physics or the geosciences, the gender gap can be even wider. Previous studies have identified the early college years as a critical point where many women exit STEM disciplines. An interdisciplinary team including experts in the geosciences, psychology, education, and STEM persistence have recently begun a 5-year project focused on understanding whether mentoring can increase the interest, persistence, and achievement of undergraduate women in the geosciences. The program focuses on mentoring first and second year female undergraduate students from three universities in Colorado and Wyoming and four universities in North and South Carolina. The mentoring program includes a weekend workshop, access to professional women across geoscience fields and both in-person and virtual peer networks. The first weekend workshops will be held in October 2015. We will present an overview of the major components and lessons learned from these workshops and showcase the web center, including the online peer-networking forum.",

            "abstract": "The positive impact of passive microwave observations of tropospheric temperature, water vapor and surface variables on short-term weather forecasts has been clearly demonstrated in recent forecast anomaly growth studies. The development of a fleet of such passive microwave sensors especially at V-band and higher frequencies in low earth orbit using 3U and 6U CubeSats could help accomplish the aforementioned objectives at low system cost and risk as well as provide for regularly updated radiometer technology. The University of Colorado’s 3U CubeSat, PolarCube is intended to serve as a demonstrator for such a fleet of passive sounders and imagers. PolarCube supports an eight channel, double sideband 118.7503 GHz passive microwave sounder. The mission is focused primarily on sounding in Arctic and Antarctic regions with the following key remote sensing science and engineering objectives: (i) Collect coincident tropospheric temperature profiles above sea ice, open polar ocean, and partially open areas to develop joint sea ice concentration and lower tropospheric temperature mapping capabilities in clear and cloudy atmospheric conditions. This goal will be accomplished in conjunction with data from existing passive microwave sensors operating at complementary bands; and (ii) Assess the capabilities of small passive microwave satellite sensors for environmental monitoring in support of the future development of inexpensive Earth Science missions.\nTo ensure fidelity of data from the instrument, the following goals are being achieved: (i) precise numerical analysis of the diffracted field produced by corrugated feed and spinning reflector antenna system to the determination of an optimal feed horn and reflector geometry such that the system efficiencies are maximized and precisely known (ii) precise calibration of the receiver by accurate characterization of the sensitivity of radiometer components to physical temperature variations (iii) retrieval of atmospheric temperature profiles and surface temperature in clear and cloudy air and initial comparison of obtained profiles with those retrieved from co-located space-borne instruments and sounding balloons in order to validate radiometer operation. The status of the instrument and spacecraft along with pre-launch testing will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The success and sustainability of an Enhance Gethermal System (EGS) reservoir depends strongly on the permeability of its fracture network. Several processes affect the permeability of the system, including thermo, hydro, mechanical and chemical processes. These processes interact with one another temporally and contribute to the evolution of permeability within an EGS reservoir during normal operation. This study attempts to experimentally investigate the fracture aperture evolution under coupled processes in EGS reservoir. Granite specimens extracted from the Barre Granite quarry (Barre, Vermont) were used in the experiments. The artificially fractured core rock specimens were scanned using X-Ray Micro- CT and steady-state flow-through experiments were performed on the fractured specimens using high pressure/temperature servo-hydraulic operated system (Autolab 1500). The rock specimens were subjected to 30 MPa of confining pressure and 5 MPa of static internal pore pressure and Temperature of 120 °C. After 24 hours of equilibration, the flow of deionized water was initiated through the artificial fracture at a rate of 0.000351 ml/min for 40 days, during which effluent samples were collected for ICP-MS analysis and fracture permeability was monitored using upstream and downstream pore pressures. Upon termination of the experiments, the core rocks were scanned again to investigate the changes in fracture aperture and dissolution/precipitation of minerals at different sections of the core rock. The experimental results demonstrated that fracture surface asperities initially prop the fracture open, but upon introduction to deionized water, the asperities dissolve and the fracture aperture closes, resulting in decreased permeability. In most experiments, fracture aperture decreased steadily with the presumed dissolution of fracture surface asperities up to 30 days and then a decrease of upstream pore pressure was observed, which might be explained by etching (dissolution paths) on the fracture surface, resulting in more direct routes for water flow and a reduction in upstream/downstream pressure differential. This was further investigated and confirmed by results of ICP-MS analysis on the influent/effluent solutions and comparing the pre and post-test CT images of the core specimens.",

            "abstract": "An abnormal wave event was observed between 23 and 27 June 2014 in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. First, sea level oscillations began in Ciutadella Inlet (Spain) after midnight of 22 June. The phenomena continued with observation of strong oscillations (up to 3 m wave height) in the Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea on 25-26 June. Finally, at noon on 27 June on a calm and sunny day, the abnormal waves suddenly struck coasts of Odessa with 1-2 m wave height injuring a number of people. This tsunami-like event which is called meteotsunami is generated by different types of meteorological disturbances such as atmospheric gravity waves, pressure jumps and squall lines and the significant consequences necessitates the research to understand, model and simulate such events accurately. Thus, using the 2014 event as a case study, the waves generated by the change of atmospheric pressure distribution is studied. A static water level drop due to high atmospheric pressure in a region and rise due to low atmospheric pressure in another region deform the water level throughout the entire sea area. To compute the sea level change, the relation between the pressure difference and change of water level from normal position (ζ=0.99ΔP) is used where ζ is the change of water level (cm) according to the pressure difference from normal pressure ΔP. This relation gives that 1 hPa (1millibar) depression in air pressure from normal water level position (under 1000millibar) creates almost 1 cm rise in mean sea level. The respective small amplitude long waves propagate along the sea which is continuously excited by the spatial and temporal changes of atmospheric pressure. And, the amplification becomes important to understand the occurrence of unexpected water level changes, especially near the coastal zone. In this study, this long wave propagation due to water surface deformation is modelled by solving nonlinear shallow water equations. The model results are compared with the 2014 event observations.\nThis research partly supported by TUBITAK Grant number 213M534 and the European Union FP7/2007-2013 program n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe).",

            "abstract": "We present the detected deformation and interpret the results in the light of ground-truth hydrological data, for the Thessaloniki-Giannitsa plain, the largest deltaic plain in Greece, encircled by Mounts Vermio, Paiko and Pieria. The contemporary morphology was gradually developed from the tectonic variations of the upper Pleistocene. The area has been subjected to many changes due to both natural causes and to human intervention. ERS-1, 2 and Envisat data provided from the European Space Agency were analysed to produce a time-series analysis based on Persistent Scatterer techniques. The mass processing of the 81 satellite images led to the creation of more than 250 Interferograms. The broader area of interest consists primarily of agricultural lands, leading to limited Interferometric coherence, and therefore careful Interferogram filtering and phase unwrapping of the input stack was crucial for reliable velocity generation. Our results show a strong deformation signal in regions of significant lifelines, as the railway and road network. Moreover, the satellite imagery revealed two significantly deforming sites: Kalochori and Sindos. The broader Kalochori region, the locus of the industrial activity of the city of Thessaloniki, is located below sea level. Both sites are suffering from land subsidence for more than 50 years, with several marine invasions reported in the past. Interestingly enough the two datasets -that represent two decades- show a reversed deformation pattern: The period in-between 1993 to 2000 is characterized by subsidence up to 34 mm/y, whereas from 2002 to 2010 there is an uplifting trend (more than 20 mm/yr). This result is crosschecked with hydrogeological data; the interpretation depicts that at Kalochori and Sindos the human factor (i.e. over pumping) is the dominant driver of these surface displacements. Although this was an assumption of previous studies, here we present for the first time, systematic proof that the detected uplift of the second decade acts as a rebound of the ground-water level.",

            "abstract": "Magnetospheric sawtooth events, first identified in the early 1990’s, are named for their characteristic appearance of multiple quasi-periodic intervals of slow decrease followed by sharp increase of proton energy fluxes in the geosynchronous region. The successive proton flux decrease-and-increase intervals have been interpreted as recurrences of stretching and dipolarization, respectively, of the nightside geomagnetic field [Reeves et al., 2003]. Due to their often-extended intervals with 2- 10 cycles, sawteeth occurrences are sometimes referred to as a magnetospheric mode [Henderson et al., 2006]. Studies over the past two decades of sawtooth events (both event and statistical) have yielded a wealth of information on the conditions for the onset and occurrence of sawtooth events, but the occurrences of sawtooth events during both storm and non-storm periods suggest that we still do not fully understand the true nature of sawtooth events [Cai et al., 2011]. In this study, we investigate the characteristic magnetospheric state conditions [Fung and Shao, 2008] associated with the beginning, during, and ending intervals of sawtooth events. Unlike previous studies of individual sawtooth event conditions, magnetospheric state conditions consider the combinations of both magnetospheric drivers (solar wind) and multiple geomagnetic responses. Our presentation will discuss the most probable conditions for a “sawtooth state” of the magnetosphere.\n",

Tropical Pacific SST and NA hydroclimate teleconnections have been explored in depth at regional-spatial scales. However, an understanding of how synoptic-climate controls impact western NA hydroclimate at fine-spatial resolutions over various seasons is needed, in order to improve our understanding of hydrologic variability within important headwaters. Seasonal hydroclimate teleconnections for western NA were explored using grid-point correlation analysis of the El Niño Southern Oscillation 3.4 (Niño3.4) index with monthly-mean geopotential height (500mb) time-series data provided by the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Global Reanalysis, and monthly-mean surface precipitation rate (kg/m^2/s), 2-m temperature, and omega (500mb) time series data provided by the NCEP/North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The resulting large-scale correlation patterns are consistent with previous research, but the increase in spatial resolution afforded by the NARR product shows distinct teleconnections in topographically complex watersheds in the intermountain U.S. west (IMW), with strongest teleconnections during the winter (DJF). These results have important implications for scarce water resources (e.g. significant DJF and MAM precipitation and temperature teleconnections within important western NA headwaters), and demonstrate the potential of fine-spatial resolution hydroclimate data, such as the NARR, to improve our understanding of western NA hydroclimate variability.",

            "abstract": "Wetland ecosystems are vital components of the carbon cycle containing an estimated 20-30% of the global soil carbon store. The Cedarburg Bog of southeastern Wisconsin boasts a myriad of wetland habitats including the southernmost string bog found in North America. The behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2) in these systems is the response of multiple interdependent variables that are, collectively, not well understood. Modeling this behavior in future climate scenarios requires detailed representation of such relationships within highly diverse environments. In 2014 a LI-COR 8100A automated soil gas flux system was installed in a hollow of the Cedarburg Bog string bog and collectively measured diffusive CO2 concentration and flux. Supplemental groundwater data, soil temperature, and weather data (temperature, pressure, precipitation, etc.) were also included to elucidate correlations between soil CO2 flux/CO2 concentration and external forces. In 2015 field data were complemented with soil moisture data and depth profile sampling of pore water chemistry and stable carbon isotopes from peat and gaseous media in order to discern the source and evolution of CO2 at depth.\nPreliminary LI-COR data analysis reveals distinct diurnal and seasonal trends; CO2 concentration builds overnight while flux increases during the day, both peaking in mid-summer. Flux events average 405 mg CO2/m2 per hour but reach over 31,800 mg CO2/m2 per hour in a single event and in several instances negative flux events are observed. Correlation significance also yields a wide array of strengths among variables. Initial δ13C data from gaseous CO2 infer, on average, a more positive δ13C signature in the atmosphere compared to the surface and shallow subsurface. Temporal trends of these parameters are similar to one another, becoming depleted in δ13C through time. Further interpretation of data trends will utilize the HYDRUS-1D model to quantify relationships under changing environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Parallel evenly-spaced strike-slip faults are prominent in the southern San Andreas fault system, as well as other settings along plate boundaries (e.g., the Alpine fault) and within continental interiors (e.g., the North Anatolian, central Asian, and northern Tibetan faults). In southern California, the parallel San Jacinto, Elsinore, Rose Canyon, and San Clemente faults to the west of the San Andreas are regularly spaced at ~40 km. In the Eastern California Shear Zone, east of the San Andreas, faults are spaced at ~15 km. These characteristic spacings provide unique mechanical constraints on how the faults interact. Despite the common occurrence of parallel strike-slip faults, the fundamental questions of how and why these fault systems form remain unanswered. We address this issue by using the stress shadow concept of Lachenbruch (1961)—developed to explain extensional joints by using the stress-free condition on the crack surface—to present a mechanical analysis of the formation of parallel strike-slip faults that relates fault spacing and brittle-crust thickness to fault strength, crustal strength, and the crustal stress state. We discuss three independent models: (1) a fracture mechanics model, (2) an empirical stress-rise function model embedded in a plastic medium, and (3) an elastic-plate model. The assumptions and predictions of these models are quantitatively tested using scaled analogue sandbox experiments that show that strike-slip fault spacing is linearly related to the brittle-crust thickness. We derive constraints on the mechanical properties of the southern San Andreas strike-slip faults and fault-bounded crust (e.g., local fault strength and crustal/regional stress) given the observed fault spacing and brittle-crust thickness, which is obtained by defining the base of the seismogenic zone with high-resolution earthquake data. Our models allow direct comparison of the parallel faults in the southern San Andreas system with other similar strike-slip fault systems, both on Earth and throughout the solar system (e.g., the Tiger Stripe Fractures on Enceladus).",

            "abstract": "The initiation of deep convection within a conditionally unstable atmosphere requires air parcels to reach their level of free convection, above which latent-heat release generates positive buoyancy. However, air parcels that satisfy this condition often fail to undergo deep ascent due to mitigating factors such as entrainment and adverse perturbation vertical pressure gradients. Recent studies suggest that the transition from shallow-to-deep convection may additionally require the formation of evaporative cold pools, a sufficient cloud-layer lapse rate, gradual moistening of the mid-troposphere through shallow-cumulus detrainment, and/or the fortuitous development of new cumuli through the remnants of their predecessors. In this study, we use cloud-resolving simulations of cumulus convection over an idealized surface-based convergence zone to study the mechanisms and sensitivities of deep-convection initiation forced by mesoscale ascent. The surface convergence forms in response to a localized diurnal heating anomaly over an otherwise homogenous and unheated surface, producing an organized boundary-layer updraft with a maximal amplitude of around 3 m/s over the center of the heat source. It gives rise to a line of cumuli that gradually deepens and, in some cases, transitions into deep convection. Detailed analysis of the simulations reveals several notable aspects of cumulus evolution, including that its vertical development is not uniquely determined by the combination of surface forcing and surface-based convective inhibition (CIN), as some have suggested. In addition, the specific mechanism by which deep convection first develops is sensitive to the environmental conditions, which implies that no single mechanism always explains the shallow-to-deep transition. For example, with a thermal tracking algorithm developed for the purpose, it can be shown that, in a marginally unstable atmosphere, the total water perturbation induced locally by decaying cumuli has an effect in helping the following thermal to transition to deep convection.",

            "abstract": "Transformations between Fe(II) and Fe(III) in ferruginous clay minerals significantly impact the physicochemical properties of soils and sediments, such as the ion exchange capacity and redox potential. An increasing number of studies have focused on clay minerals that undergo redox changes, however, none have so far addressed Fe isotope fractionation during these processes. In this study, Fe isotope fractionations were determined during microbial reduction of Fe(III) in nontronite NAu-2 with different concentrations of lactate. No secondary Fe-bearing minerals, including Fe oxides, were detected by SEM in over 100 days of incubation, suggesting that the measured fractionations only reflected the net isotope effect associated with the clay minerals. The initial reduction likely started from edge sites, and the reductive dissolution released aqueous Fe(II). Basal plane sorbed Fe(II) was detectable after the extent of Fe reduction exceeded 5% and extensive electron transfer and isotope exchange had occurred between basal plane sorbed Fe(II) and structural Fe(III). With lower concentrations of the lactate(40 mM), the maximum Fe isotope fractionation was larger (∆56Febasal Fe(II)-structure Fe(III)= -4.37‰), consistent with greater adsorption than in systems with more lactate. After the Fe in reactive sites was all reduced, isotope exchange between Fe(II) and structural Fe(III) was inhibited due to blockage of electron transfer pathways by the collapse of the clay layers. The results agree with another study in our group on microbial reduction of NAu-1, despite both the smaller extent of reduction (~10% vs. 22% max bioreduction for NAu-1 and NAu-2, respectively) and smaller isotope fractionation factor than for NAu-2. We speculate that tetrahedral Fe in NAu-2 may have accelerated the electron transfer between Fe atoms, thus inducing a higher extent of reduction and a larger Fe isotope fractionation compared to NAu-1.",

            "abstract": "Warm season convection associated with the North American Monsoon (NAM) provides an important source of precipitation for much of the Southwest Contiguous US (CONUS) and Northwest Mexico. Convection associated with the NAM can also result in flash flooding, a hazard to metropolitan areas such as Tucson and Phoenix, as well as rural areas where washouts of main roads can sever critical transportation infrastructure. In order to mitigate the effects of this problem, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Water Center (NWC) is developing a national distributed hydrologic model using the WRF-Hydro framework with forcing from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) mesoscale atmospheric model. We aim to improve this National hydrologic and atmospheric modeling framework through the calibration of the WRF-Hydro model for the southwest CONUS and the optimization of planetary boundary layer and cloud microphysics schemes for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in the same region. The WRF-Hydro model, with a similar structure as the national configuration used by the NWC, has been set up for the Gila River basin in southern Arizona. We demonstrate the utility of the model for forecasting high impact precipitation events in catchments with limited human modification. The WRF-Hydro model is spun up using past precipitation from the NCEP Stage-IV records and TRMM estimates. Atmospheric forcing for WRF-Hydro comes from the NASA Phase 2 North American Land Data Assimilation (NLDAS-2) dataset. WRF-Hydro is forced for selected high-impact events using a 3-km grid resolution Advanced Research WRF (WRF-ARW) atmospheric simulation. WRF-ARW is forced with the operational National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System (GFS) operational model. This methodology demonstrates the modeling framework that will be used for future parameter calibration of WRF-Hydro and optimization of WRF-ARW.",

            "abstract": "Most people in East Africa depend on rainfed agriculture. Rainfall in the region has been decreasing recently and is highly variable in space and time leading to high food insecurity. A comprehensive understanding of the regional cropland dynamics is therefore needed. Land surface phenology and land surface seasonality have important roles in monitoring cropland dynamics in a region with sparse coverage of in situ climatic and biophysical observations. However, commonly used optical satellite data are often degraded by cloud cover, aerosols, and dust and they are restricted to daytime observations. Here we used near-daily passive microwave (PM) data at 25 km spatial resolution from a series of microwave radiometers—AMSR-E, FengYun3B/MWRI, AMSR2—to study cropland dynamics for 2003-2013 in three important grain production areas of East Africa: Ethiopia, Tanzania, and South Sudan. PM data can be collected through clouds and at night. Based on Google Earth imagery, we identified several cropland areas corresponding to PM grid cells. Rainfall from TRMM and atmospheric water vapor (V) from PM data displayed temporal patterns that were unimodal in Ethiopia and South Sudan, but bimodal in Tanzania. We fitted convex quadratic models to link growing season increments of V and vegetation optical depth (VOD) to accumulated V (AV). The models yielded high coefficients of determination (r2 ≥0.8) and phenometrics calculated from the parameter coefficients. Peak rainfall lagged peak V, but preceded peak VOD. Growing degree-days (GDD), calculated from the PM air temperature data, displayed a weaker bimodal seasonality in which the lowest values occurred during the peak rainy season, due to the cooling effect of latent heat flux and coupled with higher reflection of insolation by the cloud deck. V as a function of GDD displays quasi-periodic behavior. Drier sites in the region displayed larger (smaller) intra-annual dynamic range of V (GDD) compared to the moister sites.",

            "abstract": "Accurate observations of atmospheric CO2 with a space-based lidar system, such as for the NASA ASCENDS mission, will improve knowledge of global CO2 distribution and variability and increase the confidence in predictions of future climate changes. To prepare for the ASCENDS mission, the NASA Langley Research Center and Exelis Inc. (now part of Harris Corp.) have been collaborating in the development and evaluation of an Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave (IM-CW) lidar approach for measuring atmospheric CO2 from space. Two airborne IM-CW lidars operating in the 1.57-mm CO2 absorption band have been developed and flight tested to demonstrate precise atmospheric CO2 column measurements. A total of 14 flight campaigns have been conducted with the two lidar and in-situ CO2 measurement systems.\nSignificant atmospheric CO2 variations on various spatiotemporal scales were observed during these campaigns. For example, around 10-ppm CO2 changes were found within free troposphere in a region of about 200×300 km2 over Iowa during a summer 2014 flight. Even over extended forests, about 2-ppm CO2 column variability was measured within about 500-km distance. For winter times, especially over snow covered ground, relatively less horizontal CO2 variability was observed, likely owing to minimal interactions between the atmosphere and land surface. Inter-annual variations of CO2 drawdown over cornfields in the Mid-West were found to be larger than 5 ppm due to slight differences in the corn growing phase and meteorological conditions even in the same time period of a year. Furthermore, considerable differences in atmospheric CO2 profiles were found during winter and summer campaigns. In the winter CO2 was found to decrease from about 400 ppm in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) to about 392 ppm above 10 km, while in the summer CO2 increased from 386 ppm in the ABL to about 396 ppm in free troposphere. These and other CO2 observations are discussed in this presentation.",

Here, the predictions of Innu-Laur15 are compared to observations and other GIA models over an extended region comprising much of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. GIA predictions are made using compressible Maxwell Earth models with gravitationally self-consistent ocean loading, changing coastlines, and ocean-water inundation where marine ice retreats or floats. For this study, GPS time series are the NA12 solution (Blewitt et al., 2013) downloaded from\nhttp://geodesy.unr.edu/NGLStationPages/GlobalStationList\nand fit with a linear trend, annual and semi-annual terms, and offsets as indicated by station logs and by inspection of the time series. For example, a comparison of GPS observations of vertical crustal motion from the NA12 solution at 360 sites gives root-mean-square (RMS) residuals of 3.2 mm/yr (null hypothesis), 1.8 mm/yr (Innu-Laur15), and 2.9 mm/yr (ICE-5G) for the VM5a Earth model. Preliminary comparisons with other Earth models give similar patterns where Innu-Laur15 provides a better fit than ICE-5G. Further adjustments to the Innu-Laur15 ice sheet history could improve the fit to GPS rates in other regions of North America.",

To explore the effects with more realism, data‐derived distribution functions were used to develop a drop­‐by-drop rain event simulation. Data based probability distributions for the number of raindrop arrivals in each sample and the event averaged drop size distribution were found using measurements of several precipitation events recorded by a two dimensional video disdrometer. Using these probability distribution functions, Monte-Carlo simulated rain events were developed and explored. The simulated events were sampled at intervals of several different durations associated with different average numbers of raindrops in each sample.

            "abstract": "Precipitation gauge undercatch is a serious problem in the context of using observed meteorological data sets for hydrologic modeling studies in regions with cold winters, such as the Midwest. Attention to this matter is urgently needed to support hydroclimatological research efforts in the region. To support hydrologic modeling studies, a new hybrid gridded meteorological dataset at 1/16 degree resolution based on data from CO-OP station records, the U. S. Historical Climatology Network, the Historical Canadian Climate Database, and Precipitation Regression on Independent Slopes Method has been assembled over the Great Lakes and Midwest regions from 1915-2013 at daily time step. Preliminary hydrologic simulations results using the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrology model with this hybrid gridded meteorological dataset showed that precipitation gauge undercatch was a very significant issue throughout the region, especially for winter snowfall and simulated streamflow, which were both grossly underpredicted. Correction of primary CO-OP station data is generally infeasible due to missing station meta data and lack of local-scale wind speed measurements. Instead, macro-scale post processing techniques were developed to adjust the regridded precipitation product from CO-OP station records from 1950-2013 forwards, accounting for undercatch as a function of regridded wind speed simulations obtained from NCAR Reanalysis. Comparisons of simulated and observed streamflow over seven river basins in the Midwest were used to evaluate the datasets constructed using different combinations of meteorological station inputs, with and without undercatch corrections. The comparisons show promise in producing corrected precipitation data sets from 1950-2013 for hydrologic modeling studies, with substantial improvements in streamflow simulation from the uncalibrated VIC model when gauge undercatch corrections are included.",

East-Timor and the Nusa Tenggara Timur region of Indonesia provide a unique setting to study a young arc-continent collision (~8 Ma) and incipient orogenesis. The NSF funded Banda Arc project affords a rare opportunity to investigate unconstrained processes such as active continental subduction and slab rupture beneath a regional deployment of broadband seismometers. We use data from 35 broadband sensors to analyze seismic anisotropy through measuring shear wave splitting. These stations span the roughly east-west transition from normal oceanic subduction at the Sunda Arc to collision at the Banda Arc, and cross areas associated with back-arc thrusting, arc volcanism, extinct volcanism and a rapidly exhuming forearc. Thirty of the sensors used in the analysis are temporary stations installed by our research team in 2014 and will remain in the field until 2016 or later. The remaining stations are part of the open-access GFZ GEOFON global seismic network. We present preliminary shear wave splitting results for teleseismic (*KS core phases) and local (direct S phase) arrivals in order to inspect the sub-slab mantle and the supra-slab mantle wedge for anisotropic patterns related to olivine flow fabric. These results can be used to assess regional strain linked to ongoing collision and may elucidate any slab tearing that has resulted from the (partial) subduction of buoyant continental material of Australian affinity. Presently, we observe a trend of primarily trench-parallel sub-slab fast polarization directions and perhaps more complicated anisotropy in the mantle wedge. Relative to the trench, there appears to be more spatial variation in fast axis orientation for direct arrivals than teleseismic phases. We discuss how the interpretation of our initial results provides insight into the mantle dynamics of the Banda collision.",

            "abstract": "The mainly igneous continents have intermediate mean SiO2 (~60 wt%) and Mg# (0.4-0.55 mol). Bowen championed crystallization-differentiation of basalts to silicic daughter liquids, but he encountered difficulties with conflicting evidence for iron enrichment. We now know that as dry reduced basalts crystallize, melt SiO2 begins climbing steeply at F (melt fraction): 0.25-0.35, reaching intermediate values at F: 0.1-0.2. H2O changes basalt crystallization by (1) increasing the ratio of olivine to high-Ca pyroxene, (2) delaying onset and reducing the proportion of plagioclase, (3) stabilizing calcic plagioclase, (4) destabilizing low-Ca pyroxene, (5) eventually stabilizing amphibole, and (6) destabilizing silicate minerals more than magnetite. Factors 1-5 enrich melts early in SiO2, 6 limits decline of Mg#. H2O of 2-6 wt% is sufficient for early SiO2 enrichment; fO2 modestly above Ni-NiO yields daughter liquids with high (calc-alkaline) Mg#s. These values are matched by many natural subduction zone magmas, so seemingly, the problem is solved.\nYet, difficulties remain: Melt SiO2 enrichment commences at F: 0.6-0.7 in experiments on hydrous Mg basalts, reaching intermediate SiO2 at F: 0.2-0.4. Cumulates 60-80% of the basalt mass must have returned to the mantle if basalt differentiation formed the continents. Differentiation mainly near the base of the crust has geologic support, and would aid disposal of cumulates, but most experiments on hydrous basalts at such pressures yield peraluminous andesitic liquids, unlike common metaluminous andesites. A composite scenario avoiding peraluminous intermediates is crystallization-differentiation plus mixing with silicic liquids mainly residual or remelted from shortly antecedent intrusions. Even in this case, cumulates and restites exceeding the continental mass must have been lost. The Archean was different: Residual-eclogite-sourced granitoids are widespread, but experiments on hydrous eclogites at plausible temperatures yield melts with SiO2 too high and Mg# too low. Reaction of such melts with peridotite is a likely solution, but must concur with the somewhat heavy oxygen in zircons from many Archean plutons. If the heavy oxygen derives from slab alteration, it provides a limiting measure of peridotite reaction.",

            "abstract": "A podcast is an audio program distributed online typically freely available through an RSS feed (essentially an on-demand internet radio show). This medium has grown steadily in listenership and popularity since its inception in the early 2000s, especially thanks to popular distribution platforms such as iTunes, and web-enabled listening devices (i.e. smart phones). In terms of science reporting, many high impact journals now produce podcasts to supplement their publications (e.g. Nature, Science, etc.). However, smaller and/or more specialized journals often can’t afford to promote their content via podcasts, thus limiting their authors to rely on traditional media and press releases supplied by their colleges and universities. This is where independent or unaffiliated podcasts can fill an open niche: providing a platform for scientists to discuss their research in their own words aimed at a general audience. Traditional press releases often follow a similar pattern, and many science news outlets essentially report the press releases verbatim with little additional content or reporting from primary sources. Podcasts suffer from no such restrictions, and they can be as long and in-depth as the subject matter necessitates. Furthermore, many news outlets no longer employ dedicated science reporters. Science is covered, if at all, by reporters without specialized scientific knowledge or training. This deficit leads to a much higher potential for science news stories to be incorrectly reported, or misinterpreted by the general public. A podcast allows a lab group or department the opportunity to edit the content for brevity and clarity, affording scientists a better chance of getting their research presented to the public in an accurate and representative way. Finally, podcasts allow the public to hear the voice of the scientist, humanizing the hard work they do, and potentially positively influencing the way the public reacts to science as a discipline.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that increases in sulfate aerosol over what is typical of the background state causes shallow boundary layer clouds to become brighter and precipitate less efficiently. However, it has been difficult to separate these effects from other mitigating factors that may control both cloud properties and aerosol simultaneously. Mount Kilauea on the island of Hawaii began erupting episodically in 2008 injecting large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the marine boundary layer. Typical peaks in sulfur dioxide injection lasted a few days followed by periods of relative quiet. This somewhat random injection of sulfur dioxide was, of course, independent of changes in the meteorology creating an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the influence of sulfate aerosols on warm shallow marine clouds. Dividing the SO2 injection rate into 3-day lagged quartiles, we conduct a statistical analysis of A-Train data to examine the effects of SO2 on cloud properties. As expected, the clouds brighten in the visible and show measurable decreases in column integrated radar reflectivity. However, these changes were subtle. Surprisingly, we find the strongest response in cloud depth. From the lowest SO2 quartile to the highest, we find that cloud top decreases from 1.75 km to 1.5 km on average. This change in cloud top is accompanied by near constant microwave brightness temperature and a decrease in cloud fraction. We speculate that the decrease in cloud top is the result of enhanced entrainment and/or a reduction in updraft speed due to fewer and weaker precipitation induced cold pools. In any case, it is clear that the response of these clouds to variable sulfate aerosol is more complicated than the simple aerosol indirect effects commonly invoked.",

            "abstract": "A snowfall rate (SFR) algorithm has been developed for the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) aboard S-NPP and future JPSS satellites. The product is based on the NOAA/NESDIS operational Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) SFR but with several key advancements. The algorithm has benefited from continuous development to improve accuracy and snowfall detection efficiency. The enhancements also expand the applicable temperature range for the algorithm and allow significantly more snowfall to be detected than the operational SFR. Another major improvement is the drastically reduced product latency by using Direct Broadcast (DB) data. The new developments have also been implemented in the MHS SFR to ensure product consistency across satellites.\nCurrently, there are five satellites that carry either ATMS or MHS: S-NPP, NOAA-18/-19 and Metop-A/-B. The combined satellites deliver up to ten SFR estimates a day at any location over land in mid-latitudes. The product provides much needed winter precipitation estimates for applications such as weather forecasting and hydrology. Both ATMS and MHS SFR serve as input to a global precipitation analysis product, the NOAA/NCEP CMORPH-Snow. SFR is the sole satellite-based snowfall estimates in the blended product. In addition, ATMS and MHS SFR was assessed at several NWS Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and NESDIS/Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) for its operational values in winter 2015. This is a joint effort among NASA/SPoRT, NOAA/NESDIS, University of Maryland/CICS, and the WFOs. The feedback from the assessment indicated that SFR provides useful information for snowfall forecast. It is especially valuable for areas with poor radar coverage and ground observations. The feedback also identified some limitations of the product such as inadequate detection of shallow snowfall. The algorithm developers will continue to improve product quality as well as developing SFR for new microwave sensors and over ocean in a project supported by the JPSS Proving Ground and Risk Reduction Program. The outcome of the new project is expected to considerably increase the value of the SFR product in operations.",

            "abstract": "Magnetospheric substorms are events in which energy stored in the magnetotail is released into the auroral zone and into the downstream solar wind. Because of the complex, nonlinear, and possibly chaotic nature of the substorm energy release mechanism, it may be extremely difficult to forecast individual substorms in the near term. However, the inter-substorm timing (the amount of time elapsed between substorms) can be reproduced in a statistical sense, as was demonstrated by Freeman and Morley (2004) using their Minimal Substorm Model (MSM), a simple solar-wind driven model with the only free parameter being a recurrence time.\nThe goal of the present work is to reproduce the observed distribution of inter-substorm timings with a global MHD model. The period of 1-31 January 2005 was simulated using the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), driven by solar wind observations. Substorms were identified in the model output by synthesizing surface magnetometer data and by looking for tailward-moving plasmoids.\nSubstorms identified in the MHD model are then compared with observational data from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) geostationary satellite energetic particle data, and surface magnetometer data.\nFor each dataset (MHD model and observations), we calculate the substorm occurrence rate, and for the MHD model we additionally calculate the timing error of the substorm onsets relative to the observed substorms. Finally, we calculate distribution functions for the inter-substorm timings in both the observations and the model. The results of this analysis will guide improvements to the MHD-based substorm model, including the use of Hall MHD and embedded particle in cell (EPIC), leading to a better reproduction of the observed inter-substorm timings and an improved understanding of the underlying physical processes.\n",

            "abstract": "The 3-D Mars multi-fluid BATS-R-US MHD code is used to study the solar wind interaction with the Martian upper atmosphere during the 2015 March 8th interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We studied four steady-state cases, corresponding to three major ICME phases: pre-ICME phase (Case 1), sheath phase (Cases 2--3), and ejecta phase (Case 4). Detailed data-model comparisons demonstrate that the simulation results are in good agreement with Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) measurements, indicating that the multi-fluid MHD model can reproduce most of the features observed by MAVEN, thus providing confidence in the estimate of ion escape rates from its calculation. The total ion escape rate is increased by an order of magnitude, from 2.05×1024 s-1 (pre-ICME phase) to 2.25×1025 s-1 (ICME sheath phase), during this time period. The calculated ion escape rates were used to examine the relative importance of the two major ion loss channels from the planet: energetic pickup ion loss through the dayside plume and cold ionospheric ion loss through the nightside plasma wake region. We found that the energetic pickup ions escaping from the dayside plume could be as much as ~23% of the total ion loss prior to the ICME arrival. Interestingly, the tailward ion escape rate is significantly increased at the ejecta phase, leading to a reduction of the dayside ion escape to ~5% of the total ion loss. Under such circumstance, the cold ionospheric ions escaping from the plasma wake comprise the majority of the ion loss from the planet. Furthermore, by comparing four simulation results along the same MAVEN orbit, we note that there is no significant variation in the Martian lower ionosphere. Finally, both bow shock and magnetic pileup boundary (BS, MPB) locations are decreased from (1.2 RMars, 1.57 RMars) at the pre-ICME phase to (1.16 RMars, 1.47 RMars) respectively during the sheath phase along the dayside Sun-Mars line.\nMAVEN has provided a great opportunity to study the evolution of the Martian atmosphere and climate over its history. A large quantity of useful data has been returned for future studies. These kinds of data-model comparisons can help the community to better understand the Martian upper atmosphere response to the (extreme) variation in the solar wind and its interplanetary environment from a global perspective.",

Effective design and implementation of enhanced recovery techniques such as miscible gas flooding and hydraulic fracturing requires modeling and simulation of these coupled proceses in geologic porous media. We develop a computational framework to model the coupled processes of flow, transport, and deformation in heterogeneous fractured rock. We show that the hydrocarbon recovery efficiency during unstable displacement of a more viscous oil with a less viscous fluid in a fractured medium depends on the mechanical state of the medium, which evolves due to permeability alteration within and around fractures.

            "abstract": "The better quality of forecasts is given the more accurate of the initial conditions. Data assimilation (DA) is the process by which short-forecast and observations are combined to obtain an accurate representation of the state of the modeled system, e.g. is a technique to generate an initial condition to a weather forecasts. This paper shows the results of a DA technique using artificial neural networks (NN) to obtain the analysis to the atmospheric model for the Florida State University. The Local Ensemble Transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is implemented with Florida State University Global Spectral Model (FSUGSM). The ANN data assimilation is made to emulate the initial condition from LETKF to run the FSUGSM. LETKF is a version of Kalman filter with Monte-Carlo ensembles of short-term forecasts to solve the data assimilation problem. The model FSUGSM is a multilevel spectral primitive equation model with vertical sigma coordinates, at resolution T63L27. The data assimilation experiments are based in simulated observations data and FSUGSM 6-hours forecasts. For the NN data assimilation, we use Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with supervised training algorithm where NN receives input vectors with their corresponding response from LETKF data assimilation. The surface pressure, absolute temperature, zonal component wind, meridional component wind and humidity results are presented. A self-configuration method finds the optimal NN and configures a set of 52 MLPs to DA experiment, referred as MLP-DA. A methodology developed with self-configuration using a meta-heuristic called the Multiple Particle Collision Algorithm to compute the optimal topology for NN. The MLP presents four input nodes, two nodes coordinates vector, one for the 6-hours forecast vector and one node for observation vector; one output node for the analysis vector results. The vector represents the values for one grid model point. The ANNs were trained with data from each month of 2001, 2002, and 2003. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLP-DA for atmospheric data assimilation, with similar quality to LETKF analyses. An experiment for data assimilation cycle using MLP-DA was performed with simulated observations for January of 2004. The major advantage of using MLP-DA is the computational performance, which is faster than LETKF.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the bi-directional reflectance function (BRDF) and spectral albedo of various land-cover types is critical for retrieval of trace gas measurements from planned geostationary satellites such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO). Radiant energy, which will be measured by these instruments at the top of atmosphere (TOA) at unprecedented spectral resolution, is strongly influenced by how this energy is reflected by the underlying surface. Thus, it is critical that we understand this phenomenon at comparable wavelength resolution. As part of the NASA ESTO-funded Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization (GeoTASO) development project, we carried out synchronous field and airborne data collection campaigns in the St Louis Metro region in Summer 2014. We collected spectral reflectance data of various land cover types on the ground within hours of a GeoTASO overpass using a field-based hyperspectral spectroradiometer (model PSR3500 from Spectral Evolution). Field measurements collecting in-situ spectral albedo and bidirectional reflectance factors were also obtained in July and August of 2015. In this study, we present our preliminary findings from in-situ and airborne GeoTASO derived spectral albedo and BRDF characteristics of major land cover types at TEMPO spectral profiles, which are necessary for the accurate retrieval of tropospheric trace gases and aerosols. First, a spectral database of various targets (e.g., plants, soils, rocks, man-made objects and water) was developed using field measurements. Next, the GeoTASO airborne data were corrected using MODTRAN and field measurements to derive spectral albedo and BRDF. High spatial resolution land-cover types were extracted using satellite images (e.g., Landsat, WorldView, IKONOS, etc.) at resolutions from 2 m - 30 m. Lastly, spectral albedo/BRDFs corresponding to various land cover types were analyzed using both field and GeoTASO measurements.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity has been proposed as an important concept for understanding local processes in the context of catchment hydrology and can be defined as flow path continuity in surface and subsurface flow. It can also provide a missing linkage for preferential flow inferred from unexpected water and chemical migration, which cannot be accounted for completely through the current process-based hydrological models. Thus, we developed a hydrologic connectivity algorithm based on various physical controls to understand better spatially distributed subsurface flow and improve the parameterization scheme in hydrological modeling. The hydrologic connectivity is often dynamic because subsurface flow patterns across a domain could be connected or disconnected seasonally or depending on rainfall event or duration. In this study, we derived the dynamic connectivity using various physical controls (e.g., rainfall intensity and duration, surface and bedrock topography, soil, vegetation, and soil wetness patterns) through a multivariate linear function. The physically based hydrologic connectivity was also applied in model parameterization schemes to improve the prediction of subsurface flow in modeling. This proposed approach was tested at a watershed scale (Little Washita watershed) and showed better results to predict spatially distributed subsurface flow with an improvement of modeling capability.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model to find flexible decision variables (e.g., turbine flows) in reservoir operation. Flexible decision variables could give the decision maker a range of options instead of single deterministic optimal solutions. In our formulation, each decision variable is modeled by a random variable, and the eventual decision will be but one realization. The optimal probability distribution is found by maximizing the expected value of the objective. Finding flexible decision variables can be computationally intensive especially for multi-reservoir systems. To increase the computational speed of the optimization, a dimension reduction method is used, namely the Karhunen Loe`ve (KL) expansion. KL expansion is closely related to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and can be used to efficiently represent the random processes by only a few random variables. When using this method, deterministic optimal Pareto solutions are used as the initial population for the optimization. The Grand Coulee reservoir, located in the Columbia River, is used as the test case. The results show that the decision space can be represented with very few random variables and the computational time can therefore be drastically reduced.",

            "abstract": "Recent geodynamic modeling studies suggest that the exhumation of the high pressure and the very/ultra high-pressure crustal rocks may occur due to the slab detachment (break-off), slab roll-back (retreat) and the buoyancy-flow controlled subduction channel. We use convective removal (Rayleigh-Taylor, ‘dripping’ instability) mechanism to quantitatively investigate the burial and the exhumation pattern of the lower/middle crustal rocks from ocean subduction to post-collisional geodynamic configuration. In order to address the model evolution and track crustal particles for deciphering P-T-t variation, we conduct a series of thermo-mechanical numerical experiments with arbitrary Eularian-Lagrangian finite element code (SOPALE). We show how additional model parameters (e.g moho temperature, upper-middle crustal activation energy, density contrast between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle) can effectively influence the burial and exhumation depths, rate and the styles (e.g clockwise or counterclockwise). First series of experiments are designed to investigate the exhumation of crustal rocks at 32 km depth for only post-collisional tectonic setting -where pre-existing ocean subduction has not been implemented-. Model predictions show that a max. 8 km lower crustal burial occurs concurrent with the lower crustal convergence as a response to the mantle lithosphere dripping instability. The subsequent exhumation of these rocks up to -25 km- is predicted at an exhumation rate of 1.24 cm/year controlled by the removal of the underlying mantle lithosphere instability with crustal extension. At the second series of experiments, we tracked the burial and exhumation history of crustal particles at 22 and 31 km depths while pre-existing ocean subduction has been included before the continental collision. Model results show that burial depths down to 62 km occurs and nearly the 32 km of exhumation is predicted again by the removal of the mantle lithosphere after the dripping instability but the crustal rocks are buried deeper because of the downward forcing of the sinking ocean plate. We suggest that the first set of model results are comparable to the peak pressure calculations from the high pressure rocks of the Afyon Zone in western Turkey with a significant offset (175°C) in temperature values.",

            "abstract": "Recent severe haze events in China have attracted significant public attention due to the severely reduced visibility and unprecedentedly high pollutant concentrations. Particular attention has been given to the high concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), which can exceed several hundred micrograms per cubic meter over several days. During January and February of 2015, a suite of aerosol instruments was deployed in Beijing to directly measure a comprehensive set of aerosol properties, including the particle size distribution, effective density, and chemical composition. In this presentation, we will discuss the particulate matter formation mechanisms, the evolution of aerosol properties throughout the event, and how the winter formation mechanisms compare with the warmer seasons. We show that the periodic cycles of severe haze episodes in Beijing are largely driven by meteorological conditions. During haze events, stagnation typically develops as a result of a low planetary boundary layer and weak southerly wind from polluted industrial source regions. Stronger northerly winds were frequently observed during the clean period, which carry unpolluted air masses from the less populated northern mountainous areas. Nucleation consistently occurs on clean days, producing a high number concentration of nano particles. The particle mass concentration exceeding several hundred micrograms per cubic meter is attributed to the continuous size growth from the nucleation-mode particles (diameter less than 10 nm) over multiple days to produce a high concentration of larger particles (diameter greater than 100 nm). The particle chemical composition in Beijing is similar to those commonly measured in other urban centers, which is indicative of chemical constituents dominated by secondary aerosol formation. Our results reveal that the severe haze formation in Beijing during the wintertime is similar to the mechanism of haze formation during the warmer months and is likely attributable the high concentration of aerosol precursor gases and the stagnation caused by the large-scale meteorological conditions.",

            "abstract": "India is predicted to be one of the most vulnerable regions in terms of agricultural sensitivity to future climate changes. Approximately 69% of India’s population is rural, and over 55% of the working population relies on agriculture for sustenance and livelihoods. Indian smallholder farmers who own less than 2 ha of farmland represent 78% of the total Indian farmers and produce 41% of the country’s food crops. These smallholder farmers are among some of the most vulnerable communities to climatic and economic changes due to limited access to technology, infrastructure, markets, and institutional or financial support in the case of adverse climatic events. Baseline information on agricultural sensitivity to climate variability will provide useful information for regional-level, and eventually state- and national-level, strategies and policies that promote adaption to climate variability.\nWe use a decade of remote sensing analysis of cropping patterns and climatic factors along with census data for irrigation and demographic factors to understand winter cropping trajectories across agro-ecological zones in India. Findings from multiple agro-ecological zones indicate that there are three primary trajectories in winter cropping in India – increasing, fluctuating, and decreasing. In the Central Indian Highlands, for example, the most dominant trend is that of fluctuating cropped area, ranging between ~37,300 km2 in 2010 and ~21,100 km2 in 2013, which is associated with village-level access to irrigation and local labor dynamics. Clay soil type and increasing irrigation coverage were associated with intensification. Yet, suitable soil type and access to irrigation do not reduce vulnerability to high daytime temperatures that is negatively associated with winter crop cover. With pronounced winter warming projected in the coming decades, effective adaptation by smallholder farmers would require additional strategies, such as access to fine-scale temperature forecasts ahead of the planting season and heat-tolerant winter crop varieties.",

            "abstract": "Land use land cover change (LULCC) plays an important role in the climate system. Impacts of LULCC can be observed at all spatio-temporal scales. LULCC results in the modification of both biogeophysical and biogeochemical properties of the land and atmosphere which eventually impacts weather and climate. Here we will focus on agriculture-driven LULCC and its biogeophysical impacts. It is found that agriculture-driven LULCC can both increase and lower the long-term maximum temperature over a region by changing energy partitioning (latent vs. sensible energy flux). LULCC also changes timing and location of convection and amount of precipitation. These impacts can be observed at the meso-, regional-/sub-continental scale. In addition, LULCC may also remotely impacts sub-continental scale climate. However, further investigation is needed to understand remote impacts of LULCC. We call for additional in-situ and remote observation platforms to monitor and understand impacts of agriculture-driven LULCC on climate.  ",

            "abstract": "Located on the western margin of Mexico, the collision zone between Rivera, Cocos and North American plates is a complex tectonic collage with high seismic hazards and potential tsunamigenic sources. During the spring of 2014, within the framework of TSUJAL project, Spanish and Mexican scientists investigated this region with the main objective of defining the crustal architecture of this active margin and recognizing potential structural sources that can trigger earthquakes and tsunamis at the convergence between Rivera plate-Jalisco block with the North American Plate. To achieve these goals, a wide-ranging of geophysical data was acquired in this region both offshore and onshore. In this paper, we present the preliminary results obtained from this project about bathymetric, structural geology and wide-angle seismic data of the southern coast of Bahía de Banderas.\nA crustal P-wave velocity model for the southern coast of Bahía de Banderas was obtained using WAS data recorded by OBS and land seismic stations for more than 150 km across Rivera Plate and Jalisco Block. The thickness of the slab in this area is about 10 km and presents a dip angle about 8º. Continental crustal thickness below Puerto Vallarta is about 20 km, no evidence of continental Moho was found in this study. This model support that due to the convergence of Rivera Plate against Jalisco Block, the region of Bahía de Banderas is under strong crustal stresses that generate structural lineaments and have the same trends offshore and inland. Most of the seismicity reported can be associated to the main structural lineaments. The Banderas Canyon apparently is in an opening process from west to east, which seems to continue through the Rio Pitillal river valley. There is no seismic or morphological evidence to consider that the Banderas Canyon is a continuation of Vallarta Graben.South of María Cleofas Island, the SC marks the limit between RP and JB, possibly being the result of the RP against JB push, and where it is established the beginning of current subduction process with seismic activity associated. If a subduction type earthquake occurs in the SC, which is 100 km length, the associated magnitude will be about 7.5 and could be tsunamigenic. In the studied area, no clear subduction features (trench, accretionary prism) are observed.",

            "abstract": "Malaria is a disease directly linked to temperature and rainfall. In Ethiopia, the influence of climate variables on malaria transmission and the subsequent role of ENSO in the rise of malaria incidence are becoming more recognized. Numerous publications attest to the extreme sensitivity of malaria to climate in Ethiopia. The majority of large-scale epidemics in the past were associated with climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall. However, there is limited information on climate variability and ENSO at the district level to aid in public health decision-making. Since 2008, the National Meteorogy Agency (NMA) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) have been collaborating on improving climate services in Ethiopia. This collaboration spurred the implementation of the Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) initiative and the creation of the IRI Data Library (DL) NMA Ethiopia Maproom. ENACTS provides reliable and readily accessible climate data at high resolutions and the Maproom uses ENACTS to build a collection of maps and other figures that monitor climate and societal conditions at present and in the recent past (1981-2010). A recent analysis exploring the relationship of rainfall and temperature ENACTS products to malaria epidemics in proceeding rainy seasons within 12 woredas found above normal temperature anomalies to be more readily associated with epidemics when compared to above normal rainfall anomalies, regardless of the ENSO phase (Figure 1-2).",

The data consists of full Stokes profiles in the Ca II 854.2 nm and Fe I 1.56 micron lines. The inversion of these Stokes spectra provides the magnetic, thermal and velocity structure at photospheric and chromospheric heights of sunspots. In this contribution, we present the results on the 3D thermal structure in the super-penumbral canopy of a well rounded sunspot, derived by a novel approach for the inversion of Ca II IR spectra. Tracing individual fibrils in the super-penumbral canopy, we find that about half of them form only short loops of a a few Mm length that return to the photosphere in the close surroundings of the sunspot instead of connecting to more remote magnetic network at the outer end of the moat flow.

            "abstract": "Acetone is one of the most abundant carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere, and a major source of HOx radicals in the upper troposphere. Thus, understanding the global budget of acetone is essential to understanding global oxidation capacity. Significant uncertainties remain regarding the flux of acetone out of and into the biosphere. Crucially unconstrained processes include dry deposition, fluxes of acetone into and out of the ocean, direct emissions of acetone from the terrestrial biosphere, and direct emissions of secondary sources of acetone such as the oxidation of monoterpenes from the terrestrial biosphere.\nWe have performed an elementary effects sensitivity analysis of the GEOS-Chem global 3-D CTM (version 10-01, www.geos-chem.org) for the global atmospheric distribution of acetone using the Morris method. This method provides a ranking of both the comparative direct importance, as well as non-linear effects and interactions of the tested input factor uncertainties, at a relatively low computational cost. The sensitivity analysis was bounded using literature minima and maxima for five sources of uncertainty related to specific biogenic sources and sinks. Preliminary results suggest that the uncertainties with the largest impact on acetone concentration are the uncertainties in direct acetone emissions from the terrestrial biosphere and uncertainties in the concentration of acetone in the ocean mixed layer.",

            "abstract": "Drainage of ice-dammed lakes is regularly observed along the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, the speed of the drainage events and implications can vary depending on the size of the lakes and the local settings. Here, we assess the drainage pattern of Lake Tinninilik, dammed by Sarqardliup sermia in West Greenland, using air- and satellite-borne laser- and radar altimetry supplemented with Landsat imagery. We combine the observations with DEMs from aerial imagery to derive lake volume changes which we compare against GPS data used to monitor crustal uplift caused by mass loss close to the site.\nOur results suggest that the previous pattern of drainage every 10th year has changed to every ~7th year, likely a result of enhanced melting over the last decade in the region. Furthermore, the lake drainage, resulting in a c. 70 m elevation change of the lake level, can occur in less than two months. Preliminary GPS results suggest instantaneous motion of a few centimeters of the solid bedrock in response the rapid drainage of the lake and thus support previous findings derived from radar interferograms that attribute vertical land motion to lake drainage.",

            "abstract": "We report on the results of the third PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) campaign on-board the NASA C-9 airplane in August 2014. The objective of PRIME is to study low-velocity impacts of cm-scale particles into planetary regolith under reduced gravity and microgravity conditions, measuring how dust on the surfaces of planetary ring particles, planetesimals and asteroids dissipates energy in the collision and the mass-velocity distribution of any ejecta produced in the impact.\nPRIME can perform impacts into granular materials at speeds of ~5-50 cm/s in microgravity. Impacts are performed in vacuum and projectiles are spherical particles launched by a spring designed to provide the desired impact energy. The target materials studied are quartz sand and JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant, filled to a depth of 2 cm in the target tray. Projectile materials are quartz, brass, and stainless steel to provide a range of impact energies at constant impact velocity. Impacts are performed in isolated chambers and up to 8 experiments can be performed per flight. The data collected consists of video recordings of the impacts, taken with a high resolution video camera at 120 frames per second.\nThe impacts observed during the PRIME-3 campaign resulted in 9 marble rebounds and 15 impacts with ejecta. Seven of these 15 were at accelerations of ~0.05 g while the remaining impacts were performed in free fall. For each rebound observed, the coefficient of restitution of the impact was measured and for each collision that produced ejecta, the ejected particles were tracked to determine their initial velocities. The PRIME-3 campaign successfully extended the region of the parameter field explored by investigating impacts at velocities lower than observed during previous campaigns while collecting new data on impacts at asteroid gravity levels. We present our new results and combine them with results from previous similar experiments and discuss applications to planetary ring systems, planetesimal accretion, and in situ exploration of asteroids and small planetary satellites.",

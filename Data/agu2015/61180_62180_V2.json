            "abstract": "Most thinking on Earth's carbon cycle implicates silicate weathering as the dominant control of atmospheric CO2 concentration over long timescales. Recent analyses of alteration of basalt at the seafloor, however, suggest that seafloor weathering (low-temperature (<60C) chemical alteration of the upper oceanic crust due to hydrothermal seawater circulation) increases dramatically in warm, high CO2 periods of Earth's history. This raises the possibility that seafloor weathering could complement silicate weathering in maintaining Earth's long term climate stability. Moreover, seafloor weathering would be the only type of weathering available on an exoplanet entirely covered by water, so understanding how it might work is essential for understanding the habitable zones of such waterworlds.\nWe have built a 2D numerical model of the flow of seawater through porous basalt coupled to chemical alteration reactions that can calculate alkalinity fluxes and carbonate deposition (seafloor weathering). I will present simulations in which we vary the seawater temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration, which are boundary conditions to our model, over large ranges. These results will provide a constraint on the ability of seafloor weathering to act as an effective climate buffer on Earth and other planets. I can't give you a preview of the results yet because at the time of writing this abstract we haven't completed the simulations!",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPhotosynthesis and light use efficiency (LUE) are major factors in the evolution of the continental carbon cycle due to their contribution to gross primary production (GPP). However, while the drivers of photosynthesis and LUE on a plant or canopy scale can often be identified, significant uncertainties exist when modeling these on a global scale. This is due to sparse observations in regions such as the tropics and the lack of a direct global observation dataset. Although others have attempted to address this issue using correlations (Beer, 2010) or calculating GPP from vegetation indices (Running, 2004), in this study we take a new approach. We combine the statistical method of Granger frequency causality and partial Granger frequency causality with remote sensing data products (including sun-induced fluorescence used as a proxy for GPP) to determine the main environmental drivers of GPP across the globe.\n",

            "abstract": "Most paleomagnetic textbooks ascribe secular variation (SV) to the movement and waxing/waning of non-dipole magnetic features in the fluid core, perhaps joined by wobble of a geocentric axial dipole (GAD). The actuality of a GAD is profoundly limited by the existence of the static, solid inner core, and the dynamic nature of the fluid outer core. A study of >560 Brunhes Epoch Virtual Geomagnetic Poles (VGP) suggests that geomagnetic field behavior arises from the waxing/waning of three approximately “stationary” offset dipoles (OD) situated in the middle of the ring of the outer core. These OD have been loosely fixed to preferred longitudes of 40°E, 120°E, and 280°E for at least the past 17Ma. The three offset dipoles in these positions determine transitional and excursional paths, and also normal SV. An extended literature documents these longitude corridors as paths of preferred VGP movement, guided by the polarity inversion of one of the three OD. Analysis of volcanic rock and archeomagnetic SV records shows a three-fold symmetric movement of local magnetic directions, guided by the variation in strength of the three OD. Preliminary data indicates that in the recent past the dominant OD at a given time yields to the next OD in movement toward greater east longitude. The frequency of OD dominance exchange is ~400 years, with return to the original OD in ~1200 years. Archeomagnetic “jerks”, not easily explained by a single dominant, inertial GAD, are more easily understood with 3 waxing/waning and exchanging OD. The particular analysis of Hawaiian SV with regard to the three OD suggests that tropical locales, far from the three spin axis-parallel OD, may still record true non-dipole influences.",

OzFlux is part of the “network of networks” Fluxnet, that is designed to provide continuous, long-term micrometeorological measurements to monitor the state of ecosystems globally.

            "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to high penetrations of solar power is the variable nature of solar power generation. To mitigate variability, grid operators have to schedule additional reliability resources, at considerable expense, to ensure that load requirements are met by generation. Thus despite the cost of solar PV decreasing, the cost of integrating solar power will increase as penetration of solar resources onto the electric grid increases. There are three principal tools currently available to mitigate variability impacts: (i) flexible generation, (ii) storage, either virtual (demand response) or physical devices and (iii) solar forecasting. Storage devices are a powerful tool capable of ensuring smooth power output from renewable resources. However, the high cost of storage is prohibitive and markets are still being designed to leverage their full potential and mitigate their limitation (e.g. empty storage). Solar forecasting provides valuable information on the daily net load profile and upcoming ramps (increasing or decreasing solar power output) thereby providing the grid advance warning to schedule ancillary generation more accurately, or curtail solar power output. In order to develop solar forecasting as a tool that can be utilized by the grid operators we identified two focus areas: (i) develop solar forecast technology and improve solar forecast accuracy and (ii) develop forecasts that can be incorporated within existing grid planning and operation infrastructure. The first issue required atmospheric science and engineering research, while the second required detailed knowledge of energy markets, and power engineering.\nMotivated by this background we will emphasize area (i) in this talk and provide an overview of recent advancements in solar forecasting especially in two areas: (a) Numerical modeling tools for coastal stratocumulus to improve scheduling in the day-ahead California energy market. (b) Development of a sky imager to provide short term forecasts (0-20 min ahead) to improve optimization and control of equipment on distribution feeders with high penetration of solar. Leveraging such tools that have seen extensive use in the atmospheric sciences supports the development of accurate physics-based solar forecast models. Directions for future research are also provided.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the base of a tectonic plate (LAB) is the 3rd dimension of plate tectonics. Recent seismic studies of the LAB have revealed planar features that show very different characteristics. In the oceans, the top of the S-wave low velocity zone shows a systematic deepening with plate age that fits plate-cooling models. However, the change in radial anisotropy has a markedly constant depth of ~70 km, regardless of plate age. A recent land-based study (SAHKE 2) of the subducted Pacific Plate in the southern Hikurangi margin has imaged a pair of distinct reflectors defining a ~10 km thick channel parallel to and ~70 km below the top of the ~15° dipping plate. Low velocities indicate that the channel is a zone of partial melt or high volatile content, acting as a weak base to the plate. Receiver function studies along the Japan margin have also imaged layers at these depths, parallel to the top of the plate and dipping up to 45°. We propose probing the base of the tectonic plate by tracing potential LAB seismic reflectors from their dipping portions in the subduction zone to where they bend in the trench outer rise. If the seismically identified boundary represents a ‘frozen-in’ feature, created at the mid ocean ridge, then it will remain parallel to the top of the plate, and its nature will remain unchanged as it is tracked over the outer rise. Alternatively, if the base of the plate is a thin channel of partial melt, then one would expect thickening of the channel beneath the outer rise due to melt ponding in the core of the flexure; this melt ponding may be the source of volcanic activity. A 500-km survey will trace the Pacific plate LAB from the subduction zone into the trench outer rise. The deeper part of the line coincides with the part of the plate where the ~10 km thick ‘melt’ channel was clearly imaged with the SAHKE 2 experiment. We show with synthetic experiments that given seismic energy scatter and attenuation comparable to that observed in the SAHKE 2 experiment, and the typical noise of OBS records, the previously detected LAB should be capable of being imaged with a high resolution OBS/low-frequency air-gun deployment, with ~10 km OBS spacing and ~60 sec recording time, using the RV Langseth. In addition, we give examples of air-gun experiments elsewhere in the world that provide further support that the LAB can be imaged this way.",

Considerations include the costs of the technical equipment: comparisons of small, medium, and large-format camera systems, as well as various GPS-INS systems and their impact on processing accuracy for various Ground Sampling Distances. Tradeoffs between camera formats and flight time are central. Weather conditions and planning high altitude versus low altitude flights are another economic factor, particularly in areas of persistently bad weather and in areas where ground logistics (i.e. hotel rooms and pilot incidentals) are expensive. Unique costs associated with UAS collections and experimental payloads will be discussed. Finally, the costs of equipment and labor differs in SfM processing than in conventional orthomosaic and LiDAR processing. There are opportunities for ‘economies of scale’ in SfM collections under certain circumstances but whether the accuracy specifications are firm/fixed or ‘best effort’ makes a difference.",

            "abstract": "Water plays an important role in the structure, dynamics, and evolution of planets because hydrogen can affect the physical properties and stabilities of constituent minerals in the planets\n.\nSince alumimous phase H (MgSiO4H2-AlOOH) is stable over the entire pressure range of the lower mantle, the hydrated subducting plate may deliver a certain amount of water into the bottom of the Earth’s mantle (Tsuchiya 2013, Nishi et al. 2013, Ohira et al. 2014, Walter et al. 2015). Compositional analysis of phase H grains synthesized from natural serpentine shows the presence of the Fe component in this phase (Nishi et al., 2015). This result suggests that phase H would also form solid solutions with ε-FeOOH, since ε-FeOOH is isostructural to phase H and δ-AlOOH. Moreover, an ab initio calculation has recently predicted that the new high pressure form of AlOOH, which has pyrite-type structure, would be stabilized at pressures above 170 GPa (Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya, 2011). Although this pyrite-type hydroxide has been found in InOOH, this structure in AlOOH has not been reported by experimental studies.\nHere we examine the composition and stability of Al,Fe-bearing phase H using a multi-anvil apparatus combined with sintered diamond anvils. Results show that large amounts of Fe and Al are partitioned into phase H relative to bridgmanite. Fe likely affects the stability of phase H in the lower mantle. Also, we conducted high pressure experiments on pure δ-AlOOH by using laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) techniques up to 200 GPa and 2,500 K. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicated that the transition from the δ-AlOOH to the pyrite-type structure occurs at high pressures above 190 GPa. Our experimental results exhibited a density reduction of 2.6 wt.% through the structural transition, and both experimental data plots and theoretical calculations showed similar compressibilities of δ-AlOOH and pyrite-type AlOOH. In recent years, hundreds of extra-solar planets have been reported. The stability of the pyrite-type hydroxide at extreme high pressures may affect the modelling results on the internal structure and deep water circulation of some extra-solar planets such as terrestrial super-Earths, which is because the hydroxide can store water in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Increasing interest in use of GRACE satellites and a variety of new products to monitor changes in total water storage (TWS) underscores the need to assess the reliability of output from different products. The objective of this study was to assess skills and uncertainties of different approaches for processing GRACE data to restore signal losses caused by spatial filtering based on analysis of 1°×1° grid scale data and basin scale data in 60 river basins globally. Results indicate that scaling factors from six land surface models (LSMs), including four models from GLDAS-1 (Noah 2.7, Mosaic, VIC, and CLM 2.0), CLM 4.0, and WGHM, are similar over most humid, sub-humid, and high-latitude regions but can differ by up to 100% over arid and semi-arid basins and areas with intensive irrigation. Large differences in TWS anomalies from three processing approaches (scaling factor, additive, and multiplicative corrections) were found in arid and semi-arid regions, areas with intensive irrigation, and relatively small basins (e.g., ≤ 200,000 km2). Furthermore, TWS anomaly products from gridded data with CLM4.0 scaling factors and the additive correction approach more closely agree with WGHM output than the multiplicative correction approach. Estimation of groundwater storage changes using GRACE satellites requires caution in selecting an appropriate approach for restoring TWS changes. A priori ground-based data used in forward modeling can provide a powerful tool for explaining the distribution of signal gains or losses caused by low-pass filtering in specific regions of interest and should be very useful for more reliable estimation of groundwater storage changes using GRACE satellites.",

            "abstract": "The Subauroral Polarization Stream (SAPS) flow structures are narrow ionospheric channels of fast (in excess of 100 m/s) westward drift just outside the equatorward edge of the diffuse aurora in the dusk-to-midnight local time sector. Other terms for this phenomenon include subauroral Ion Drift (SAID) events and Polarization Jets. SAPS structures represent a striking departure from the commonly-used two-cell convection pattern. They are thought to arise from the displacement of the downward region-2 Birkeland currents on the dusk side equatorward of the low-latitude boundary of the auroral oval during times of changing high-latitude convection. In this paper, we will use several event simulations with the SAMI3-RCM numerical model (a self-consistent ionosphere-inner magnetosphere model) and RCM-GITM (a self-consistent model of the ionosphere-thermosphere-inner magnetosphere) to analyze the relative roles of changes in the IMF Bz component, ionospheric electron density depletions, and thermospheric modifications in controlling the dynamics of SAPS. Simulation results will be compared to multi-instrument ionospheric observations.",

            "abstract": "Theory and observations have linked equatorial VLF waves with pulsating aurora for decades, invoking the process of pitch-angle scattering of 10's keV electrons in the equatorial magnetosphere. Recently published satellite studies have strengthened this argument, by showing strong correlation between pulsating auroral patches and both lower-band chorus and 10's keV electron modulation in the vicinity of geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, a previous link has been made between Pc4-5 compressional pulsations and modulation of whistler-mode chorus using THEMIS.\nIn the current study, we present simultaneous in-situ observations of structured chorus waves and an apparent field line resonance (in the Pc4-5 range) as a result of a substorm injection, observed by Van Allen Probes, along with ground-based observations of pulsating aurora. We demonstrate the likely scenario being one of substorm-driven Pc4-5 ULF pulsations modulating chorus waves, and thus providing the driver for pulsating particle precipitation into the Earth's atmosphere. Interestingly, the modulated chorus wave and ULF wave periods are well correlated, with chorus occurring at half the periodicity of the ULF waves. We also show, for the first time, a particular few-Hz modulation of individual chorus elements that coincides with the same modulation in a nearby pulsating aurora patch. Such modulation has been noticed as a high-frequency component in ground-based camera data of pulsating aurora for decades, and may be a result of nonlinear chorus wave interactions in the equatorial region. This work illustrates the significant understanding of magnetospheric processes that can be gained through use of conjunctive ground- and space-based observations.",

The options are many and costs have plummeted in last five years; however, many challenges persist with their deployment.\nWe mapped the archaeological site Maw­chu Llacta, a settlement in the southern highlands of Peru (Figure 1). Mawchu Llacta is a planned colonial town built over a major Inka-era center in the high-elevation grasslands at ~4,000m asl. The “general resettlement of Indians” was a massive forced resettlement program, for which very little local-level documentation exists. Mawachu Llacta’s excellently preserved architecture includes >500 buildings and hundreds of walls spread across ~13h posed significant mapping challenges.\nMany environmental factors impact UAV deployment. The air pressure at 4,100 m asl is dramatically lower than at sea level. The dry season diurnal temperature differentials can vary from 7°C to 22°C daily. High and hot conditions frequently occur from late morning to early afternoon. Reaching Mawchu Llacta requires hiking 4km with 400m of vertical gain over steep and rocky terrain. There is also no on-site power or secure storage. Thus, the UAV must be packable.\nFAA regulations govern US UAV deployments, but regulations were less stringent in Peru. However, ITAR exemptions and Peruvian customs requirements were required. The Peruvian government has established an importation and approval process that entails leaving the UAV at customs, while obtaining the necessary government approvals, both of which can be problematic.\nWe have deployed the Aurora Flight Sciences Skate fixed wing ßUAV, an in-house fixed wing UAV based on the Skywalker X-5 flying wing, and a tethered 9 m3 capacity latex meteorological weather balloon. Development of an autonomous blimp/balloon has been ruled-out. A 3DR Solo is being assessed for excavation mapping.",

            "abstract": "The current data management practices for NASA airborne field projects have successfully served science team data needs over the past 30 years to achieve project science objectives, however, users have discovered a number of issues in terms of data reporting and format. The ICARTT format, a NASA standard since 2010, is currently the most popular among the airborne measurement community. Although easy for humans to use, the format standard is not sufficiently rigorous to be machine-readable, and there lacks a standard variable naming convention among the many airborne measurement variables. This makes data use and management tedious and resource intensive, and also create problems in Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) data ingest procedures and distribution. Further, most DAACs use metadata models that concentrate on satellite data observations, making them less prepared to deal with airborne data. There also exists a substantial amount of airborne data distributed by websites designed for science team use that are less friendly to users unfamiliar with operations of airborne field studies. A number of efforts are underway to help overcome the issues with airborne data discovery and distribution. The ICARTT Refresh Earth Science Data Systems Working Group (ESDSWG) was established to enable a platform for atmospheric science data providers, users, and data managers to collaborate on developing new criteria for the file format in an effort to enhance airborne data usability. In addition, the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) has developed the Toolsets for Airborne Data (TAD) to provide web-based tools and centralized access to airborne in situ measurements of atmospheric composition. This presentation will discuss the aforementioned challenges and attempted solutions in an effort to demonstrate how airborne data management can be improved to streamline data ingest and discoverability to a broader user community.",

            "abstract": "Ash-rich volcanic plumes are often associated with intense electrical activity and the generation of volcanic lightning. Monitoring electrical discharges associated with explosive eruptions can provide crucial information on the dynamics and structure of the plume as well as on the mass eruption rate and cargo of erupted fine ash. Nevertheless, our understanding of volcanic lightning is still limited due to lacking of i) systematic instrumental observations and ii) the limited number of experimental investigations on the electrical properties of volcanic materials and the opportunity of replicating volcanic plume conditions in the lab.\nWe recently contributed to the understanding of both these aspects by performing multi-parametric observation of volcanic lightning at Sakurajima volcano in Japan and by achieving volcanic lightning in particle-laden jets generated in the lab.\nAt Sakurajima volcano we combined high-speed imaging with magnetotelluric and acoustic measurements of ash-rich plumes and compared our observation with maximum plume height measurement and atmospheric soundings. Our observations at Sakurajima allow the measurement of flash properties with respect to the plume evolution as well as magnetic and electric field variation and associated transferred current. In addition, weather-balloon soundings rule out the contribution of hydrometeors in the electrification of the plume.\nWe complement the field observation by performing rapid decompression experiments of well-constrained (composition and granulometry) ash samples and analogue materials. The experiments show many similarities with the vulcanian explosions at Sakurajima and, most importantly, they highlight how lightning is controlled by the dynamics of the rapidly expanding particle-laden jet. Two main conditions are required to generate lightning: 1) triboelectrification of the particles and 2) clustering of the particles driven by the jet fluid dynamics. As observed in nature, the size of the flashes scales with the dimensions of the evolving jet and the presence of fine ash in the jet is key to generate electrical discharges.\nWe further invite discussions on cross-correlation of relevant monitoring and lab techniques and possible future developments of multi-parametric arrays relevant for volcanic lightning.",

            "abstract": "A new regional Earth system model focused on the Arctic, the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), has recently been developed. The initial version of this model includes atmosphere (WRF), ocean (POP), sea ice (CICE), and land (VIC) component models coupled using the NCAR CESM CPL7 coupler. The model is configured to run on a large pan-Arctic domain that includes all sea ice covered waters in the Northern Hemisphere and all Arctic Ocean draining land areas.\nResults from a suite of multi-decadal (1990 to 2014) simulations with RASM will be presented and will focus on the simulated climate's sensitivity to atmospheric processes and parameterizations. These simulations show that the modeled climate is sensitive to changes in the boundary layer and cumulus parameterizations used in the atmospheric component of RASM. Depending on the WRF parameterizations used the model either overestimates or underestimates cloud cover over the ocean. Underestimation of clouds over land areas is common in all versions of the model evaluated. The differences in simulated cloud impacts the surface and top of the atmosphere radiation budget, alters biases in land and ocean surface temperature, changes precipitation distribution within the domain, and leads to different sea ice states being simulated. Simulations with only the atmospheric component of RASM were also run and highlight the model response that is solely due to atmospheric processes and the model response arising from coupled processes in RASM.",

The activity has two stages, one on local and the other on the circum-Arctic scales. Stage 1 is site simulations for the period of 1980-2013 for four Arctic observation sites, i.e., Fairbanks/AK, Kevo/Finland, Yakutsuk and Tiksi in Siberia, focusing on process evaluations with observation. Stage 2 is pan-arctic simulations for 1850-2100 with 0.5x0.5 degree resolution, targeting at the responses of Arctic terrestrial to global climate change. At both stages multiple terrestrial models have been participating (16+ for Stage 1; 10 for Stage 2), ranging from physically-oriented process models to biogeochemical models to ESM-compatible ecosystem models. The results are delineating a) spatial variations and temporal changes in subsurface thermal and hydrological states, and subsequently the ecosystem in different climatic/ecosystem zones (e.g., Kevo is underlain by seasonally frozen ground while others by permafrost; Tiksi is in tundra whole others in taiga; these two sites are Arctic while the other two sub-Arctic), and b) the differences and similarities in the reproducibility among models with respect to the target of the models (e.g., physical, or biogeochemical) and to the complexity of implemented processes.",

            "abstract": "Claims with extraordinary consequences require extraordinary evidence. It is not sufficient to prove that the warming is \"extremely likely\" to be anthropogenic: to achieve \"climate closure\", we must also disprove the converse theory that it is a natural fluctuation. This disproof requires an understanding of the strongly nonlinear atmospheric variability: since the 1980's this understanding is one of the important contributions of nonlinear geophysics to the atmospheric sciences. Atmospheric variability spans twenty orders of magnitude in time and ten in space, but it can be tamed with the help of emergent high-level turbulent laws and their anisotropic and multifractal generalizations.\nWe take a voyage through scales and with the help of some new fluctuation analysis tools, we review the arguments and evidence for wide scale range space-time scaling: high level turbulent laws. We examine the consequences for the extreme fluctuations (\"grey swan\", \"black swan\" events) and we apply this to estimating the probabilities and return times of extreme centennial, global scale temperature fluctuations. Even with conservative assumptions, the natural warming hypothesis can be rejected with >99% confidence.",

            "abstract": "The Alaska Land Carbon Assessment was conducted to inform mitigation and adaptation policies and land management decisions at sub-regional, regional, and national scales. Ecosystem carbon balance of Alaska was estimated for two time periods, a historical period (1950-2009) and a projected period (2010-2099) by synthesizing results for upland, wetland, and inland aquatic ecosystems. The total area of Alaska considered in this assessment was 1,474,844 km2, which is composed of 84 percent uplands, 12 percent wetlands, and 4 percent inland waters. Between 1950 and 2009 the upland and wetland ecosystems of the state sequestered an average of 4.4 TgC/yr, which is almost 2 percent of net primary production (NPP) by upland and wetland ecosystems. However, this sequestration is spatially variable with the northern boreal sub-region losing C because of fire disturbance and other sub-regions gaining carbon. For inland aquatic ecosystems, there was a net combined carbon flux through various pathways of 41.2 TgC/yr, or about 17 percent of upland and wetland NPP. The greenhouse gas forcing potential of upland and wetland ecosystems of Alaska was approximately neutral during the historical period, but the state as a whole could be a source for greenhouse gas forcing to the climate system from methane emissions from lake ecosystems, which were not considered in the assessment. During the projected period (2010-2099), carbon sequestration of upland and wetland ecosystems of Alaska would increase substantially (18.2 to 34.4 TgC/yr) primarily because of an increase in NPP of 8 to 19 percent associated with responses to rising atmospheric CO2, increased nitrogen cycling, and longer growing seasons. Although C emissions to the atmosphere from wildfire increase substantially for all of the projected climates, the increases in NPP more than compensate for those losses. The analysis indicates that upland and wetland ecosystems would be sinks for greenhouse gases for all scenarios during the projected period. However, as in the case of the analysis of the historical period, there is an uncertainty as whether the state could be a net source for GHG if emissions of CH4 from lakes in Alaska were considered.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is currently experiencing rapid environmental change. Numerous studies have shown clear evidence of change that is pervasive throughout the terrestrial Arctic system including widespread permafrost thaw and associated thermokarst initiation, changes in lake distribution, shifts in vegetation community composition, as well as changes in a host of other ecosystem, carbon cycle, and hydrologic processes. Threshold and non-linear responses associated with phase change between ice and water leave the Arctic particularly susceptible to swift and disruptive change. The fate of the Arctic carbon cycle including the potential release of soil carbon as carbon dioxide or methane, as well as any counterbalancing carbon accumulation via enhanced vegetation growth, is fundamentally governed by present and future soil hydrologic states. Prior research suggests that the hydrologic response may contain two phases, an initial wettening associated with ice melt and surface subsidence leading to more wetlands and lakes, followed by drying once the permafrost table has deepened enough to open up new channels to the groundwater system.\nUtilizing a version of the Community Land Model (CLM), the land model of CESM, that includes advances in the representation of permafrost water and carbon dynamics, we will explore how soil moisture and the water cycle in permafrost regions may change in response to permafrost thaw and assess the implications for the permafrost-carbon feedback.",

We investigate the leading factor for the interannual variability of Bering sea ice concentration (SIC) in early winter (November-December), using canonical correlation analysis based on seasonally resolved atmosphere and ocean data for 1980-2014. We found that the 3-month leading (August-September) geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) in the Northern Hemisphere explains 29% of SIC variability. The spatial pattern of Z500 for positive sea ice anomalies is associated with negative anomalies over the Gulf of Alaska related to the Pacific Transition (PT) pattern. The heat budget analysis indicates that summertime atmospheric conditions influence SIC through the ocean temperature anomalies of the Alaskan Coastal Current forced by atmospheric turbulent heat fluxes. The PT pattern highly correlates with convective precipitation in the western subtropical Pacific, implying that tropical forcing is the likely cause for the recent extreme winters in North America. Our results present a major factor for interannual variability in the Bering Sea ice area, and further would contribute to the improvement of forecast skill for winter climate in North America.",

            "abstract": "Observations are essential for the development and evaluation of climate models. Satellite and in-situ measurements as well as reanalysis products provide crucial resources for these purposes. Over the last two decades, the climate modeling community has become adept at developing model intercomparison projects (MIPs) that provide the basis for more systematic comparisons of climate models under common experimental conditions. A prominent example among these is the coupled MIP (CMIP). Due to its growing importance in providing input to the IPCC, the framework for CMIP, now planning CMIP6, has expanded to include a very comprehensive and precise set of experimental protocols, with an advanced data archive and dissemination system. While the number, types and sophistication of observations over the same time period have kept pace, their systematic application to the evaluation of climate models has yet to be fully exploited due to a lack of coordinated protocols for identifying, archiving, documenting and applying observational resources.\n This presentation will discuss activities and plans of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Data Advisory Council’s (WDAC) Task Team on Observations for Model Evaluation for facilitating the use of observations for model evaluation. The presentation will include an update on the status of the obs4MIPs and ana4MIPs projects, whose purpose is to provide a limited collection of well-established and documented observation and reanalysis datasets for comparison with Earth system models, targeting CMIP in particular. The presentation will also describe the role these activities and datasets play in the development of a set of community standard observation-based climate model performance metrics by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE)’s Performance Metrics Panel, as well as which CMIP6 experiments these activities are targeting, and where additional community input and contributions to these activities are needed.",

            "abstract": "Be it fuel production for energy consumption or carbon storage and sequestration to mitigate global warming, tight gas sandstone and carbonate formations offer a new and largely available potential for these purposes. Exploring and developing these formations however is hampered by uncertainties in quantifying their pore structure due to considerable heterogeneity and existence of pores in multiple length scales.\nWe explore tracer breakthrough profiles (TBP) as a macroscopic property to infer the complex pore space topology of tight gas sandstone and carbonate rocks at the core scale. The following features were modeled via three-dimensional multiscale networks: microporosity within dissolved grains and pore-filling clay, cementation in the absence and presence of microporosity (each classified into uniform, pore preferred, and throat-preferred modes), layering, vug, and microcrack inclusion. A priori knowledge of the extent and location of each process was assumed to be known. With the exception of an equal importance of macropores and pore-filling micropores, TBPs show little sensitivity to the fraction of micropores present. In general, significant sensitivity of the TBPs was observed for uniform and throat-preferred cementation. Layering parallel to the fluid flow direction had a considerable impact on TBPs whereas layering perpendicular to flow did not. Microcrack orientations seemed of minor importance in affecting TBPs.",

            "abstract": "Long-term shifts in baseline hydroclimatic conditions present meaningful risks to ecosystems and society. Multi-decade megadroughts and pluvials illustrate these risks, but much less is known about lower frequency hydroclimatic variability. Here, we build upon previous work demonstrating coherent signals of multi-century lake-level trends and fluctuations over the past >6,000 years in the northeast U.S., which were reconstructed using systematic analyses of past shoreline positions in small ponds in coastal Massachusetts. Based on these records, water levels have risen substantially since 8 ka and repeated multi-century episodes of low water at ca. 4.9-4.6, 4.2-3.9, 2.9-2.1, and 1.3-1.2 ka punctuated the long-term rise. New records from inland Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania extend these patterns to the mid-Atlantic region. By converting the changes in lake volume to estimates of precipitation minus evaporation for each watershed using a simple hydrologic budget model, we compare the paleohydrologic record from lakes with annual precipitation reconstructions derived from fossil pollen data. The fossil pollen data were matched to their nearest modern equivalents, based on a dissimilarity metric, and assigned the annual precipitation associated with their space-for-time analogs. Such an approach accurately reconstructs spatial gradients in annual precipitation today (R2 = 0.70 for North America) with uncertainty <15% (RMSE = 165 mm/yr) for the northeast U.S. Over the Holocene, the mean lake and pollen records correlate well (R2 = 0.96). The comparison indicates that multi-millennial trends and additional multi-century hydroclimate variability impacted both surface hydrology (lakes) and vegetation composition. Because the lake and pollen records derive from independent sediment cores and types of analyses, and show correlated trends across multiple sites, the major features of the record appear robust. Additionally, alkenone-derived sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates from the Atlantic coast predict both the lake-level and pollen-inferred changes. Low SSTs correlate with high effective moisture, and indicate an integrated ocean-atmosphere component to Holocene hydroclimatic changes in the northeast U.S.",

The average temperature\ndiscrepancy (ΔT) between the two temperature proxies is ~3℃ during the last glacial and ~0℃ during the Holocene, which cannot be fully attributed\nto calculation errors. The offset between these two proxies may be caused by the different living water depths of the source organisms: haptophyte\nand Thaumarchaeota for the UK'37 and TEX86 respectively. The terrestrial GDGTs input and the different calibration equations on the TEX86 may\npossibly also contribute to the discrepancy.

            "abstract": "Impacts of CO2 concentration data obtained from satellite (GOSAT TIR L2 Ver. 1.0) measurements on the estimation of global surface CO2 fluxes have been investigated using an ensemble-based four-dimensional data assimilation system (LETKF). An online atmospheric transport model (MJ98-CDTM) is employed in the data assimilation system to optimize surface CO2 fluxes from real observations at spatial and temporal resolutions of 6 days and about 2.8° (T42), respectively. The features of GOSAT TIR L2 Ver. 1.0 data are their larger data number than that of SWIR L2 (about 10 times) and smaller standard deviation than their former version (TIR L2 Ver. 0.01). These points are the advantageous features to CO2 data assimilation. One of the most important issues in satellite data assimilation is a bias correction technique. Therefore, we have tested 4 types of satellite bias correction experiments (w/o bias correction, monthly mean bias correction, all data bias correction and globally constant bias correction) using independent CO2 concentration analysis (JMA CO2 distribution) in our data assimilation system. Our results showed that estimated CO2 concentration and fluxes are significantly sensitive to bias correction scheme. The reason may come from that model biases are important issue on data assimilation. In conclusion, suitable satellite data bias correction allows obtaining realistic CO2 concentration field and modifying surface CO2 flux almost entire earth surface. In addition, this satellite bias correction scheme makes it possible to use multiple satellite observation data simultaneously in CO2 data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Earth science is arguably one of the most mature science discipline which constantly acquires, curates, and utilizes a large volume of data with diverse variety. We deal with big data before there is big data. For example, while developing the EOS program in the 1980s, the EOS data and information system (EOSDIS) was developed to manage the vast amount of data acquired by the EOS fleet of satellites. EOSDIS continues to be a shining example of modern science data systems in the past two decades.\nWith the explosion of internet, the usage of social media, and the provision of sensors everywhere, the big data era has bring new challenges. First, Goggle developed the search algorithm and a distributed data management system. The open source communities quickly followed up and developed Hadoop file system to facility the map reduce workloads. The internet continues to generate tens of petabytes of data every day. There is a significant shortage of algorithms and knowledgeable manpower to mine the data. In response, the federal government developed the big data programs that fund research and development projects and training programs to tackle these new challenges.\nMeanwhile, comparatively to the internet data explosion, Earth science big data problem has become quite small. Nevertheless, the big data era presents an opportunity for Earth science to evolve. We learned about the MapReduce algorithms, in memory data mining, machine learning, graph analysis, and semantic web technologies. How do we apply these new technologies to our discipline and bring the hype to Earth? In this talk, I will discuss how we might want to apply some of the big data technologies to our discipline and solve many of our challenging problems. More importantly, I will propose new Earth science data system architecture to enable new type of scientific inquires.",

Because of the long integration time and the tremendous computing resources required for such a projection, the model resolution is typically not at a spatial scale fine enough for climate assessment or decision support purposes. A number of “downscaling technologies” have been developed over the years to bring the climate projection information to the local level for management and policy decision support purposes.\nIn the past couple of years, NASA supported a number of regional to local climate projection activities: NASA Climate Adaption Science Investigators focused on climate resilience at NASA center level, National Climate Assessment (NCA) Capacity Building focused on data sets and tools to support NCA, NCA Indicators focused on creating simple indicators specifically designed for decision support, Assessing the Fidelity of Dynamical Downscaling with the NASA Unifies-WRF Model focused on understanding the credibility of dynamical downscaling technique using a regional climate model. All of these projects have a component in creating or using downscaled climate information.\nWith the consequence of climate change beginning to emerge, there is a continuous need to better quantify the quality of downscaled climate projections. In this talk I will give an overview on NASA’s efforts to understand the various techniques, the limitations including the risks of using these techniques, and finally, I will provide a view on possible future researches in this area.",

            "abstract": "In the absence of vegetation, evaporation occurs entirely from the soil and can lead to considerable water losses. Considering the increase of water limited environments throughout the world and their potential for expansion over the coming years, it is critical that we are able to properly understand and model evaporation. Evaporation is affected by atmospheric conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature, wind velocity, solar radiation) and soil thermal and hydraulic properties (e.g., thermal and hydraulic conductivity, porosity), all of which are strongly coupled. However, for most conventional models, many of these mechanisms are crudely parameterized and inconsistent with current physical understanding due to the complexity of the problem in field scenarios and the scarcity of field or laboratory data capable of testing and refining energy and mass transfer theories. In this work, we investigated different physical processes that are often overlooked in models of flux exchange and how these processes may become significant in modeling arid and semi-arid environments. A non-isothermal model that allows for the coupling of single-phase (gas) two-component (air and water vapor) atmospheric flow and two-phase (gas, liquid) two-component (air and water vapor) flow in porous media was modified to better account for dry soil conditions. Numerical results were tested with precision experimental data. Results demonstrate that proper coupling of the thermal and mass flux processes allows us to better understand vapor transport and phase change processes that control shallow subsurface soil moisture and ultimately improve models predicting mass and energy fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Using cross-correlation analysis, we demonstrate that flux measurements at observation locations during hydraulic tomography (HT) surveys carry non-redundant information about heterogeneity that are complementary to head measurements at the same locations. We then hypothesize that a joint interpretation of head and flux data, even when the same observation network as head is used, can enhance the resolution of HT estimates. Subsequently, we use numerical experiments to test this hypothesis and investigate the impact of flux conditioning and prior information such as correlation lengths, and initial mean models (uniform or distributed means) on the HT estimates of a non-stationary hydraulic conductivity field. We find that the addition of flux conditioning to HT analysis improve the estimates in all of the prior models tested. While prior information (as uniform mean or layered means, correlation scales) could be useful, its influence on the estimates moderates as more non-redundant data (i.e. flux) are used in the HT analysis. Lastly, some recommendations for conducting HT surveys and analysis are presented.",

ICARTT has been the NASA standard since 2010, and is widely used by NOAA, NSF, and international partners (DLR, FAAM). Despite its level of acceptance, there are a number of issues with the current ICARTT format, especially concerning the machine readability. To enhance usability, the ICARTT Refresh Earth Science Data Systems Working Group (ESDSWG) was established to enable a platform for atmospheric science data producers, users (e.g. modelers) and data managers to collaborate on developing criteria for this file format. Ultimately, this is a cross agency effort to improve and aggregate the metadata records being produced. After conducting a survey to identify deficiencies in the current format, we determined which are considered most important to the various communities. Numerous recommendations were made to improve upon the file format while maintaining backward compatibility. The recommendations made to date and their advantages and limitations will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Water is the most climate sensitive sector in changing climate. Hydrological vulnerability assessment is critical to the implementation of adaption measures. In this study, projections of 7 GCMs in association with high (RCP8.5) and medium low (RCP4.5) representative concentration path way from the CMPI5 (fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) for the period 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 were adopted to assess the impacts of climate change on the runoffs of Gilgel Abbay watershed, the upper Blue Nile basin, in Ethiopia. The GCMs selected were first screened in harmony with baseline climate statistics of study areas. Based on climate projections and statistical characteristics of historical weather data, a weather generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation as inputs for the GWLF hydrological model to simulate runoffs. Changes of projected temperature and precipitation were analyzed to explain variations of evapotranspiration and influences on future runoffs. We found that, despite the fact that the projected magnitude varies among different GCMs, increasing in the wet and a decreasing in dry seasons runoffs were observed in both time windows, which mainly attributes to the increase of precipitations projected by most of GCMs. In contrast to great increases in runoffs, the increase of evapotranspiration by elevating temperature is less significant. The increasing runoffs in both time windows will provide more water inflow to the Lake Tana. On the other hand, the increase of precipitation in wet season makes the wet season wetter and implies higher possibility of flash floods. This will have deleterious consequences in the local community. Therefore, concerned water organizations in local, state, and federal levels shall be prepared to harness the opportunities with more water resources for utilization and management, as well as flood preventive measures.",

Mature science understanding is allowing new levels of situational awareness be possible when and if the relevant data is available and shared in a timely and useable manner. Satellite and other remote sensing tools have been used to observe, monitor, assess and predict weather and water impacts for decades. In the last few years much of this has included a focus on the ability to monitor changes on climate scales that suggest changes in quantity and quality of ecosystem resources or the “one-health” approach where trans-disciplinary links between environment, animal and vegetative health may provide indications of best ways to manage susceptibility to infectious disease or outbreaks. But the scale of impacts and availability of information from earth observing satellites, airborne platforms, health tracking systems and surveillance networks offer new integrated tools. This presentation will describe several recent events, such as Superstorm Sandy in the United States and the Ebola outbreak in Africa, where public health and health infrastructure have been exposed to environmental hazards and lessons learned from disaster response in the ability to share data have been effective in risk reduction.",

Triggered by a global seismic network and the interpretation by operational, research and response agencies, all available assets were quickly mobilized, charters activated to share data, and information gathered to assess impacts. This included assessing available data from optical and radar-based satellites and global positioning systems to baseline pre-event conditions and distinguish immediate and ongoing changes. Models and maps were generated to identify land deformation and damage proxies for communities, resources and infrastructure. Technologies facilitated national and international collaboration among public and private sector institutions to task satellites and optimize integration and processing of data from vital airborne platforms or ingest relevant new data streams. Crowd-sourced data added to the mix and provided a critical source of ground truth that blended with reports from field teams and those in communities. New levels of situational awareness were achieved through integrated data products and the reliance on relationships and new technologies that allowed for volunteers to analyze results in an unprecedented fashion.

            "abstract": "We have recently developed a new modeling capability to embed the implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model iPIC3D into the BATS-R-US magnetohydrodynamic model. The PIC domain can cover the regions where kinetic effects are most important, such as reconnection sites. The BATS-R-US code, on the other hand, can efficiently handle the rest of the computational domain where the MHD or Hall MHD description is sufficient with its block-adaptive grid. The current implementation of the MHD-EPIC model allows two-way coupled simulations in two and three dimensions with multiple embedded PIC regions. The MHD and PIC grids can have different grid resolutions. The MHD variables and the moments of the PIC distribution functions are interpolated and message passed in an efficient manner through the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). Both BATS-R-US and iPIC3D are massively parallel codes fully integrated into, run by and coupled through the SWMF.\nWe have successfully applied the MHD-EPIC code to model Ganymede's magnetosphere. Using four PIC regions we have in effect performed a fully kinetic simulation of the moon's mini-magnetosphere with a grid resolution that is about 5 times finer than the ion inertial length. The Hall MHD model provides proper boundary conditions for the four PIC regions and connects them with each other and with the inner and outer outer boundary conditions of the much larger MHD domain. We compare our results with Galileo magnetic observations and find good overall agreement with both Hall MHD and MHD-EPIC simulations. The power spectrum for the small scale fluctuations, however, agrees with the data much better for the MHD-EPIC simulation than for Hall MHD. In the MHD-EPIC simulation, unlike in the pure Hall MHD results, we also find signatures of flux transfer events (FTEs) that agree very well with the observed FTE signatures both in terms of shape and amplitudes. We will also highlight our ongoing efforts to model the magnetospheres of Mercury and Earth with the MHD-EPIC model.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface thermal erosion is triggered by convective heat transfers between flowing water and permafrost. Heat advection due to infiltration of run-off in the massive ice wedges and the ice-rich upper portion of permafrost creates sink holes and networks of interconnected tunnels in the permafrost. Mass movements such as collapse of tunnel’s roof, retrogressive thaw-slumping and active layer detachment slides lead to the development of extensive gully networks in the landscape. These gullies drastically change the hydrology of ice-wedge polygon terrains and the fluxes of heat, water, sediment, nutrients and carbon within the geosystem. Exportation of sediments out of gullies are positive mechanical feed-back that keep channels active for decades. Along gully margins, drainage of disturbed polygons and ponds, slope drainage, soil consolidation, gully walls colonization by vegetation and wet to mesic plant succession change the thermal properties of the active layer and create negative feedback effects that stabilize active erosion processes and promote permafrost recovery in gully slopes and adjacent disturbed polygons. On Bylot Island (Nunavut), over 40 gullies were monitored to characterize gully geomorphology, thermal and mechanical processes of gully erosion, rates of gully erosion over time within different sedimentary deposits, total volume of eroded permafrost at the landscape scale and gully hydrology. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to quantify heat convection processes and speed of ice wedge ablation in order to derive empirical equations to develop model of permafrost thermal erosion. We used data, collected over 10 years, of geomorphological gully monitoring and regional climate scenarios to evaluate the potential response of ice-wedge polygon terrains to changes in snow, permafrost thermal regime and hydrological conditions over the coming decades and its implication for the short and long term dynamics of arctic permafrost geosystems.",

The results showed that pump output increase by 2.8 billion cubic meters of water. On the conditions of P = 95%, 75% and 50%, compared with the benchmark year, water demand increases slightly due to the need of social and economic development in planning years, and water supply increased significantly because of new diversion ability. Water deficit are greatly reduced by 74.9% especially in the commonly drought condition because of the new project operation and optimized allocation of water resources.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the complex coupling between the Martian ionosphere and magnetosphere, formed as the solar wind interacts with the planet's upper atmosphere and localized crustal magnetic fields. Data from MAVEN's Particles and Fields Package are analyzed to assess variations in the magnetic structure of the ionosphere and possible links to particle transport within, and away from, the ionosphere. During periods when incident solar wind dynamic pressure exceeds ionospheric plasma pressure, the ionosphere of Mars may become strongly magnetized. At Venus, these periods of intense ionosphere magnetization were reported to suppress the formation of ionospheric flux ropes, helical magnetic structures that are also observed at Mars. Magnetic flux ropes may serve as a gateway for plasma exchange between the ionosphere and the magnetosheath, while heavily draped, horizontal ionospheric fields would inhibit vertical transport. Therefore, changes in the Martian ionospheric structure, based on varying upstream conditions, may have implications for particle transport mechanisms leading to atmospheric escape. Here, we examine magnetic field and plasma characteristics as a function of altitude and latitude in order to characterize several features of the Martian ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling: 1) the degree to which the ionosphere becomes magnetized; 2) whether ionospheric flux rope formation is enhanced or impeded, based on upstream solar wind conditions; and 3) possible implications of ionosphere magnetization on atmospheric escape. By constraining these characteristics we can better understand the Mars-solar wind interaction and, more specifically, how the magnetic structure of the ionosphere may affect particle transport and atmospheric escape.",

However, factors controlling the denitrification, anammox and DNRA processes and their respective contributions to the nitrogen removal remain unclear for specific aquatic environments. In this study, we investigate potential rates of denitrification, anammox and DNRA in the subtidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary via slurry incubation experiments combined with isotope-tracing techniques to reveal their respective contributions to total nitrate reduction in this hypereutrophic estuarine ecosystem. Measured rates of denitrification, anammox and DNRA ranged from 0.06 to 4.51 μmol N kg-1 h-1, 0.01 to 0.52 μmol N kg-1 h-1, and 0.03 to 0.89 μmol N kg-1 h-1, respectively. These potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction process rates correlated significantly with salinity, sulfide, organic carbon and nitrogen. Denitrification contributed 38 – 96 % total nitrate reduction in the Yangtze Estuary, as compared to 3 – 45 % for DNRA and 1 – 36 % for anammox. In total, the denitrification and anammox processes removed approximately 25% of the external inorganic nitrogen transported annually into the estuary. In contrast, most external inorganic nitrogen was retained in the estuary and contributes substantially to the severe eutrophication of the Yangtze Estuary.\n Keywords: Nitrogen; Ammonium; Nitrate; Denitrification; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; Sediment",

            "abstract": "Alpine treelines in Alaska have advanced for the past 50 years in response to the recent climate warming. However, further increases in temperatures may cause treeline species drought stress and increase susceptibility to insect outbreaks and fire. Complex factors such as soil conditions and plant species composition also impact the growth of seedlings, which are essential to sustain boreal forests. Our goals were to assess 1) the current optimal elevation for the treeline species Picea glauca (white spruce) seedlings and how it is altered by climate change, and 2) their growth/survival strategies at each environmental site. We studied the growth response of spruce seedlings along an altitudinal gradient at 6 sites, consisting of tundra, forest, or transitional ecotone in Denali National Park and one forest site in Fairbanks, AK. In May 2012, four-month old seedlings were planted with or without naturally occurring plants to compare the presence or absence of the interspecific interaction. Summer temperatures were increased by one small greenhouse per site. Over 2 growing seasons, growth was measured non-destructively, and then the seedlings were harvested. Relative growth rate (RGR) in height was increased significantly as the altitude was increased. Elevated temperature increased height only in seedlings at a high-altitude forest. Seedlings with neighboring plants had a higher RGR in height than seedlings that had neighbors removed, while significantly wider diameters were measured from the seedlings without neighbors. A weak trend of declining diameter width with increasing altitudes was seen. Seedlings that grew taller did not grow their stems wider, indicating trade-offs in resource allocation. None of the altitudinal sites had a clear advantage for the growth of the seedlings. Habitat microclimate and the interaction with other species could be more important than the altitude or temperatures and hence, key to the survival and growth of spruce seedlings in this region.",

            "abstract": "Hourly sea-level records for the time period of 1901 to 2012 at Fort Point tidal station in San Francisco Bay are analyzed in an attempt to find the origin of the secular changes found in the tidal constituents. Complex demodulation implemented with a low pass filter window of 8760 hours was employed to extract the amplitude and phase of the principal tidal constituent M2 as a function of time. The 18.6 year nodal signal was removed by using the tide potential of the equilibrium tide. The results show significant trends up to 4 cm in amplitude as well as phase shifts of 17 minutes per century. Moreover, yearly amplitude variations of M2 show to be inversely correlated to river flow discharge. On the other hand, the results of a simplified two-layer numerical hydrodynamic model indicate that long-term tide variations are directly related to the morphological evolution of a sandbank located outside the bay surrounding its entrance, acting as a hydraulic control for the whole bay. According to historical results, the sandbank reached its shallowest depth during the California Gold Rush (1848-1884), when mining debris together with large amounts of sediment were deposited into the estuary. After the Central Valley Water Project was approved (1933), many dams were built decreasing significantly the sediment supply. With the passage of time, the gradual loss of sedimentation also diminished the sandbank, increasing its depth. This fact explains the observed secular long-term advance of the tidal phase, as well as the increasing trend of the M2 amplitude.",

            "abstract": "Some bacteria possess the capability to degrade SCN-; therefore, harnessing this metabolic trait offers a biotechnological remediation strategy for SCN- produced in gold ore processing. A tailings storage facility (TSF) at a gold mine in Victoria, Australia holds large quantities of thiocyanate (SCN-) contaminated mine waste. The surface water in the TSF typically contains SCN- concentrations of >800 mg L-1, and seepage from the facility has contaminated the groundwater at the site. This study aimed to culture SCN-degrading microbes from the TSF, characterize the microbial consortia and test its operational parameters for use in a thiocyanate-degrading bioreactor.\nSurface samples were obtained from several locations around the TSF facility and used to inoculate medium reflective of the moderately saline and alkaline tailings water at the TSF, in the absence of organic carbon but subject to additions of phosphate and trace metals. Four microbial consortia capable of rapid SCN- degradation were successfully cultured. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes found that the consortia were dominated by Thiobacillus species, a genus of known SCN- degraders. Lower abundances of other SCN- degraders; Sphingopyxis and Rhodobacter, were also identified. The impact of a number of geochemical conditions, including pH, temperature and SCN- concentration, upon the growth and SCN- degrading capacity of these consortia was determined. These results informed the optimization of a lab-scale thiocyanate degrading bioreactor.\nIn summary, the cultured bacterial consortia proved effective towards SCN- degradation at the prevailing geochemical conditions of the TSF, requiring minimal nutrient additions. These consortia were dominated by genera of known autotrophic SCN- degraders. The comprehensive characterisation of these SCN- degrading consortia will provide the fundamental operational parameters required for deployment of this technique at the field scale.",

            "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. Lyme disease occurrence is highly seasonal and the annual springtime onset of cases is modulated by meteorological conditions in preceding months. A meteorological-based empirical model for Lyme disease onset week in the United States is driven with downscaled simulations from five global climate models and four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to project the impacts of 21st century climate change on the annual onset week of Lyme disease. Projections are made individually and collectively for the 12 eastern States where >90% of cases occur. The national average annual onset week of Lyme disease is projected to become 0.4-0.5 weeks earlier for 2025-2040 (p<0.05), and 0.7-1.9 weeks earlier for 2065-2080 (p<0.01), with the largest shifts for scenarios with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The more southerly mid-Atlantic States exhibit larger shifts (1.0-3.5 weeks) compared to the Northeastern and upper Midwestern States (0.2-2.3 weeks) by 2065-2080. Winter and spring temperature increases primarily cause the earlier onset. Greater spring precipitation and changes in humidity partially counteract the temperature effects. The model does not account for the possibility that abrupt shifts in the life cycle of Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in the eastern United States, may alter the disease transmission cycle in unforeseen ways. The results suggest 21st century climate change will make environmental conditions suitable for earlier annual onset of Lyme disease cases in the United States with possible implications for the timing of public health interventions.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and nutrient deposition have the potential to accelerate soil formation in high-elevation sediments recently exposed by glacier or snow melt. This process has implications not only for ecosystem formation on Earth but for the formation of Earth-like ecosystems on other planets and icy moons. Research into microbial communities shifting from subnival to mesotrophic conditions has mainly focused on changes on respiration and biomass, and is generally limited to one or two well-studied geographical locations. In particular, more information is needed on microbial shifts in snow-covered volcanic sediments, which may prove the closest analog to the most ‘habitable’ non-terrestrial environments for Earth microorganisms. We sampled in volcanic soil and sediment along gradients of elevation and snowmelt – dry soil, moist soil next to snowpack, and soil underneath snowpack - at the Muir Snowfields at Mount Rainier National Park, in order to investigate changes in carbon and nitrogen compounds, microbial diversity and gene expression. Initial results show a decrease in available ammonium and increase in microbial biomass carbon in exposed sediment with increasing soil moisture, and a sharp decrease in microbial C:N ratios after snowmelt and drying. Available/labile organic carbon and organic nitrogen decrease strongly with elevation, while microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and mineral nitrogen compounds show no change with elevation. Though gene expression data is needed for confirmation, we hypothesize that these snowfields receive strong wind-borne deposits of carbon and nitrogen but that chemoautotrophic communities under semi-permanent snowpack do not shift to more mesotrophic communities until after exposed sediment has already begun to desiccate, limiting soil formation.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial reference frame (TRF) provides the foundation for the accurate monitoring of sea level using both ground-based (tide gauges) and space-based (satellite altimetry) techniques. For the latter, tide gauges are also used to monitor drifts in the satellite instruments over time. The accuracy of the terrestrial reference frame (TRF) is thus a critical component for both types of sea level measurements. The TRF is central to the formation of geocentric sea-surface height (SSH) measurements from satellite altimeter data. The computed satellite orbits are linked to a particular TRF via the assumed locations of the ground-based tracking systems. The manner in which TRF errors are expressed in the orbit solution (and thus SSH) is not straightforward, and depends on the models of the forces underlying the satellite's motion. We discuss this relationship, and provide examples of the systematic TRF-induced errors in the altimeter derived sea-level record. The TRF is also crucial to the interpretation of tide-gauge measurements, as it enables the separation of vertical land motion from volumetric changes in the water level. TRF errors affect tide gauge measurements through GNSS estimates of the vertical land motion at each tide gauge. This talk will discuss the current accuracy of the TRF and how errors in the TRF impact both satellite altimeter and tide gauge sea level measurements. We will also discuss simulations of how the proposed Geodetic ",

            "abstract": "The South Pacific Island countries are vulnerable to natural hazards which cause devastating effects on infrastructure, crops and at times loss of lives and many others. Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one type of natural hazard experienced by Pacific Island countries (PICs). The South Pacific region has two seasons, namely: the cyclone season, running from November to April, and the non-cyclone season, running from May to October. Tropical cyclones are associated with strong winds, rainfall, and thunderstorms generating strong lightning discharges. The analysis of lightning data obtained from the World Wide Lightning Locations Network for the southwest Pacific region, defined as the region bounded between geographic coordinates, latitudes 0 - 40°S, longitudes 135°E - 120°W, during 2013 clearly shows the lightning activity to be higher during the cyclone season due to increased convective activity. The change in the lightning activity with the intensity of 41 TCs of categories 2 to 5 occurring in the southwest Pacific region has been analysed for the years 2005 to 2013. The intensity measurements, as determined by maximum sustained winds and the lightning activity, as determined by flash counts were studied during the stages of evolution of these TCs. Taking into account the lag between peak lightning activity and peak maximum sustained wind, the two quantities; lightning activity and intensity for individual TCs were correlated. Square 10° grid sizes were used along with radial sections to quantify lightning. We quantify lightning occurrences in three distinct sections of the cyclone (eyewall, inner and outer rainbands) to clearly show the lightning characteristics within these different regions. Lightning activity is seen to be greatly variable between different storms, however we do observe lightning outbreaks in the eyewall prior to the intensification of the storm.",

            "abstract": "Traditional active seismic survey can no longer be properly applied in highly populated urban areas due to restrictions in modern civilian life styles. Passive seismic methods, however, have gained much more attention from the engineering geophysics community because of their environmental friendly and deeper investigation depth. Due to extracting signal from noise has never been as comfortable as that in active seismic survey, how to make it more efficiently and accurately has been emphasized. We propose a multi-channel analysis of passive surface waves (MAPW) based on long noise sequences cross-correlations to meet the demand for increasing investigation depth by acquiring surface-wave data at a relative low-frequency range (1 Hz ≤ f ≤ 10 Hz) in urban areas. We utilize seismic interferometry to produce common virtual source gathers from one-hour-long noise records and do dispersion measurements by using the classic passive multi-channel analysis of surface waves (PMASW). We used synthetic tests to demonstrate the advantages of MAPW for various noise distributions. Results show that our method has the superiority of maximizing the analysis accuracy. Finally, we used two field data applications to demonstrate the advantages of our MAPW over the classic PMASW on isolating azimuth of the predominant noise sources and the effectivity of combined survey of active multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) and MAPW. We suggest, for the field operation using MAPW, that a parallel receiver line which is close to a main road or river, if any, with one or two hours noise observation will be an effective means for an unbiased dispersion image.\nKeywords: passive seismic method, MAPW, MASW, cross-correlation, directional noise source, spatial-aliasing effects, inversion",

This process injects organisms and liquids from the surface into the deep subsurface (~2500 m), exposing microorganisms to high pressures, elevated temperatures, chemical additives, and brine-level salinities. Here we use assembly-based metagenomics to create a metabolic blueprint from an energy-producing Marcellus shale well over a 328-day period. Using this approach we ask the question: What abiotic and biotic factors drive microbial metabolism and thus biogeochemical cycling during natural gas extraction? We found that after 49 days, increased salinity in produced waters corresponded to a shift in the microbial community, with only organisms that encode salinity adaptations detected. We posit that organic compatible solutes, produced by organisms adapting to increased salinity, fuels a methylamine-driven ecosystem in fractured shale. This metabolic network ultimately results in biogenic methane production from members of Methanohalophilus and Methanolobus. Proton NMR validated these genomic hypotheses, with mono-methylamine being highest in the input material, but detected throughout the sampling. Beyond abiotic constraints, our genomic investigations revealed that viruses can be linked to key members of the microbial community, potentially releasing methylamine osmoprotectants and impacting bacterial strain variation. Collectively our results indicate that adaptation to high salinity, metabolism in the absence of oxidized electron acceptors, and viral predation are controlling factors mediating microbial community metabolism during hydraulic fracturing of the deep subsurface.",

This presentation will examine how lessons captured from disaster events are mainstreaming the use of global earth observation data and derived products of sufficient reliability and timeliness to provide situational awareness. What is good enough for disaster response is a challenge, especially where the requirements for earth system research and experimentation are not the same as application science and operations. In areas of timeliness and access to data or processing of information to knowledge the economic and policy objectives are not always aligned between research and application. Even when both are addressing substantive science area questions and critical data is available, creating scientifically-informed guidance, forecasts and assessments may take considerable effort to be made accessible and understandable, and even longer to reflect consensus or consistency. Conveying the degree of science certainty and accountability that triggers a threshold for action is always a challenge at the interface of hazard characterization and disaster response. Often decisions and interpretation must be reached when staring down a hazard or potential disaster situation, which makes automation a potential solution. Yet human opinions remain important, social cultural and behavioral context suggest that observational information, maps, models and other derived information is only acted upon when provided by multiple trusted and reliable sources.

            "abstract": "Soil moisture and hydrologic fluxes at the land surface are critical to climate feedback, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycling. Soil moisture temporal and spatial variability over catchment areas affects surface and subsurface runoff, modulates evaporation and transpiration, determines the extent of groundwater recharge and contaminant transport, and initiates or sustains feedback between the land surface and the atmosphere. At a particular point in time soil moisture content is influenced by: (1) the precipitation history, (2) the texture of the soil, which determines the water-holding capacity, (3) the slope of the land surface, which affects runoff and infiltration, and (4) the vegetation and land cover, which influences evapotranspiration and deep percolation. In other terms the partitioning of soil moisture to recharge to the groundwater, evapotranspiration to the atmosphere, and surface/subsurface runoff to the streams at different spatio-temporal scales and under different hydro-climatic conditions pose one of the greatest challenges to weather and climate prediction, water resources availability, sustainability, quality, and variability in agricultural, range and forested watersheds and hydro-climatic conditions. In this context we hypothesize that: 1) soil moisture variability is dominated by soil properties at the field scale, topographic features at the catchment/watershed scale, and vegetation characteristics and precipitation patterns at the regional scale and beyond; and 2) ensemble hydrologic fluxes (evapotranspiration, infiltration, and shallow ground water recharge) across the vadose zone at the corresponding scale can be effectively represented by one or more soil, topography, vegetation, or climate scale factors. Using ground-based and various active and passive microwave remote sensing measurements during the NASA field campaigns in the past decade we test these hypotheses. Various scaling techniques for soil moisture and soil hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes are presented.",

            "abstract": "Here we use stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in the tissue of two bathymodiolin mussel species with different chemotrophic symbionts (methanotrophs in B. platifrons and sulfide-oxidizers in B. aduloides) to gain insights into the biogeochemical processes at an active site in 1120 m depth on the Formosa Ridge, called Site F. Because mussels with methanotrophic symbionts acquire the isotope signature of the used methane, the average δ13C values of B. platifrons (–70.3‰; n=36) indicates a biogenic methane source at Site F, consistent with the measured carbon isotope signature of methane (–61.1‰ to –58.7‰) sampled 1.5 m above the mussel beds. The only small offset between the δ13C signatures of the ascending methane and the authigenic carbonate at site F (as low as –55.3‰) suggests only minor mixing of the pore water with marine bicarbonate, which in turn may be used as an indicator for advective rather than diffusive seepage at this site. B. aduloides has much higher average δ13C values of –34.4‰ (n=9), indicating inorganic carbon (DIC) dissolved in epibenthic bottom water as its main carbon source. The DIC was apparently marine bicarbonate with a small contribution of 13C-depleted carbon from locally oxidized methane. The δ34S values of the two mussel species indicate that they used two different sulfur sources. B. platifrons (average δ34S = +6.4±2.6‰; n=36) used seawater sulfate mixed with isotopically light re-oxidized sulfide from the sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), while the sulfur source of B. aduloides (δ34S = –8.0±3.1‰; n=9) was AOM-derived sulfide used by its symbionts. δ15N values differed between the mussels, with B. platifrons having a wider range of on average slightly lower values (mean = +0.5±0.7‰, n=36) than B. aduloides (mean = +1.1±0.0‰). These values are significantly lower than δ15N values of South China Sea deep-sea sediments (+5‰ to +6‰), indicating that the organic nitrogen is of local origin, possibly resulting from the activity of autotrophic bacteria and due to assimilation of isotopically light nitrate or ammonium by the symbionts.\nAcknowledgments: Financial support was provided by the NSF of China (Grants: 41422602 and 41373085) and the “Hundred Talents Program” of CAS.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice melting is accelerating in the Barents and Kara Seas. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the accelerated loss of polar sea ice, which remains an open question. In the present study, the detailed physical mechanism of sea ice melting in winter is identified using the daily ERA interim reanalysis data. Downward longwave radiation is an essential element for sea ice melting, but can only be sustained by excessive upward heat flux from the sea surface exposed to air in the region of sea ice loss. This energy is used to increase air temperature in the lower troposphere, which in turn increases downward longwave radiation. This feedback process is clearly observed in the Barents and Kara Seas in the reanalysis data. A quantitative assessment reveals that this feedback process is amplifying at the rate of ~8.9% every year during 1979-2014. Based on this estimate, sea ice will completely disappear in the Barents and Kara Seas by around 2022. Availability of excessive heat flux is necessary for the maintenance of this melting feedback process; a similar sea ice melting mechanism is expected to take place over the sea-ice covered polar region when sea ice is not fully recovered in winter.",

            "abstract": "New evidence suggests that interannual variability in zonal-mean meridional circulation and precipitation can be partially attributed to the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), the dominant mode of climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics. A cross-seasonal correlation exists between the December–February (DJF) SAM and March–May (MAM) zonal-mean meridional circulation and precipitation. This correlation is not confined to the SH: it also extends to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) subtropics. When the preceding DJF SAM is positive, anticlockwise and clockwise meridional cells, accompanied by less and more precipitation, occur alternately between the SH middle latitudes and NH subtropics in MAM. In particular, less precipitation occurs in the SH middle latitudes, the SH tropics, and the NH subtropics, but more precipitation occurs in the SH subtropics and the NH tropics. A framework is built to explain the cross-seasonal impact of SAM-related SST anomalies. Evidence indicates that the DJF SAM tends to lead to dipole-like SST anomalies in the SH extratropics, which are referred to in this study as the SH ocean dipole (SOD). The DJF SOD can persist until the following MAM when it begins to modulate MAM meridional circulation and large-scale precipitation. Atmospheric general circulation model simulations further verify that MAM meridional circulation between the SH middle latitudes and the northern subtropics responds to the MAM SOD.",

            "abstract": "The use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) has gained increasing attention in the field of hydrology, because WSNs offer a unique potential to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture at scales beyond the field scale. In addition, they provide unique opportunities for the validation of numerical models, hydrogeophysical measurement techniques, as well as for the calibration and validation of remotely sensed soil moisture data. In this presentation, we will discuss results of temporal and spatially resolved measurements of soil moisture using WSNs installed in two different small-scale catchments under forest (Wüstebach, Germany) and grassland (Rollesbroich, Germany). In combination with measurements of hydrological fluxes, we were able to close the water balance of the Wüstebach catchment up to 3% of the yearly rainfall. In addition, changes between wet and dry states of the catchment could be observed and related to a critical soil moisture content. Using stochastic analysis of water flow in the unsaturated zone and pedotransfer functions, we were able to predict subgrid variability of soil moisture. This framework also allowed deriving the spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters using the relationship between the variance of soil moisture and its mean soil water content. Finally, soil moisture data from the WSN in the Wüstebach catchment were used to validate a detailed hydrologic model of the catchment using empirical orthogonal functions and coherence wavelet analysis. Further development of wireless sensing technologies will include the monitoring of soil moisture potential and biogeochemical properties such as redox potential.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeophysical methods are ideally suited to characterize subsurface hydrologic structures and processes within the critical zone. Recent improvements in the acquisition and inversion of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and ElectroMagnetic Induction (EMI) data now enable to characterize the subsurface in terms of spatially distributed information on soil and hydrologic properties, and to monitor hydrological processes using time-lapse measurements. We will illustrate these new developments by presenting three example cases. The first case illustrates the potential of using GPR full-waveform inversion techniques to obtain detailed information on subsurface porosity. For this purpose, we used cross-borehole GPR measurements along a series of longitudinal and transversal transects at the test site Krauthausen. The obtained information is key for modelling flow and solute transport because the high resolution of the GPR inversion results allows to study the effect of hydraulic connectivity on solute transport. In the following two cases, we illustrate the potential of multi-receiver electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors that enable the imaging of the soil at different depths. The second case deals with the mapping of peat land properties at the field scale. We used multi-coil offset EMI measurements to provide spatial estimates of SOC content, bulk density, and SOC stock. Together with laser scanning elevation and soil core reference data, regression equations were built predicting SOC content, bulk density, and SOC stocks. EMI-derived explanatory variables were shown to strongly determine the prediction quality of the regression equations. In the last example, we investigated the origin of observed leaf area index (LAI) patterns that indicate crop performance. Using multi-coil offset EMI, we obtained a moderate to excellent spatial consistency of ECa and LAI patterns. It was concluded from these EMI measurements that improved crop performance was related to a higher water storage capacity as well as a higher subsoil clay content. Overall, these two case studies clearly showed that this new generation of EMI devices can be used to obtain quantitative information about dominant features in subsurface layering up to a depth of 2 m for areas up to several hectares in a fast and non-invasive manner.",

            "abstract": "Dust input into the ocean-atmosphere system has significant ramifications for biogeochemical cycles and global climate, yet direct observations of dust deposition in the ocean, especially at higher latitudes, are scarce. The long-lived isotope Thorium-232 is greatly enriched in upper continental crust compared to oceanic crust and mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-like volcanogenic material. In open ocean areas, away from fluvial and ice-rafted sources of continental material, it is assumed to be of eolian origin. In conjunction with 230Th-flux normalization, 232Th measurements in marine sediments are thus a promising new proxy for dust accumulation in the present and past ocean. Here, we present \"ThoroMap\", a global data compilation of >300 previously published 230Th-normalized fluxes of 232Th, complemented by unpublished data. In the equatorial Atlantic and eastern equatorial Pacific, there is excellent agreement between late Holocene sedimentary dust fluxes and dust deposition estimates derived from 2 recent coupled atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea-ice models (CCSM3, CAM4). At higher latitudes (between 40 and 60 degrees), careful site selection is necessary to avoid areas where eolian contributions to seafloor sediments are overwhelmed by ice rafted material. After addressing this caveat, the new database shows great potential for significantly increasing the spatial coverage of dust deposition records in the high latitudes, especially in the NW Pacific and S-Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Electronic structure of Fe2+-bearing wadsleyite b-(Mg,Fe2+)SiO4 has been investigated by first-principles calculations based on the density function theory. Crystal structure of wadsleyite is characterized by edge-sharing octahedra. The single chains of M1 and M2 octahedra running parallel to b-axis are cross-linked by the double columns of M3 octahedra parallel to a-axis. In the wadsleyite structure, Fe2+ cation orders preferentially into the M1 and M3 sites. Electron configuration analysis of the Fe2+ reveals that the dxy, dyz, dzx orbitals (lower energy orbital t2g) of Fe2+ are occupied by 0.430, 1.931, 1.923 electrons, while the dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals (higher energy orbital eg) are filled with 1.809 and 0.434 electrons, respectively. The asymmetric electron occupations of the t2g and eg can lead to the Jahn-Teller distortion around the octahedrally coordinated Fe2+. The molecular orbital calculation shows that the electron orbitals in the Fe2+-bearing wadsleyite are completely localized at the Fe3d orbitals and O2p orbital in the M3 sites, which causes the repulsive interactions between the Fe3d orbitals and O2p orbital. The strong repulsion is responsible for the Jahn-Teller distortion in the structure. In contrast, little localization of electron orbitals is observable in the Fe2+-free wadsleyite. Therefore, the presence of Fe2+ appears to destabilize the wadsleyite structure. This is the reason that the stability of wadsleyite is limited to the Mg-rich portion of the (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 binary system. Since coordination polyhedra of Fe3+ exhibit no Jahn–Teller distortions, on the other hand, a continuous substitution of Fe3+ can occur in wadsleyite via a coupled substitution of 2Fe3+ = Si4+ + Fe2+ without structural change, which suggests that the Jahn–Teller effect of Fe2+ is critically important for the phase stability of wadsleyite.",

            "abstract": "Rapid population and economic growth, and the increase in extreme weather events, are destabilizing global food security. In Asia, rice is a staple cereal crop, and the continent accounts for about 90% of global rice production and consumption. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Global Agricultural Monitoring (GLAM) was launched in 2011 to utilize remote sensing tools to enhance crop production projections in order to promote food security and foster sustainable economic growth. Asia-‐‑‒Rice Crop Estimation & Monitoring (Asia-‐‑‒RiCE) is a component of GEOGLAM, and aims to use remote sensing tools to develop rice-‐‑‒related information such as maps of paddy fields, rice growing conditions, yield, and production. However, in some regions in Southeast Asia, rice is planted and harvested more than twice a year, and the crop calendar is quite complicated. In addition, rice is mainly cultivated in the rainy season, and the high density of cloud cover during that season limits the observations that can be made from space using only optical sensors. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a robust tool because it penetrates cloud cover; however, the revisit frequency of a single SAR satellite is limited, making it difficult to capture the complicated rice crop calendar in Asia. In this research, time-‐‑‒series SAR data were fused with optical data to monitor rice crops in Southeast Asia with complicated crop calendars. In addition, a microwave radiometer that also penetrates clouds and has a high revisit frequency but a coarse spatial resolution (greater than several kilometers), was used. The integrated use of a large variety of satellite data enables us to periodically monitor surface conditions such as water inundation, transplanting, and rice crop growth and harvesting, which in turn enables us to examine rice planted areas, rice crop calendars, and rice growing conditions in order to estimate rice production.

            "abstract": "Several mission concepts are being studied to directly image planets around nearby stars. It is commonly thought that directly imaging a potentially habitable exoplanet around a Sun-like star requires space telescopes with apertures of at least 1m. A notable exception to this is Alpha Centauri (A and B), which is an extreme outlier among FGKM stars in terms of apparent habitable zone size: the habitable zones are ~3x wider in apparent size than around any other FGKM star and are thus in theory accessible to much smaller telescopes. Alpha Centauri is also an extreme outlier in terms of how bright its planets are. For example, an Earth-like planet would be several magnitudes brighter around Alpha Centauri than around any other Sun-like star. Alpha Centauri lies in the galactic plane but its high brightness and proper motion make confusion with background stars unlikely, and extinction by our own galaxy makes confusion with extragalactic sources unlikely. The high brightness also helps any planet stand out against exozodiacal light. Alpha Centauri B has a (probable) planet, which establishes that a planetary system has formed in the system despite the multiplicity of the system. Dynamical simulations show that the habitable zones around both Alpha Centauri A and B are stable, and RV measurements rule out any large planets in the system that may have disrupted the formation of habitable planets. Recently developed high contrast techniques enable the detection of planets in multi-star systems, enabling imaging planets around Alpha Centauri. In particular, a small ~30-45cm visible light space telescope equipped with a modern high performance coronagraph or starshade is sufficient to directly image any potentially habitable planet that may exist in the system.",

            "abstract": "Variability of the 142Nd/144Nd ratio can reflect Sm/Nd fractionation during the lifetime of 146Sm, i.e. the first 500 Ma of Solar System history1 and nucleosynthetic heterogeneity inherited from the solar nebula. Deciphering the message carried by 142Nd variability requires a detailed examination of the data for Earth and meteorites. The elevated 142Nd/144Nd in terrestrial samples relative to average chondrites suggests that all terrestrial rocks sampled by volcanism over the Earth’s history come from a geochemical reservoir characterized by a superchondritic Sm/Nd ratio. The chemical compliment to this reservoir, however, has never been seen, so it either was lost during Earth’s accretion2,3, or is preserved in a deep hidden reservoir 1,4. These models are based on a comparison of Earth rocks and O-chondrites because they do not show any variation in stable Sm and Nd isotopic composition compared to Earth6-8. The first analyzed E-chondrites with terrestrial 142Nd/144Nd showed 144Sm excesses that reflect an excess p-process contribution. Although 142Nd is mainly produced by s-process, there is a direct p-process component estimated to be lower than 4 %.\nWe will present new Sm and Nd isotopic data on meteoritic materials. CAIs show deficits in both r- and p-process isotopes that would lead to elevated 142Nd, yet the bulk C-chondrites in which they are contained show excesses in r-process isotopes and hence 142Nd/144Nd lower than terrestrial. The new E-chondrites data do not confirm the 142Nd-144Sm correlation observed in bulk chondrites In light of these results and using 146Sm-142Nd isochrons for constraining the bulk 142Nd/144Nd ratio of planetary bodies, we will discuss the 142Nd signature of terrestrial samples (from Hadean to present).\n1Boyet & Carlson, Science 2005; 2O’Neill & Palme, Phil.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed an increasingly complex structure of the Earth’s inner core (IC) in properties such as seismic velocity, attenuation, anisotropy, and differential rotation. In addition, the inner core boundary (ICB) has proven to be more complex than just a dividing boundary between the liquid outer core and the solid IC.\nOn one hand, these advancements have been achieved due to the availability of new data. On the other hand, this is due to better computational facilities, the introduction of new mathematical techniques to this field of study, and a multidisciplinary approach.\nThrough first principles treatment of global seismological differential travel time data, it is possible to acquire a complex mineralogical structure of the IC, consisting of at least three different phases of iron. This has the potential to unify seismological observations and interpretation of IC anisotropy with mineral physics and recent geodynamical scenarios suggesting a predominant degree 1 structure in the IC, although a new complexity emerges from recent attenuation and isotropic velocity studies. A number of studies have recently shown lateral variability of these properties in the uppermost IC, to an increasingly more complex extent than a simple harmonic degree 1.\nWhile large earthquakes recorded on individual stations constrain established ray-path corridors through the IC, large arrays provide an unprecedented and overwhelming number of deep Earth-sensitive data. For example, the most complete collection of empirical travel time curves of core phases, from simultaneous recordings of a distant individual earthquake on hundreds of stations is now within reach. Similarly, we can recover hundreds of simultaneous observations of PKiKP and PcP waves from more proximate earthquakes. Traditionally, these have been used to study the sharpness of the ICB by a far more modest number of data points in the time domain. A new study of these observations in the frequency domain reveals the existence of small-scale topography at the ICB and puts invaluable constraints on the process of solidification and melting of the IC in the eastern hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "The newly acquired possibility of retrieving from the SUOMI/NPP satellite the cloud base drop concentrations and updrafts made it possible to calculate cloud base vapor super saturation (S) and thus the CCN(S) over the GOAmazon domain, and validate it against surface and aircraft measurements. This was used to map the Manaus air pollution plume and observe its impact on cloud drop effective radius, precipitation forming processes and glaciation temperatures. These observations allow completing and extending the patchy picture obtained by the aircraft measurements over the full domain of interest. The methodology will be shown, as well as the main findings. By the time of the writing of this abstract we have already documented that during pristine conditions the CCN(S) is nearly double in the Manaus plume with respect to the background of ~200 cm-3 at S = 0.25 to 0.3%. The S of cloud base in the Manaus pollution plume is lower by about 0.05 to 0.1%. The cloud depth for initiation of warm rain increases by more than one km due to the decrease in cloud drop effective radius, as indicated by the increase in the isotherm level where it reaches the threshold of 14 micrometer. During smoky conditions, caused by distant biomass burning, the background CCN overwhelms the Manaus plume; CCN can exceed 1000 cm-3 at S < 0.2%, and the height of rain initiation can exceed the 0° isotherm level. This means that the effects on clouds incurred by biomass burning dwarf the effects of the Manaus pollution plume.",

It is well known that, upon impinging on the lithosphere at spreading ridges or intra-oceanic settings, mantle plumes generate hotspots, Large Igneous Provinces and considerable dynamic topography. However, it is still poorly understood which is the active role of mantle plumes on subducting slabs. Here we show that the stagnancy and fastest trench retreat of the Tonga slab in Southwestern Pacific are consistent with an interaction with the big Samoan plume and the Hikurangi plateau. Our findings are based on comparisons between 3-D anisotropic tomography images and 3-D petrological-thermo-mechanical models, which show complex mantle flow around the slab and intense deformation and anisotropy in the transition zone, explaining several unique features in the Fiji-Tonga area self-consistently. We also found that horizontally polarized shear waves (SH) are faster than vertically polarized shear waves (SV) in the mid mantle beneath the Tonga slab, which may indicate a dominant dislocation creep mechanism during the slab-plume interaction. We propose possible slip systems of bridgmanite in the lower mantle that reconcile the observed seismic anisotropy with thermo-mechanical calculations.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of sediment dynamics allows to get insight in driving forces and internal dynamics of the sediment cascade system. A useful tool to achieve this is the sediment budget approach, which encompasses the quantification of different sinks and sources. A Holocene time-differentiated sediment budget has been constructed for the Belgian Dijle River catchment (720 km²), based on a large set of field data. The results show how soil erosion is driven by land use changes over longer timescales. Sediment redistribution and the relative importance of the different sinks also vary over time, mainly as a result of changing land use and related landscape connectivity. However, the coarse temporal resolution typically associated with Holocene studies complicates the understanding of sub-millennial scale processes.\nIn a second step, the field-based sediment budget was combined with a modeling approach using Watem/Sedem, a spatially distributed model that simulates soil erosion and colluvial deposition. After validation of the model calibration against the sediment budget, the model was used in a sensitivity analysis. Results confirm the overwhelming influence of human land use on both soil erosion and landscape connectivity, whereas the climatic impact is comparatively small. In addition to catchment-wide simulations, the model also served to test the relative importance of lynchets and dry valleys in different environments.\nFinally, the geomorphic model was used to simulate past land use, taking into account equifinality. For this purpose, a large series of hypothetical time-independent land use maps of the Dijle catchment were modeled based on a multi-objective allocation algorithm, and applied in Watem/Sedem. Modeled soil erosion and sediment deposition outcomes for each scenario were subsequently compared with the field-based record, taking into account uncertainties. As such, the model allows to evaluate and select realistic land use scenarios for the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Acid rock drainage is a natural weathering process that is often exacerbated by mining activities, common in onshore sulphide ore deposits, that can lead to considerable environmental impact. A similar 'weathering process' occurs at seafloor massive sulphide (SMS) ore deposits. In contrast to the onshore situation, the expected consequence in the marine environment is often considered to be oxide formation, negligible metal release and minimal net acid generation due to the high buffering capacity of seawater and low solubility of iron at near neutral pH. However, no dissolution studies exist that emulate the true composition of sulphide ore deposits that either sit passively on the seafloor or are actively mined in this colder, more saline, and alkaline environment. In particular, these deposits will include a variety of minerals, and it is the interaction of these minerals and inclusions in regards to galvanic cells that can subsequently increase the dissolution of metals into the water column. Any heavy metal release that is not balanced by subsequent oxidation and precipitation, has the potential to produce toxicity for benthic ecosystems, bioaccumulation and dispersal through currents.\nThe present work has sought to provide a pilot investigation on the deep sea weathering of sulphide minerals, by identifying the mineral phases, trace elements and potential galvanic couples that may arise in sulphide mineral samples collected from various tectonic settings. Samples have been analysed using EMPA and LA-ICPMS in order to identify the range of trace elements and toxins that may be contributed to the water column, especially heavy metals and environmental toxins (e.g. Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Cd, As, Sb, Sn, Hg). Our observations raise important questions about which ore deposits could have more or less environmental impact during any mining activity.\nThese observations will be used to design oxidative dissolution experiments at deep-sea conditions utilising the natural sulphide ore deposits characterised here. As well as elucidation of the natural weathering process and the economic value of residual deposits, the nature of oxides formed in these experiments may be developed as a tool for detection of deposits associated with inactive vents.",

            "abstract": "MODIS is one of the key instruments currently operated on two major missions for the NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) program: Terra and Aqua launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively. Nearly 40 data products have been routinely generated from both Terra and Aqua MODIS observations and widely distributed to the science community and users worldwide for their studies of the earth’s system and changes in its geophysical properties. To date, each MODIS instrument operation remains nominal and its on-board calibrators (OBC) continue to function satisfactorily. On a regular basis, MODIS reflective solar bands (RSB) calibration is performed by a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). For the thermal emissive bands (TEB), an on-board blackbody (BB) provides a scan-by-scan calibration reference. Since launch, extensive calibration and characterization activities have been scheduled and implemented by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) to produce and update calibration look-up tables (LUT). This presentation provides an overview of both Terra and Aqua MODIS instrument status, their on-orbit operation and calibration activities, and radiometric, spectral, and spatial performance. It describes calibration changes (algorithms and look-up tables) made for the MODIS Level 1B (L1B) data collection 6 (C6) and discusses remaining challenging issues and ongoing effort for future improvements. As expected, lessons from both Terra and Aqua MODIS have benefitted and will continue to help the S-NPP and JPSS VIIRS instruments in terms of on-orbit operation strategies and calibration enhancements.",

            "abstract": "To understand the whereabouts of CO2 during glacials and its pathways during deglacial transitions is one of the main priorities in paleoclimate research. The opposing patterns of atmospheric CO2 and Δ14C suggest that the bulk of CO2 was released from an old and therefore 14C-depleted carbon reservoir. As the modern deep ocean, below ~2000 m, stores up to 60-times more carbon than the entire atmosphere, it is considered to be a major driver of the atmospheric CO2 pattern, storing CO2 during glacials, releasing it during deglacial transitions.\nWe use a South Pacific transect of sediment cores, covering the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) and the Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of oceanic Δ14C over the last 30,000 years.\nDuring the last glacial, we find significantly 14C-depleted waters between 2000 and 4300 m water depth, indicating a strong stratification and the storage of carbon in these water masses. However, two sediment cores from 2500 m and 3600 m water depth reveal an extreme glacial atmosphere-to-deep-water Δ14C offset of up to -1000‰ and ventilation ages (deep-water to atmosphere 14C-age difference) of ~8000 years. Such old water masses are expected to be anoxic, yet there is no evidence of anoxia in the glacial S-Pacific.\nRecent studies showed an increase of Mid Ocean Ridge (MOR) volcanism during glacials due to the low stand of global sea level. For this reason, we hypothesize that the admixture of 14C-dead carbon via tectonic activity along MORs might have contributed to these extremely low radiocarbon values. With a simple 1-box model, we calculated if the admixture of hydrothermal CO2 has the potential to lower the deep Pacific Δ14C signal.\nWe show that if the oceanic turnover time is at least 2700 years, an increased hydrothermal flux of 1.2 µmol kg-1 yr-1 has the potential to reproduce the extreme radiocarbon values observed in our records.",

            "abstract": "To help produce accurate and consistent maritime hazard products, the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) Strategic Plan includes a requirement to develop and run a benchmarking workshop to evaluate the numerical tsunami modeling of currents. For this workshop, five different benchmarking datasets were organized. These datasets were selected based on characteristics such as geometric complexity, currents that are shear/separation driven (and thus are de-coupled from the incident wave forcing), tidal coupling, and interaction with the built environment. While tsunami simulation models have generally been well validated against wave height and runup, comparisons with speed data are much less common. As model results are increasingly being used to estimate or indicate damage to coastal infrastructure, understanding the accuracy and precision of speed predictions becomes of important. As a result of this 2-day workshop held in early 2015, modelers now have a better awareness of their ability to accurately capture the physics of tsunami currents, and therefore a better understanding of how to use these simulation tools for hazard assessment and mitigation efforts. In this presentation, the model results – from 14 different modelers – will be presented and summarized, with a focus on statistical and ensemble properties of the current predictions.",

            "abstract": "Floods cause billions of dollars of economic damage each year, and this is expected to increase in the future due to socioeconomic development and climate change. To limit these losses, and to protect people and their livelihoods from flooding, adaptation in flood risk management systems is required that takes into account both current and future risk. Whilst several global scale flood risk models have now been developed to assess both current and future river flood risk, to date none of these include currently installed or future flood risk management measures, nor their costs and benefits. In this contribution, a new modelling framework is presented for assessing both the costs and benefits of flood risk management at the global scale, which employs a cascade of models to provide first-cut estimates of the costs and benefits of adaptation by means of hazard reduction through the construction of dikes.\nThe modeling framework is first used to assess what protection standards would be required in the future per state, in order to keep future flood risk constant at today’s levels, and the costs and benefits associated with such a strategy. In a second analysis, flood risk protection standards are calculated per state that optimize the net present value of adaptation. The potential usefulness and limitations of the results for practical applications are discussed, as well as key avenues for future developments. In particular, recent research has shown flood risk itself to be non-stationary, being influenced by oscillations in climate variability caused by phenomenon such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results of the research will be discussed within the context of climate-driven ENSO variability.",

            "abstract": "We analyse the physics and geometry of trade-offs between Earth structure and noise sources in inter-station noise correlations. Our approach is based on the computation of off-diagonal Hessian elements that describe the extent to which variations in noise sources can compensate for variations in Earth structure without changing the misfit beyond the measurement uncertainty. Despite the fact that all ambient noise inverse problems are special in terms of their receiver configuration and data, some general statements concerning source-structure trade-offs can be made: (i) While source-structure trade-offs may be reduced to some extent by clever measurement design, there are inherent trade-offs that can generally not be avoided. These inherent trade-offs may lead to a mispositioning of structural heterogeneities when the noise source distribution is unknown. (ii) When attenuation is weak, source-structure trade-offs in ambient noise correlations are a global phenomenon, meaning that there is no noise source perturbation that does not trade-off with some Earth structure, and vice versa. (iii) The most significant source-structure trade-offs occur within two elliptically shaped regions connecting a potential noise source perturbation to each one of the receivers. (iv) Far from these elliptical regions, only small-scale structure can trade off against changes in the noise source. (v) While source-structure trade-offs mostly decay with increasing attenuation, they are nearly unaffected by attenuation when the noise source perturbation is located near the receiver-receiver line.\nWe complement these theoretical considerations by numerical experiments where we model ambient noise correlations for arbitrary source geometries. The experiments illustrate how and to which extent unknown noise sources may map into spurious Earth structure.\nThis work is intended to contribute to the development of joint source-structure inversions of ambient noise correlations, and in particular to an understanding of the extent to which source-structure trade-offs may be reduced. It furthermore establishes the foundation of future resolution analyses that properly quantify trade-offs between noise sources and Earth structure.",

            "abstract": "The crustal and upper mantle velocity structures in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are obtained from joint analysis of receiver functions and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves derived from teleseismic earthquake arrivals and ambient noise seismic data. The resulting velocity model reveals a close correlation between the thick (>60 km) crust and the presence of an intra-crustal low-velocity zone, which is detected beneath the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes as well as the northwestern Qilian orogen. However, the high Vp/Vs ratio is found only beneath the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes. The crustal low-velocity zone is not observed beneath the west Qinling and southeastern Qilian orogens, which have a relatively thin (~50 km) crust, indicating that crustal channel flow is not the primary mechanism by which the northeastern Tibetan plateau grows. In contrast to the widespread low velocities in the mid-to-lower crust beneath the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganzi terranes, the upper mantle in these two regions shows alternating high and low velocity anomalies. A continuous low-velocity zone from the mid-to-lower crust down to 140 km beneath the eastern Kunlun fault suggests an induced local mantle upwelling after the delamination of the lithosphere.",

Between February 2012 and January 2013 a network of 24 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers was in operation around the volcanic archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. Ambient noise data from the OBS and a seismic station on Nightingale Island were used to constrain the crustal and uppermost structure around the island. From the vertical and hydrophone recordings of more than 300 days we could reconstruct the ambient noise Green's functions by cross-correlation. The dispersion curves of Rayleigh/Scholte waves could be derived from the cross-correlations in the period range from 2 to 32 seconds. Group velocity maps were determined for each individual period using travel time tomography. These group velocity maps were converted to depth by dispersion curve inversion to construct a 3D S-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle in the region. This model shows a strong velocity anomaly beneath the Tristan da Cunha archipelago. The influence of the water depth on the inversion is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The advent of shale oil and shale gas into the energy landscape has relied on achieving vigorous stimulation of the rock by means of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Traditionally, hydraulic fracturing is understood as a single-fluid-phase, pressure-driven process, in which the fluid (typically water with additives) is injected at a high-enough rate that the pressure builds up faster than it can dissipate by permeating into the rock, thereby fracturing it. However, the prevalent conditions for shale (ultra fine pore size, moderate overburden stress, and poor cementation) suggest that capillary forces could play an important role in the fracturing process.\nHere, we show the results of our recent experimental and theoretical studies on fracturing of granular media by means of injection of an immiscible fluid. We conduct carefully controlled injection experiments in a quasi-2D granular medium (a circular Hele-Shaw cell filled with glass beads), in an experimental set-up that allows us to systematically study the impact of capillarity (by varying injection rate, bead size, and fluid-fluid surface tension), wetting properties (by treating the beads and the cell plates by chemical vapor deposition of silane-based substances) and confinement (by varying the load on the cell). Our choice of defending and invading liquids and granular medium allows us to investigate a wide range of contact angles, from drainage to imbibition. We demonstrate that wettability exerts a powerful influence on the invasion/fracturing morphology of unfavorable mobility displacements. High time resolution imaging techniques and particle image velocimetry (PIV) allow us to quantify matrix displacement and fracture opening dynamics. Our results provide insights on fracture propagation, fracture length distribution and the fracture drainage area, parameters which are critically important to better understand long-term hydrocarbon production from shale.",

            "abstract": "In addition to material and energy flows, the dynamics and functions of the Earth's critical zone are intensively mediated by biological actions performed by diverse organisms. These biological actions are modulated by the expression of functional genes and their translation into enzymes that catalyze geochemical reactions, such as nutrient turnover and pollutant biodegradation. Although geobiology, as an interdisciplinary research area, is playing and vital role in linking biological and geochemical processes at different temporal and spatial scales, the distribution and transport of functional genes have rarely been investigated from the Earth's critical zone perspectives.\nTo illustrate the framework of studies on the transport and transformation of genetic information in the critical zone, antibiotic resistance is taken as an example. Antibiotic resistance genes are considered as a group of emerging contaminants, and their emergence and spread within the critical zone on one hand are induced by anthropogenic activities, and on other hand are threatening human health worldwide. The transport and transformation of antibiotic resistance genes are controlled by both horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells and the movement of bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance genes. In this paper, the fate and behavior of antibiotic resistance genes will be discussed in the following aspects: 1) general overview of environmental antibiotic resistance; 2) high through quantification of the resistome in various environmental media; 3) pathways of resistance gene flow within the critical zone; and 4) potential strategies in mitigating antibiotic resistance, particularly from the critical zone perspectives.",

This ongoing societal change has profound impacts on environmental quality and population health. In addition to intensive discharges of waste, urbanization is not only changing the land use and land cover, but also inducing fundamental changes in biogeochemical processes. Unlike biogeochemistry in non-urban environment, the biological component of urban biogeochemistry is dominated by direct human activities, such as air pollution derived from transport, wastewater treatment, garbage disposal and increase in impervious surface etc. Managing urban biogeochemistry will include source control over waste discharge, eco-infrastructure (such as green space and eco-drainage), resource recovery from urban waste stream, and integration with peri-urban ecosystem, particularly with food production system. The overall goal of managing urban biogeochemistry is for human health and wellbeing, which is a global challenge. In this paper, the current status of urban biogeochemistry research in China will be briefly reviewed, and then it will focus on nutrient recycling and waste management, as these are the major driving forces of environmental quality changes in urban areas. This paper will take a holistic view on waste management, covering urban metabolism analysis, technological innovation and integration for resource recovery from urban waste stream, and risk management related to waste recycling and recovery.",

            "abstract": "Land surface hydrology is influenced by atmospheric controls at a wide range of spatial scales. However, larger scale atmospheric variation can be particularly useful when considering hydrological variation over longer time periods. Here, a series of examples are discussed which demonstrate both the increased understanding that can be obtained from identifying relationships between large-scale climate and land surface hydrology, together with their potential limitations, particularly in light of decadal-scale variability. The first set of examples relate to a series of process-based relationships between modes of atmospheric variation and both river flow and meteorological drought in the north Atlantic-European region. The identification of these relationships, including the cascade of processes linking atmospheric circulation to land surface hydrology, provides a framework within which ocean-atmosphere-land surface hydrology relationships and teleconnections in this region can be understood. Although many of these relationships appear stable (within the time period of analysis), other examples of large-scale climate relationships to land surface hydrology have been shown to vary over time. For example, a series of investigations in New Zealand have shown that climate-river flow relationships based on certain patterns of large-scale atmospheric variation are strong in some time periods yet weak or non-existent in others. In part, this may be due to interaction between relatively quick and slow varying components of the climate system (particularly associated with the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation). As such, it is essential to understand the decadal-scale context within which teleconnections between large-scale atmospheric variation and hydrological systems operate, before such relationships can be used as a means to reduce uncertainties in modelling hydrological changes.",

            "abstract": "Rifting often initiates on former continental collision zones. For example, the present-day passive margins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans formed after continental break-up occurred on relatively young and very old sutures, such as Morocco–Nova Scotia and East Antarctica–Australia, respectively. Rifts may localize on former collision zones for several reasons: orogens are thermally weak because of the increase in heat producing elements in their thicker crustal root, the inherited thrust faults form large-scale heterogeneities, and in the case of young sutures, extensional collapse of the orogen may help initiate rifting.\nWe highlight the impact of collision zone inheritance on continental extension and rifted margin architecture using numerical experiments. We first explicitly prescribe collisional structures in the initial setup, such as increased crustal thickness and inherited thrust faults. Varying the prescribed structures results in different rift to break-up durations and margin widths. Our second series of experiments creates a collision zone through subduction and closure of an ocean. We confirm that post-collisional collapse is not a sufficient trigger for continental rifting and that a change in regional plate motions is required. When extension occurs, the weak former subduction interface and the elevated temperatures in the crustal nappe stack work in tandem as the main deformation localizers for continental rifting. Our experiments show that different approaches of initiating a continental rift result in different dynamics of the crust and mantle, thereby impacting rift geometry, rift to break-up duration, and exhumation of subduction-related sediments and oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we use old wind direction records to reconstruct indices for the West African Monsoon (WAM) and the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Since centuries ago, ships departing from the naval European powers circumnavigated Africa in their route to the Far East. Most of these ships took high-quality observations preserved in logbooks. We show that wind direction observations taken aboard ships can be used to track the seasonal wind reversal typical of monsoonal circulations.\nThe persistence of the SW winds in the 20W-17W and 7N-13N region is highly correlated with the WAM strength and Sahel’s precipitation. It has been possible to build a WAM index back to the 19th Century. Our results show that in the Sahel, the second half of the 19thCentury was significantly wetter than present day. The relation of the WAM with the ENSO cycle, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation was low and instable from the 1840s to the 1970s, when they abruptly suffered an unprecedented reinforcement which last up to the present day.\nThe persistence of the SSW wind in the 60E-80E and 8N-12N area has been used to track the ISM onset since the 1880s. We found evidences of later than average onset dates during the 1900-1925 and 1970-1990 periods and earlier than average onset between 1940 and 1965. A significant relation between the ISM onset and the PDO restricted to shifts from negative to positive PDO phases has been found.\nThe most significant contribution of our study is the fact that we have shown that it is possible to build consistent monsoon indices of instrumental character using solely direct observations of wind direction. Our indices have been generated by using data currently available in the ICOADS 2.5 database, but a large amount of wind observations for periods previous to the 20thcentury still remain not explored in thousands of logbooks preserved in British archives. The interest of unveil these data to track the monsoons for more than 200 -or even 300 years- it is difficult to exaggerate and will largely justify the time and economic costs of its digitation.\nThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad through the project INCITE (CGL2013-44530-P).",

Detrital zircons from the two Taiwanese Rivers show seven major age groups of 100-200 Ma, 200-300 Ma, 360-550 Ma, 700-850 Ma, 0.9-1.1 Ga, 1.8-2.0 Ga and 2.4-2.6 Ga, which correspond well with major tectonic and magmatic events in east mainland. Nevertheless, the U-Pb age distributions have significant difference between east and west Taiwan terranes, showing high proportion of Phanerozoic zircons in east Taiwan and more complex age population and more Precambrian zircons in west Taiwan. This reveals obviously different sedimentary evolution between east and west Taiwan terranes. A series of methods (kernel density estimation plot, cumulative probability plot, overlap and similarity and a simple provenance model) are carried out to compare the U-Pb age distributions between Taiwan and east Chinese mainland, hence the source-sink relationship between them can be investigated. The Eocene-late Oligocene sequences of the Hsuehshan Range and the Miocene turbidity sequences of the east Central Range in east Taiwan are mainly sourced from the west Cathaysia Block (contributing about 81% of total zircon age population). The Yangtze Block (about 43%) and the North China Block (about 34%) may be the dominant provenances of the Eocene-Pleistocene sequences in west Taiwan.",

Signals generated by lightning discharges were recorded close to the thunderstorm by a magnetic-field receiver and travelled up to 600 km to three distant electric-field receivers. We investigate propagation of the preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. We found that amplitudes of observed pulses are decreasing approximately inverse proportional to the square of the distance. The attenuation of the PBP amplitudes is roughly the same as the attenuation of the corresponding return stroke pulses. The estimated PBP peak currents reach over 100 kA. They may be therefore able to initiate terrestrial gamma ray flashes. The Finite Difference Time Domain simulation shows that there is a significant contribution of the sky wave signals in the PBP waveforms observed beyond 500 km from their source.",

The only mean to tie the resulting technique-specific frames into a homogeneous combined frame is then to use local topometric ties between stations of different techniques co-located at the same observatory. However, inconsistencies between these local ties and space geodesy estimates of the station positions are today a major limiting factor of the ITRF accuracy.\nAn alternative way of tying the different space geodetic techniques together is through the use of multi-technique satellites equipped with instruments of more than one technique. But the main challenge of using such a satellite as an inter-technique link resides in the accurate knowledge (or estimation) of the vectors between the satellite's center of mass and the reference points of its different instruments (i.e., space ties).\nIn this study, the results from multi-technique (GPS+SLR+DORIS) analyses involving the Jason-2 satellite are presented and compared to the results from traditional single-technique analyses. We assess in particular the effect of simultaneously processing the observations of the three techniques with Jason-2 as inter-technique link on the resolution of the GPS phase ambiguities, on the estimation of the GPS and Jason-2 satellite orbits and on the estimation of the ground station positions.\nMoreover, results of the estimation of the Jason-2 space ties will be presented, in order to assess the quality of the presently available values.",

            "abstract": "During the Miocene-Pliocene the Mediterranean region experienced major changes in paleogeography. Today, its only connection to the global ocean is the Strait of Gibraltar. This restricted nature causes the Mediterranean basin to react more sensitive to climatic and tectonic related phenomena than the global ocean: Not just eustatic sea-level and regional river run-off, but also gateway tectonics and connectivity between sub-basins are leaving an enhanced fingerprint in its geological record. To understand its evolution, it is crucial to understand how these different effects are coupled.\nThe Miocene-Pliocene sedimentary record of the Mediterranean alternates in composition and colour. Around the Miocene-Pliocene Boundary the most extreme changes occur in the Mediterranean Sea: About 6% of the salt in the global ocean got deposited in the Mediterranean Region, forming an approximately 2km thick salt layer, which is still present today. This extreme event is named the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC, 5.97-5.33Ma).\nBefore (and also after) the MSC, the sedimentary record demonstrates “marl dominated” alternations with variations in organic content (e.g. higher organic content = sapropel). During the MSC these change to mainly “evaporite (e.g. gypsum or halite) dominated” alternations, but also to brackish Black Sea-type of deposits towards the end of the crisis. Due to its relative short geological time span, the period before, during and after the MSC is ideal to study these extreme changes in sedimentation.\nWe are investigating these couplings and evolutions in a box/budget model. With such a model we can study the responses to basin water exchange dynamics under the effect of different regional and global climatic and tectonic forcings, to predict the evolution of basin properties (e.g. salinity). By doing so we can isolate certain climatic and tectonic effects, to better understand their individual contribution, their interaction, but also the consequences due to their coupling.\nKeywords: Mediterranean Sea, Climate, Coupling, Evolution, Messinian Salinity Crisis, Modeling, Strait of Gibraltar, GCM",

            "abstract": "Defined as the ratio between gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (EWUE) is an indicator of the adjustment of vegetation photosynthesis to water loss. The processes controlling EWUE are complex and reflect both a slow evolution of plants and plant communities as well as fast adjustments of ecosystem functioning to changes of limiting resources. In this study, we investigated EWUE trends from 1982 to 2008 using data-driven models derived from satellite observations, and process-oriented carbon cycle models. Our findings suggest positive EWUE trends of 0.0056, 0.0007 and 0.0001 g C m-2 mm-1 yr-1 under the single effect of rising CO2 (‘CO2’), climate change (‘CLIM’) and nitrogen deposition (‘NDEP’), respectively. Global patterns of EWUE trends under the different scenarios suggest that: (i) EWUE-CO2 shows global increases, (ii) EWUE-CLIM increases in mainly high latitudes and decreases at middle and low latitudes, (iii) EWUE-NDEP displays slight increasing trends except in west Siberia, eastern Europe, parts of North America and central Amazonia. The data-driven MTE model, however, shows a slight decline of EWUE during the same period (-0.0005 g C m-2 mm-1 yr-1), which differs from process-models (0.0064 g C m-2 mm-1 yr-1) simulations with all drivers are taken into account. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the non-modeled physiological effects of elevated CO2 reducing stomatal conductance and transpiration (TR) in the MTE model. Partial correlation analysis between EWUE and climate drivers shows similar responses to climatic variables with the data-driven model and the process-oriented models across different ecosystems. Change in water-use efficiency defined from transpiration-based WUEt (GPP/TR) and inherent water-use efficiency IWUEt (GPP×VPD/TR) in response to rising CO2, climate change, and nitrogen deposition are also discussed. Our analyses will facilitate mechanistic understanding of the carbon-water interactions over terrestrial ecosystems under global change.",

            "abstract": "Societies and economies are challenged by variable water supplies. Water storage infrastructure, on a range of scales, can help to mitigate hydrological variability. This study uses a water balance model to investigate how storage capacity can improve water security in the world’s 403 most important river basins, by substituting water from wet months to dry months. We construct a new water balance model for 680 ‘basin-country units’ (BCUs), which simulates runoff, water use (from surface and groundwater), evaporation and trans-boundary discharges.\nWe find that, so far, storage capacity in most basins is able to buffer inter- and intra-annual water variability . However, when hydrological variability and net withdrawals are taken into account, along with existing storage capacity, we find risks of water shortages in the Indian subcontinent, Northern China, Spain, the West of the US, Australia and several basins in Africa. Dividing basins into basin-country units enabled assessment of upstream dependency in trans-boundary rivers.\nIncluding Environmental Water Requirements into the model, we find that in many basins in India, Northern China, South Africa, the US West Coast, the East of Brazil, Spain and in the Murray basin in Australia human water demand leads to over-abstraction of water resources important to the ecosystem. Then, a Sequent Peak Analysis is conducted to estimate how much storage would be needed to satisfy human water demand whilst not jeopardising environmental flows. The results are consistent with the water balance model in that basins in India, Northern China, Western Australia, Spain, the US West Coast and several basins in Africa would need more storage to mitigate water supply variability and to meet water demand.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Continental Margin of India (ECMI), a classical passive margin has evolved after breakup of the Indian landmass from the East Antarctica during the Early Cretaceous. Anomalous thick sediments and lack of cohesive magnetic signatures in the Bay of Bengal hampered delineation of rift-structure and age assignment for the continental breakup between India and East Antarctica. Further, absence of lithological and geochronological information and a few seismic profiles from the margin led to put forward several competing models for the rift initiation and evolution of the ECMI. Here, we analyze long streamer seismic reflection data and deep-water drill well information from the western Bay of Bengal to infer the buried rift structure, crustal architecture and stratigraphy along the ECMI. Following the structural pattern of the margin, the region is divided into four domains as decoupled, coupled, exhumed and oceanic, which in turn helped us to demarcate the variations in rift structure from south to north along the margin. The southern segment in the vicinity of Cauvery Basin consists of steep continental shelf associated with few major normal faults, which indicates that the segment was evolved as mix shear-rifted margin. The central segment off southern part of the Krishna-Godavari Basin is controlled by a series of fault-bounded half-graben structures and presence of thinned continental crust over the exhumed mantle body, revealing that the segment was formed under hyper-rifting process. While the northern segment extends up to Mahanadi Basin shows relatively less gradient continental slope with a few major faults, suggesting that the segment was evolved by hypo-extended process. Variable crustal architecture lying along the ECMI supports each segment of the margin formed in a specific rift process. A breakup unconformity considered as important geological constraint for completion of rift process between India and East Antarctica is clearly mapped on hyper- and hypo-extended margin segments. On correlation of rift structures to Indian Shield's geology, it is found that rheology of stable cratonic blocks and bordered Gondwana grabens/ mobile belts may have played a role in controlling the rift process between the continental masses, India and East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Global climate models suggest an increase in evapotranspiration in many parts of the world which is likely to cause an increase in drought severity, yet the weakness of climate models in modelling persistence of hydro-climatic variables and the uncertainties associated with regional climate projections mean that impact assessments based on climate model output may underestimate the risk of multi-year droughts. In this paper we propose a vulnerability-based approach to test water resource system response to drought. We generate a large number of synthetic streamflow series with different drought durations and deficits and use them as input to a water resource system model.\nTwo approaches to drought simulation are presented: (1) using a numerical streamflow generator based upon an optimal bootstrapping algorithm and (2) using a copula to characterise the joint probability distribution streamflow characteristics in successive months. Droughts with longer durations and larger deficits than the observed record are generated (1) by changing the objective function of the optimisation and (2) by perturbing the copula dependence parameter and by adopting an importance sampling strategy for low flows. In this way potential climate-induced changes in monthly hydrological persistence are factored into the vulnerability analysis.\nThe method is applied to the London water resource system (England) to investigate under which drought conditions severe water use restrictions would need to be imposed on water users. Results indicate that the water resource system is vulnerable to drought conditions outside the range of historical events. The vulnerability assessment results were coupled with climate model information to compare alternative water management options with respect to their vulnerability to increasingly long and severe drought conditions.

The exposure of these rocks to surface conditions provides a large reservoir of chemical potential energy that drives rapid reactions, heat generation, expansion and cracking.\nThe Oman Drilling Project will address long-standing questions regarding mantle melting, melt transport and crystallization of lavas at ocean spreading ridges to form ocean crust, determine the nature and extent of chemical interactions between the oceans and newly formed oceanic crust, improve our understanding of CO2 and H2O uptake via weathering to form hydrated minerals and carbonates including reaction-driven cracking mechanisms as well as explore serpentinite-hosted microbial ecosystem. With funding from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), U.S. NSF, NASA, IODP, Sloan Foundation and Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft in place, we will address these objectives via observations on core, geophysical logging, fluid and microbiological sampling, and hydrological measurements in a series of newly drilled boreholes. Preliminary surveys showed that active low-T alteration of upper mantle rocks is an ongoing process. Dissolved hydrogen and methane concentrations in fluid samples collected in existing boreholes are up to 1.3 and 8 mmol/l, respectively [1]. Regarding the physical, chemical and biological processes related to near surface alteration of mantle rocks, a multi-borehole test site will be established in the southern massif of the Samail ophiolite. This test site will facilitate in-situ studies of water-rock-microbe interactions. Technical details and potential opportunities will be discussed.\n[1] Paukert A.

The Hengchun Peninsula (HCP) in the southernmost Taiwan is the southern extension of the mountainous core of the orogen. Thus studying HCP could provide information of the early history of the orogeny. It is generally considered that Taiwan was located on the Eurasian continental margin before the collision, and the source of pre-collision sediments was southeastern China. However, the submarine topography shows that HCP is on the eastern side of Manila trench. Therefore, either HCP should belong to the Philippine Sea plate instead of the Eurasian continental margin, or the HCP sediments need to somehow move across the plate boundary. In order to further understand the evolution of HCP, this study aims to identify potential sediment sources of the Miocene Series in HCP.\nWe performed U-Pb dating of detrital zircons obtained from HCP. 7 sandstone samples were collected from the Lilongshan, Shihmen and Loshui Formations in HCP. The U-Pb dating results show that zircons in these three formations all have peaks in the range of 1840-1870 Ma and 150-250 Ma. However, in the Shihmen Formation, the ages concentrate more between 20-25 Ma than the two previously identified peaks. Such an age distribution pattern is significantly different from the other two. According to previous studies, no major magmatic events occurred during this relatively young period in southeastern China. Thus the provenance of these young sediments in HCP is still under debate. Combining with results of Hf isotopes of the zircons and comparing the detrital zircon ages of samples collected from the Luzon Island, we hope to establish alternative models for sediment sources of HCP in Miocene. Such results may provide additional information about the sediment sources and history of HCP, as well as the entire Taiwan orogen.",

Combining GNSS single difference and VLBI data during CONT11, we estimate station coordinates and site common parameters, i.e. zenith wet delays, troposphere gradients and clock parameters, with the Vienna VLBI Software. Local tie vectors, which contribute to the combination of terrestrial frames between GNSS and VLBI, are introduced as fictitious observations and then reassessed according to stations coordinate results. We compare combination solutions with single technique solutions, assess the impact of the combination at the observation level with respect to geodetic results and discuss the current limitation and potentials to be developed.",

            "abstract": "The Longmenshan fold-and-thrust belt at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin has long been identified as an active tectonic belt. This has been clearly illustrated by the disastrous Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes in the recent decade. The two earthquakes, however, have distinctive characters. In the north, the Wenchuan event occurred on major fault zones identified previously. But in the south, the Lushan event was not accompanied by surface ruptures, and the seismogenic structure is still under debate. In order to further understand the neotectonic characteristics of the Lushan earthquake region, we analyzed fluvial terraces, in the hope that such geomorphic features would provide information of active structures of the area.\nAlong the Tianquan River, river terraces are particularly well developed near two cities, Tianquan and Shiyang. Since the terraces appear to be very wide and limited in these two basin-like areas, we suspected that they formed as filled-up lakes. However, after detailed field investigations, we found that underneath these terraces, early Tertiary bedrocks crop out below river sediments that are only several meters thick. This indicates that the Tianquan River has incised into bedrocks. The slope of the terrace surfaces is similar to that of the present-day riverbed, and the river sediments in the terrace outcrops have similar grain size distribution as current riverbed sediments. Therefore, we suggest that the terraces along the Tianquan River are not related to dammed lake, but were produced by tectonic uplift. Combining the age of terrace sediments dated by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and detailed topography of the terrace surfaces, we aim to establish a model for the formation mechanism of these two terrace groups. We hope the results of this study would provide more information of neotectonic characteristics of the southwestern Sichuan Basin, as well as future earthquake hazards in this densely populated region.",

            "abstract": "Surface waves are strong noise in petroleum seismic exploration. It is necessary to suppress this kind of noise to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of seismic data. In the time-offset (t-x) domain, surface waves and body waves interfere with each other, which make it difficult to separate them. Due to the characteristics of low velocity, low frequency and strong energy, surface-wave suppression is possible in the frequency-velocity (f-v) domain. We propose a novel strategy to separate surface waves from body waves using high-resolution linear Radon transform (LRT). The proposed high-resolution LRT shows the advantage that the shot gather can be transformed between the t-x domain and the f-v domain with amplitude of seismic data preserved. Because of that, we can obtain the energy distribution relation of surface and body waves in the f-v domain by high-resolution LRT. After extracting the energy of surface waves in the f-v domain, we transform the selected energy back to the t-x domain to retrieve surface waves. Finally, we subtract them from the raw shot gather arithmetically to suppress surface waves. Compared with the conventional the f-k method, results of synthetic and real-world examples demonstrate that the proposed method produces more accurate results in surface-wave suppression. \nKeywords:surface waves and body waves; Radon transform; time-offset domain; frequency-velocity domain",

            "abstract": "The diamond anvil cell is a unique tool to study materials under static pressures up to several hundreds of GPa. It is possible to generate temperatures as high as several thousand degrees in the diamond anvil cell by laser heating. This allows us to achieve deep mantle conditions in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC). The small heated volume is surrounded by thermally conductive diamond anvils results in high temperature gradients which affect phase transformation and chemical distribution in the LH-DAC.\nAnalytical characterization of samples in three dimensions is essential to fully understand phase assemblages and equilibrium in LHDAC. In this study we used San Carlos olivine as a starting material as a simple proxy to deep mantle composition. Three samples were melted at ~3000 K and at ~45 GPa for three different durations ranging from 1 to 6 minutes; two other samples were melted at 30 GPa and 70 GPa. All samples were then sliced by focused ion beam (FIB). From each slice, an electron image and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) map were acquired by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the dual beam FIB instrument. These slices were collected on one half of the heated area in each sample, from which we obtained 3D elemental and phase distribution. The other half of the heated area was used to extract a 100 nm thick section for subsequent analysis by analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to obtain diffraction patterns and high resolution EDX maps.\n3D reconstruction of SEM EDX results shows at least four differentiated regions in the heated area for all samples. The exact Fe and Mg compositions mentioned below are an example of the sample melted at 45 GPa for 6 minutes. The bulk of the heated are is surrounded by ferropericlase (Mg0.92, Fe0.08)O shell (Fp). Inside this shell we find a thick region of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite-structured bridgmanite (Brg) coexisting with Fp. In the center lies a Fe-rich core which is surrounded by magnesiowüstite (Mg0.65, Fe0.35)O (Mw). Moreover TEM EDX results show that we have not only 2 oxide phases (outer Fp shell and inner Mw layer) but rather 4 different compositions of oxide phases. The average composition of third oxide is (Mg0.77, Fe0.23)O which is the phase coexisting with Brg and the fourth one has a (Mg0.46, Fe0.54)O composition and is a 70 nm layer sitting between the core and the Mw phase.",

But there is very limited data available in the eastern part of the QXH/R and almost no observation in the western part of QXH/R not only for the observed permafrost data, but also for the dataset on ground surface conditions, such as soil and vegetation, which are used as model parameters, initial variables, or benchmark data sets for calibration, validation, and comparison in various Earth System Models (ESMs). To evaluate the status of permafrost and its environmental conditions, such as the distribution and thermal state of permafrost, soil and vegetation on the TP, detailed investigation on permafrost were conducted in 5 regions with different climatic and geologic conditions over the whole plateau from 2009 to 2013, and more than 100 ground temperatures (GTs) monitoring boreholes were drilled and equipped with thermistors, of which 10 sites were equipped with automatic meteorological stations. Geophysical prospecting methods, such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic prospecting, were used in the same time to detect the permafrost distribution and thicknesses. The monitoring data revealed that the thermal state of permafrost was well correlated with elevation, and regulated by annual precipitation, local geological, geomorphological and hydrological conditions through heat exchanges between ground and atmosphere. Different models, including GTs statistical model, Common Land Surface Model (CoLM), Noah land surface model and TTOP models, were used to map the permafrost in 5 selected regions and the whole TP, while the investigated and monitored data were used as calibration and validation for all models. Finally, we compiled the permafrost map of the TP, soil and vegetation map within the permafrost regions on the TP. We also compiled the soil organic carbon density map of permafrost affected soils on the TP. An overview on permafrost thickness, GTs, ice content was statistically summarized based on investigation data.",

We benefited from an annual survey between 2009 and 2011 of temperatures, along with sampling of focused and diffused fluids for chemical analysis, and chimney sampling and samples from microbial colonization experiments analyzed for prokaryotic composition and rock alteration study.\nThe chemical composition of the fluids show an important increase in the CO2 concentration at the Eiffel Tower site between 2009 and 2010 followed by a decrease between 2010 and 2011. In 2011, several fluid samples show an important depletion in Si, suggesting that some Si was removed by interaction with the stockwork before emission. Our observations, regarding the previous studies of chemical fluid affected by a magmatic event lead us to suppose that a magmatic/tectonic event occurred under the Lucky Strike hydrothermal field between 2009 and 2010.\nThe results of the prokaryotic communities’ analysis show that a shift occurred in the dominant microbial metabolisms present in the colonizer retrieved in 2010 and the one retrieved in 2011. Archaeal communities shifted from chemolithoautotropic sulfite/thiosulfate reducers-dominated in 2010 to ammonia oxidizers-dominated in 2011. The bacterial communities also undergo a shift, from a community with diversified metabolisms in 2010 to a community strongly dominated by chemolithoautotrophic sulfide or hydrogen oxidation in 2011. Moreover, in terms of ecological preferendum, the Archaeal communities shifted from thermophilic-dominated to mesophilic-dominated.\nThe present study underline the influence of modifications in gases compositions of hydrothermal fluids subsequently to a degassing of the magma chamber and their impact on the microbial communities living in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents at the Eiffel Tower site.",

            "abstract": "The sediment succession in the Bay of Bengal records signatures corresponding to India-Asia collision, regional climate, and erosional processes of the Himalayan orogeny and the Indian subcontinent. The Bengal Fan – world’s largest submarine fan - has been long studied to understand the link between the Himalayan tectonics and Asian monsoon climate, but early phase information of the Himalaya erosion is not retrieved from the Indian Ocean due to lack of deep-core samples. Therefore, the missing corresponding signals hampered the understanding of coupled processes between tectonics, climate and erosion. Seismic reflection profiles and industrial drill wells from the western Bay of Bengal show two different modes of sediment deposition: initially Indian peninsular rivers discharged sediments to the ocean at a rate ~20 m/m.y. until Oligocene-Miocene time (~23 Ma) with the exception of two fairly-enhanced sediment pulses from 65 to 54 and again from 34 to 23 Ma; since 23 Ma the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers added huge volumes of sediments to the bay with variable rates range from 40 to >1000 m/m.y. Using seismic stratigraphic technique we found a distinct increase in sediment discharge (~140 m/m.y.) at 23 Ma is an important age marker for the onset of Bengal Fan sedimentation as a coupled connection between the Himalayan tectonics and Asian climate. Further rise in sedimentation rate during the period 6.8 - 0.8 Ma is surprisingly not in agreement with the decrease in sediment rate reported at ODP Leg 116 sites in the distal Bengal Fan, but coincident with the change in monsoon intensity. Here we provide well constrained ages for the growth of the Bengal Fan, which can serve as benchmark for interactions between the Himalayan exhumation and Asian climate.",

The January precipitation set a record for several rain gauge stations in Southern England. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of the anthropogenic climate change, represented by a modification of the sea surface temperature (SST) on the January precipitation. For that, we conducted a sensitivity experiment by running a set of 108 four-months simulations using WRF model with 9 different physics and 12 different SST fields; 9 for the factual world and 99 for the counter-factual world. A spectral nudging technique was used here to ensure a same atmospheric circulation patterns for all the simulations. Therefore, only the thermodynamic effect is considered here. The analysis is focused on January precipitation over the southern England. Results show for 0,5°C SST difference over the Northern Atlantic, the precipitation in the factual simulations is between 0,4 and 8% higher than the precipitation in the counter-factual simulations depending on the physic. A validation test shows that this value is closer to 8% for the “best physic” simulation. It also show a strong spatial variability where in some region the precipitation is higher in the counter-factual world compared the factual world. Finally, a backward trajectories were calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the moisture sources and air mass trajectories to the SST in the factual and the counter-factual world.",

            "abstract": "The glacial history of the vast Siberian continental shelf of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas is poorly known. Most of this shelf area is shallower than 120 m implying that it was exposed land during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as well as during older major Quaternary glaciations. The regional glacial and deglacial history of marine transgression has greatly influenced marine conditions of today’s Arctic Ocean continental shelves. For example, the present extent of submarine permafrost on the shallow continental shelves is tightly linked to the glacial history, because the submarine permafrost was formed during cold conditions when sea level was low enough for the shelves to be subaerially exposed. Conversely, one explanation for lack of submarine permafrost on some shelf areas is the presence of past ice sheets. Ice sheets extending over parts of the Eastern Siberian continental shelf have been proposed in literature during LGM as well as during older Quaternary glacial periods. However, the sparsely available data from the outer continental shelf and adjacent slope of the Eastern Siberian Arctic Ocean has left the glacial history in this part largely unresolved. Here we present new geophysical mapping and sediment coring data from the shallow East Siberian shelf and adjacent slope collected during the 2014 SWERUS-C3 expedition (SWERUS-C3: Swedish – Russian – US Arctic Ocean Investigation of Climate-Cryosphere-Carbon Interactions) with Swedish icebreaker Oden. The mapping, using multibeam sonar, chirp sub-bottom profiler, and electro magnetics, in combination with new sediment cores provide information on past glacial activities, sea-level history and permafrost extent on the Eastern Siberian Arctic Ocean. Combining the new SWERUS-C3 data with previous results from this region raises the question whether an East Siberian-Chukchi ice sheet existed during LGM and/or during older glacial periods.",

            "abstract": "In order to better describe the secular variation during the Holocene in the southern hemisphere, we sampled 21 dated lava flows or pyroclastic flows from several Chilean volcanoes (Lonquimay, Llaima, Solipulli, Villarrica, Mocho-Choshuenco, Osorno, Calbuco). We also sampled 56 sites in Holocene lava flows with only relative ages with respect of the dated units. The steepest inclination of the geomagnetic field (-71.6°) and the highest intensity (70µT±5) are found at Osorno volcano (calibrated age range of 782-966AD). The steep inclination is also observed in dated lava flows of the same age range at Llaima volcano. The VGP associated with the steep inclination is not much different from the VGP recorded at European sites suggesting a significant dipole wobble at that time.\nMean paleointensities of 63, 60.3 and 57.5µT obtained in three dated units in the time range 0-2000BC confirm the high geomagnetic dipole moment of the Earth’s magnetic field for the two millennia BC. In contrast, paleointensity results in late Pleistocene units show that the magnetic field strength was low just prior to the Holocene (-14000 -15,000 BC).\nThe available paleomagnetic results from Chile indicate little geomagnetic secular variation in direction during the Holocene. This observation contrasts with the large and rapid secular variation observed during the last two centuries (Roperch et al., 2015). Thus the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly appears to be a recent and unique anomalous feature of the Earth’s magnetic field during the Holocene.\nRoperch et al. (2015), Phys. Earth. Planet.

            "abstract": "The Falkland Plateau is situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and stretches from the Falkland Islands more than 1500 km eastward to Georgia Basin. The Falkland Plateau Basin is located on the Falkland Plateau between the Falkland Islands in the west and a bathymetric high, the Maurice Ewing Bank, in the east. According to geodynamic models, the Falkland Plateau had a different shape during the Jurassic whereas the Falkland Islands were part of the supercontinent Gondwana.\nWhile the Falkland Islands and Maurice Ewing Bank are proved to be of continental composition, the nature and structure of the crust beneath the Falkland Plateau Basin in between is debatable. The first crustal model derived from sonobuoy data contradicts a recently published 3D-gravity model. To enhance the understanding of Gondwana break-up considering timing, geometry and amount of volcanism, further knowledge about the structure and thickness of the crust is inevitable.\nDuring the ANT-XXIX/5 Polarstern cruise, seismic refraction measurements were conducted using Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and REF TEK land stations onshore of East Falkland. The OBS were deployed at 78 locations along an approximately 1500 km east-west stretching profile. Based on this data, a P-wave velocity model was calculated using 2D-raytracing techniques.\nBeneath the Falkland Plateau Basin the crust exhibits a thickness ranging between 16 km and 22 km and a two-layered velocity structure. The velocity distribution is similar to average oceanic crust with a larger gradient in the upper part and a smaller gradient in the lower part. Lower crustal velocities are up to 7.6 km/s. For Maurice Ewing Bank a different velocity distribution can be observed. The crust is thicker (about 30 km) and velocities do not exceed 7.0 km/s.\nConsidering crustal thickness and velocity distribution, we interpret the Falkland Plateau with the exception of Maurice Ewing Bank to consist of thickened oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of climate change, particularly that of rising temperatures, are being observed across the globe and are expected to further increase. To counter this phenomenon, numerous nations are focusing on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because energy demand management is considered as a key factor in emissions reduction, it is necessary to estimate energy consumption and GHG emissions in relation to climate change. Further, because South Korea is the world’s fastest nation to become aged, demographics have also become instrumental in the accurate estimation of energy demands and emissions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate energy consumption and GHG emissions in the residential sectors of South Korea with regard to climate change and aging to build more accurate strategies for energy demand management and emissions reduction goals. This study, which was stablished with 2010 and 2050 as the base and target years, respectively, was divided into a two-step process. The first step evaluated the effects of aging and climate change on energy demand, and the second estimated future energy use and GHG emissions through projected scenarios. First, aging characteristics and climate change factors were analyzed by using the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis and the application of historical data. In the analysis of changes in energy use, the effects of activity, structure, and intensity were considered; the degrees of contribution were derived from each effect in addition to their relations to energy demand. Second, two types of scenarios were stablished based on this analysis. The aging scenarios are business as usual and future characteristics scenarios, and were used in combination with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. Finally, energy consumption and GHG emissions were estimated by using a combination of scenarios. The results of these scenarios show an increase in energy consumption and GHG emissions from 2010 to 2050. This growth is caused by increases in heating energy because the elderly generally spend more time at home, and cooling energy owing to rising temperatures. This study will be useful in the preparation of energy demand management policies and the establishment and attainability of GHG emissions reduction goals.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture, hydraulic and thermal properties are critical for understanding the soil surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Here, we will discuss the potential of using soil temperature observations from Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) to investigate the spatial variability of soil moisture and soil properties. With DTS soil temperature can be measured with high resolution (spatial <1m, and temporal < 1min) in cables up to kilometers in length. Soil temperature evolution is primarily controlled by the soil thermal properties, and the energy balance at the soil surface. Hence, soil moisture, which affects both soil thermal properties and the energy that participates the evaporation process, is strongly correlated to the soil temperatures. In addition, the dynamics of the soil moisture is determined by the soil hydraulic properties.\nHere we will demonstrate that soil moisture, hydraulic and thermal properties can be estimated by assimilating observed soil temperature at shallow depths using the Particle Batch Smoother (PBS). The PBS can be considered as an extension of the particle filter, which allows us to infer soil moisture and soil properties using the dynamics of soil temperature within a batch window. Both synthetic and real field data will be used to demonstrate the robustness of this approach. We will show that the proposed method is shown to be able to handle different sources of uncertainties, which may provide a new view of using DTS observations to estimate sub-meter resolution soil moisture and properties for remote sensing product validation.",

            "abstract": "With extensive use of hydrological models over a wide range of hydro-climatic contexts, bias in hydro-climatic data may lead to unreliable models and thus hydrological forecasts and projections. This issue is particularly pregnant when considering mountainous areas with great uncertainties on precipitations, or when considering complex unconservative catchments (e.g. karstic systems).\nThe Turc-Pike water balance formula, analogous to the classical Budyko formula, is a simple and efficient mathematical formulation relating long-term average streamflow to long-term average precipitation and potential evaporation. In this study, we propose to apply this framework to assess and eventually adjust the water-balance before calibrating an operational hydrologic model (MORDOR model).\nConsidering a large set of 350 french catchments, the Turc-Pike formula is regionalized based on ecohydrologic criterions to handle various hydro-climatic contexts. This interannual regional model is then applied to assess the water-balance over numerous catchments and various conditions, such as karstic, snow-driven or glaciarized and even anthropized catchments. Results show that it is possible to obtain pretty realistic corrections of meteorological inputs (precipitations, temperature or potential evaporation) or hydrologic surface (or runoff). These corrections can often be confirmed a posteriori by exogenous information. Positive impacts on hydrologic model’s calibration are also demonstrated. This methodology is now operational for hydrologic applications at EDF (Electricité de France, French electric utility company), and therefore applied on hundreds of catchments.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is rapidly transitioning towards a seasonal sea ice-free state, perhaps one of the most apparent examples of climate change in the world. This dramatic change has numerous consequences, including a large increase in near-surface air temperatures, which in turn may affect terrestrial methane emissions. Nonetheless, terrestrial and marine environments are seldom jointly analyzed. By comparing satellite observations of Arctic sea ice concentrations to methane emissions simulated by three process-based biogeochemical models, we show that rising wetland methane emissions are associated with sea ice retreat. Strong correlations with sea ice are apparent throughout the Arctic, with considerable variation throughout the summer. In sea ice-affected areas, temperatures were markedly higher compared to areas that did not show a strong association with sea ice retreat. These higher temperatures led to an increase in methane emissions. Our analyses indicate that simulated high-latitude emissions for 2005-2010 were, on average, 1.7 Tg CH4 yr-1 higher compared to 1981-1990. These results suggest a continued rise in methane emissions with further warming from future sea ice decline, particularly in the autumn. Observation programs, therefore, need to include measurements during that time to further investigate the impact of this spatial connection on terrestrial methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "Continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism has been temporally, and therefore causally, linked to periods of environmental crisis in the past 260 Ma. The majority of the proposed causal relationships are, however, qualitative, in particular the potential climatic and environmental effects of large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted to the atmosphere. CFB provinces are typically formed by numerous individual eruptions, each lasting years to decades, with highly uncertain periods of quiescence lasting hundreds to thousands of years.\nI will present results obtained from a global aerosol-climate model set-up to simulate the sulfur-induced climatic and environmental effects of individual decade to century-long CFB eruptions. For sulfur dioxide emissions representative of a single decade-long eruption in the 65 Ma Deccan Trap Volcanic Province, the model predicts a substantial reduction in global surface temperature of 4.5 K, which is in good agreement with multi-proxy palaeo-temperature records. However, the calculated cooling is short-lived and temperatures recover within less than 50 years once volcanic activity ceases. In contrast to previous studies, I show that acid rain from decade-long eruptions cannot cause widespread vegetation stress or loss due to the buffering capacities of soils. The direct exposure of vegetation to acid mists and fogs, however, could cause damage where the exposure is high and sustained, such as at high elevations. Finally, I will use these modeling results to place constraints on the likely environmental effects and habitability by simulating different eruption frequencies and durations as well as hiatus periods and by comparing to the proxy records.",

            "abstract": "Measuring greenhouse gas emissions from individual localised sources, or \"hotspots\", is important for both compliance monitoring and validating the techniques used to compile national emission inventories. Frequently ground based techniques are used, such as flux chamber measurements, which suffer from issues regarding sample representativeness, and tracer release methods, which for area sources rely heavily on release site configuration. Obtaining vertically resolved data can enable the use of a mass balance method to calculate greenhouse gas fluxes. This has been achieved using remote sensing techniques, but this usually requires the deployment of expensive, bulky instrumentation.\nHere we evaluate the suitability of using UAVs, in conjunction with emerging miniaturised sensor technology, as a highly manoeuvrable, low cost alternative for measuring hotspot greenhouse gas emissions. We describe a case study performed at a UK landfill site, where greenhouse gas measurements made on board a fixed wing UAV were used to estimate the bulk CH4 emission rate. Details of the mass balance technique employed, along with the key uncertainties associated with it, are discussed. This work is part of an ongoing study at the University of Manchester into the application of UAVs in atmospheric research, with the rapid advancement in miniaturised sensor technology providing new opportunities for integrating trace gas measurement with existing lightweight UAVs.",

            "abstract": "Frost damage takes place when the pressure exerted against pore walls exceeds the cohesive strength of water-infiltrated rock and causes cracks to extend. Elegant theoretical treatments supported by meticulous field and laboratory observations have combined to unravel the basic mechanical and thermodynamic controls in idealized systems. Frost damage is most vigorous when conditions are cold enough that the net pressure exerted against the pore walls can cause crack extension, yet warm enough to enable the flow that supplies further ice growth in the newly opened space. This insight is applied here to develop practical geomorphic process laws for the effects of frost damage at the larger scales that are relevant for describing the evolution of landscapes. To this end, a direct connection is made between the intensity of frost damage and the porosity increase that results from gradients in water flux under conditions that are cold enough for ice–rock interactions to propagate cracks. This implies that the annual temperature variation at the ground surface can be combined with considerations of heat and mass transport to derive rigorous forecasts of the potential for frost damage that are tied to the increases in water mass that accompany solidification in porous rock.\nAs an example, the image shows the depth-integrated porosity change λ promoted by crack growth at temperatures colder than –ΔTc over an annual cycle for different choices of mean annual temperature MAT and surface amplitude A (assuming a thermal diffusivity of 1 mm2/s and a power-law relationship between permeability and undercooling with exponent α=4, such that a base value of 10-14m2 is reached at a reference undercooling of 0.1 ºC). The abrupt onset in cracking once MAT decreases below a threshold is produced by the requirement that undercooling surpass ΔTc in order to generate sufficient pressures to propagate cracks. The eventual reduction and gradual tail in λ at colder MAT is produced by the clogging of the permeable pathways needed to supply additional water to propmote crack growth.",

            "abstract": "The conversion of liquid water into water vapor strongly controls the energy transfer between the Earth and the atmosphere, and plays one of the most important roles in the hydrological cycle. This process, called evapotranspiration (ET), deeply constraints the amount of green water in the total global water balance. However, assessing the ET from terrestrial ecosystems remains a key challenge in hydrology. We show that the liquid water mass losses can be directly inferred from continuous gravity measurements: as water evaporates and transpires from terrestrial ecosystems, the mass distribution varies through the system, changing its gravity field. Using continuous superconducting gravity measurements, we were able to identify a daily changes in gravity at the level of, or smaller than 10-10 g per day. This corresponds to 2.0 mm of water over an area of 50 ha.The strength of this method is its ability to ensure a direct, traceable and continuous monitoring of actual ET for years at the mesoscale (~50 ha) with a precision of a few tenths of mm of water. This paves the way for the development of the method in different land-use, land-cover and geological contexts, using superconducting and coming quantum gravimeters.",

            "abstract": "Elucidation of the conditions under which blowing snow occurs is important not only in mitigating snowstorm-related disasters but also in discussing the mass balance of water. The major factor for the occurrence of blowing snow is strong winds. However, the conditions that cause blowing snow are complicated, because temperature, the condition of the snow surface, and the presence or absence of falling snow affect blowing snow occurrence. We created a formula for determining the conditions under which blowing snow will occur, based on multiple meteorological elements. In this presentation, we report the results of analysis on the occurrence conditions of blowing snow without concurrent falling snow. The observation data used in the analysis were obtained in Hokkaido, northern Japan, from December 2012 to April 2013. The observed items were air temperature, wind velocity, intensity of solar radiation, snow depth and the mass flux of blowing snow particles. In addition to the above, videos were taken to determine the presence of blowing snow. After the blowing snow events were extracted, each meteorological element was compared with the frequency of blowing snow occurrence. The analysis found that the frequency tended to be low when 12 or more hours had passed after a snowfall event or when the maximum air temperature exceeded 2 °C. It is thought that the snow particles sinter together and the surface of the snow pack hardens, and that such sintering makes it difficult for the particles fly off from the snow surface. It was shown that the frequency of blowing snow occurrence is high when large amounts of fresh snow are on the ground. Based on the above examinations, a formula for determining the occurrence of blowing snow was created using the discriminate analysis method. An accuracy verification test found the formula to have a hit ratio of 92.3%. The verification test showed the formula to be useful in determining the occurrence of blowing snow.",

The essential causes of the postseismic crustal deformation are considered to be slow afterslip at the downdip extension of the main rupture zone and viscoelastic relaxation of stress changes induced in the asthenosphere. Crustal responses to the afterslip and the viscoelastic relaxation are different in both space and time. So, given proper plate interface geometry and proper crust-mantle rheological structure, we can estimate unbiased spatiotemporal distribution of afterslip through the inversion analysis of observed geodetic data. In the present analysis, we used a 3-D realistic model developed by Hashimoto et al. (2004) for plate interface geometry and a standard elastic-viscoelastic layered model, consisting of a 60 km-thick elastic surface layer and a Maxwell-type viscoelastic substratum with the viscosity of 1019 Pa s, for crust-mantle rheological structure. First, following Noda et al. (2013), we transformed the GPS displacement data on land into the average strains of triangular elements composed of adjacent three GPS stations. Then, by applying a sequential method of stepwise (every two months) inversion to the strain data, we estimated the spatiotemporal distribution of afterslip together with coseismic slip distribution. The estimated results show that significant afterslip has proceeded for the first one and a half years at the downdip extension of the main rupture zone off Iwate and Miyagi with decaying its rate. Finally, based on the estimated results, we computed postseismic offshore crustal movements by using the same elastic-viscoelastic structure model and compared them with seafloor geodetic observations (Watanabe et al., 2014). The good agreement between the computed crustal movements and the observations in both spatial pattern and transient behavior demonstrates the validity of our inversion results for coseismic slip and afterslip distributions.",

While databases are good at metadata modelled in tables, XML hierarchies, or RDF graphs, they traditionally do not support multi-dimensional arrays.\nThis gap is being closed by Array Databases, pioneered by the scalable rasdaman (\"raster data manager\") array engine. Its declarative query language, rasql, extends SQL with array operators which are optimized and parallelized on server side. Installations can easily be mashed up securely, thereby enabling large-scale location-transparent query processing in federations. Domain experts value the integration with their commonly used tools leading to a quick learning curve.\nEarth, Space, and Life sciences, but also Social sciences as well as business have massive amounts of data and complex analysis challenges that are answered by rasdaman. As of today, rasdaman is mature and in operational use on hundreds of Terabytes of timeseries datacubes, with transparent query distribution across more than 1,000 nodes. Additionally, its concepts have shaped international Big Data standards in the field, including the forthcoming array extension to ISO SQL, many of which are supported by both open-source and commercial systems meantime. In the geo field, rasdaman is reference implementation for the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Big Data standard, WCS, now also under adoption by ISO. Further, rasdaman is in the final stage of OSGeo incubation.\nIn this contribution we present array queries a la rasdaman, describe the architecture and novel optimization and parallelization techniques introduced in 2015, and put this in context of the intercontinental EarthServer initiative which utilizes rasdaman for enabling agile analytics on Petascale datacubes.",

            "abstract": "Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering large amounts of atmospheric CO2. The CO2 sequestered by a forest varies depending on many factors including climate, species composition, growth strategy, stand age and structure. Forests are structurally complex ecosystems, both horizontally and vertically. In many cases, several canopy layers with distinct functional properties and sun exposure contribute differently to the ecosystem CO2exchange. Only a few studies thus far have investigated the contribution of understory to overstory fluxes, and large variations have been found among sites.\nOur study focused on partitioning the net ecosystem CO2 flux of a mixed deciduous forest in Switzerland into its understory and overstory components using below and above canopy eddy-covariance (EC) measurements over two years. CO2 concentration profile measurements made at eight levels within the canopy complemented those measurements. We quantified the CO2flux contribution from the understory to the overstory, both in terms of photosynthesis and respiration, and assessed the differences between understory and overstory functional responses to environmental drivers.\nOn an annual basis, the understory was a CO2 source, while the overstory was a CO2 sink. The understory was a CO2 sink only in spring with the early emergence of understory plants before overstory canopy leaf-out. Overall, the understory contributed 54% to annual ecosystem respiration but only 7% to annual ecosystem photosynthesis. Moreover, understory and overstory fluxes became decoupled at full canopy closure, thus leading to unaccounted EC fluxes when measured only above the canopy. CO2 concentration profile measurements supported this finding. Our results showed that understory EC measurements are essential in this mixed deciduous forest, and likely in many other forests, to fully understand the carbon dynamics within structurally complex ecosystems.",

In the PIC approach, the waves are self-consistently generated by the temperature anisotropy instability that quickly saturates and relaxes the system toward marginal stability.\nWe show that the quasi-linear diffusion and PIC results have significant quantitative mismatch in regions of energy/pitch angle where the resonance condition is not satisfied. Moreover, for pitch angles close to the loss cone the diffusion code overestimates the scattering, particularly at low energies. This suggests that higher-order nonlinear theories should be taken in consideration in order to capture non-resonant interactions, resonance broadening, and to account for scattering at angles close to 90 degree.\nFinally, we show that pitch angle diffusion is enhanced during the linear wave growth phase, and it rapidly saturates well before a single bounce period. We discuss how the saturation is related to the fact that the domain in which the particles pitch angle diffuse is bounded, and to the well-known problem of 90 degree diffusion barrier.",

However, interpretation of the signals associated with explosive activity is still equivocal, due to both source variability and the intrinsically limited information carried by the waves. Comparison and cross-correlation of the geophysical quantities with other information in general and visual recording in particular is therefore actively sought. At Etna (Italy) in July 2014, short-lived Strombolian explosions ejected bomb- to lapilli-sized, molten pyroclasts at a remarkably repeatable time interval of about two seconds, offering a rare occasion to systematically investigate the seismic and acoustic fields radiated by this common volcanic source. We deployed FAMoUS (FAst, MUltiparametric Setup for the study of explosive activity) at 260 meters from the vents, recording more than 60 explosions in thermal and visible high-speed videos (50 to 500 frames per second) and broadband seismic and acoustic instruments (1 to 10000 Hz for the acoustic and from 0.01 to 30 Hz for the seismic). Analysis of this dataset highlights nonlinear relationships between the exit velocity and mass of ejecta and the amplitude and frequency of the acoustic signals. It also allows comparing different methods to estimate source depth, and to validate existing theory on the coupling of airwaves with ground motion.",

This is commonly accepted ethics. But how would you \"tell society\" at large what you are doing? Scientific work typically is difficult to confer to lay people, and finding suitable simplifications and paraphrasings requires considerable effort. Estimating societal implications is dangerous as swimming with sharks, some of which are your own colleagues. Media tend to be not always interested - unless results are particularly spectacular, well, in a press sense. Again, sharks are luring. All this makes informing the public a tedious, time-consuming task which tends to receive not much appreciation in tenure negotiations where indexed publications are the first and foremost measure.\nAs part of the EU funded EarthServer initiative we tried it. Having promised a \"video about the project\" we found it boring to do another 10 minute repetition from the grant contract and started aiming at a full TV documentary explaining \"Big Earth Data\" to the interested citizens. It took more than one year to convince a TV producing company and TV stations that this is not another feature about the beauty of nature or catastrophies, but about human insight from computer-supported sifting through all those observations and simulations available. After they got the gist they were fully on board and supported financially with a substantial amount. The final 53 minutes \"Big Earth Data\" movie was broadcast in February 2015 in German and French (English version available from ). Several smaller spin-off features originated around it, such as an uptake of the theme (and material) in a popular German science TV series.\nOf course, this is but one contribution and cannot be made a continuous activity. In the talk we want to present and discuss the \"making of\" from a scientist's perspective, highlighting the ups and downs in the process, in the hope that it contributes to our profession's quest for materializing its scientific outreach promise.",

When the water temperature gradient is positive, the sensor temperature rises; In contrast, borehole sensor temperature drops, which explains the same step change of well water and well water temperature.\nAs for three observation wells, the change in water level is in the opposite direction to the change in water temperature, which is the post-seismic effect. Meanwhile, one observation well has only water temperature co-seismic change but no water level change, which may have great relation to the borehole condition, water temperature gradient, sensor position and water depth. The results also show that there is complex relationship between of time and amplitude of groundwater level change and those of groundwater temperature change, which is affected by borehole conditions and temperature gradients.",

            "abstract": "New insights related to time-dependent bias corrections in global surface temperatures have led to higher rates of warming over the past few decades than previously reported in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014). Record high global temperatures in the past few years have also contributed to larger trends. The combination of these factors and new analyses of the rate of temperature change show unabated global warming since at least the mid-Twentieth Century.\nNew time-dependent bias corrections account for: (1) differences in temperatures measured from ships and drifting buoys; (2) improved corrections to ship measured temperatures; and (3) the larger rates of warming in polar regions (particularly the Arctic). Since 1951, the period over which IPCC (2014) attributes over half of the observed global warming to human causes, it is shown that there has been a remarkably robust and sustained warming, punctuated with inter-annual and decadal variability. This finding is confirmed through simple trend analysis and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Trend analysis however, especially for decadal trends, is sensitive to selection bias of beginning and ending dates. EMD has no selection bias. Additionally, it can highlight both short- and long-term processes affecting the global temperature times series since it addresses both non-linear and non-stationary processes. For the new NOAA global temperature data set, our analyses do not support the notion of a hiatus or slowing of long-term global warming. However, sub-decadal periods of little (or no warming) and rapid warming can also be found, clearly showing the impact of inter-annual and decadal variability that previously has been attributed to both natural and human-induced non-greenhouse forcings.",

They included the measurement of thermomagnetic curves, hysteresis parameters and IRM acquisition curves. Mostly reversible but also non-reversible curves were recorded in thermomagnetic experiments, with low-Ti titanomagnetite being the main carrier of remanence in most studied flows. Paleomagnetic analysis showed in most cases a single component and a characteristic component could be determined in 15 flows, all displaying normal-polarity.\n83 samples from 13 flows were chosen for paleointensity experiments. In order to compare paleointensity results from exactly the same samples, they were cut into smaller specimens so that in each case a specimen was available to be used for a Thellier-type paleointensity determination, another one for a multispecimen paleointensity experiment and another one for rock-magnetic experiments. Thermomagnetic curves could be therefore measured on all samples subjected to paleointensity experiments.\nThellier-type paleointensity determinations were performed with the Coe method between room temperature and 581°C on small (0.9 cm diameter and 1 to 2.5 cm length) specimens. After heating, samples were left cooling down naturally during several hours.\nMultispecimen paleointensity determinations were carried out using the method of Dekkers and Böhnel. The aforementioned sub-samples were cut into 8 specimens and pressed into salt pellets in order to obtain standard cylindrical specimens. A set of eight experiments was performed using laboratory fields from 10 to 80 μT, with increments of 10 μT. Samples were oriented in such a way that the NRM directions of each sub specimen lay parallel to the axis of the heating chamber and were heated at a temperature of 450°C.\nResults obtained with both methods are compared and discussed.",

            "abstract": "One of the most critical variables in semiarid environment is the soil water content that represents a controlling factor for both ecological and hydrological processes. Soil moisture monitoring over large scales may be extremely useful, but it is limited by the fact that most of the available tools provides only surface measurements not representative of the effective amount of water stored in the subsurface. Therefore, a methodology able to infer root-zone soil moisture starting from surface measurements is highly desirable. Recently a new simplified formulation has been introduced to provide a formal description of the mathematical relationship between surface measurements and root-zone soil moisture (Manfreda et al., HESS 2014). This is a physically based approach derived from the soil water balance equation, where different soil water loss functions have been explored in order to take into account for the non-linear processes governing soil water fluxes. The study highlighted that the soil loss function is the key for such relationship that is therefore strongly influenced by soil type and physiological plant types. The new formulation has been tested on soil moisture based on measurements taken from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) and the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) databases. The method sheds lights on the physical controls for soil moisture dynamics and on the possibility to use such a simplified method for the description of root-zone soil moisture. Furthermore, the method has been also couple with an Enasamble Kalman Filter (EnKF) in order to optimize its performances for the large scale monitoring based the new satellite near-surface moisture data (SMAP). The optimized SMAR-EnKF model does well in both wet and dry climates and across many different soil types (51 SCAN locations) providing a strategy for real-time soil moisture monitoring.",

Dehyroxylation of goethite to hematite at temperatures as low as 150°C produces poorly crystalline, psuedomorphic hematite that may become rapidly recrystallized and converted to magnetite or maghemite in a reducing environment. New experiments were conducted to understand the influence of goethite grain size and crystallinity and the concentration of organic matter on the production of remanence-bearing phases during alteration. Pyrogenic alteration and deep burial metamorphic processes in organic-rich soils and sediments were simulated in a series of heating experiments to observe the evolution of secondary (chemical) remanence with increasing alteration temperatures. The implications for long-term goethite stability at ambient temperatures in soils and sediments will also be discussed in the context of the solid-state reaction kinetics and the influence of non-solid-state processes.",

            "abstract": "Increased understanding on how marine species shift their distribution is required for effective conservation of fishery resources under climate change. Previous studies have often predicted distributional shifts of fish using satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST). However, SST may not fully represent the changes in species distribution through food web structure and as such this remains an open issue due to lack of ecological perspective on energy transfer process in the earlier studies. One of the most important factors in ecosystem is composition of phytoplankton community, and its size structure determines energy flow efficiency from base to higher trophic levels. To elucidate spatiotemporal variation in phytoplankton size structure, chlorophyll-a size distribution (CSD) algorithm was developed using spectral variance of phytoplankton absorption coefficient through principal component analysis. Slope of CSD (CSD slope) indicates size structure of phytoplankton community where, strong and weak magnitudes of CSD slope indicate smaller and larger phytoplankton structure, respectively. Shifts in CSD slope and SST were derived as the ratio of temporal trend over the 12-year period (2003-2014) to 2-dimensional spatial gradient and the resulting global median velocity of CSD slope and SST were 0.361 and 0.733 km year-1, respectively. In addition, the velocity of CSD slope monotonically increases with increasing latitude, while relatively complex latitudinal pattern for SST emerged. Moreover, angle of shifts suggest that species are required to shift their distribution toward not limited to simple pole-ward migration, and some regions exhibit opposite direction between the velocity of CSD slope and SST. These findings further imply that combined phytoplankton size structure and SST may contribute for more accurate prediction of species distribution shifts relative to existing studies which only considering variations in thermal niches.

High precision and accuracy are possible for inorganic calcite, but continued testing is essential to establish the accuracy of this novel technique for biocarbonates; hence, a comparative study was conducted using both in situ SIMS (IMS 1280) and standard gas-source IRMS analyses to measure the δ18O in the same chamber of a foraminifera shell. An initial experiment was performed on 18 Orbulina universa shells (~600 μm) exhibiting varying states of preservation (3 well-preserved glassy, 1 intermediate, 14 frosty) handpicked from the uppermost 2 cm (Holocene) of a piston core (PC9) retrieved from the northwestern Atlantic. The spherical chamber of each shell was manually broken into smaller fragments with the majority of the fragments pooled for δ18O analysis by IRMS, and a remaining fragment cast in epoxy for SIMS. Comparison of average SIMS δ18O values to corresponding IRMS δ18O values for the same chamber reveals a linear relationship across a 3‰ range in glassy and frosty shells with the SIMS values being 0.9 ± 0.7‰ (2SD) lower. This 0.9‰ offset is also seen in O. universa shells (1 glassy, 3 intermediate, 10 frosty) that have undergone hydrogen peroxide cleaning and sonication. The δ18O offset is being further investigated using manually fragmented O. universa shells from the core-top of PC9 that have been vacuum roasted as well as cultured specimens grown under controlled conditions. Through these additional experiments we are exploring possible offset mechanisms including: errors in SIMS and gas-source analysis; differences between the coarsely crystalline homogeneous SIMS standards and complex biocarbonate samples; and zoning in shells due to growth, diagenesis or other components not targeted by SIMS.",

All the pathways require increase in bioenergy deployment, of which a significant amount could be indigenously sourced from crops. But will increased domestic production of energy crops conflict with other land use and ecosystem priorities?\nTo address this question, a coupled analysis of the four energy transition pathways and land use has been developed using an integrated resource accounting platform called ForeseerTM. The two systems are connected by the bioenergy component, and are projected forward in time to 2050, under different scenarios of energy crop composition and yield, and accounting for various constraints on land use for agriculture and ecosystem services.\nThe results show between 7 and 61% of UK agricultural land could be required to meet bioenergy deployment projections under different combinations of crop yield and compositions for the transition pathways. This could result in competition for land for food production and other socio-economic and ecological land uses. Consequently, the potential role of bioenergy in achieving UK emissions reduction targets may face significant deployment challenges.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosol can alter the Earth’s radiative budget and global climate but can also affect human health. A dominant contributor to the submicrometer particulate matter (PM) is organic aerosol (OA). OA can be either directly emitted through e.g. combustion processes (primary OA) or formed through the oxidation of organic gases (secondary organic aerosol, SOA). A detailed understanding of SOA formation is of importance as it constitutes a major contribution to the total OA. The partitioning between the gas and particle phase as well as the volatility of individual components of SOA is yet poorly understood adding uncertainties and thus complicating climate modelling.\nIn this work, a new experimental methodology was used for compound-specific analysis of organic aerosol. The Aerosol Collection Module (ACM) is a newly developed instrument that deploys an aerodynamic lens to separate the gas and particle phase of an aerosol. The particle phase is directed to a cooled sampling surface. After collection particles are thermally desorbed and transferred to a detector for further analysis. In the present work, the ACM was coupled to a Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) to detect and quantify organic compounds partitioning between the gas and particle phase. This experimental approach was used in a set of experiments at the atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR to investigate SOA formation. Ozone oxidation with subsequent photochemical aging of β-pinene, limonene and real plant emissions from Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) were studied. Simultaneous measurement of the gas and particle phase using the ACM-PTR-ToF-MS allows to report partitioning coefficients of important BVOC oxidation products. Additionally, volatility trends and changes of the SOA with photochemical aging are investigated and compared for all systems studied.",

The MLTWA method have been used numerous earthquake data at once to simulate the energy of observed seismic envelopes with theoretical values obtained by a single source assumption. The theoretical values of MLTWA method is normally obtained by numerical method such as Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method due to availability for various source depth. One of the major concerns with the MLTWA method is that, it normally shows a large observational scatter caused by the multiple use of earthquakes which have different radiation pattern and focal depth, and the regional alteration of local structure. Recently our study of MLTWA using single event showed realistic results when the number of recorded station was more than 8, without consideration of radiation pattern in DSMC method (Asep et al., 2015). In particular, Asep et al. (2015) found the significant effect of source depth which had been neglected by the previous MLTWA studies (Asep et al. (2015). This study, therefore, focused on the depth effect of MLTWA by relocation of 53 earthquakes occurred in S. Korea from March 2003 to December 2014. To obtain reliable depths of these events, seven crustal models (Fig. 1) were constructed based on two refraction profiles across the Korean Peninsula. The Vp/Vs ratio and the preliminary origin time (POT) was obtained by the Wadati plot. Since focal depth and origin time is a coupled data, a series of inversions using HYPO71 were performed for only three parameters (latitude, longitude, and origin time) of earthquakes while keeping its depth fixed each time. The residuals were calculated for varied focal depth from 0 to 30 km with an increment of 0.5 km, and depth range of minimum rms residual (minimum rms residual plus 0.05) was selected. For the minimum depth range of seven models, the closest range with the POT was selected as the most reliable depth range. Based on this reliable depth, MLTWA using single event showed good correlation between scattering attenuation value and depth (presently processing).",

            "abstract": "A review of 150 publications on the subsurface microbiology of the continental subsurface provides ~1,400 measurements of cellular abundances down to 4,800 meter depth. These data suggest that the continental subsurface biomass is comprised of ~1016-17 grams of carbon, which is higher than the most recent estimates of ~1015 grams of carbon (1 Gt) for the marine deep biosphere. If life developed early in Martian history and Mars sustained an active hydrological cycle during its first 500 million years, then is it possible that Mars could have developed a subsurface biomass of comparable size to that of Earth? Such a biomass would comprise a much larger fraction of the total known Martian carbon budget than does the subsurface biomass on Earth. More importantly could a remnant of this subsurface biosphere survive to the present day? To determine how sustainable subsurface life could be in isolation from the surface we have been studying subsurface fracture fluids from the Precambrian Shields in South Africa and Canada. In these environments the energetically efficient and deeply rooted acetyl-CoA pathway for carbon fixation plays a central role for chemolithoautotrophic primary producers that form the base of the biomass pyramid. These primary producers appear to be sustained indefinitely by H2 generated through serpentinization and radiolytic reactions. Carbon isotope data suggest that in some subsurface locations a much larger population of secondary consumers are sustained by the primary production of biogenic CH4 from a much smaller population of methanogens. These inverted biomass and energy pyramids sustained by the cycling of CH4 could have been and could still be active on Mars. The C and H isotopic signatures of Martian CH4 remain key tools in identifying potential signatures of an extant Martian biosphere. Based upon our results to date cavity ring-down spectroscopic technologies provide an option for making these measurements on future rover missions.",

            "abstract": "We present a simulation of effects of whistler-mode waves on radiation belt electrons for the entire month of March 2013. Frequency dependent wave intensities as well as ambient plasma density are obtained from the EMFISIS Waves instrument onboard the Van Allen Probes using fine temporal (8 hours) and spatial (0.1L) resolutions. Pitch angle diffusion that produces electron scattering is computed using the Lyons et al. [1972] model, from L=1.8 to L=5.5 and energy in [0.05, 6] MeV. Electron lifetimes are deduced from the steady state of electron pitch angle diffusion. Such a computation requires 4000 thousands processors during 10 hours. It leads to a fine description of the hiss effects in the plasmasphere and in its exterior neighborhood. Losses follow a complex and dynamic filamentary structure, imposed by the wave properties (mainly frequency and amplitude), that sculpts the slot as such. Their daily structure in the (E-L) plane is characteristic [Lyons & Thorne, 1973], dynamic, and similar to recent slot observations from the Van Allen probes [Reeves et al., 2015]. Low energy electrons are less influenced by intense hiss scattering below L=4, which favors their travel down to the vicinity of the Earth, explaining thus the existence of a wide inner belt. On the other hand MeV electrons evolve in a more hostile environment that will depopulate them as they migrate from L~5 down to L~2.5. Ultra-relativistic electrons are not sensible to hiss waves before two and three Earth radii.",

            "abstract": "On an average Martian afternoon, two or three local dust storms are taking place somewhere on the planet. By definition, these storms range in area from a few square kilometers to hundreds of thousands, rarely surviving from sol to the next. After more than 40 years of observation, a great deal is known about where and when they occur, but very little is known about the structure and dynamics of individual storms.\nThis contrast in our knowledge about local dust storms results from how they are observed. Daily global mapping of Mars in the visible has enabled an accurate census of storms as well as observation of their morphological diversity. However, even under ideal conditions, an individual storm is only observed by sounder-type instrumentation once or twice (if it is a large enough), providing an incomplete picture of structure of an individual storm.\nEarly studies of cyclogenesis on Earth had a similar problem. Cyclones were many, but observations of individual cyclones, especially over the ocean, were sparse. The structure and dynamics of cyclones was unraveled by noting similarities in properties between certain classes of cyclones and using observational data to generate composite cyclones that could be analyzed and modeled. Variability within the composite also could be studied.\nHere I establish the existence of a well-defined class of Martian local dust storms defined by: (1) occurrence along the axis of the dark albedo feature in northern Amazonis Planitia (36 N, 155 W); (2) not being associated with lifting or cloudiness due to a baroclinic wave/frontal boundary at higher latitude; (3) being textured, that is, having dust clouds with sharp, well-defined features that are thought to indicate their clouds are supplied by the active lifting of dust; (4) having dust clouds organized in well-defined streets indicative of convective rolls. In Mars Year 24, such storms developed on thirteen occasions in northern fall and autumn.\nUsing data from the Mars Orbiter Camera, Thermal Emission Spectrometer, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter on Mars Global Surveyor, I will present a composite description of the structure of an individual storm of this class and its variability.\nThis work is supported by NASA's Mars Data Analysis Program (NNX14AM32G).",

            "abstract": "Surface Temperature (ST) changes in the Polar Regions are predicted to be more rapid than either global averages or responses in lower latitudes. Observations increasingly confirm these findings in the Arctic. It is, therefore, particularly important to monitor Arctic climate change. Satellites are particularly relevant to observations of Polar latitudes as they are well-served by low-Earth orbiting satellites. Whilst clouds often cause problems for satellite observations of the surface, in situ observations are much sparser. The ATSRs are accurate infra-red satellite radiometers, designed explicitly for climate standard observations and particularly suited to surface temperature observations. ATSR radiance observations have been used to retrieve sea and land surface temperature for a series of three instruments over a period greater than twenty years. We have combined land, ocean and sea-ice surface temperature retrievals from ATSR-2 and AATSR to produce a new surface temperature dataset for the Arctic; the ATSR Arctic combined Surface Temperature (AAST) dataset. The method of cloud-clearing, use of auxiliary data for ice classification and the ST retrievals used for each surface-type will be described. We will establish the accuracy of sea-ice and land-ice retrievals with recent results from validation against in situ data. Time series of ST anomalies for each surface type will be presented. The time series for open ocean in the Arctic Polar Region shows a significant warming trend during the AATSR mission. Interpretation of this trend must take into consideration changes in open-water extent and this will be discussed. Time series for land, land-ice and sea-ice show high variability as expected but also interesting patterns. Overall, our purpose is to present the state-of-the-art for ATSR observations of surface temperature change in the Arctic and hence indicate confidence we can have in temperature change across all three domains, and in combination.",

            "abstract": "The monsoon system serves as a \"bridge\" in the atmosphere; it connects the circulation between high and low latitudes, influencing the most densely populated regions on Earth. However, what role it played in the geological history is still elusive despite its significance. The climate of South China Sea and the ambient land masses are dominated by the East Asian monsoon, composed of the temperature-cooling East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the rain-bearing East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). In this study, high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST), terrestrial input and humidity changes since ~28 ka were reconstructed based on alkenones and long chain n-alkanes records in core MD12-3428 in northern South China Sea.\nOur results demonstrated complex and dynamic paleoclimatic situations since the last glacial superimposed on the overall glacial-interglacial trend. During the last deglacial, the rising of the sea level can be dated back to 17 ka and ended at ~12 ka, according to the gradual decrease of long chain n-alkanes concentrations. However, the SST warming began at ~15 ka (~2 000 years after the initial sea level uplift) and achieved a relatively stable state in mid-Holocene (~6 000 years after the sea level stablization). The humidity varibility linked with EASM based on C31/C27 and ACL record indicated highly humid conditions within the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) period, followed by a rapid drying towards the glacial level during Younger Dryas (YD). EASM gradually strengthened after YD when the sea level had run up to almost the present state, and weakened after ~6 ka when sea level and SST both reached the plateau. These large fluctuations of C31/C27 and ACL implied that humidity was more sensitive to climate events since the last deglacial when compared with SST and sea level.\nThe asynchronous patterns of East Asian monsoon climate proxies in the present work indicated the complex heat transport and atmospheric circulation between low and high latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: According to a detailed analysis of georesistivity data recorded from 2004 to 2011 by the PS100 geoelectric stations, a number of georesistivity pulses which appeared a couple of months to a couple of days before large earthquakes (eg., Wenchuan earthquake, Ms8.0, 2008; Yushu earthquake, Ms7.3, 2010) are reported in this study. These pulses may be responses of the wave related to tidal force and the wave may generate in the earthquake source region for the following reasons: Firstly, statistics indicate that the duration time of these pulses ranges from 8 to 22 hours and concentrate on about 13 hours which is roughly in agreement with the period of the tidal force M2 (12h25min); Secondly, time delays (T, unit: hour) exist between the arrival time of the pulses’ minima and gravity tide maxima and they differ from the distance (d, unit: km) between the earthquake epicenter and PS100 stations, but what’s may be more interesting is that the distance and time delays satisfy the formula of d=41.47T, suggesting that this kind of pulses shows some wave-like properties. Further investigations reveal that the wave may be the result of perturbation of the mass beneath the earthquake source region in the critical stage of earthquake when the crust is weakened on a large scale and it will be useful for earthquake prediction.\nKey words: Tidal force, Georesistivity pulses, Wenchuan earthquake, Yushu earthquake, Sumatra earthquake",

The main goal of GOFC/GOLD is to support a forum for international information exchange, observation and data coordination, and a framework for establishing the necessary long-term monitoring systems. GOFC-GOLD has two Implementation Teams: Land Cover Characteristics and Change, and Fire Monitoring and Mapping. Additionally, it includes two working groups: the Working Group on Biomass Monitoring and the Working group on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), the latter being aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Regional networks are an integral part of the GOFC-GOLD program, with some networks fully developed and some still emerging. GOFC-GOLD provides training workshops to build capacity in the regions. Capacity building in using Earth Observation techniques and applications is also promoted by cooperation of NASA and ESA under the Trans-Atlantic Training (TAT) program. The main objective of TAT is training of early career scientists and students in East European and Baltic countries emphasizing outstanding technical issues in remote sensing of land-cover/land-use change and ecosystems processes. TAT promotes data sharing and advanced research methods and technologies through series of training sessions. Three TAT sessions have been held until now, each session consisting of 5-10 tutors and about 30 early career scientists and students from Eastern Europe. The sessions include lectures on remote sensing covering the full solar spectrum and hands-on practice. The experience obtained in capacity building activities under GOFC-GOLD and TAT will be shared with the audience.",

We use high-resolution NO2 data from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to identify energy sources and to monitor how NO2 levels, and subsequently, energy usage, evolved from 2005 to 2014. We find complex heterogeneity in trends on both urban and regional scales around the world. Trends for the majority of cities were determined by several factors. First, environmental regulations resulted in strong negative trends over many industrialized countries. The only strong positive trend over the U.S. occurred over the Williston Basin, an area of intense energy extraction activities. Second, strong economic growth elevated NO2 levels over many tropical megacities and China. Two of the highest trends occurred over the recently expanded Jamnagar Refining and Petrochemical Complex (India), the world’s largest oil refinery, and the Incheon Free Trade Zone (Korea). Third, increasing pollution transport from China diminished the effectiveness of emission controls in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Over China, there were three areas of strong negative trends associated with emission control efforts of Beijing, Shanghai, and cities in the Pearl River Delta. Fourth, the impact of civil unrest is seen over Libya, Iraq, and Syria. Fifth, spatial heterogeneity of trends within several megacities reflects mixed success in coping with air quality degradation. We demonstrate the value of high-resolution data for quantifying emissions from individual sources in complex source regions, using the Johannesburg megacity with its intensive thermal power generation and industry as a case study. Looking ahead, intensive monitoring, composed of satellite and surface instruments, is needed for the world’s tropical and subtropical megacities, where a dramatic increase in population, energy use, and emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases are expected in the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "As a preliminary experiment, a low-cost method to determine the capacity of water to take up carbon dioxide was used. Several factors affecting the solubility of CO2 in water were tested. Among the factors tested was the presence of olivine, a mineral used to enhance the uptake of CO2 by soils through a process called Enhanced Weathering. Literature search indicated that olivine increases the alkalinity and concentration of silicate in water and thus increasing the capacity of water to take up CO2. This, however, could not be verified with the said method. Albeit, further experiments showed that the concentration of silicate in distilled water with olivine increases if the water was acidified with CO2.\nIn an additional investigation, to different types of water (distilled water, Baltic seawater (15 ppt) and North Atlantic Seawater (35 ppt)), powdered olivine was added in a concentration of 1g/litre. These were treated with different concentrations of CO2 (400,800,1200 ppm) at 15°C. 400 ppm is the present concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Alkalinity, pH, silicate and magnesium concentrations were monitored for a period of 10 days. To test if the silicate released from the dissolution of olivine promotes the growth of phytoplankton, the diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was cultured in the Baltic seawater used for the above experiments and Chlorophyll a concentrations were measured.\nFirst results show that the effectiveness of olivine in increasing the alkalinity, pH, silicate and magnesium concentrations is limited only in the distilled water sample. This may be due to other ions in seawater which might be interfering in the dissolution of olivine. The powdered olivine sank immediately to the bottom of the containers, indicating that this does not stay long in the water column to cause any significant changes in CO2 uptake, which occurs primarily in the surface of the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Most public communication about cutting-edge science happens through a series of filters – press teams, science journalists, news outlets, or even bloggers. Unfortunately, these filters can sometimes lead to research being presented in a way that demotivates the researchers from wanting to translate their science for a broader audience in the future. Frontiers for Young Minds was developed to bridge this gap by publishing plain-language research articles that are written by scientists about their own research and “peer reviewed” by kids ages 8-15 for their own young peers. Though Frontiers for Young Minds authors know that they are creating a high-quality science resource that will be freely available online, many are surprised by the lessons they stand to learn by having direct access to their target audience for feedback. The young reviewers can be refreshingly blunt, questioning everything from why money was spent on such a project to why researchers would make something that should be exciting “too boring to even finish reading.” Frontiers for Young Minds is compiling this feedback to create guides for researchers who want to translate their research for young readers, including: using your structure as part of the communication process, the dangers of explaining too much at once, reading to learn, limitations in vocabulary for different age groups, outreach figures – vs – research figures, defining your communication goals, communicating motivation and context, and sharing your excitement. We are working to share our experiences and create resources that will not only be useful for people participating in Frontiers for Young Minds, but for anyone who wants to become a better science communicator.",

            "abstract": "Mode water formation has long been treated as a buoyancy flux problem, however this approach fails to explain the spatial distribution and variability of dense water in the Northwestern Mediterranean. This paper proposes to adopt a PV-perspective (PV: Potential Vorticity) rather than the usual surface flux approach to identify the processes of dense water formation during the HyMeX/ASICS experiment.\nThe PV-budget was diagnosed from an ocean simulation performed with the NEMO-WMED36 ocean model (1/36°-resolution), driven in surface by the hourly air-sea fluxes from the AROME-WMED forecasts model (2.5km-resolution) during winter 2012-2013.\nIf a large part of dense water is produced at the centre of the cyclonic gyre, a significant production of dense water (rho>29 kg/m3) is also found along the rim of the cyclonic gyre where the current (North Current) and gradients of density are strong. The spatial distribution of dense waters is well collocated with the PV-destruction associated with the surface frictional and buoyancy PV-fluxes. This suggests that surface PV destructions by winds are sources of destratification and are the relevant forcings of dense water formation.\nThe negative PV created around the gyre forces a cross-front ageostrophic circulation which subducts subsurface low-PV into interior and obducts high-PV from the thermocline to the surface. The horizontal and vertical advections associated with the 3D ageostrophic circulation in the frontal region are positive and plays a role of PV-refueling destroyed by surface winds. Finally eddies formed by baroclinic instability are expulsed from the cyclonic gyre and transport the low-PV produced in the frontal region towards the centre of the gyre. This non-local process contributes to destratify the convection area.",

            "abstract": "Ramadas volcanic centre (6.6 Ma) is a monogenetic calderic depression, now largely obliterated, almost coeval with the Late Miocene outbreak of highly explosive silicic activity in the Altiplano-Puna plateau. Ramadas erupted a rather complex suite of garnet-bearing, rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks, dominated by a >35 km3 fall deposit and preceded by the emplacement of a lag breccia containing abundant metasedimentary lithics and garnet-tourmaline leucogranites. During the waning stage of the eruption, small volume phreatomagmatic deposits formed a small tuff-ring, followed by a lava coulée emplacement. Volcanological data together with textural features of typical tube pumice evidence a volatiles-rich, plinian eruption. Petrographic and textural studies on juveniles confirm the presence of euhedral garnet as dominant phase and identify micrometric metaigneous fragments (Qtz+Bt+Kfs+Mt+Tur). BSE imaging and microprobe analyses on glasses, garnets and accessory mineral phases (zircon and monazite) provide further data to understand the genesis and eruptive conditions of these atypical rhyolites, geochemically different from those outcropping in the same region. Garnets display a homogeneous, unzoned almandine-spessartine composition (Alm72-71Sps24-23Pyr0-1Grs4-3) and are contained in a glassy rhyolitic magma with peraluminous character, HREE depleted and relative LREE enriched. It’s known that primary igneous garnets are rare and can only develop under restricted conditions. Additionally, the presence of Zr and Mnz is associated with both magmatic and high-T metamorphic processes. Although more data need to be collected, our study and preliminary modelling point to the occurrence of thermal metamorphism shifting to partial melting of Fe-MnO-rich metapelitic rocks (or even re-melting of older acid volcanics), with final extraction of volatiles-rich rhyolitic melts, able to produce a plinian eruption. Here, Alm-Sps garnet could represent the peritectic product of the melting reactions at P≤ 5 Kbar and T= 550-800°C.",

            "abstract": "Middle Miocene climate had boundary conditions different from the Pleistocene but similar to those predicted for Earth’s future including substantial Antarctic ice cover without permanent northern hemisphere ice sheets. Under these boundary conditions, comparatively little is known about monsoon variability. Here we show using terrestrial sediments in the Tianshui Basin, Gansu, China that East Asian monsoon variability during a portion of the Middle Miocene (~13.9 – 13.4 Ma) was obliquity-paced. The sediments, part of the Yanwan section, consist of siltstones strongly modified by pedogenesis, such that primary sedimentary structures are largely absent. 20 cm thick, well-cemented CaCO3 cliff-forming horizons containing root-pore cements and clay nodules are inter-bedded at regular ~1m intervals with slope-forming siltstones containing clay films, well-preserved roots up to 2 cm in diameter, and variable abundances of 0.1–2cm diameter CaCO3 nodules. Stronger pedogenesis in the well-cemented horizons typify soil K horizons that develop in seasonal climates when sedimentation is slower, whereas the weaker pedogenesis in the siltstones occurs when sedimentation is faster. Thus this cyclic stratigraphy was likely generated by changes in sedimentation rate, which governed the intensity of pedogenesis and was likely controlled by variability of the winter monsoon (if the sediments are aeolian) or the summer monsoon (if fluvial). Obliquity (41 kyr) pacing of the inferred monsoon variability is concluded from counting the cycles in a 12m subsection dated by magnetostratigraphy. Obliquity–paced (41kyr) monsoon variability was likely controlled by insolation-driven changes in the meridional temperature gradient and may relate to southern hemisphere ice volume.",

            "abstract": "We use the EMAC global model with the aerosol module MADE to quantify the impact of aviation emissions on the global aerosol. We focus on the year 2000, prescribing the emissions according to the CMIP5 inventory, and on the year 2030, according to the four RCP scenarios. Various sensitivity experiments are performed to further quantify: (i) the uncertainty behind different assumptions on the size distribution of aviation-emitted particles; (ii) the effect of aviation fuel sulfur content on the simulated impacts; (iii) the linearity of the system’s response to emission perturbation. The simulations show that the aviation impact on particle mass (black carbon and sulfate) is small, on the order of a few percent, whereas a large effect is found for particle number. In the northern mid-latitudes’ upper troposphere (7-12 km), up to 30-40% of the modelled particle number concentration is attributable to aviation. Significant effects are also simulated at the ground, due to the emissions from landing and take-off cycles. The aviation induced perturbations to the particle number concentrations are very sensitive to the assumptions on the size distribution of emitted particles and on the fuel sulfur content. The simulated aviation-induced RF in the year 2000 is in the range of −69.5 to 2.4 mW/m2. The bulk of this RF is due to aerosol-cloud effects, in particular to the perturbation of low clouds. All RCP scenarios project an increase in the aviation impact in 2030, ranging between a factor of 2 to 4 with respect to 2000, albeit with large uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of extreme precipitation is important for hydrologic designs. Due to lack of availability of extreme precipitation data for sufficiently large number of years, estimating the probability of extreme events is difficult and extrapolating the distributions to locations where observations are not available is challenging. In an urban setting, the spatial variation of precipitation can be high; the precipitation amounts and patterns often vary within short distances of less than 10 km. Therefore it is crucial to study the uncertainties in the spatial variation of precipitation in urban areas.\nIn this work, the extreme precipitation is modeled spatially using the Bayesian hierarchical spatial analysis and the spatial variation of return levels is studied. The analysis is carried out with both the Peak over Threshold (PoT) and the Block Maxima approaches for defining the extreme precipitation. The study area is Bangalore city, India. Daily data for seventeen stations in and around Bangalore city are considered in the study. The threshold exceedences are modeled using a Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution and the block maxima are modeled using Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. In the hierarchical analysis, the statistical model is specified in three layers. The data layer models the data (either block maxima or the threshold exceedences) at each station. In the process layer, the latent spatial process characterized by geographical and climatological covariates (lat-lon, elevation, mean temperature etc.) which drives the extreme precipitation is modeled and in the prior level, the prior distributions that govern the latent process are modeled. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to obtain the samples of parameters from the posterior distribution of parameters. The spatial maps of return levels for specified return periods, along with the associated uncertainties, are obtained. The results show that there is significant variation in return levels when the data is pooled compared with the return levels obtained at individual sites. Using the various covariates, the best fit model is selected using Deviance Information Criteria. The spatial maps of return levels thus generated are useful in storm water designs, adequacy analysis and identifying the vulnerable flooding areas.",

SSERVI consists of a diverse set of domestic teams and (currently) nine international teams, ultimately represented by greater than 75 distinct research institutions and more than 450 individual researchers and EPO specialists.\nThe decline in funding opportunities after the termination of the Apollo missions to the Moon in the early 1970’s produced a large gap in both the scientific knowledge and experience of the original lunar Apollo researchers and the resurgent group of young lunar/NEA researchers that have emerged within the last 15 years. One of SSERVI's many goals is to bridge this gap through the many networking and scientific connections made between young researchers and established planetary principle investigators. To this end, SSERVI has supported the establishment of NextGen Lunar Scientists and Engineers group (NGLSE), a group of students and early-career professionals designed to build experience and provide networking opportunities to its members. SSERVI has also created the LunarGradCon, a scientific conference dedicated solely to graduate and undergraduate students working in the lunar field. Additionally, SSERVI produces monthly seminars and bi-yearly virtual workshops that introduce students to the wide variety of exploration science being performed in today’s research labs. SSERVI also brokers opportunities for domestic and international student exchange between collaborating laboratories as well as internships at our member institutions.

This area has been the ideal place for the research of continental dynamics and the prediction for risk region of strong earthquake for its complex tectonic environment and frequent seismic activity. Therefore the study on the geomagnetic short period variations is of great significance in the exploration of deep electrical structure, analysis of the seismic origin and deep geodynamics in the Northwestern Yunnan of China .\nThis paper is based on the geomagnetic data from the magnetometer array with 8 sites built in the northwestern Yunnan to explore the deep electrical structure by the method of geomagnetic depth sounding. Firstly, we selected a total of 183 geomagnetic short period events at the range of 6min to 120min period. And we found a north northwest dividing line, of which two sides has the opposite value in the vertical component variation amplitude, which indicates the obvious conductivity anomaly underground. Secondly, the contour maps of the ratio of vertical component and horizontal component variation amplitude ΔZ/ΔH in different periods reflects the changes of a high conductivity belt’s direction and position. In addition, the induction arrows maps within the period of 2 - 256min also shows that on the two sides of the dividing line the induction vectors deviate from each other, and the amplitude and direction of vectors varies with periods regularly. In the light of this, we infer that a high conductivity belt probably exists, which stretches from the deep crust to uppermost mantle and changes with depth constantly with the reference of magnetotelluric sounding.\nIn the end of this paper, the staggered grid finite difference method is used to model the simplified three-dimensional high conductivity anomaly, and the result shows magnetic field distributions are consistent with the observed geomagnetic short period variations characteristics in different periods, which confirms the existence of the high conductivity belt. According to the characteristics of the short period geomagnetic variation above, in combination with the results of previous studies, the synthetic action of partial melting and fluid might be the origin of the belt.",

            "abstract": "Policy and economic driving forces have resulted in a higher demand for biofuel feedstocks in recent years, resulting in substantial increases in cultivated cropland in the northern Great Plains. A cellulosic-based biofuel industry could potentially further impact the region, with grassland and marginal agricultural land converted to perennial grasses or other feedstocks. Scenarios of projected land-use change are needed to enable regional stakeholders to plan for the potential consequences of expanded agricultural activity. Land-use models used to produce spatially explicit scenarios are typically raster-based and are poor at representing ownership units on which land-use change is based. This work describes a hybrid raster/vector-based modeling approach for modeling scenarios of agricultural change in the northern Great Plains. Regional scenarios of agricultural change from 2012 to 2050 were constructed, based partly on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Billion Ton Update. Land-use data built from the 2012 Cropland Data Layer and the 2011 National Land Cover Database was used to establish initial conditions. Field boundaries from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Common Land Unit dataset were used to establish ownership units. A modified version of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Forecasting Scenarios of land-use (FORE-SCE) model was used to ingest vector-based field boundaries to facilitate the modeling of a farmer’s choice of land use for a given year, while patch-based raster methodologies were used to represent expansion of urban/developed lands and other land use conversions. All modeled data were merged to a common raster dataset representing annual land use from 2012 to 2050. The hybrid modeling approach enabled the use of traditional, raster-based methods while integrating vector-based data to represent agricultural fields and other ownership-based units upon which land-use decisions are typically made.",

            "abstract": "One of the main objectives of the Sentinel-3 mission is to measure sea- and land-surface temperature with high-end accuracy and reliability in support of environmental and climate monitoring in an operational context. Calibration and validation are thus key criteria for operationalization within the framework of the Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Centre (S3MPC).\nLand surface temperature (LST) has a long heritage of satellite observations which have facilitated our understanding of land surface and climate change processes, such as desertification, urbanization, deforestation and land/atmosphere coupling. These observations have been acquired from a variety of satellite instruments on platforms in both low-earth orbit and in geostationary orbit. Retrieval accuracy can be a challenge though; surface emissivities can be highly variable owing to the heterogeneity of the land, and atmospheric effects caused by the presence of aerosols and by water vapour absorption can give a bias to the underlying LST. As such, a rigorous validation is critical in order to assess the quality of the data and the associated uncertainties.\nThe Sentinel-3 Cal-Val Plan for evaluating the level-2 SL_2_LST product builds on an established validation protocol for satellite-based LST. This set of guidelines provides a standardized framework for structuring LST validation activities, and is rapidly gaining international recognition. The protocol introduces a four-pronged approach which can be summarised thus: i) in situ validation where ground-based observations are available; ii) radiance-based validation over sites that are homogeneous in emissivity; iii) intercomparison with retrievals from other satellite sensors; iv) time-series analysis to identify artefacts on an interannual time-scale. This multi-dimensional approach is a necessary requirement for assessing the performance of the LST algorithm for SLSTR which is designed around biome-based coefficients, thus emphasizing the importance of non-traditional forms of validation such as radiance-based techniques. Here we present examples of the application of the protocol to data produced within the ESA DUE GlobTemperature Project. The lessons learnt here are helping to fine-tune the methodology in preparation for Sentinel-3 commissioning.",

            "abstract": "Reactive flow at depth (either related to underground activities like enhancement of hydrocarbon recovery, CO2 storage or to natural flow like in hydrothermal zones) can alter fractures’ topography, which might in turn change their seismic responses. Depending on the flow and reaction rates, instability of the dissolution front can lead to a wormhole-like pronounced erosion pattern (Szymczak & Ladd, JGR, 2009). In a fractal structure of rupture process (Ide & Aochi, JGR, 2005), we question how the perturbation related to well-spaced long channels alters rupture propagation initiated on a weak plane and eventually the statistical feature of rupture appearance in Frequency-Magnitude Distribution FMD (Rohmer & Aochi, GJI, 2015). Contrary to intuition, a spatially uniform dissolution is not the most remarkable case, since it affects all the events proportionally to their sizes leading to a downwards translation of FMD: the slope of FMD (b-value) remains unchanged. An in-depth parametric study was carried out by considering different pattern characteristics: spacing S varying from 0 to 100 and length L from 50 to 800 and fixing the width w=1. The figure shows that there is a region of optimum channels’ characteristics for which the b-value of the Gutenberg Richter law is significantly modified with p-value ~10% (corresponding to area with red-coloured boundaries) given spacing to length ratio of the order of ~1/40: large magnitude events are more significantly affected leading to an imbalanced distribution in the magnitude bins of the FMD. The larger the spacing, the lower the channel’s influence. The decrease of the b-value between intact and altered fractures can reach values down to -0.08. Besides, a spatial analysis shows that the local seismicity anomaly concentrates in a limited zone around the channels: this opens perspective for detecting these eroded regions through high-resolution imaging surveys.",

Accordingly, within a region of magnetic field reversal, the wedge-shaped, Alfvenic accelerated plasma outflow is bounded by layers containing (anti-) correlated components of speed and magnetic field fluctuations. However, time-dependent impulsive reconnection can generate flux ropes embedded into accelerated outflows. Reconnection associated moving flux ropes or plasmoids are frequently observed in the Earth’s magnetotail, while similar observations are missing in the solar wind. We present the first observations of small-scale magnetic flux ropes associated with reconnection exhausts in the solar wind, using the data from the WIND probe. We argue that the interaction of moving flux ropes with the background plasma can generate turbulence leading finally to the local heating of the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "The Galileo observations are analyzed to establish possible relationships between dynamic processes occurring in the jovian magnetosdisk and variations in the flux of the radio emissions. More specifically, it is shown that there is a general good correlation between increases of the azimuth component of the magnetic field (B_phi) seen in the middle/distant magnetodisk (distances ranging between 20 to 80 Rj) and intensification of the auroral radio emissions. A simple explanation is that the variations of B_phi are related to modifications in the current system linking the ionosphere to the disk and, thus, to variations in the intensity of the parallel currents with implications on the associated auroral processes. An interpretation is proposed using Hill’s model of the enforcement of the magnetodisk rotation with, however, adaptations to the observations that require the use of a current sheet model (adapted from Nichols, 2003) . The link with possible variations in the radial mass transport is discussed, with estimates of the overall power associated to the magnetic torque that enforces the corotation and accelerates the bulk plasma. From an astrophysical perspective, this offers an interesting opportunity to quantify a transfer of rotational energy from to central body to a magnetosdisk and compared it to the resulting radiations (here in the radio domain).",

            "abstract": "In winter 2013-2014, the UK experienced exceptional stormy and rainy weather conditions. Concurrently, surface temperatures over large parts of central North America fell to near record minimum values. One potential driver for these cold conditions is discussed to be the increasingly warm surface waters of the tropical west Pacific. It has been suggested these increasing sea surface temperatures could also be the cause for extreme weather over the British Isles.\nTesting this hypothesis, we investigate mechanisms linking the tropical west Pacific and European wind storm activity. We focus on two research questions. Firstly: Was a chain of anomaly patterns with origin in the west Pacific present in the winter 2013-14? And secondly: Can centres of action along such a chain be identified with a strong interannual relationship in the recent past?\nOur results, using primarily ERA-Interim Reanalysis from 1979 to 2014, show an absolute maximum of wind storm frequency over the northeast Atlantic and the British Isles in winter 2013-14. We also find absolute minimum surface temperatures in central North America and increased convective activity over the tropical west Pacific in the same season. The winter 2013-14 was additionally characterized by anomalous warm sea surface temperatures over the subtropical northwest Atlantic.\nAlthough the interannual variability of wind storms in the northeast Atlantic and surface temperatures in North America are significantly anti-correlated, we cannot directly relate wind storm frequency with tropical west Pacific anomalies. We thus conclude that the conditions over the Pacific in winter 2013-14 were favourable but not sufficient to explain the record number of wind storms in this season. Instead, we suggest that warm north Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies in combination with cold surface temperatures over North America played a more important role for generating higher wind storm counts over the northeast Atlantic and the UK.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies documented that the northern part of the Sunda subduction zone ruptured several times in the past 1500 years including one in 1762. To better understand megathrust surface ruptures and the hazards associated to them, we surveyed the SE coast of Bangladesh along the Teknaf peninsula and the Saint Martin anticline by dating coral microatolls of Porites lutea species by the U-Th dating method. Porites luteagrows a few centimeters below the low tide level creating a 5-12 mm thick skeletal band per year, which makes them a good indicator of relative sea level change that might be caused during tectonic submergence and uplift. U-Th ages were obtained from coral slabs and their growth bands interpreted from x-rays. The corals and marine terraces uplift were measured with high precision RTK GPS and modeled with high resolution DEM.\nThe coral microatolls along the St. Martin anticline were dated to be ~ 250, 800 and 1300 years old. Since storm and other climatic phenomenon cannot cause uplift, we interpret that 2.5 m uplift was caused by 1762 earthquake that killed the coral microatolls. The coral slabs show three growth interruptions, where skeletal growth bands continued to grow onlapping the older growth bands. These growth onlaps could be the result of smaller uplift events after 1762 that did not result in coral mortality. The subsidence history extracted from vertical growth of the slabs suggests that the island is submerging at a rate of 11 mm/year. Corals growing 250 m from the dead coral colony post date the 1762 earthquake. Today living Porites lutea can be found 2.5 m below the dead coral heads and 9 cm above the spring low tide.\nThe elevation of marine terraces (T1, T2 and T3) along the Teknaf coast is 2.5 m, 5-7 m and 11-13 m above sea level, respectively. A shell bed on top of T1 was dated at 1763 (dated by C14). This and the other two terraces could have been uplifted during the three earthquakes dated from coral microatolls. Considering the fact that this active subduction zone is converging at a rate of 13 mm/year and it ruptured several times in the recent past, this segment of the Sunda Subduction system could rupture again and cause a of 8.5 Mw earthquake which will be devastating for neighboring countries.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Dawn spacecraft began orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres in April 2015. Framing Camera data from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits include digital terrain models derived from processing stereo images. These models have supported various scientific studies of the surface. The eastern hemisphere of Ceres is topographically higher than the western hemisphere. Some of linear structures on Ceres (which include grooves, pit crater chains, fractures and troughs) appear to be radial to the large basins Urvara and Yalode, and most likely formed due to impact processes. However, set of regional linear structures (RLS) that do not have any obvious relationship to impact craters are found on the eastern hemisphere topographic high region. Many of the longer RLS are comprised of smaller structures that have linked together, suggestive of en echelon fractures. Polygonal craters, theorized to form when pervasive subsurface fracturing affects crater formation [1], are widespread on Ceres [2], and those proximal to the RLS have straight crater rims aligned with the grooves and troughs, suggesting that the RLS are fracture systems. A cross-section of one RLS is displayed in FC images of the Occator crater wall. Comparing these images to the digital terrain models show 1) that the structure dips ~60º and 2) there is downward motion on the hanging wall, implying normal faulting. The digital terrain models also reveal the presence of numerous positive relief features with sub-circular shapes. These dome-like features have been tentatively interpreted as volcanic/magmatic features [3]; other possibilities include salt domes. Analog models of domal uplift in areas of regional extension [4] predict patterns of linear structures similar to those observed in the RLS near Occator. Utilizing topography data provided by the Ceres digital terrain models, we assess the relationship between the RLS and nearby domes and topographic high regions to determine the mechanism by which the RLS may have formed.\n[1] Thomas, P.C. et al.

            "abstract": "During the last decades, Greenland surface melt has shown an increase both in intensity and spatial extent. Part of this water probably reaches the bedrock and enhances the glacier speed, advecting larger volume of ice into the ablation area. In the context of a warming climate, this mechanism will contribute to the future rate of retreat and thinning of the land-terminating glaciers of Greenland. Complex couplings, implying both positive and negative feedbacks, prevail between surface mass balance, ice flow, basal hydrology and the evolution of the glacier geometry. Larger amount of melt water might increase or decrease the mean ice flow of a glacier, depending on the capacity of the basal hydrology network to evacuate this surplus of water, which in turn will influence the surface crevassing and the ability of water to reach the bedrock at higher elevations.\nHere, using a coupled basal hydrology and prognostic ice flow model, the evolution of a Greenland-type glacier subject to an increasing surface melt is studied over few decades. The basal hydrology model, based on the GlaDS model, includes an inefficient cavity-type water sheet and a network of efficient discrete channels. Both systems are connected and evolve in time in response to the water inputs. The prognostic equations for ice flow and the hydrology model are implemented in the open source, finite element, ice sheet / ice flow model Elmer/Ice. Assuming a surface melt increase over the next decades, the evolution of crevassed areas and the ability of water to reach the bedrock is inferred. Our results indicate that the currently observed crevasse distribution is likely to extend upstream, leading to an increase in ice flow which, in turn, accelerates the retreat and thinning of land-terminating glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Fluid injection and its subsequent induced seismicity have significantly increased recently. Injection of fluids due to wastewater disposal, geothermal energy, seasonal natural gas storage and geologic carbon storage causes pressure buildup, which reduces the effective stresses. This reduction brings the stress state closer to failure conditions, which may yield shear slip of pre-existing fractures or faults. Shear slip induces seismic events, which in some cases are felt by the local population. Felt induced seismicity negatively affects public acceptance and may lead to the closure of injection projects. To avoid inducing felt seismic events, a good pressure management is crucial. We propose a methodology to identify and locate undetected low permeability faults using diagnostic plots. This method is useful to assist decision making to adopt the proper mitigation measures to keep overpressure below the maximum sustainable injection pressure when a low permeability fault is causing an additional overpressure within the injection formation. Diagnostic tools allow a rapid identification of the divergence between the pressure measurements and the expected overpressure evolution in a homogeneous aquifer. The divergence time is an indicator of the presence of a low permeability fault and can be used to determine its position. We formulate the problem in its dimensionless form, so it can be generalized to all injection sites. We apply our methodology to water and CO2 injection through a horizontal well in a confined aquifer that has a fault parallel to the well. Nevertheless, the methodology can be extended to other geometrical configurations and geological settings.",

We use these xenolith suites to determine to what extent and by what mechanisms the western North American lithospheric mantle has deformed during Cenozoic tectonic events, including Laramide flat-slab subduction, Basin-and-Range extension, and Quaternary strike-slip faulting associated with the San Andreas Fault System. We find the following. 1) Laramide flat-slab subduction substantially and heterogeneously deformed the North American lithospheric mantle. Despite some serpentinization, deformation along the plate interface was accommodated primarily by olivine dislocation creep, and was cold enough that the mantle lithosphere was strong and could transmit basal shear tractions into the upper plate crust, generating high topography. 2) During B&R extension, the mantle lithosphere was thinned and heated, and Laramide-age shear zone foliations were obliterated by grain growth, even in mixed phase lithologies. Despite annealing, LPO in olivine is preserved in several samples. This fossil LPO may control present-day mantle lid seismic anisotropy in the Basin and Range and may also provide an important source of viscous anisotropy. 3) The mantle lithosphere is actively deforming in localized zones beneath faults of the San Andreas system, but high sub-Moho temperatures render it very weak such that most of the strength of the lithosphere resides in the crust. Because deformation is localized, mantle lid anisotropy in the Mojave region is likely controlled by a fossil LPO, despite present-day deformation in the lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "The Circumpolar Vortex (CPV) in the troposphere is a main feature of weather and climate steering phenomena on both hemispheres. Its extent, position and strength are strongly linked to respective anomalies not only in the mid- to upper-troposphere but also to surface conditions. Thus, the CPV has fundamental importance for the positioning of e.g., the polar frontal structure, the inherent temperature gradients, the baroclinic jet and related baroclinic wave disturbances. For example, in winter 2013/14 an extended southward extension combined with a deep geopotential trough over North America led to extreme cold conditions and upstream surface high pressure anomalies were responsible for a significant reduction of cyclones over the North Pacific.\nThis study aims at the anthropogenic impact on the structure of the winter CPV on the northern hemisphere (NH, DJF) as a main driver of subsequent changes also for extreme event occurrence. We analyse the transient change up to 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario using 8 state-of-the-art CMIP5 AOGCMs with in total 62 individual simulations for the 20C- and 32 members for the RCP8.5-period. Our results show a good validation of the models’ performance (ensemble mean) against ERA-Interim reanalyses for circularity, a slightly slower velocity, but an underestimation for the extent of the CPV, accompanied by a high model-to-model variability.\nThe climate change signal is characterized by a reduction of the extent of the CPV from 33% to 26% of the NH area (a relative change of about 20%), a reduction from 32 m/s to 28m/s (a relative change of about 13%), and a moderate decrease in circularity. Impacts on specific regions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The past and future of cities are inextricably linked, a linkage that can be seen clearly in the long-term impacts of urban geochemical legacies. As loci of population as well as the means of employment and industry to support these populations, cities have a long history of co-locating contaminating practices and people, sometimes with negative implications for human health. Working at the intersection between geochemical processes, communities, and human health is critical to grapple with environmental legacies and to support healthy, sustainable, and growing urban populations. An emerging area of environmental health research is to understand the impacts of chronic exposures and exposure mixtures—these impacts are very poorly studied, yet have materialized as perhaps the greatest threat to large-scale population health.\nAcute exposure to lead (Pb), a powerful neurotoxin to which children are particularly susceptible, has largely been eliminated in the U.S. and other countries through policy-based restrictions on leaded gasoline and lead-based paints. But these legacy Pb sources are still around in the form of surface soil Pb contamination, a common problem in cities and one that has only recently emerged as a pernicious and widespread chronic exposure mechanism in cities. Some urban soils are also contaminated with another neurotoxin, mercury (Hg), although very little work has been done to understand human exposures to low levels of this element in soils. The most documented human exposure to Hg is through fish consumption, so eating fish caught in urban areas presents risks for above average dietary Hg exposure. The potential double impact of chronic exposure to these two neurotoxins is pronounced in cities.  Many aspects of the dose-response curves for individual elements and mixtures are poorly understood, especially at lower levels, leaving unanswered several interesting and provocative questions about environmental impacts on neurological and developmental disorders.",

The plane of the simulation includes variation in the L shell direction and along magnetic field lines. Relativistic test particle electrons are inserted into the simulation when the wave fields are near their maximum amplitude. These electrons can be scattered into the loss cone so that they precipitate into the ionosphere. We find the effective pitch angle diffusion coefficient and probability of precipitation using these test particles. The pitch angle diffusion coefficients are largest for relativistic energies greater than 2 MeV, though they may be substantial for lower energies. The probability of precipitation is highest for low energy particles at small initial equatorial pitch angle. For high initial equatorial pitch angles, the probability of precipitation increases greatly with respect to particle energy. Starting from an isotropic pitch angle distribution of relativistic electrons with a Gaussian spread in the relativistic momentum, we find only a small drop in the probability of precipitation during 13 s time as the particle energy decreases. But that result depends on the initial pitch angle distribution. Starting with a distribution of particles steeply peaked at 90° initial equatorial pitch angle, the probability of precipitation would be greater for high-energy particles. We will discuss the mechanism of pitch angle scattering.",

            "abstract": "In April 2007, an eruption with an exceptional intensity occured 7 km southeast of the central cone of the Piton de la Fournaise (Réunion Island). ALOS and ENVISAT satellites recorded up to 1.4 meter of displacement towards the east, and a general subsidence up to 45 cm of the Eastern Flank of the volcano. This movement continued for more than one year after the end of the eruption. In this work, we address the Eastern Flank displacement during and after the April 2007 eruption by inverting post-eruptive InSAR data. Our purpose is twofold: assess the hazard associated to flank displacement and understand the origin of the distal location of the eruption. C-band ENVISAT interferograms from six different lines of sight were interpolated to cover a common period from May 2007 to July 2008. We combine a Mixed Boundary Element Method (MBEM) assuming linear elasticity of the edifice and a Neighborhood Algorithm to invert the surface displacement. The real topography is taken into account using a Digital Elevation Model. The fracture geometry is supposed to be a curved quadrangle. Linear parameters such as pressure and shear stress are also inverted. Inversion results show that a 5 by 8 km trapezoïdal fracture reproduces well the first order displacement of the Eastern Flank. The fracture is 500 to 1000 m deep with a low dip angle to the East. It links the summit cone to the eruptive fissure of April 2007 which corresponds to the expected magma path. The fracture is submitted to an eastward slip up to around 25 cm, and a closure up to 20 cm. To confirm the surprising result of a closure, we made an inversion with a version of MBEM where closure is forbidden and we tested a linear inversion of slip distribution on a fracture of the same geometry assuming an elastic half space. These inversions confirmed the closure and lead us to propose that the source of the April 2007 eruption is a sheared sill, which underwent closure in the post-eruptive period.",

            "abstract": "Microgravity studies represent a relatively underutilized technique to investigate active volcanoes compared to some of the more established methods (e.g. seismic and ground deformation). Temporal changes of the gravity field in volcanic zones are related to sub-surface mass redistributions in response to magmatic processes and are variable in space (wavelengths between hundreds of meters and tens of kilometers) and time (periods between seconds and years), according to the size, depth and rate of evolution of the source processes. As a result, both campaign and continuous gravity observations can make valuable contributes to better understanding how volcanoes work.\nGravity measurements offer insights into volcanic activity that cannot be inferred from other data sets. By supplying information on the subsurface mass distribution, gravity studies alleviate ambiguity on the nature of magmatic sources, which may affect the interpretation of ground deformation and other measurements. Gravity studies can detect magma accumulation in pre-existing void space, which does not produce any other measurable effect at the surface. Gravity surveys can also identify zones of increased microfracturing rate within a volcanic edifice, which may be able to channel magma from a deep storage area to the surface. Continuous measurements of the gravity field can recognize rapid changes in the magma/gas ratio within the upper plumbing system of a volcano and can thus be used to discover otherwise “hidden” states of unrest at active volcanoes. Continuous gravimetry can also track convective overturns in a shallow reservoir over short time scales.\nDespite the obvious potential of gravity monitoring, gravity measurements at active volcanoes are still relatively rare, mainly due to instrument cost and data interpretation issues. Here, the potential of gravity studies to provide insight into the processes that drive volcanic activity will be shown through case studies from different volcanoes.",

An exception\nis the inner magnetosphere where energy dependent particle drifts are\nessential in the dynamics and evolution of the ring current. Even in\nthe tail particle drifts are a significant perturbation on the MHD\nbehavior of the plasma. The most common drift addition to MHD has been\ninclusion of the Hall term in Faraday's Law. There have been attempts\nin the space physics context to include gradient and curvature drifts\nwithin a single fluid MHD picture. These have not been terribly\nsuccessful because the use of a single, Maxwellian distribution does\nnot capture the energy dependent nature of the drifts. The advent of\nmulti-fluid MHD codes leads to a reconsideration of this problem. The\nVlasov equation can be used to define individual ``species'' which\ncover a specific energy range. Each fluid can then be treated as\nhaving a separate evolution. We take the approach of the Rice\nConvection Model (RCM) that each energy channel can be described by a\ndistribution that is essentially isotropic in the guiding center\npicture. In the local picture, this gives rise to drifts that can be\ndescribed in terms of the energy dependent inertial and diamagnetic\ndrifts. By extending the MHD equations with these drifts we can get a\nsystem which reduces to the RCM approach in the slow-flow inner\nmagnetosphere but is not restricted to cases where the flow speed is\nsmall. The restriction is that the equations can be expanded in the\nratio of the Larmor radius to the gradient scale lengths. At scales\napproaching di, the assumption of gyrotropic (or isotropic)\ndistributions break down. In addition to the drifts, the formalism can\nalso be used to include finite Larmor radius effects on the pressure\ntensor (gyro-viscosity). We present some initial calculations with this method.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge on the melting behavior in the deep mantle remains based on a limited number of experimental and theoretical works. Today, thanks to (i) availability of very brilliant X-ray synchrotron sources and (ii) improved control of the P-T conditions in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC), the experimental results should reach some agreement about the melting diagrams. However, it is not the case and major controversies remain. For example, liquidi of peridotitic (1) and chondritic-type (2) mantles are reported with a temperature difference of ~1000 K at a pressure of ~90 GPa (corresponding to ~2000 km depth), which cannot be explained by the relatively small compositional difference between these two materials.\nTo bring new insights about the melting properties of the deep mantle, our strategy has been to study the melting curve of the end-member liquidus phase, the (Mg,Fe)(Al,Si)O3 bridgmanite (Bg), before applying a basic thermodynamical approach to the mineralogical system made of Bg, CaSiO3-perovskite and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase. Our approach cannot be as formal as currently done for melting in the shallow mantle, due to lack of major thermodynamical parameters. Still, our analysis yields original information, such as the degree of partial melting as a function of P, T and fraction of Bg in the geological material. The Mg/Si ratio in melts can also be addressed.\nConcerning the controversy between LH-DAC experiments, it can be solved taking into account migration in the temperature gradient of the pseudo-eutectic melt, when the sample starts to melt. This effect is expected to occur more extensively in absence of an insulating material between the sample and the diamond anvils. It yields an overestimation of the liquidus temperature for a given chemical composition, due to loss of the most fusing elements.\n",

In such a simple two-layer system, equation f = n Vs/4H (1) links the resonance frequency \"f\" to the thickness “H” and shear waves velocity “Vs “of the resonating layer.\nIn recent years, this methodology has been applied generally to obtain information on the seismostratigraphy of an investigated site in different environmental context. In this work, its potential application in the characterization of archaeological features hosted in shallow geological levels is discussed.\nField cases are identified in the Appia Antica archaeological site which is placed in central Italy. Here, acknowledged targets correspond to: i) empty tanks carved by the Romans into Cretaceous limestone in the IV-III cen. BC and ii): the basaltic stone paving of the ancient road track which is locally buried beneath colluvial deposits. Narrowly-spaced recordings of environmental noise were carried using a portable digital seismograph equipped with three electrodynamic orthogonal sensors (velocimeters) responding in the band 0.1 ÷1024 Hz and adopting a sampling frequency of 256 Hz..\nResults are discussed in terms of absolute H/V values and related distribution maps in the very high-frequency interval of 10-40Hz. In the tanks hosting area, interpolation of H/V maximum values around 13Hz matches caves location and alignment, which is also evidenced by clear inversions (H/V<1) at lower frequencies (10-1Hz). Correlation between H/V peaks and the top surface of the buried stone paving along the prosecution of the road track is even more straightforward. Finally, the depth variations of the tank roofs and the basaltic paving were reconstructed combining in equation (1) results of noise recordings with borehole data and geophysical surveys (SASW analysis).",

These data sets almost always reside at a separate data center - the journal and the center maintain explicit identifier linkages. Data journals add quality to the feature of availability.

When the solar wind\nturns strongly southward this plasma is convected toward the dayside\nmagnetopause and affects the interaction of the solar wind with the\nmagnetosphere. We have used multi-fluid simulations using the LFM\nglobal MHD code to model this interaction. The plasmasphere is\ninitialized as a cold (~1eV) hydrogen plasma in a quiet northward IMF\nstate with a density distribution appropriate for K_p = 1. The\ncorotation potential from the ionosphere spins up the plasmasphere\ninto rough corotation. After a initialization period of hours, a\nsouthward IMF is introduced and the enhanced convection initiates a\nsurge of plasmaspheric density to the dayside. We discuss two aspects\nof this interaction, the effects on dayside reconnection and on the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). We find that the mass loading of\nmagnetospheric flux tubes slows local reconnection rates, though not\nas much as predicted by Borovsky et al. [2013]. We find\nthat the total reconnection rate is reduced, although not as much as\nwould be predicted by just the sub-solar reconnection rate. The KHI\nis somewhat reduced by the plasmaspheric loading of density in the low\nlatitude boundary layer. It has been suggested that the presence of\nthe plasmasphere may lead to enhanced ULF wave power in the interior\nof the magnetosphere from the KHI waves. We find only a minimal effect during northward IMF. For southward IMF, the situation is complicated by the interaction of KHI with non-steady reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Concurrent changes in climate, land cover, and population are pushing coupled human and natural systems outside of the historical range of natural variability, presenting major challenges to the management of natural and built environments worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of how precipitation is partitioned to ecosystem and societal water resources is central to many of these challenges. Although considerable progress has been made advancing process understanding and developing ecohydrological models, a key challenge remains applying this knowledge to landscape and regional scales of resource management. Approaches to address this challenge, ranging from deterministic to probabilistic models, all face the challenge of identifying scale breaks in the coupling between biotic and abiotic processes.\nWe employ an alternative, complementary approach, combining newer observations (e.g. high resolution aerial LiDAR; isotopes) and established techniques to identify scale breaks and transitions in how ecological processes, occurring on relatively short timescales, are coupled to longer-term development of critical zone, that typically develops over longer time scales. At stand scales, vegetation structure strongly controls the fraction of precipitation partitioned to evaporation by influencing both solar radiation and turbulence with a net change in effective precipitation (water available for transpiration, recharge, or streamflow) of as much as 25%. At hillslope scales, topographic shading or exposure has similar magnitude effects on total evapotranspiration, while topographically driven water subsidy can double carbon storage through increases in both tree size and number. At catchment-scales, the coupling between vegetation, climate, and the physical landscape results in a predictable signature in hydrologic partitioning that reflects regional susceptibility to drought. Importantly, these transitions in biophysical interactions, occurring at scales from 0.01 to 106 ha, can be used both to constrain predictive models while directly informing management decisions by identifying areas where vegetation or streamflow is more or less at risk to climate change.",

            "abstract": "­The Indo-Pacific region plays an integral role in the Earth’s climate system. Changes in local insolation, greenhouse gas concentrations, ice volume, and local sea level are each hypothesized to exert a dominant control on Indo-Pacific hydroclimate variations through the Pleistocene, yet existing records from the region are generally short and exhibit fundamental differences in orbital-scale patterns that limit our understanding of the regional climate responses to these global forcings. New paleoclimate records spanning multiple glacial-interglacial cycles are therefore required to document the region’s hydroclimatic response to the full range of global climate boundary conditions observed during the late Quaternary.\nLake Towuti is located in central Indonesia and is the only known terrestrial sedimentary archive in the region that spans multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. From May – July, 2015, the Towuti Drilling Project, consisting of nearly 40 scientists from eight countries, recovered over 1,000 meters of new sediment core from Lake Towuti. This includes cores though the entire sediment column to bedrock, which likely provide a >1-million-year records of regional hydroclimate. On-site borehole and sediment core logging data document major shifts in sediment composition, including transitions from lake clays to peats, calcareous sediments, and gravels. These data show excellent agreement with major lithological transitions recorded in seismic reflection data, and indicate large changes in lake levels and hydroclimate through the late Quaternary. Prior work on Lake Towuti indicated a dominant control by global ice volume on regional hydroclimate, a hypothesis we aim to test through the analysis of these new cores. This presentation will review existing records from the region and show the first long geochemical and sedimentological records from Lake Towuti to understand orbital-scale hydrologic change during the last ~1 million years.",

            "abstract": "Because of the transient and widespread nature of wildfires and other types of open biomass burning, satellite remote sensing has become an indispensable technique for characterizing their smoke emissions for modeling applications, especially at regional to global scales. Fire radiative energy (FRE), whose instantaneous rate of release or fire radiative power (FRP) is measurable from space, has been found to be proportional to both the biomass consumption and emission of aerosol particulate matter. We have leveraged this relationship to generate a global, gridded smoke-aerosol emission coefficients (Ce) dataset based on FRP and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Ce is a simple coefficient to convert FRE to smoke aerosol emissions, in the same manner as traditional emission factors are used to convert burned biomass to emissions. The first version of this Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEER.v1) global gridded Ce product at 1°x1° resolution is available at\nhttp://feer.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n. Based on published emission ratios, the FEER.v1 Ce product for total smoke aerosol has also been used to generate similar products for specific fire-emitted aerosols and gases, including those that are regulated as ‘criteria pollutants’ under the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), such as particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO). These gridded Ce products were used in conjunction with satellite measurements of FRP to derive emissions of several smoke constituents, which were applied to WRF-Chem fully coupled meteorology-chemistry-aerosol model simulations, with promising results. In this presentation, we analyze WRF-Chem simulations of surface-level concentrations of various pollutants based on FEER.v1 emission products to illustrate their value for air-quality modeling, particularly in parts of Africa and southeast Asia where ground-based air-quality monitoring is limited or absent.",

            "abstract": "Leaching of sediments from the Eastern flank of the Chagos-Laccadive ridge, the 90°E ridge and the distal part of the Bengal Fan have extracted authigenic lead (Pb). This allowed the reconstruction of the Pb isotope evolution of the deep central Indian Ocean over the past 250 thousand years at ∼3 kyr resolution and over the past 20 Ma at 2-3Myr resolution. High frequency temporal variations recorded close to the ridges define a binary mixing line that records the variable admixture of radiogenic Pb with a signature characteristic of the composition of Ganges–Brahmaputra river sediments to the stable unradiogenic widely-distributed Pb source, from mid-ocean ridges or possibly volcanic aerosols. The temporal variations suggest an enhancement of Himalayan contributions by two to three times during interglacial periods, indicating that climate modulates the supply of dissolved elements to the ocean. While these changes could accurately record variations in the continental chemical weathering flux in response to warmer and wetter conditions during interglacials, the relative proportions of Pb derived from the Ganges and Brahmaputra appear to have been constant through time. This observation may point towards particulate-dissolved interactions in the estuary or pro-delta as a buffer of short timescale variability of the fluvial inputs. The changes recorded directly in the turbiditic fan during the Neogene are more difficult to interpret and will be discussed in lengh. If the last Ma data points are consistent with the 2 records from either side of the sedimentary basin, the input from the weathering of the Himalaya could have been impacted by 1) the uplift of more radiogenic terrane consistent with the onset of the Main Boundary Thrust around 10 Ma, and 2) changes in the weathering style pointing toward a more uncongruent weathering between 7 and 1 Ma.",

            "abstract": "In northern regions the dominant phase of precipitation is snow, this precipitation persists and accumulates throughout the winter season until freshet. Quantitative information on snow, such as snow water equivalent and snow cover extent, is essential for water resources management in northern regions. Due to the inaccessibility and remoteness of snow course locations, snow surveys are usually expensive. Therefore an efficient network design strategy is required to provide a maximum amount of information while also minimizing the network cost. In this study, an entropy-based multiobjective optimization method is applied to design a snow network by adding new stations to the existing network in the La Grande River Basin of Quebec, Canada. Three hydrologic models, Sacramento, HBV, and HSAMI, are calibrated to 12 subwatersheds in the La Grande River Basin. Pareto optimal networks are given by the multiobjective optimization by maximizing joint entropy and minimizing total correlation. Each of the potential optimal networks is then evaluated using the calibrated hydrologic models to determine the most appropriate network for spring peak flow forecasting. The proposed methodology provides useful information for designing snow network appropriate for spring peak flow forecasting, which is essential for reservoir operation.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological cycles have strong temporal variations. Analysis of the long-term observations can help detect trends that may be consistent with theses projected in the context of climate change and thus help awareness of stakeholders. However, one must remain cautious on the analysis of these trends when they are estimated on the basis of a few decades, because the water cycle can have strong multi-decadal variations.\nIndeed, in France, long observed series shown that river flows generally exhibit large multidecadal variation since the late 19th century to the present, especially in spring. Differences of means between 21 yr periods of the 20th century as large as 40% are indeed found for many gauging stations.\nSuch multi decadal variations were also found on glaciers, but are difficult to detect on the groundwater resource, which might be linked to the recharge processes.\nMulti-decadal spring river flow variations are associated with variations in spring precipitation and temperature. These multi-decadal variations in precipitation are themselves found to be driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation, more precisely by a multi-decadal oscillation in a sea level pressure dipole between western Europe and the eastern Atlantic. It is suggested that the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), the main mode of multi-decadal variability in the North Atlantic–Europe sector, controls those variations in large-scale circulation and is therefore the main ultimate driver of multi-decadal variations in spring river flows.\nImpact of such teleconnection for the management of the water resource is important, since the threshold alert used by stakeholder vary also at multi decadal scale.\nMoreover, such natural variabilities are not well reproduced by climate model, especially because of weak teleconnection between the simulated AMV and the simulated precipitation over France. Statistical methods could help correct such bias, and are currently assessed on the 20th century.",

SCDR collects more than 200 data products, which are commonly used by multiple groups in STAR, from NOAA, GOES, Metop, Suomi NPP, Sentinel, Himawari, and other satellites. The processes of acquisition, recording, retrieval, organization, and dissemination are performed in parallel. Multiple data access interfaces, like FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, and RESTful, are supported in the SCDR to obtain satellite data from their providers through high speed internet. The original satellite data in various raster formats can be parsed in the respective adapter to retrieve data information. The data information is ingested to the corresponding partitioned tables in the central database. All files are distributed equally on the Network File System (NFS) disks to balance the disk load. SCDR provides consistent interfaces (including Perl utility, portal, and RESTful Web service) to locate files of interest easily and quickly and access them directly by over 200 compute servers via NFS.\nSCDR greatly improves collection and integration of near real-time satellite data, addresses satellite data requirements of scientists and researchers, and facilitates their primary research and development activities.",

This glacier-free island contains the southernmost exposures of the K/Pg boundary and it has the most complete record of the Paleogene in Antarctica. The base of the Paleogene is represented by the Early Paleocene shallow marine shelf deposits of the Marambio Group; which are unconformably overlain by the Late Paleocene to Late Eocene Seymour Island Group. The Marambio Group is divided into the quartz-rich silty sandstones and mudstones of the López de Bertodano Fm and the mudstones to quartz-rich sandstones of the Sobral Fm. The overlaying Seymour Island Group records the erosion and filling of incised valleys. This group is made up by the Cross Valley-Wiman, La Meseta and the uppermost new Submeseta Formations. Main regressive periods are evidenced by the erosional unconformities and their related time gaps at the base of these three Formations. The La Meseta and Submeseta Formations are composed by poorly consolidated marine sandstones and siltstones deposited in a shallow coastal (possibly estuarine) environment. Several biostratigraphic and isotopic studies have been conducted in the Seymour Island due to its extremely rich fossil record, and the age of the López de Bertodano Fm has been recently refined by magnetostratigraphy. However, the overlying Paleogene formations lack a reliable absolute continuous dating. To solve this problem, a composite magnetostratigraphic section spanning more than 1300 m from the K/Pg boundary up to the top of the Submeseta Fm was conducted, with an average sampling resolution of 3 m per site. Although many samples yielded weak results, a local magnetostratigraphy was obtained which has been correlated to the GPTS. The new derived ages range from Danian (~ 66 Ma) up to Priabonian (~ 34 Ma). These results have been integrated with previous litho-, bio- and isotopic data to build a new Paleogene chronostratigraphy for the Seymour Island.",

Precipitation extremes vary in magnitude and duration both spatially and temporally, making it one of the most challenging climate variables to comprehend and predict. Using information theory, we provide an attempt to improve understanding of the predictability of extreme precipitation in the conterminous U.S. over the period of 1949-2010. We define predictability as the recurrent likelihood of patterns described by the measures of constancy and contingency, with the former describing the inter-annual variability and the latter describing the seasonality. This study shows that there are clear west-east contrasts of predictability over the U.S. landscape, with a generally decreasing gradient from the Northeast to the Southwest for intensity-based extremes and a generally increasing gradient from the West to the East for duration-based extremes. We further identify spatially heterogeneous patterns of temporal changes in predictability over the investigated timeframe. Finally, it is evident that constancy plays a heavier role in regulating predictability increases for both intensity and duration-based extremes and for predictability decreases for duration-based extremes, while contingency contributes equally with constancy to determining the decreases in predictability for intensity-based extremes.",

            "abstract": "World’s growing demand for food is driven by population and income growth, dietary changes, and the ever-increasing competition between food, feed and bioenergy challenges food security; meanwhile agricultural expansion and intensification threats the environment by the various detrimental impacts. Researchers have attempted to explore strategies to overcome this grand challenge. One of the promising solutions that have attracted considerable attention recently is to increase the efficiency of food supply chain by reducing food loss and waste (FLW). According to recent studies conducted by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nation, almost one third of the food produced for human consumption globally is lost or wasted along the food supply chain. This amount of food discarded manifests a missing, yet potential, opportunity to sustainably enhance both food security and environmental sustainability. However, implementing the strategies and technologies for tackling FLW does not come up as an easy solution since it requires economic incentives, benefit and cost analysis, infrastructure development, and appropriate market mechanism. In this presentation I will provide a synthesis of knowledge on the implications of postharvest food loss/waste prevention to energy and resource conservation, environmental protection, as well as food security. I will also discuss how traditional civil and environmental engineering can contribute to the reduction of postharvest food loss, an important issue of sustainable agriculture.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) couples the water cycle and energy budget of hydrological processes. Understanding the components of ET variability and their spatial distribution is essential for improving hydrological simulations, quantifying ET observation uncertainties and supporting water resources management under climate change. Although advances in monitoring hydrological components have been made, how to use various existing observations to obtain a better knowledge about ET variability remains a challenging task. This study adopts a system approach to analyze ET variability in contiguous United States, considering the factors of climatic forcing fluctuations and catchment storage dynamics. We apply an ET variance decomposition framework (Zeng and Cai, 2015) to calculate monthly ET variance based on climatic forcing (i.e., precipitation and potential ET) and GRACE terrestrial storage change data. We quantify the various sources of ET variance, in terms of variances of precipitation, potential ET and terrestrial storage and their covariances, and obtain a spatial map of its primary and secondary controlling factors in the in contiguous United States. Furthermore, the estimated ET variance is compared to two existing ET products (e.g., MODIS-based remote sensing and FLUEXNET-based interpolation). It is found that FLUXNET-based interpolation is systematically smaller than the estimated ET variance with less deviation; while the MODIS-based ET agrees with estimated ET variance with larger uncertainty. The decomposition framework provides not only an independent estimation of ET variance but also a method to assess the uncertainty of existing ET products.",

            "abstract": "Adopted at the U.N. Conference on March 18, 2015 in Sendai Japan, the international framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) will guide how nations across the world address disasters and hazards for the next fifteen years. The agreement, reached after several years of negotiation, marks a shift in thinking and approach to DRR. Traditionally DRR has been the domain of humanitarian responses and methods have been well honed over the decades. However, a defining element of this agreement is the stronger recognition of the role that science can play in preparing for, managing, and mitigating disasters. The framework identifies four priority areas: understanding disaster risk; strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to “build back better” in recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction. Science can underpin each one. For example, the first priority to better understand risks will require scientific and technological input. In addition embedded throughout the Framework are calls for several other specific actions including, dedicated scientific and technical work on disaster risk reduction; mobilization. The challenge moving forward will be to move from rhetoric to action. Are governments ready to embrace the scientific community’s input or are many still resistant? What, if any, structures are in place to ensure that the necessary science is carried out and then heard by those who can use it? What steps can scientists and scientific organizations take to ensure the role of science and make their efforts are effective? How science can respond to the opportunities and challenges in a Post-Sendai world will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric vortex at the southern pole of Venus is a complex structure well observed over the Venus Express mission. The vortex is highly variable in morphology exhibiting large-scale transitions with time scales of a few days. In order to better understand the relation between the vortex’s morphology and its dynamics, we measure the wind field at the lower and upper clouds levels (at ~43 km and ~59 km, respectively) and retrieve the three-dimensional thermal structure of the polar atmosphere using data from the infrared channel of the instrument VIRTIS on board Venus Express.\nCombining wind and temperature fields we calculate the horizontal spatial structure of Ertel’s potential vorticity (EPV) at both clouds levels. Our analysis shows that the South Polar Vortex of Venus is a vertically depressed structure when observed in isentropic surfaces between 55 and 85 km altitude, and that the horizontal distribution of EPV does not retain the structure seen in radiance or temperature maps, but resembles the distribution of the relative vorticity (determined purely from tracked motions).\nWith the temperature profiles at hand, we calculate the thermal winds over the south polar atmosphere of Venus by means of the cyclostrophic approximation. We improve the method to retrieve the thermal winds at high latitudes (so far inconsistent with cloud tracking measurements [1, 2]) by taking into account the meridional component of the wind to fully explore the three-dimensional structure of the vortex in the upper troposphere.\n[1] Mendonça, J.

            "abstract": "Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful tool for quantitative estimation of high-resolution high-fidelity models of subsurface seismic parameters, typically P-wave velocity. The solution to FWI’s posed nonlinear inverse problem is obtained via an iterative series of linearized local updates to a start model, assuming this model lies within the basin of attraction to the global minimum. Thanks to many successful published applications to three-dimensional (3D) field datasets, its advance has been rapid and driven in large-part by the oil and gas industry. The consideration of seismic anisotropy during FWI is of vital importance, as it holds influence over both the kinematics and dynamics of seismic waveforms. If not appropriately taken into account then inadequacies in the anisotropy model are likely to manifest as significant error in the recovered velocity model. Conventionally, anisotropic FWI employs either an a priori anisotropy model, held fixed during FWI, or it uses a multi-parameter local inversion scheme to recover the anisotropy as part of the FWI; both of these methods can be problematic. Constructing an anisotropy model prior to FWI often involves intensive (and hence expensive) iterative procedures, such as travel-time tomography or moveout velocity analysis. On the other hand, introducing multiple parameters to FWI itself increases the complexity of what is already an underdetermined inverse problem. We propose that global rather than local FWI can be used to recover the long-wavelength acoustic anisotropy model, and that this can then be followed by more-conventional local FWI to recover the detailed model. We validate this approach using a full 3D field dataset, demonstrating that it avoids problems associated to crosstalk that can bedevil local inversion schemes, and reconciles well with in situ borehole measurements. Although our approach includes a global inversion for anisotropy, it is nonetheless affordable and practical for 3D field data.",

            "abstract": "Addressing the great challenges facing society requires industry, government, and academia to work together. I call this overlap space, where compromises are made and real solutions determined, the Radical Middle. Radical because it can appear at times as if the loudest and most publicly influential voices lie outside of the actual solution space, content to provoke but not problem-solve.\nOne key area where geoscientists can play a lead role in the Radical Middle is in the overlap between energy, the environment, and the economy. Globally, fossil fuels still represent 85% of the aggregate energy mix. As existing conventional oil and natural-gas reservoir production continues to slowly decline, unconventional reservoirs, led today by shale and other more expensive resources, will represent a growing part of the oil and gas production mix. Many of these unconventional reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing. The positive economic impact of hydraulic fracturing and associated natural gas and oil production on the United States economy is well documented and undeniable. Yet there are environmental concerns about fracking, and some states and nations have imposed moratoria. This energy-environment-economy space is ideal for leadership from the geosciences.\nAnother such overlap space is the potential for geoscience leadership in relations with China, whose economy and global presence continue to expand. Although China is building major hydropower and natural-gas power plants, as well as nuclear reactors, coal is still king—with the associated environmental impacts. Carbon sequestration—onshore in brine and to enhance oil recovery, as well as offshore—could prove viable.\nIt is vital that educated and objective geoscientists from industry, government, and academia leave their corners and work together in the Radical Middle to educate the public and develop and deliver balanced, economically sensible energy and environmental strategies.",

            "abstract": "Much of the debate surrounding Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) concerns the regional versus global aspects of biogeochemical and environmental changes associated with it. Untangling local versus global aspects of OAEs remains a major challenge. This is particularly true for the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event or T-OAE of the Early Jurassic (~182 million years ago) since few open ocean, deep-sea sedimentary records remain for this time interval. Much of the uncertainly surrounding the geochemical record of this event derives from the fact that the majority of the studied stratigraphic successions occur in Western Europe. These localities record the paleoceanographic conditions within the western Tethys Ocean and adjacent epeiric seas. To develop a greater understanding of the T-OAE we will present geochemical and biostratigraphic data from western North America (Alberta) that will enable us to access paleoceanographic changes associated with the T-OAE in the eastern Panthalassic Ocean.\nThe Early Jurassic stratigraphic succession in Alberta consist of carbonate ramp facies that transition into basinal fine-grained siliciclastic facies. Ammonite biostratigraphy from this succession identifies the time interval spanning the Pliensbachian and Toarcian Stages (Carlottense, Kanense and Planulata zones of western North America). Organic carbon isotope data from the studied sections show the negative excursion that is now recognized globally to occur during the T-OAE. Locally, geochemical data indicate that the distal portions of a carbonate ramp and basinal facies were anoxic during the T-OAE and the carbonate factory appears to have been drowned at the onset of the T-OAE. In addition, sulfur isotope and iron speciation data will be presented from these successions to examine further the paleoceanographic changes of the Panthalassic Ocean in response to the T-OAE. Importantly, this Panthalassic succession provides an additional perspective for understanding global biogeochemical cycles during the Early Jurassic.",

Despite this, there is still limited understanding of the spatial variability in both the formation of, and eventual burial of, surface hoar at spatial scales which are of critical importance to avalanche forecasters. While it is relatively well understood that aspect plays an important role in the spatial location of the formation, and burial of these grain forms, due to the unequal distribution of incoming radiation, this factor alone does not explain the complex and often confusing spatial pattern of these grains forms throughout the landscape at different spatial scales.\nIn this paper we present additional data from a unique data set including over two hundred days of manual observations of surface hoar at sixteen locations on Pioneer Mountain at the Yellowstone Club in southwestern Montana. Using this wealth of observational data located on different aspects, elevations and exposures, coupled with detailed meteorological observations, and detailed slope scale observation, we examine the spatial variability of surface hoar at this scale, and examine the factors that control its spatial distribution.\nOur results further supports our preliminary work, which shows that small-scale slope conditions, meteorological differences, and local scale lapse rates, can greatly influence the spatial variability of surface hoar, over and above that which aspect alone can explain. These results highlight our incomplete understanding of the processes at both the slope and range scale, and are likely to have implications for both regional and local scale avalanche forecasting in environments where surface hoar cause ongoing instabilities.",

            "abstract": "Spin transition of iron in ferropericlase (Fp) causes a significant softening in bulk modulus [e.g.,1,2], which leads to unusual dVP/dT>0. Because dVP/dT>0 in Fp cancels out with dVP/dT<0 in silica perovskite, VP of the lower mantle becomes insensitive to the temperature variation at the depth of ~1730 km [3], which is in consistence with some seismic tomography results[4,5]. Spin transition of iron in Fp also plays a crtical role to the structure and stability of LLSVPs in the lower mantle[6]. Obviously, the insensitivity of VPto temperature at mid lower mantle dramatically depends on the content of Fp and iron content in Fp.\nThe composition of the lower mantle is critical for us to understand the Earth’s interior and the mantle convection. Previous reports on the composition of the lower mantle are controversial. Using the high -temperature and -pressure velocities and density data of minerals obtained from first-principles calculations, we found that the aggregate constrained well by seismic model can vary from pyrolitic composition with ~ 15 wt% ferropericlase (Fp) to perovskitic-rich composition. Any composition well constrained by seismic model, however, has enough amount of Fp to exhibit positive temperature dependence of the bulk sound velocity, which results in negative correlation between bulk sound and shear velocities at mid lower mantle without involving any composition variation. Spin crossover of iron in Fp significantly reduces the temperature sensitivity of P wave velocity of the aggregate at the depth of ~1730 km along the adiabatic geotherm.\n[1] Wu, Z.Q., Justo, J.F., Wentzcovitch, R.M., 2013.

Change in vegetation water use will feedback to atmospheric and hydrological cycles. Here, we report results from the PLATO “Plant-water interlinkages in northern uplands – mediation of climate change?” project where we investigate water uptake by plants and consequent water availability in northern regions along a cross-regional climate gradient to understand future responses to change in high-latitude uplands. Six sites in Sweden (Krycklan), Canada (Wolf Creek; Baker Creek; Dorset), Scotland (Girnock) and the USA (Dry Creek) span moisture and energy gradients found at high-latitudes. We are presenting preliminary results of vegetation phenology changes from 2000 to 2014 by analysing remote sensing vegetation indices.

For that, a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) using simplified atmospheric conditions has been performed with the Meso-NH model to serve as a reference simulation of deep convection. This LES with a 50-m grid spacing is used to compute the turbulent fluxes at different coarser horizontal resolutions (500 m, 1 km, and 2 km). Vertical turbulent fluxes of liquid water potential temperature and non-precipitating total water mixing ratio have counter-gradient structures, indicative of nonlocal turbulence.\nSecond, a diagnostic assessment, from the reference fields, of the current turbulence parameterization of the Meso-NH model (subgrid scheme with a 1.5-order closure and diagnostic equations for the fluxes) at these coarser resolutions shows that turbulent kinetic energy is largely underestimated in the clouds, related to an underestimation of thermal production. The counter-gradient structures of vertical turbulent fluxes are not reproduced, indeed, the local K-gradient formulation is not suitable. Alternative parameterizations of some turbulent fluxes, proposed in the literature, are then tested. In particular, a parameterization based on horizontal gradients, gives a better representation of the thermal production of turbulence in the clouds, with a good representation of counter-gradient areas.\nThird, the on-line evaluation from model runs with 2-km, 1-km, and 500-m horizontal grid spacing confirms the improvement when using the modified scheme, with an increase of subgrid turbulence and a significant decrease of vertical velocities in convective clouds.\nIn the next future, we plan to evaluate and to improve this new parameterization on real cases of deep convection from the two-month HyMeX field campaign.",

            "abstract": "To date, most studies of the human dimensions of decision making in avalanche terrain has focused on two areas - post-accident analysis using accident reports/interviews and, the development of tools as decision forcing aids. We present an alternate method using crowd-sourced citizen science, for understanding decision-making in avalanche terrain. Our project combines real-time GPS tracking via a smartphone application, with internet based surveys of winter backcountry users as a method to describe and quantify travel practices in concert with group decision-making dynamics, and demographic data of participants during excursions. Effectively, we use the recorded GPS track taken within the landscape as an expression of the decision making processes and terrain usage by the group.\nPreliminary data analysis shows that individual experience levels, gender, avalanche hazard, and group composition all influence the ways in which people travel in avalanche terrain. Our results provide the first analysis of coupled real-time GPS tracking of the crowd while moving in avalanche terrain combined with psychographic and demographic correlates. This research will lead to an improved understanding of real-time decision making in avalanche terrain. In this paper we will specifically focus on the presentation of the methods used to solicit, and then harness the crowd to obtain data in a unique and innovative application of citizen science where the movements within the terrain are the desired output data (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Example GPS tracks sourced from backcountry winter users in the Teton Pass area (Wyoming), from the 2014-15 winter season, where tracks in red represent those recorded as self-assessed experts (as per our survey), and where tracks in blue represent those recorded as self-assessed intermediates. All tracks shown were obtained under similar avalanche conditions. Statistical analysis of terrain metrics showed that the experts used steeper terrain than the intermediate users under similar avalanche conditions, demonstrating different terrain choice and use as a function of experience rather than hazard level.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we apply a new method—the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE)—to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct magnetic field topology, in order to use it with the data from the forth-coming MMS mission. We compare this method with the previously used Poincare index (PI), and find that they are generally consistent, except that the PI method can only find a null inside the spacecraft (SC) tetrahedron, while the FOTE method can find a null both inside and outside the tetrahedron and also deduce its drift velocity. In addition, the FOTE method can (1) avoid limitations of the PI method such as data resolution, instrument uncertainty (Bz offset), and SC separation; (2) identify 3D null types (A, B, As, and Bs) and determine whether these types can degenerate into 2D (X and O); (3) reconstruct the magnetic field topology. We quantitively test the accuracy of FOTE in positioning magnetic nulls and reconstructing field topology, by using the data from 3D kinetic simulations. The influences of SC separation (0.05~1 di) and null-SC distance (0~1 di) on the accuracy are both considered. We find that: (1) for an isolated null, the method is accurate when the SC separation is smaller than 1 di, and the null-SC distance is smaller than 0.25~0.5 di; (2) for a null pair, the accuracy is same as in the isolated-null situation, except at the separator line, where the field is nonlinear. We define a parameter in terms of the eigenvalues of the null to quantify the quality of our method—the smaller this parameter the better the results. Comparing to the previously used one, this parameter is more relevant for null identification. Using the new method, we reconstruct the magnetic field topology around a radial-type null and a spiral-type null, and find that the topologies are well consistent with those predicted in theory. We therefore suggest using this method to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct field topology with four-point measurements, particularly from Cluster and the forth-coming MMS mission. For the MMS mission, this null-finding algorithm can be used to trigger its burst-mode measurements.",

To improve North American carbon flux estimates, we have built a new data assimilation system that couples the contemporary global carbon cycle model CarbonTracker with the Weather Research and Forecasting/Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model (referred as CarbonTracker-WRF-STILT).\nThe current CarbonTracker-WRF-STILT system assimilates atmospheric observations of CO2 mole fractions at eight tower sites in North America and optimizes the a priori carbon fluxes from the simple biosphere (SiB) model. The system employs a two-lag Ensemble Kalman smoother to optimize scaling factors for both biospheric fluxes and the boundary conditions every 10 days. We will present the optimized carbon fluxes for North America for 2010, and compare them with the results from the CT2013B and CTE2014. To estimate the transport uncertainties, we also plan to test an alternative Lagrangian transport model Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) driven by the NAM12 meteorological fields.\nIn the following step, the CarbonTracker-WRF-STILT system will be adapted to assimilate multiple tracers, e.g. CO2 and carbonyl sulfide (COS) to simultaneously optimize photosynthesis (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiration.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable bioenergy for transportation fuel and greenhouse gas (GHGs) reductions may require considerable changes in land use. Perennial grasses have been proposed because of their potential to yield substantial biomass on marginal lands without displacing food and reduce GHG emissions by storing soil carbon. Here, we implemented an integrated approach to planning bioenergy landscapes by combining spatially-explicit ecosystem and economic models to predict a least-cost land allocation for a 32 billion gallon (121 billion liter) renewable fuel mandate in the US. We find that 2022 GHG transportation emissions are decreased by 7% when 3.9 million hectares of eastern US land are converted to perennial grasses supplemented with corn residue to meet cellulosic ethanol requirements, largely because of gasoline displacement and soil carbon storage. If renewable fuel production is accompanied by a cellulosic biofuel tax credit, CO2 equivalent emissions could be reduced by 12%, because it induces more cellulosic biofuel and land under perennial grasses (10 million hectares) than under the mandate alone. While GHG reducing bioenergy landscapes that meet RFS requirements and do not displace food are possible, the reductions in GHG emissions are 50% less compared to previous estimates that did not account for economically feasible land allocation.",

Understanding the budget of atmospheric P is helpful to uncovering the Earth’s biogeochemical cycle of P. However, this budget was not well balanced in previous studies, with global deposition exceeding estimated emissions from wildfires, fossil fuel combustion, dust, volcanoes, sea-salt and biogenic particles. Here we re-estimate the combustion-related emissions of P into the atmosphere using a new method based on the mass balance (Wang et al., Nature Geoscience, 8, 48-54, 2015). We derive a combustion-related emission of 1.8 Tg P yr-1 (90% confidence from 0.5 to 4.4), comprising over 50% of global atmospheric sources, higher than the 5% previously estimated. Resultant total source to the atmosphere (3.5 Tg P yr-1, 90% confidence from 0.9 to 7.8) translates to a deposition sink of 2.7 Tg P yr-1 over land and 0.8 Tg P yr-1 over the oceans, when prescribed to an atmospheric transport model. P deposition rates observed at a set of measurement stations can be well captured by the model, indicating a near balance of the budget. Our result implies a larger human perturbation on the atmospheric P cycle than thought.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates changing climatological conditions in the Nepalese Himalayas including decreasing precipitation, a weakening Indian monsoon and rising temperatures. Trees and shrubs found at treeline are considered to be highly sensitive to climate, but the climatic effects on these ecotone species in the Himalayas are not well understood. Dendrochronological techniques applied to co-occurring shrubs and trees up-and down-slope of treeline extend our understanding of vegetation response at range margins and into tree-less environments. We developed tree-ring width and annual height increment chronologies for Abies spectabilis (Himalayan fir) and the first annual growth increment and annual production of leaves chronologies for Cassiope fastigata (Himalayan heather) at a high elevation site in central Nepal. C. fastigata chronologies showed moisture availability in late pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons of the previous year are critical to stem elongation and leaf production (AGI and previous May-August SPEI-12, r = 0.790; LEAF and previous June-September SPEI-12, r = 0.708) A. spectabilis chronologies were significantly and negatively correlated with monsoon season temperature during the current year (tree-ring width and June mean temperature, r = -0.677; height-increment and Sept maximum temperature, r = -0.605). In addition to both long-term and recent declines in moisture in the Himalayas, moisture deficit may be further exacerbated at high elevation sites via run-off and higher levels of evapotranspiration resulting in growth reductions, dieback and even death of these species. These results highlight that not all mid-latitude, high elevation treelines are limited by temperature as previously thought and that severe drought stress may initiate downslope treeline retraction. Understanding the response of co-occurring tree and shrub species to climate, now and in the future, may help to elucidate the physiological mechanisms controlling local and landscape transitions from forest to alpine shrubs and have important implications for future land surface-atmosphere interactions in the region.",

            "abstract": "Coherent structures such as the vortical updrafts (and their shell) and subsidence are the main heat- and moisture-transporting flow structures in atmospheric convective layers. Although understanding their stochastic characteristics is essential in improving convection parameterization, even detecting them in well simulated numerical data is difficult because of their complex spatial and temporal distribution. A new method, classifying coherent structures in the boundary and cloud layers, is introduced. The new method first filters out noise from numerical simulation data and then it divides the denoised coherent flow into \"updraft\", \"downdraft/shell\", \"subsidence\" and other flow structures using an octant analysis. The method is used to detect the coherent structures in the shallow convection, simulated by large-eddy simulation model. The frequency and contribution to the vertical transport of heat and moisture of the coherent structures are analyzed. Updraft and environmental subsidence are the most frequent and dominant contributor to the vertical transport of heat and moisture in the boundary layer. The two flow structures with downdraft/shell illustrate the horizontal convective rolls in the boundary layer. Cloudy updrafts spread over the horizontal convective rolls and several updrafts with subsiding shells tend to form larger and complex convective structures. The role of downdraft/shell is distinct especially in the upper cloud layer and it acts against the updraft in transporting heat and moisture in the vertical direction. The newly developed method enables tracking individual or an ensemble of coherent structures from unsaturated boundary layer to less turbulent cloud layer. Thus, this method is expected to help understand en/detrainment around the complex but coherent structures.",

To be useful in long term sea level studies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errors one order of magnitude less than the contemporary climate signals of 1-3 mm/year observed in sea level records. This metrology demand constitutes a challenge in geodesy. Here, we review the most successful instrumental methods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at the Earth’s surface, so that the above-mentioned sea level issues can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy. A special focus will be given to the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and to the combination of satellite radar altimetry minus tide gauge data. We will update previous data analyses and confront the updated results from both methods. Then, using a joined set of relatively robust vertical velocities from nearly 500 sites along the world coastlines, we will examine to what extent the assumption of coastal vertical land motion cancelling out, on average, with or without glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) corrections, was valid in past global sea level rise studies, and whether subsidence processes are predominant at coastlines.",

            "abstract": "Methane is generated as the end product of anaerobic organic matter degradation following a series of reaction pathways including fermentation and syntrophy. Along with acetate and CO2, syntrophic reactions generate H2 and are only thermodynamically feasible when coupled to an exothermic reaction that consumes H2. The usual model of organic matter degradation in peatlands has assumed that methanogenesis is that exothermic H2-consuming reaction. If correct, this paradigm should ultimately result in equimolar production of CO2 and methane from the degradation of the model organic compound cellulose: i.e. C6H12O6 à 3CO2 + 3CH4. However, dissolved gas measurement and modeling results from field and incubation experiments spanning peatlands across the northern hemisphere have failed to demonstrate equimolar production of CO2 and methane. Instead, in a flagrant violation of thermodynamics, these studies show a large bias favoring CO2 production over methane generation. In this talk, we will use an array of complementary analytical techniques including FT-IR, cellulose and lignin measurements, 13C-NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to describe organic matter degradation within a peat column and identify the important degradation mechanisms. Hydrogenation was the most common transformation observed in the ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry data. From these results we propose a new mechanism for consuming H2 generated during CO2 production, without concomitant methane formation, consistent with observed high CO2/CH4 ratios. While homoacetogenesis is a known sink for H2 in these systems, this process also consumes CO2 and therefore does not explain the excess CO2 measured in field and incubation samples. Not only does the newly proposed mechanism consume H2 without generating methane, but it also yields enough energy to balance the coupled syntrophic reactions, thereby restoring thermodynamic order.\nSchematic of organic matter degradation. Solid lines indicate traditional pathways from Conrad (1999), dashed lines indicates new proposed mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Observations have established that about 20% of the solar wind (SW) is reflected and 80% directly transmitted across Earth’s bow shock (Skopke et al, Adv. Space Sci., 15, No. 8/9, 269, 1995). The transmitted SW is not immediately thermalized and the magnetosheath plasma distribution can remain non-Maxwellian for a long time. Cluster observations have further established that most of the magnetosheath bulk flow remains super-Alfvenic except in the polar altitudes near the cusp region (Longmore et al., Anna. Geophysicae, 23, 3351–3364, 2005). We have studied SW ion distributions before and after entering the bow shock to examine the details of the solar wind-bow shock interaction. Preliminary findings indicate that a typical SW H+ beam with thermal kT ~10 eV drifting at 400 km/s in front of the bow shock appears as ~12 eV beam drifting at 250 km/s after it penetrates the shock barrier. The small kT increase is possibly due to wave-particle interaction at the boundary. While the He++ ion beam kT behaves similarly as H+ ions, the drift velocities of He++ ions do not always slow down as H+ ions. These observations indicate the physics of SW-bow shock interaction is much more complicated than the models that explain SW slow down as resulting from an electrostatic potential at the shock that decelerates the SW. We have started PIC simulation of SW transport across the bow shock and the results will be presented together with observations.",

            "abstract": "The reduction of uncertainties is a primary goal in Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA). One of the main sources of uncertainty is associated with the use of the Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs). Part of the GMPE uncertainties can be reduced improving the forecasts of the focal mechanisms and style of faulting related to the future earthquakes; in other words, it is expected that GMPEs forecasting performances are more accurate and precise if the style of faulting of the next earthquakes is known. In this study, we propose and apply to the Italian territory a procedure to compute, for each spatial cell, the probability to observe in the future a Normal, Reverse, and Strike-Slip event, and the average distribution of the P, T and N axes for each of these types of earthquake. For this purpose we use a significant focal mechanism catalog and the latest present-day stress field data release for Italy. The method is a modification of the Cumulative Moment Tensor introduced by Kostrov (1974), where all data are weighted according to their spatial distance from the cell. This method is applied to the Italian territory that is characterized by a complex tectonic setting because of the N-S convergence of Africa and Eurasian plates and of NE-SW extension, perpendicular to the Apenninic belt, coexistence. The final goal is to provide information that might be helpful for the ongoing activities related to the preparation of the next seismic hazard model for Italy.",

            "abstract": "Urban environments continue to face the challenges of localized flooding and decreased water quality brought on by the increasing amount of impervious area in the built environment. Green infrastructure provides an alternative to conventional storm sewer design by using natural processes to filter and store stormwater at its source. However, there are currently few consistent standards available in North America to ensure that installed green infrastructure is performing as expected. This analysis offers a method for characterizing green roof failure using a visual aid commonly used in earthquake engineering: fragility curves. We adapted the concept of the fragility curve based on the efficiency in runoff reduction provided by a green roof compared to a conventional roof under different storm scenarios. We then used the 2D distributed surface water-groundwater coupled model MIKE SHE to model the impact that a real green roof might have on runoff in different storm events. We then employed a multiple regression analysis to generate an algebraic demand model that was input into the Matlab-based reliability analysis model FERUM, which was then used to calculate the probability of failure. The use of reliability analysis as a part of green infrastructure design code can provide insights into green roof weaknesses and areas for improvement. It also supports the design of code that is more resilient than current standards and is easily testable for failure. Finally, the understanding of reliability of a single green roof module under different scenarios can support holistic testing of system reliability.",

Pressure perturbations of the strongest bolide events were detected at distances of thousands of kilometers, while for the 2013 Chelyabinsk superbolide, arrivals at long orthodrome distances (above 20000 km) and after complete circumnavigations of the globe (up to 87000 km) were recorded.\nInfluence parameters on the detection capability of a single infrasound station on the one hand and of the complete global infrasound network of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) are investigated within this study and applied to a number of strong bolide events of the past 15 years. Potential influences on infrasound detection capability are due to the directivity of the acoustic source energy emission, the long-range ducting via stratosphere and thermosphere and the diurnal change of meteorological parameters and noise conditions at the stations during the signal arrivals.\nSince infrasound of large bolides has probably the most similar characteristics to an atmospheric nuclear explosion, it can be utilized as reference event for studies on the global performance of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the CTBTO. Detections and non-detections of bolide infrasound at the more than 40 operational IMS infrasound stations are studied for the estimation of station and network performance and thus verification of nuclear test ban.",

The properties of particles can differ on the nanoscale compared to larger sizes, as observed in atmospheric chemistry for the crystallization of particles < 40 nm in diameter. We have applied cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) for the study of the morphology of dry, submicron organic aerosol to explore whether nanoscale effects impact the morphology of particles. Specifically, we have characterized the morphology of the poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG-400)/ammonium sulfate system. We have shown that depending on the composition of the system and the mechanism of phase separation (i.e. nucleation and growth vs. spinodal decomposition), a size dependence of morphology is observed. Since phase separation by nucleation and growth should be a common occurrence in the atmosphere, we expect the majority of phase separating atmospheric particles to have a size dependent morphology, which may have important implications for CCN activation. Size dependent morphology may impact the hygroscopic properties of these particles which can affect CCN concentrations and further influence cloud formation, reflectivity, and precipitation, which will have consequences for Earth’s radiation budget.",

This complex system is characterized by coupling and feedback as well as preconditioning and memory. The impact of solar wind driving on geospace is of particular importance during the most severe geomagnetic disturbances, i.e., storms. In this presentation, we will use ionospheric storms as an example to demonstrate a system science approach to studying the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling. During geomagnetic storms, the ionospheric plasma density increases dramatically in the dayside mid-latitude region forming the so-called Storm-Enhanced Density (SED). SED can extend to higher latitude as a plume-like structure and occasionally be transported into the polar cap and the nightside auroral zone, where it constitutes an important seed population for intense ion outflow that can potentially produce significant global impact on the magnetosphere. We will present observational results of the generation and decay of SED plumes as well as their interaction with dayside cusp using data from multiple space-borne and ground-based instruments.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's transition zone (TZ) is a key region within the Earth that, from seismology, may be composed of a mixture of relatively primitive material together with the products of crustal recycling throughout the history of plate tectonics. The only samples of the TZ come in the form of inclusions in diamonds, that, for the most-part are retrogressed lower pressure equivalents of their precursor phases that formed at depth. Recent work by our group and others [1] on transition zone diamonds indicate that both peridotite and eclogitic paragenesis diamonds may record the products of crustal recycling. In-situ ion probe nitrogen and carbon isotopic measurements indicate the crystallisation of TZ diamonds from fluids bearing crustal signatures, of both oxidised and reduced forms. At the same time, majoritic garnets record extreme oxygen isotope compositions that track the interaction of oceanic crust with seawater at low temperature [2]. Such an origin is consistent with the few measured Sr-Nd isotope compositions of majorite garnet inclusions which resemble depleted MORB [3]. We have found considerably more enriched Sr isotope compositions (87Sr/86S ranging to > 0.8) in CaSiO3 inclusions that are from deep asthenosphere to TZ depths, supporting an origin that includes incorporation of recycled crustal sediment, in addition to the basaltic oceanic crust required to explain the phase equilibria [4]. Lastly, the discovery of hydrous ringwoodite in a diamond [5] containing more water than is soluble at the lower TZ adiabat indicates the possible role of recycling in transporting water as well as carbon into the TZ via a cool thermally unequilibrated slab.\n[1] Thomson et al (2014) CMP, 168, 1081.

In this presentation latest research results to severe cyclones and related wind fields from synoptic to multi-decadal and anthropogenic scales will be presented, including recent work to risk assessment of potential damages out of this natural hazard. Nevertheless, the focus is laid on the seasonal timescale and recent results to predictability and predictive skills out of different forecast suites will be discussed.\nIn this context, three seasonal forecast suites, namely ECMWF System 3, ECMWF System 4 and Met Office HadGEM-GA3, are analysed regarding their ability to represent wintertime extra-tropical cyclone and wind storm events for the period 1992 until 2011. Two objective algorithms have been applied to 6 hourly MSLP data and 12 hourly wind speeds in 925hPa to detect cyclone and wind storm events, respectively.\nResults show that all model suites are able to simulate the climatological mean distribution of cyclones and wind storms. For wind storms, all model suites show positive skill in simulating the inter-annual variability over the sub-tropical Pacific. Results for the Atlantic region are more model dependent, with all models showing negative correlations over the western Atlantic. Over the eastern Atlantic/Western Europe only HadGEM-GA3 and ECMWF-S4 reveal significant positive correlations. However, it is found that results over this region are not robust in time for ECMWF-S4, as correlations drop if using 1982 until 2011 instead of 1992 until 2011. Factors of potential predictability will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "There is no shortage of coal, oil, and natural gas in the world. What are sometimes in short supply are fresh ideas. Scientific innovation combined with continued advances in drilling and completion technology revitalized the natural gas industry in North America by making production from shale economic. Similar advances are now happening in shale oil. The convergence of ideas and technology has created a commercial environment in which unconventional reservoirs could supply natural gas to the North American consumer for 50 years or more. And, although not as far along in terms of resource development, oil from the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shales and the oil sands in Alberta could have a similar impact.\nWithout advanced horizontal drilling, geosteering, staged hydraulic-fracture stimulation, synthetic and natural proppants, evolution of hydraulic fluid chemistry, and high-end monitoring and simulation, many of these plays would not exist. Yet drilling and completion technology cannot stand alone. Also required for success are creative thinking, favorable economics, and a tolerance for risk by operators. Current understanding and completion practices will leave upwards of 80% of oil and natural gas in the shale reservoirs. The opportunity to enhance recovery through advanced reservoir understanding and imaging, as well as through recompletions and infill drilling, is considerable. The path from ideas to commercialization will continue to provide economic results in unconventional reservoirs.",

The review includes a history of droughts and floods in the past, in the present and some discussions on future extremes in the context of climate change and its impacts on the Amazon region. Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as ‘once in a century’, have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river’s main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012–2015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Niña/El Niño events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Ocean internal waves (IWs) occurred frequently and extensively in the northern South China Sea (SCS). We studied the effect of interacting nonlinear internal waves (IWs) on chlorophyll concentration variations in the northern South China Sea using the multi-sensors of the Envisat, ERS-2 and MODIS synthetically. Representative cases of the IWs spatial distribution in June in 2005, 2007 and 2009 provide the detailed analysis on the vicinity of the Dongsha Atoll. Unambiguously, results from the depth-integrated body force model, indicated that Luzon Strait was the main generation source of the large-scale IWs. Forcing of two parallel meridional ridges, Lan-yu and Heng-chun, played a more important role than adjacent regions (over 2 m2/s2). The chlorophyll (CHL) concentration enhancement detected by the ocean color sensors was consistent with the large-scale IWs activity from Luzon Strait. Our studies demonstrated that large-amplitude IW packets had a significant influence on the phytoplankton. In the vertical direction, CHL concentration lifting from sub-surface fluctuated along with the IWs activity, and was up to maximum (0.35 mg/m3) at the wave crest. Meanwhile, the peak value of CHL concentration decreased and the fluctuation disappeared with the spread of nonlinear IWs horizontally. A Deep Chlorophyll Maximum model (DCM) was introduced with this remote sensing inversion results, and the presence of IWs activities displace the top of the DCM and have an elevation where the effective light is just enough to produce a measurable response in the ocean color sensors. As further revealed, these large-scale IWs generated from Luzon Strait travelled long distance on the continental shelf in the SCS, significantly impacting vertical distribution, water masses and the ocean mixing.",

            "abstract": "We compare the extent to which VHR optical and radar images delineate the eruption impacts and trace the evolution of erupted deposits on active volcanoes. We could identify about 75% of the 2010 Merapi erupted deposits recognized in traditional geological mapping using object-oriented classification and spectral indices on sub-metric GeoEye and Pléiades images. We recognized sixteen PDC depositional units including high-energy surge deposits on the upper south flank, valley-confined BAF deposits channeled in the Gendol River, and overbank BAF with ash-cloud surge deposits on valley margins. We used an innovative method to map PDC and tephra-fall deposits exploiting direct- and cross-polarized L-band SAR data from ALOS-PALSAR before and after the eruption and combining changes in amplitude of the radar signal with temporal decorrelation. Deposits were separated according to increase or decrease in ground backscattering in direct (HH) and cross (HV) polarizations. The maximum likelihood classification applied to ALOS images provided a result consistent with previous studies with 70% classification accuracy for deposits overall. Scatter diagrams of NDWI, NDVI and NDRSI from three VHR images and morphometric analysis of the initial drainage network enabled us to trace the spatio-temporal evolution (2010-2012) of impacted areas against re-vegetation and surficial erosion. In two years after the eruption, the drainage network was fully developed in the upper catchment devastated by high energy surges but far less developped on fans formed by overbank BAF deposits in the middle valley, suggesting the importance of slope gradient and the deposit grain size, permeability and thickness. We updated the Merapi hazard assessment using Pleiades images as the 2010 eruption changed the summit crater morphology and valley channels. Potential sites favorable to future lahar overbank were identified by computing three morphometric parameters of the river channels.",

            "abstract": "Ice sheets discharge the majority of their mass though fast flowing ice streams and outlet glaciers and the flow dynamics of these features are heavily influenced by conditions at the base. Passive monitoring of microseismic icequake signals generated beneath ice streams are associated with the motion of the ice over its bed and can be used to map both the characteristics of the ice-bed interface and to understand these basal processes. These signals can be inverted for source location, source mechanism and magnitude, amongst other properties, to give spatial and temporal information about the active basal dynamics of a moving ice stream. Since the first dedicated microseismic survey on ice was undertaken in the 1960s, the use of passive microseismic monitoring to investigate the base of ice streams and glaciers has become more commonplace and the utilisation of information contained in these signals increasingly varied and complex.\nWe present a summary of the present state of passive microseismic monitoring of the base of ice streams with a focus on recent findings from Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica. We have located around 3000 microseismic events, in discrete spatial clusters near the ice-bed interface. The source mechanism for the events is interpreted as sub-horizontal, low-angle faulting, slipping in the ice flow direction. Cluster locations are interpreted as ‘sticky spots’ of stiff basal sediment at the ice-bed interface, where ice movement is accommodated by stick-slip basal sliding. We show that the location of these events, historically difficult to accurately determine, can be better constrained by synthetic modeling to investigate the source of errors in location. In addition to this we show that shear wave splitting in the signals can be used to determine properties of the ice fabric of Rutford Ice Stream, which informs both the deformation history and the future response of that ice to the stresses induced by ice flow.",

            "abstract": "The Southeast U.S. is listed one of the fastest growing regions by the Census Bureau, covering two of the eleven megaregions of the United States (Florida and Piedmont Atlantic). The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)’s Operational Line-scan System (OLS) nighttime light (NTL) imagery offers a good opportunity for characterizing the extent and dynamics of urban development at global and regional scales. However, the commonly used thresholding technique for NTL-based urban land mapping often underestimates the suburban and rural areas and overestimates urban extents. In this study we developed a novel approach to estimating impervious surface area (ISA) by integrating the NTL and optical reflectance data. A geographically weighted regression model was built to extract ISA from the Vegetation-Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI). The ISA was estimated each year from 1992 to 2013 to generate the ISA time series for the U.S. Southeast region. Using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products of percent imperviousness (2001, 2006, and 2010) as our reference data, accuracy assessment indicated that our approach made considerable improvement of the ISA estimation, especially in suburban areas. With the ISA time series, a nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis was performed to detect hotspots of human settlement expansion, followed by the exploration of decennial U.S. census data to link these patterns to migration flows in these hotspots. Our results provided significant insights to human settlement of the U.S. Southeast in the past decades. The proposed approach has great potential for mapping ISA at broad scales with nightlight data such as DMSP/OLS and the new-generation VIIRS products. The ISA time series generated in this study can be used to assess the anthropogenic impacts on regional climate, environment and ecosystem services in the U.S. Southeast.",

            "abstract": "The interannual Antarctic sea ice variability in Indian Ocean shares a large portion of variance with Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and that in Ross Sea with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). If we regress out the influence of these climate modes from the sectorial sea ice extent time series, the expanding sea ice trends in the satellite era become insignificant at 95 %. Because SAM has a human-induced trend, the increasing sea ice extent in Indian Ocean may be explained by superposition of anthropogenic forcing and natural variability. On the other hand, because ENSO does not have a significant trend, the sea ice trend in Ross Sea might be produced purely by natural variability. In addition to SAM and ENSO, some residual sea ice variances can be explained by other modes, which are not simultaneously-correlated with SAM or ENSO. For instance, a wave-like mode that appears to be Rossby wave trains shares large variance with interannual sea ice variability in many longitudinal sectors. The spatial trend pattern reconstructed by the Rossby mode exhibits consistent features with the ice motion trend pattern shown by Holland and Kwok (2012). These results, based on observational and reanalysis data, suggest that a large portion of expanding trend of Antarctic sea ice may be explained by natural climate variability.",

In 2014 SWERUS-C3 carried out a two-leg field program on the Swedish Icebreaker ODEN. A component of the SWERUS-C3 program focused on water column mapping of the spatial distribution and geologic context of gas seeps using the acoustic systems on board ODEN (12 kHz EM122 multibeam echo sounder, 2-8 kHz SBP120 subbottom profiler, and an 18 kHz EK60 split-beam sonar). On Leg 2 of the 2014 expedition, a new wideband transceiver (EK80) was added to the split-beam echo sounder and calibrated, providing the ability to measure the acoustic response of the gas seeps over a much broader range of frequencies (15-30 kHz). While the broader bandwidth unquestionably provides higher target resolution a further objective of the broadband mapping was to determine whether information on bubble size distribution could be determined so as to help model the flux of gas coming from the seeps. On Leg 2 approximately 34 seeps were mapped, mostly in the vicinity of Herald Canyon. The wide-swath, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry (from the EM122) and high-resolution chirp sub-bottom profiling (from the SBP120 multibeam sub-bottom profiler) combined with water column imaging of seeps collected at both 12 kHz (from the EM122) and 15-30 kHz (from the EK80) offer an important opportunity to understand the spatial distribution of seeps and their relationship to local and regional processes as determined from seafloor and subsurface structure, as well as to explore the potential of extracting quantitative information about the magnitude of gas transport from the seeps.",

Here we present the first continuous record of water vapor isotope ratio (δ18O, δ2H, d-excess) measurements from the sub-Arctic and Arctic Ocean during ship transit through both open water and sea ice. As water vapor isotopes were collected across a spectrum of sea ice conditions, the influence of sea ice and availability of open water moisture sources on Arctic Ocean water vapor isotope values (particularly d-excess) is examined. Isotope values reveal characteristics about water availability at vapor sources, as influenced by presence of sea ice (e.g., ice covered arid or open water humid sources), and air parcel trajectory. Higher d-excess values were generally associated with more northern Arctic, ice covered, and arid vapor sources. Conversely, lower d-excess values were related to more southern, open water, and humid vapor sources. Additionally, water vapor isotopes while sea ice was present were generally characterized by more depleted δ18O and δ2H and higher d-excess values, relative to open water values. These water vapor isotope values also present information about potential shifts in moisture sources in an increasingly ice free Arctic Ocean. Understanding these shifts is important to learning about both modern and past patterns of Arctic atmospheric water movement and distribution.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed the dielectric spectra of 49 firn and ice samples from ice sheets and glaciers to better understand how differing ice formation and evolution affect electrical properties. The dielectric relaxation of ice is well known and its characteristic frequency increases with the concentration of soluble impurities in the ice lattice. We found that meteoric ice and firn generally possess two such relaxations, indicating distinct crystal populations or zonation. Typically, one population is consistent with that of relatively pure ice, and the other is significantly more impure. However, high temperatures (e.g., temperate ice), long residence times (e.g., ancient ice from Mullins Glacier, Antarctica), or anomalously high impurity concentrations favor the development of a single relaxation. These relationships suggest that annealing causes two dielectrically distinct populations to merge into one population. The dielectric response of temperate ice samples indicates increasing purity with increasing depth, suggesting final rejection of impurities from the lattice. Separately, subglacially frozen samples from the Vostok 5G ice core possess a single relaxation whose variable characteristic frequency likely reflects the composition of the source water. Multi-frequency electrical measurements on cores and in the field can track annealing of glacier ice.",

The effects are often contingent upon meteorological variables and aerosol properties. By reducing surface energy budget, aerosol tends to suppress convection, but aerosol-induced heating in the lower atmosphere can destabilize the upper atmosphere and strengthen convection. Aerosol-induced altering cloud microphysics may also suppress or invigorate cloud development pending on various factors. In this talk, I will illustrate how aerosols likely contribute to the thunderstorm variability on three distinct time scales from diurnal, weekly to decadal and how different types of aerosols and varying meteorological conditions may affect with the observed trends. I will first demonstrate the opposite effects of conservative scattering and hygroscopic aerosols versus absorbing and hydrophobic aerosol on the long-term trends of thunderstorms. I will then illustrate that aerosol can have a discernible effect on the weekly cycle of thunderstorms and there is the dependence of the phase of the weekly cycle on aerosol types. Last, I will show how aerosol delays the occurrence of thunderstorms. Of course, the plausible connections are subject to various uncertainties that should be tackled with more rigorous modeling and extensive observation studies.",

This understanding has brought changes in researchers’ and practitioners’ interactions with diverse groups and individuals. This paper addresses evaluation, a process that measures the degree to which learning and project goals are met and factors contributing to or hindering outcomes. Parallels are drawn to learning assessment.\nThe concepts of inclusion, participation, and constructivism (Mertens, 1999; Mertens and Hopson, 2006) now drive best evaluation practices for projects with persons with disabilities (AEA, 2011). This is also true in cases of other people who have been marginalized in STEM fields, e.g. women and underrepresented groups. Inclusion of these stakeholders has important implications for the validity of an evaluation, including the accuracy of results (Jacobson et al, 2012; Gill, 1999; Lee, 1999). The American Indian Higher Education Consortium’s framework for indigenous groups incorporates their values and goals into evaluation design and implementation. It is feasible to include participant input in designing the questions and methods of obtaining data, ensuring that issues of access, opportunity, and power (Shuffelbeam, 2001) are taken into consideration.\nGeoscience projects with u-learning and m-learning provide opportunities to test these theoretical models in innovative programs such as: field work for students with physical disability; underrepresented minority, secondary students using mobile devices in contextualized learning in informal settings; and graduate students using digital maps to enhance traditional field work. This study compares program evaluation methodology of tradition learning with that of programs for diverse groups of students using digital technology.\nRef: Mertens doi:10.1177/109821409902000102; Mertens and Hopson DOI: 10.1002/ev.177; AEA http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=92; Jacobson et al DOI 10.1177/1098214012461558; Gill DOI:10.1016/S1098-2140(99)00018-1; Lee DOI: 10.1177/109821409902000210; Shuffelbeam ISBN: 978-0-7879-5755-1",

An accurate quantification of the sources, sinks, and chemical transformation of bromine species is thus crucial to the understanding of the bromine and ozone budget in the UTLS and the stratosphere. However, the investigation of the composition of the tropical UTLS is challenging, as the altitude of this region of 15 - 20 km requires high-altitude aircraft, or balloons. In recent years a new aircraft has become available to penetrate into this region: NASA’s Global Hawk (GH) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The GH has a ceiling altitude of 20 km and a 24h endurance with a full complement of scientific experiments. The GH provides a new and exciting platform that allows unique insights into atmospheric processes in the UTLS.\nHere we present observations of CH4, BrO, NO2, and ozone made on-board the GH during the 2011, 2013, and 2014 Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) in the pacific tropical UTLS. We will discuss the details of UV-vis remote sensing measurements of BrO and NO2 by the UCLA/HD limb scanning Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy instrument. We also present observations of organic bromine species from the University of Miami’s Whole Air Sampler, in-situ ozone measurement by NOAA, and CH4 measurements by the Harvard Picarro instrument and the NOAA UCATS gas chromatograph. Methods to determine vertical trace gas profiles through aircraft maneuvers and by scanning the mini-DOAS telescope in viewing elevation will be discussed. The combination of the observations with calculations using the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D model allows quantification and interpretation of the bromine and ozone budget in the UTLS.",

Model developments include efficient numerical approaches to support operational forecasting and focus on particular feedbacks of the aerosol-cloud-radiation system:\nAerosol-radiation feedbacks: A new parameterization of the aerosol direct effect was implemented to improve the representation of the aerosol variability.\nCloud-aerosol feedbacks: The microphysics parameterization was upgraded to include water- and ice-nucleation aerosols.\nCloud-radiation feedbacks: A shallow cumulus parameterization was implemented to connect sub-grid clouds to the radiation scheme. In addition, the microphysics parameterization provides the cloud droplet radius and ice crystal size to the radiation parameterizations to fully represent the first and second aerosol indirect effect.\nInitialization of the cloud field from infrared radiances recorded by satellites.\nThe different components have been interconnected to provide a complete representation of the aerosol-cloud-radiation system and its feedbacks. In addition, new developments were introduced to output the diffuse and direct normal irradiance (DNI) at temporal resolutions only limited by the time step of the model.\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the model physics packages upgraded for solar energy applications together with an assessment of different upgraded components. This includes the clear sky assessment wherein improvements of up to 58%, 76%, and 83% are found in global horizontal irradiance, DNI, and diffuse irradiance, respectively, compared to a standard version of the WRF model. The benefits of including a representation of the effects of unresolved clouds in the solar irradiance that largely reduce a positive bias in the model (~50W/m2). Finally, we will discuss an ongoing evaluation of the improvements resulting from the activation of the aerosol indirect effect.",

During this cruise we investigated and sampled the corrugated fault to understand its geometry, nature of deformation, and links to fluid flow.\nWe identified and explored 7 fault outcrops on the flanks of microbathymetric striations subparallel to extension. These outcrops expose extensive fault planes, with the most prominent ones extending 40-90m laterally, and up to 10 m vertically. These fault surfaces systematically show subhorizontal striations subparallel to extension, and define slabs of fault-rock that are flat and also striated at sample scale. Visual observations show a complex detachment fault zone, with anastomosing fault planes at outcrop scale (1-10 m), with a highly heterogeneous distribution of deformation. We observe heterogeneity in fault-rock nature at outcrop scale. In situ samples from striated faults are primarily basalt breccias with prior green-schist facies alteration, and a few ultramafic fault-rocks that show a complex deformation history, with early schistose textures, brittlely reworked as clasts within the fault. The basalt breccias show variable silicification and associated sulfides, recording important fluid-rock interactions during exhumation.\nTo understand the link between fluid and deformation during exhumation, we will present microstructural observation of deformation textures, composition, and distribution and origin of quartz and sulfides, as well as constraints on the temperature of silicifying fluids from fluid inclusions in quartz. These results allow us to characterize in detail the detachment fault zone geometry, and investigate the timing of silicification relative to deformation.",

The gradient in net radiation causes a response of the atmospheric general circulation. Cloud feedbacks are a key contributor in this process. One of the important feedbacks in models is the cloud optical depth feedback in high latitudes, in which the liquid water content of clouds in middle and high latitudes increases with warming. It is shown that in models the shortwave cloud feedback in middle latitudes is caused by the ice microphysics, which decrease the sink of liquid water as the temperature increases. This brightening of the high latitude clouds, a negative shortwave cloud feedback, is shown to be the most important contributor to the poleward jet shift in an aquaplanet simulation.",

            "abstract": "The in situ measurment of the conditions near the Sun's corona, responsible for coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, and energetic particle production and transport has been a high priority, but elusive, scientific goal since the beginning of the Space Age. The first proposal for a solar probe was from the six-man Fields and Particles Group (Committee 8 of the Space Science Board (SSB)) chaired by John Simpson of the University of Chicago. In their interim report of 24 Octobr 1958, the Group suggested a variety of missions, including \"a solar probe to pass inside the orbit of Mercury to study the particles and fields in the vicinity of the Sun...\". The exteme thermal and propulsive requirements were immediately recognized. Following initial trajectory studies using a variety of gravity-assist stategies, in the mid-1970's detailed mission and engineering studies for such a mission were carried out in the U.S. by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and in Europe by the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission rationale did not change substantially since the 1978 workshop at which Harold Glaser, then head of NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Program office asked the attendees “What can Solar Probe do that no other mission can do?” Answers provided at the workshop included solar energetic particle propagation effects, acceleration of the solar wind, and testing \"the validity of the many models now in use for interpretation of remotely observed solar phenomena and interplanetary phenomena observed near 1 AU.” Studies in the 1980's emphasized a comprehensive payload passing to within 4 solar radii of the Sun's center. Budgetary concerns led to a \"minimal mission\" concept in 1995, followed by a more robust concept studied in 1999. A renewed study in 2005 was followed by a non-nucelar \"Solar Probe Lite.\" The requirment to use solar power eliminated the use of a Jupiter gravity assist and a polar pass as close as 4 solar radii. However, the substitute of using multiple Venus gravity assists to \"walk\" the spacecraft perihelion in to 10 solar radii in Venus's orbital plane, also enabled far more time close to the Sun. This trade was found actually to enhance the science return and \"Solar Probe Plus\" was born, with a launch now set to occur just months shy of the 60th anniversary of the issuance of the Simpson committee interim report.",

But planning and conducting these events costs participants’ time and energy. For 15 years, the Bureau of Economic Geology of The University of Texas at Austin has hosted an Austin Earth Science Week Career Day, in which STEM professionals showcase their knowledge, skills, and experiences for middle-school students. By establishing partnerships and assuming a leadership role, the Bureau has leveraged resources to host a sustainable series of educational events.\nKey to success was finding a common goal that all participants were interested in fulfilling. Engaging and educating students about careers in geoscience became that unifying goal. Governmental agency staffers, industry professionals, graduate students, and school administrators were all interested in this effort. The career theme also attracted a wide variety of professionals, many of whom have participated in the event every year.\nThe biggest challenge is meeting the demand from schools for this type of educational experience. In early years, the event was hosted by a few Bureau scientists in their offices. As word spread about the event, new partners and a larger facility were required to accommodate the growing number of participants. Currently, new media and distance learning platforms are being explored for broadening the event to meet demand. After 15 years, the Austin Earth Science Week Career Day has now become a tradition. We hope it serves as a model to others interested in establishing a STEM event in their own community.",

The MJO simulations performed during the DYNAMO MJO2 suppressed and active phases. The objective is to examine the initiation of the MJO. The results are evaluated using the observations from the DYNAMO NOAA-P3 Dropsondes. The three formulations show general agreement during the suppressed phase of the MJO, which is important for the initiation of the MJO. During the active phase of the MJO, the modified Bougeault mixing length formulation shows improvement in the lower layer. This modified formulation enhances the convection by applying the Bougeault up-down-ward parcel approach to the levels above 2000 m and the approach of Mellor-Yamada below 2000 m. The other modified formulation that removes the discontinuities in the parameterized eddy viscosity and diffusivity terms is able to reduce the mean bias of temperature in the upper layer. This study suggests the importance of vertical mixing in modulating convective activities during the active phase of the MJO.",

            "abstract": "Mercury’s surface hosts a large number of thrust-fault-related landforms that primarily accommodated global contraction driven by interior cooling. The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft returned a wealth of data that allow for a detailed characterization of the amount and timing of that contraction. In particular, mapping of thrust-fault-related landforms shows that the planet experienced a radius decrease of 5.1±2 km since the end of heavy bombardment. Cross-cutting relationships of thrust faults with impact craters of different degradation stages indicate that global contraction operated throughout much of Mercury’s past, with the earliest evidence for faulting dating from near the time of cessation of widespread plains volcanism. An assessment of the brittle strength of Mercury’s lithosphere indicates that 0.4±0.1 to 2.1±0.4 km of radius change is necessary for stresses to be sufficiently large to overcome the frictional resistance to sliding on pre-existing fractures and faults. These values not only increase estimates for the overall amount of global contraction but also imply that this process was initiated before any evidence of shortening in the geologic record was manifest as brittle deformation. Together, these observations and results have implications for the rate at which global contraction operated through Mercury’s geologic history. Higher initial strain rates are required if the radial contraction prior to the initiation of thrust faulting was ~2.1 km, and are possible but not required if the radial contraction accommodated prior to the onset of thrust faulting was ~0.4 km. These findings incorporate an aspect of global contraction not previously considered, as well as a contribution to radius change beyond that inferable from mapping. This approach is applicable to inferences on global contraction from tectonic mapping, and constraints on thermal histories, for any world dominated by secular cooling.",

A temperature/wind Doppler Na lidar, operating at Fort Collins, CO (41°N, 105°W) and later at Logan, UT (42°N and 112°W), observed significant temperature increases (temperature anomaly) above 95 km (as much as 55 K at 105 km altitude) during four geomagnetic storms (April 2002, Nov. 2004, May 2005 and Oct. 2012). Coincident TIMED/GUVI observations indicate significant depletion in the thermospheric O/N2 ratio at the lidar locations.

            "abstract": "The thermal-based Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model partitions the water and energy fluxes from vegetation and soil components providing thus the ability for estimating soil evaporation (E) and canopy transpiration (T) separately. However, it is crucial for ET partitioning to retrieve reliable estimates of canopy and soil temperatures as well as the net radiation partitioning (ΔRn), as the latter determines the available energy for water and heat exchange from soil and canopy sources. These two factors become especially relevant in agricultural areas, with vegetation clumped along rows and hence only partially covering the soil surface for much of the growing season. The effects on radiation and temperature partitioning is extreme for vineyards and orchards, where there is often significant separation between plants, resulting in strongly clumped vegetation with significant fraction of bare soil/substrate. To better understand the effects of strongly clumped vegetation on radiation and Land Surface Temperature (LST) partitioning very high spatial resolution remote sensing data acquired from an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) were collected over vineyards in Califronia, as part of the Grape Remote sensing and Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX).\nThe multi-temporal observations from the UAS and very high pixel resolution permitted the estimation of reliable soil and leaf temperatures using a contextual algorithm based on the inverse relationship between LST and a vegetation index. An improvement in the algorithm estimating the effective leaf area index explicitly developed for vine rows and ΔRn using the 4SAIL Radiative Transfer Model is as well developed. The revisions to the TSEB model are evaluated with in situ measurements of energy fluxes and transmitted solar radiation. Results show that the modifications to the TSEB resulted in closer agreement with the flux tower measurements compared to the original TSEB model formulations. The significant advantages in using very high resolution remote sensing data for ET monitoring in agricultural regions having strongly clumped vegetation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Every decade since the 1960s has been warmer than the one before, with 2000-2009 by far the warmest decade on record. However, the role of human-induced climate change has been discounted by some owing to a markedly reduced increase in global mean surface temperature from 1998 through 2013, known as the hiatus. The upward trend has resumed in 2014, now the warmest year on record, with 2015 temperatures on course for another record-hot year. Although the Earth’s climate is undoubtedly warming, this paper examines how weather-related and internal natural climate variability can temporarily overwhelm global warming in any given year or even decade, especially locally. Part of the perspective is from the standpoint of the energy budget of the planet and how that is changing. A key aspect is whether we can account for any anomalous heating by taking an inventory of the heat content of the planet, in particular ocean heat content. The vertical disposition of heat taken up by the ocean plays a key role in decadal variability.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms and timing of mountain growth in Scandinavia remain enigmatic given that the region has not been involved in active orogenesis since the Devonian and in any large-scale tectonic activities after the NE Atlantic breakup during the early Cenozoic. In this study we combine analysis of the vertical motions of the region caused by (dominantly) glacial erosion during the Quaternary with Apatite Fission Track (AFT) analysis of rocks from the area. Using numerical models, we first quantify how fluvial and glacial erosion carved out the fjords and valleys to a depth of 2 km below the paleosurfaces. This erosional episode represents a major local weight loss and results in up to a 0.8-km uplift of rocks and up to a 0.5-km rise of local topography. These estimates only marginally depend on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere and thus are robust. We show then that no correlation exists between sample altitude and published AFT data, but that a correlation does exist between AFT age and the depth below our constructed pre-glacial summit surface. This correlation demonstrates the robustness of the numerical erosional model, quantifies average erosion rates during Carboniferous–Cretaceous at < 10 m/My, and outlines the regions of western Scandinavia (Lofoten and Bergen areas and Møre-Trøndelag fault complex) with atypical Mesozoic–Cenozoic evolution, probably related to regional tectonic activities.",

            "abstract": "Natural disasters disproportionately impact developing country economies while also impacting business operations for multi-national corporations that rely on supplies and manufacturing in affected areas. Understanding natural hazard risk is only a first step towards preparedness and mitigation—data on facilities, transportation, critical infrastructure, and populations that may be exposed to disasters is required to plan for events and properly assess risks. Detailed exposure data can be used in models to predict casualty rates, aggregate estimates of building damage or destruction, impacts on business operations, and the scale of recovery efforts required. These model outputs are useful for disaster preparedness planning by national and international organizations, as well as for corporations and the reinsurance industry seeking to better understand their risk exposure. Many of these data are lacking for developing countries.\nRapid assessment in areas with minimal data for disaster modeling is possible by combing remote sensing data, sample data on construction methods, facility and critical infrastructure data, and economic and demographic census information. This presentation focuses on the methods used to fuse the physical and socioeconomic data by presenting the results from two projects. The first project seeks to improve earthquake risk assessments in Asia using for the reinsurance industry, while the second project builds an integrated exposure database across five countries in Africa for use by international development organizations.",

            "abstract": "During May 1-2, 2010, a record-breaking storm hit Nashville, and caused huge humanity and societal loss. It raises the importance of forecasting/reconstructing these types of extreme weather systems once again, in the meanwhile providing an excellent case for such atmospheric modelling studies. However, earlier studies suggest that successful reconstruction of this event depends on and is sensitive to a number of model options, making it difficult to establish a better model framework with more confidence. In this study we employed the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to investigate how this extreme precipitation event is sensitive to the model configuration, and identified options that would produce better results. We tested several combinations of modelling grid sizes together with initial/boundary conditions (IC/BC). At different grid sizes, we conducted a set of tests on various combinations of microphysics (Morrison, new Thompson and WSM5) and cumulus process (Kain-Fristch, Grell-Devenyi and Grell-Freitas) parameterization schemes. The model results were intensively evaluated under bias analysis as well as other metrics (probability of detection, bias, false alerts, HSS, ETS). The evaluation suggests that in general, simulation results benefit from finer model grids (5km). At 5km level, NCEP2 or NAM IC/BCs are more representative for the 2010 Nashville storm. There are no universally good parameterization schemes, but the WSM5 microphysics scheme, Kain-Fristch and Grell-Freitas cumulus schemes are recommended over other tested schemes. These better schemes would help to make better estimation of PMP in the region.",

            "abstract": "Flow in relatively steep dryland channels is commonly intermittent and dominated by flash floods. For a given flood discharge, these channels usually transport much more sediment than do mountain rivers with perennial flow. Dryland channel beds tend to be sand-rich, poorly sorted and unarmored even in channels with abundant gravel, in contrast to well-armored gravel beds typical of upland rivers in temperate climates. To explore how unsteady flow and sediment supply influence dryland channel morphodynamics, we first propose a simple model of a developing boundary layer to predict how basal shear stresses change during flash flood hydrographs. Results from the boundary layer model are compared to experimental constraints on bore shear stresses, and are used to predict transport rates for different grain size classes. However, transport depends not only on fluid stresses, but also on granular interactions among particles. Our flume experiments show that bores can disrupt bed grains and cause rapid kinematic sieving and surface coarsening, although shear stresses are high enough to easily transport all available grain sizes. While flash floods can efficiently transport grains both large and small, we show that perennially-flowing channels are typically more supply-limited with respect to fine sediment, because base flow is often sufficient to remove large amounts of sand from the system. Transport rates increase greatly with surface and subsurface sand fraction; we put bounds on the effect of sand abundance on transport efficiencies in flash flood channels. Finally, the comparison to dryland channels also provides insight into “typical” gravel-bed rivers with well-developed surface armoring. While large floods that exceed gravel thresholds of motion cause the most coarse bed load transport, these channels are able to evolve to states of armored stability not because of big floods, but because of the persistent, sand-transporting effects of base flow.",

            "abstract": "The body of evidence indicating a human contribution to observed climate change has continued to strengthen as indicated by the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This includes an accumulating body of evidence suggesting that temperature and precipitation extremes have both changed in response to human influences on the climate. The research on temperature extremes is well established, with recent work indicating that temperature extremes have continued to warm over land despite the global warming “hiatus”, and that anthropogenic forcing has substantially increased the odds of extreme warm years and summers, both globally and regionally. The evidence on precipitation extremes is less well established, although there is increasingly strong evidence that human influence is detectable in observations at the largest scales that are resolvable in available international compilations of daily precipitation records. In contrast, assessments of historical and projected changes in the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle and storminess remain cautious, due to data limitations, uncertainty in process understanding, modelling, and in the case of terrestrial hydrological impacts, the highly heterogeneous nature of the impacted systems. Despite uncertainties and limitations in knowledge, observed and projected changes in the simple temperature and precipitation indicators in which we have greatest confidence provide strong evidence that adaptation is required now, and that further adaptation will be required in the future.",

            "abstract": "The presence of calcite in and near faults, as the dominant material, cement, or vein fill, indicates that the mechanical behavior of carbonate-dominated material likely plays an important role in shallow- and mid-crustal faulting. Furthermore, a variety of physical and chemical processes control the evolution of strength and style of slip along seismogenic faults and thus play a critical role in the seismic cycle. Determining the role and contributions of these types of mechanisms is essential to furthering our understanding of the processes and timescales that lead to the strengthening of faults during interseismic periods and their behavior during the earthquake nucleation process.\nTo further our understanding of these processes, we performed laboratory-shearing experiments on calcite gouge at normal stresses from 1 to 100 MPa, under conditions of saturation and at room temperature. We performed velocity stepping (0.1-1000µm/s) and slide-hold-slide (1-3000s) tests, to measure the velocity dependence of friction and the amount of frictional strengthening respectively, under saturated conditions with pore fluid that was in equilibrium with CaCO3. At 5 MPa normal stress, we also varied the environmental conditions by performing experiments under conditions of 5% RH and 50 % RH, and saturation with: silicone oil, demineralized water, and the equilibrated solution combined with 0.5M NaCl. Finally, we collected post experimental samples for microscopic analysis.\nOur combined analyses of rate-dependence, strengthening behavior, and microstructures show that calcite fault gouge transitions from brittle to semi-brittle behavior at high normal stress and low sliding velocities. Furthermore, our results also highlight how changes in pore water chemistry can have significant influence on the mechanical behavior of calcite gouge in both the laboratory and in natural faults. Our observations have important implications for earthquake nucleation and propagation on faults in carbonate-dominated lithologies.",

            "abstract": "When inverting for a planetary magnetic potential from vector-valued satellite magnetic field data we need to take into account that the recorded data also contain fields not stemming from the planet but from outer sources in space. In classical global spherical-harmonic analysis this is done by fitting, in addition to the inner sources potential field, a linear combination of outer-source spherical harmonics to the data. This approach has been successfully applied to data with global homogeneous coverage and quality but is not suited for purely regional data. In many situations a local method would be beneficial to take full advantage of data with regionally varying quality or coverage, or to avoid ringing artifacts from sharp intensity contrasts. Here we present a local method that allows such a magnetic source separation. We simultaneously create inner-source and outer-source altitude vector Slepian functions by solving an optimization problem that considers the satellite altitude, the upper radial limit of the satellite trajectory, and the maximum spherical-harmonic degree we want to resolve. This new dual-source altitude vector Slepian system allows to invert for both inner-source and outer-source magnetic potential fields from regional data in a computationally efficient manner, as we show with a series of examples for Earth, the Moon, and terrestrial planets.",

Deep convection occurs at values of column humidity above the transition point and induces drying of moist columns. With a 1km resolution, large domain cloud resolving model run in RCE, what will be made clear here for the first time is how the entire tropical convective cloud population is affected by and feeds back to the pickup in heavy precipitation. Shallow convection can act to dry the low levels through weak precipitation or vertical redistribution of moisture, or to moisten toward a transition to deep convection. It is shown that not only can deep convection dehydrate the entire column, it can also dry just the lower layer through intense rain. In the latter case, deep stratiform cloud then forms to dry the upper layer through rain with anomalously high rates for its value of column humidity until both the total column moisture falls below the critical transition point and the upper levels are cloud free. Thus, all major tropical cloud types are shown to respond strongly to the same critical phase-transition point. This mutual response represents a potentially strong organizational mechanism for convection, and the frequency of and logical rules determining physical evolutions between these convective regimes will be discussed. The precise value of the point in total column moisture at which the transition to heavy precipitation occurs is shown to result from two independent thresholds in lower-layer and upper-layer integrated humidity.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Mercury is dominated by ancient volcanic plains with a range of compositions similar to Mg-rich basalts and basaltic komatiites. This observed geochemical diversity cannot solely be the result of fractional crystallization of magmas derived from a single source composition, and instead requires the volcanic plains to be products of partial melting of at least two distinct mantle lithologies, consistent with a compositionally heterogeneous interior. Whereas studies of mantle convection on Mercury to date have constrained general parameters for mantle thickness, viscosity, and radiogenic heating, such models have yet to utilize the link between magma generation and past mantle states to impose thermochemical constraints on the interior. To that end, we use a three-dimensional thermochemical mantle evolution model (CitcomS) to investigate the effects of compositional heterogeneity on the form and vigor of mantle convection and the extent and duration of partial melting. We investigate a range of compositional scenarios for Mercury’s mantle that are broadly consistent with planetary formation and differentiation from enstatite chondrite and carbonaceous (CB) chondrite bulk compositions. Our results indicate that the magma generation implied by widespread volcanic plains emplacement until ~3.8–3.6 Ga must have occurred predominantly in the lower half of the mantle. Although low-degree partial melting is possible in the shallow mantle for the first ~500 My after planetary differentiation, we find that temperatures in the shallow mantle are not sufficiently high to account for the prolonged and extensive magmatism required to produce both intercrater and smooth plains. Additionally, our results suggest that during the period of widespread plains emplacement, layered mantle convection would permit the lower mantle to convect vigorously beneath a sluggishly convective or conductive upper mantle. A compositionally stratified mantle on Mercury not only could yield the substantive magmatism necessary for volcanic plains emplacement, it would also allow for multiple mantle source regions as indicated by the observed geochemical diversity of surface volcanic materials.",

            "abstract": "Organic matter burial in marine sediments is a major process in the global carbon cycle, and enhanced organic matter burial is often associated with periods of global climatic and ecological change. Still, we have only a limited understanding of the processes that drive enhanced OM burial during oxygen-deficient conditions. Abiotic OM sulfurization has the potential to enhance the preservation of OM, but for this process to be significant it must compete with heterotrophic remineralization, most of which occurs before sinking particles reach the sea floor. We investigate the sources of sulfur to sinking particles in a modern marine basin using samples from the CARIACO fixed sediment trap time-series, applying recently developed methods for d34S analysis of small (≥20 nmol) sulfur pools and individual volatile organosulfur compounds. Relative to expectations for planktonic biomass, we find that sinking particles are both sulfur-rich and 34S-depleted. Higher apparent fluxes of 34S-depleted organic sulfur are associated with high OM export from the surface ocean, low terrestrial inputs, and high concentrations of both elemental S and the dominant non-polar organosulfur compound, C20 thiophene. We conclude that OM sulfurization is occurring in particles sinking through the Cariaco water column on timescales of days or less. Depending on the frequency of high OM export events, we estimate that this rapid sulfurization delivers roughly half of the total organic S present at 5 cm depth in underlying sediments. Accordingly, many OM-rich deposits in the geologic record may represent the products of water column sulfurization. This process provides a strong mechanistic feedback between oxygen deficiency and OM preservation.",

Peatlands can be separated into two main layers: the acrotelm, which is exposed to the atmosphere and dominated by living plants, and the catotelm, which tends to be anoxic and is where the majority of organic matter is stored. In response to warming climate, to what extent will peatland organic matter be activated to form additional CH4 and CO2 relative to current production rates? To predict the answer to this question the SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change) project is being conducted in a bog ecosystem in northern Minnesota. The study is designed to improve predictive skill in peat and wetland-methane models by defining quantitative relationships among decomposition indices, microbial communities, and CO2 and CH4 production rates. The manipulation is being conducted in a staged approach, and deep warming through the entire ~2 m peat profile was initiated in June of 2014 at +0, +2.2, +4.5, +6.8 and +9C. Starting in summer 2015, the project will enhance both above and belowground temperature and CO2 levels. Following months of temperature enhancement there is no evidence of an effect on catotelm peat. In bog pre-treatment, control and treatment plots, microbial respiration and CO2 and CH4 production in the deep peat is driven primarily by recent plant production and to date, this trend continues in the catolem following treatment. Methane d13C and fractionation factors are invariant across the treatments, as are gas concentrations at depth. Surface CH4 emission, however, has shown a positive correlation with peat temperature, and measurements of CH4 production in incubations across the depth profile suggest that surface peat is more responsive to increases in soil temperature, apparently driving the emission response. Shifts in the composition and metabolic potential of microbial communities are being examined using next generation sequencing, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic approaches. Prior to heating, microbial communities showed strong vertical stratification correlated to peat decomposition and humification, while little spatial or temporal variation was observed. Peat samples from after 1 year of heating are now being processed and data will soon be available.",

            "abstract": "The Nankai Trough is a plate convergent boundary where earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 take place repeatedly. Thermal structure in subduction zones affects pore pressure and diagenesis such as consolidation, dewatering and cementation, and constrains physical properties of a fault-slip plane. In the Nankai subduction zone, existence of methane hydrate is confirmed from acoustic reflectors called the Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) which parallel the seafloor on seismic reflection images with high-amplitude and reverse-polarity waveforms. As a depth of BSR is theoretically constrained by subseafloor profiles of temperature and pressure, the BSR depths effectively produce subseafloor geothermal information over a wide area without heat flow probe penetration or in-situ borehole temperature measurement that is fragmentary. In this study, we aim at calculating precise two-dimensional shallow thermal structure. First, we investigate detailed distribution of the BSRs in the Nankai area ranging from offshore Tokai to Hyuga using two-dimensional multi-channel seismic reflection data. The BSR depths are then forwarded to estimate heat flow values. Second, we use a simple two-dimensional thermal modeling of Blackwell et al. [1980] that takes into account topographical effects of the seafloor roughness. We also employ additional boundary conditions constrained by seafloor temperature and the heat flow estimated from BSR depths. In order to confirm reliability of the modeled thermal structure, we additionally estimate the base of gas hydrate stability zone which is proved to almost equal to observational BSR depths. We find in the modeled thermal structure that the convex portions that are subject to cooling by cold bottom water, while depressions are less subject to the cooling from observational BSRs and theoretical calculation. The thermal structure gained here provides essential data for seismic simulations in subduction zones and for laboratory experiments as analogues to seismic ruptures along plate boundary faults.",

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of Abrupt Climate Change (ACC) became evident as paleoclimate data analyses began revealing that Earth’s climate has the ability to rapidly switch from one state to the next in just a few decades after thresholds are crossed. Previously paleo-climatologists thought these switches were gradual but now there is growing concern to identify thresholds and the dominant feedback mechanisms that propel systems toward thresholds. Current human civilization relies heavily on climate stability and ACC threatens immense disruption with potentially disastrous consequences for all ecosystems. Therefore, prediction of the climate system’s approach to threshold values would prove vital for the resilience of civilization through development of appropriate adaptation strategies when that shift occurs. Numerous studies now establish that earth systems are experiencing dramatic changes both by system interactions and anthropogenic sources adding urgency for comprehensive knowledge of tipping point identification. Despite this, predictions are difficult due to the immensity of interactions among feedback mechanisms. In this paper, we attempt to narrow this broad spectrum of critical feedback mechanisms by reviewing several publications on role of feedbacks in initiating past climate transitions establishing the most critical ones and significance in current climate changes. Using a compilation of paleoclimate datasets we compared the rates of deglaciations with that of glacial inceptions, which are approximately 5-10 times slower. We hypothesize that the critical feedbacks are unique to each type of transition such that warmings are dominated by the ice-albedo feedback while coolings are a combination of temperature – CO2 and temperature-precipitation followed by the ice-albedo feedbacks. Additionally, we propose the existence of a commonality in the dominant trigger feedbacks for astronomical and millennial timescale abrupt climate shifts and as such future studies should consider the mechanisms of both.\nKey words: Abrupt Climate Change, thresholds, critical feedback mechanisms",

            "abstract": "Geological estimates of subsidence from past earthquakes help to constrain Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) earthquake rupture models. To improve subsidence estimates for past earthquakes along the southern CSZ, we apply transfer function analysis on microfossils from 3 intertidal marshes in northern Humboldt Bay, California, ~60 km north of the Mendocino Triple Junction. The transfer function method uses elevation-dependent intertidal foraminiferal and diatom assemblages to reconstruct relative sea-level (RSL) change indicated by shifts in microfossil assemblages. We interpret stratigraphic evidence associated with sudden shifts in microfossils to reflect sudden RSL rise due to subsidence during past CSZ earthquakes. Laterally extensive (>5 km) and sharp mud-over-peat contacts beneath marshes at Jacoby Creek, Mad River Slough, and McDaniel Slough demonstrate widespread earthquake subsidence in northern Humboldt Bay. C-14 ages of plant macrofossils taken from above and below three contacts that correlate across all three sites, provide estimates of the times of subsidence at ~250 yr BP, ~1300 yr BP and ~1700 yr BP. Two further contacts observed at only two sites provide evidence for subsidence during possible CSZ earthquakes at ~900 yr BP and ~1100 yr BP. Our study contributes 20 AMS radiocarbon ages, of identifiable plant macrofossils, that improve estimates of the timing of past earthquakes along the southern CSZ. We anticipate that our results will provide more accurate and precise reconstructions of RSL change induced by southern CSZ earthquakes. Prior to our work, studies in northern Humboldt Bay provided subsidence estimates with vertical uncertainties >±0.5 m; too imprecise to adequately constrain earthquake rupture models. Our method, applied recently in coastal Oregon, has shown that subsidence during past CSZ earthquakes can be reconstructed with a precision of ±0.3m and substantially improves constraints on rupture models used for seismic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "Nares Strait, which forms one of the main connections between the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay was blocked by coalescent Innuitian and Greenland ice sheets during the LGM. Nares Strait opened ca. 9000 cal ka BP when the connection between the two ice sheets was finally severed. Our research focuses on the events and processes leading up to the opening of the strait and the response of the glacier and marine systems to establishment of the throughflow. The study at present involves new analysis of two sediment cores: 2001LSSL-163PC from Smith Sound, at the southern end of Nares Strait, and 2001LSSL-079PC from the mouth of Petermann Fjord at the northern end of the strait. X-radiography and core photographs were studied to establish basic lithofacies and stratigraphy. Foraminiferal faunas provide insight into changes in ice margin proximity, Atlantic Water advection and sea-ice conditions and are used to develop the radiocarbon chronologies. Quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk sediments aids in determining sediment provenance and the establishment of a north to south connection. Grain size analysis allows sediment processes and sedimentary environments, such as iceberg rafting, current deposition, and sub ice-shelf deposition to be evaluated. A radiocarbon date of >50 kyr was obtained from foraminifera in an overconsolidated, gray diamicton in core 163PC. The diamicton is overlain by a red deglacial sequence of barren laminated sediments followed by gray pebbly mud. Two radiocarbon dates submitted from near the base of the pebbly mud constrain the timing of ice retreat from Smith Sound. The chronology of core 079PC indicates that it captures the opening of Nares Strait, but 4 submitted radiocarbon dates will further constrain its chronology. The goal of the work on these two cores is to lay a framework for extensive marine fieldwork to study ice sheet-ocean interactions in the Petermann Glacier in late summer 2015.",

            "abstract": "In order to support scientific discoveries in Heliophysics (HP), with modern data systems, the HP Data Centers actively pursue harmonization of available metadata that allows crossing boundaries between existing data models, conventions, and resource interfaces. The discoverability of HP observations is improved when associated metadata describes their physical content in agreed terms as a part of the resource registration. One of the great challenges of enabling such content-targeted data search capability is the harmonization of domain ontology across data providers. Ontologies are the cornerstones of the content-aware data systems: they define an agreed vocabulary of keywords that capture the essence of domain-specific concepts and their relationships. With the introduction of the Virtual Wave Observatory (VWO), as part of NASA’s Virtual System Observatory in 2008, the task of formulating the HP ontology became yet more complicated. Definitions of the wave domain concepts required several layers of specifications that described the generation, propagation, and interaction of the waves with the underlying medium in addition to the observation itself. Simple keyword lists could not provide a sufficiently information-rich description, given the complexity of the wave domain, and the development of a more powerful schema was required. The ontology research at the VWO eventually resulted in a suitable multi-hierarchical design that found its first implementation in 2015 at one of the European space physics data repositories, the near-Earth Space Data Infrastructure for e-Science (ESPAS). Similar to many other European geoscience projects, ESPAS is based on the ISO 19156 Observation and Measurements standard. In cooperation with the NASA VWO, the ESPAS project has deployed a space physics ontology design for all data registration purposes. The VWO science team is now uniquely positioned to establish a crosswalk between the ESPAS ontology based on ISO 19156 and the VWO ontology based on the SPASE data model. The crosswalk both maps the individual vocabulary terms and accommodates the underlying differences in the structural model elements that are part of both standards. We will review practical questions of harmonizing SPASE and ISO solutions specific to the HP domain ontology.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to determine the changes on soil traits, forest structure and species richness and composition of multiple groups of organisms along secondary succession in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in southeastern Brazil. We defined three successional stages based in forest vertical and horizontal structure and age: early (18-25 years), intermediate (50-60 years) and late (no records of clearing). Five plots of 50 x 20 m were established per stage, and the following groups were sampled using specific techniques: rhizobacteria, mycorrhiza, trees and lianas, butterflies, ants, dung beetles, mosquitoes (Culicidae), birds and bats. We also determined soil chemical and physical characteristics and forest structure (tree height, density and basal area). Soil fertility increased along the successional gradient, and the same pattern was observed for all the forest structure variables. However, species richness and composition showed mixed results depending on the organism group. Three groups usually considered as good bioindicators of habitat quality did not differ in species richness and composition between stages: butterflies, ants and dung beetles. On the other hand, rizhobacteria and mycorrhiza differed both in species richness and composition between stages and may be more sensitive to changes in environmental conditions in TDFs. The other five groups differed either in species richness or composition between one or two pairs of successional stages. Although changes in abiotic conditions and forest structure match the predictions of classical successional models, the response of each group of organism is idiosyncratic in terms of diversity and ecological function, as a consequence of specific resource requirements and life-history traits. In general, diversity increased and functional groups changed mostly from early to intermediate-late stages, strengthening the importance of secondary forests to the maintenance of ecosystem integrity of TDFs.",

            "abstract": "The 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 South Napa, California earthquake produced significant offsets on 12 borehole strainmeters in the San Francisco Bay area. These strainmeters are located between 24 and 80 km from the source and the observed offsets ranged up to 400 parts-per-billion (ppb), which exceeds their nominal precision by a factor of 100. However, the observed offsets in tidally-calibrated strains have RMS deviation of 130 ppb from strains predicted by previously published moment tensor derived from seismic data. Here, I show that the large misfit can be reduced by a combination of better tidal calibration and better modeling of the strain field from the earthquake. Borehole strainmeters require in-situ calibration, which historically has been accomplished by comparing their measurements of Earth tides with the strain-tides predicted by a model. Although borehole strainmeters accurately measure the deformation within the borehole, the long-wavelength strain signals from tides or other tectonic processes recorded in the borehole are modified by the presence of the borehole and the elastic properties of the grout and the instrument. Previous analyses of surface-mounted, strainmeter data and their relationship with the predicted tides suggest that tidal models could be in error by 30%. The poor fit of the borehole strainmeter data from this earthquake can be improved by simultaneously varying the components of the model tides up to 30% and making small adjustments to the point-source model of the earthquake, which reduces the RMS misfit from 130 to 18 ppb. This suggests that calibrations derived solely from tidal models limits the accuracy of borehole strainmeters. On the other hand, the revised calibration derived here becomes testable on strain measurements from future, large Bay area events.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well logging data can provide direct information about subsurface water content. While NMR water content estimates are known to be accurate in low magnetic susceptibility materials, it has often been assumed that NMR measurements cannot be used in high magnetic susceptibility materials due to internal magnetic field inhomogeneities that arise due to magnetic susceptibility contrasts in the material. In this study we compare the NMR estimated water content using laboratory measurements made at two low magnetic field strengths (with Larmor frequencies of 275 kHz and 2 MHz) on both synthetic and natural unconsolidated sediments with a range of magnetic susceptibility values.\nNMR measurements were collected on seven water-saturated materials with magnetic susceptibility values spanning three orders of magnitude (3.6x10-6 SI to 7.0 x10-3 SI). T2 relaxation time data was collected with echo times, tE, ranging from 200 to 3000 μs. The results show that for the materials with low magnetic susceptibilities (< 5x10-4 SI), the total water content was accurately estimated at both field strengths. For the materials with high magnetic susceptibilities (> 5x10-4 SI) the water content was more accurately estimated using the data collected at 275 kHz (> 80% detected at tE = 400 μs) than the data collected at 2 MHz (< 40% detected at tE = 400 μs). Furthermore, the 275 kHz data showed water content underestimation errors increased only slightly with increased tE, compared to substantial increases in errors for the 2 MHz data as tE was increased. This finding suggests that there is an advantage for collecting measurements at lower field strengths even for long tE. We explain the differences in the water content estimates at the two field strengths by considering the shape of the echoes and the coil and pulse bandwidths, and find excellent agreement with the range of collected NMR data.",

            "abstract": "Global predictability of intraseasonal tropical storm (TS) activity is assessed using the 1999-2012 CFSv2 45-day hindcast suite and real-time predictions for 2014-2015. Weekly TS activities in the CFSv2 45-day forecasts were determined using the TS detection and tracking method devised by Carmago and Zebiak (2002). The forecast periods are divided into weekly intervals for Week 1 through Week 4. The TS activities in those intervals are compared to the observed activities based on the NHC HURDAT and JTWC Best Track datasets.\nThe CFSv2 45-day hindcast suite is made of forecast runs initialized at 00, 06, 12 and 18Z every day during the 1999 – 2012 period. For predictability evaluation, forecast TS activities are analyzed based on 20-member ensemble forecasts comprised of 45-day runs made during the most recent 5 days prior to the verification period. The forecast TS activities are evaluated in terms of the number of storms, genesis locations and storm tracks during the weekly periods. The CFSv2 forecasts are shown to have a fair level of skill in predicting the anomalous number of storms over most of the seven ocean basins during the 1999-2012 active seasons. The average temporal correlation score for Week 1 forecasts is between 0.50-0.52 in the Eastern and Western North Pacific, the South Indian and South Pacific basins, while correlations drop to around 0.20 for Week 4 forecasts. The forecast track is also examined using density distribution maps and false alarm statistics compiled using the hindcast analyses with Heidke Skill Scores peaking at around 0.35.\nReal-time weekly TS activity predictions began in December 2013 using the climatological TS forecast statistics to make the model bias corrections in terms of the storm counts, track distribution and removal of false alarm storms. This operational implementation provides an objective tool for the CPC’s Global Tropical Hazards Outlooks. Verification and evaluation of the 2014 and 2015 seasons will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Across the Himalaya, mid- to lower-crustal Greater-Himalayan (GH) rocks have been exhumed during active continent-continent collision. In the eastern Himalaya within Bhutan, GH rocks are divided into an upper and lower level by an intra-GH shear zone, the Kakthang thrust (KT). To decipher the metamorphic, melt-crystallization and exhumation history of the GH rocks exposed above and below the KT, monazite from metapelites and migmatites was dated and trace elements were analyzed by laser-ablation, split-stream ICPMS. The trace elements from the monazite were used to track when the rocks were at near-peak conditions (based on the depletion of HREE and the likely presence of garnet during monazite growth) versus likely undergoing initial exhumation and garnet breakdown (based on an increase in HREE). Samples were collected from two N–S transects that cross the KT in central and eastern Bhutan. The eastern transect reveals a progressive younging of near-peak metamorphism within the GH, with dates of ca. 23–20 Ma for the structurally-highest sample versus ca. 18–16 Ma in the structurally-lowest sample. The youngest dates from all structural levels of the eastern Bhutan metapelites are 13–15 Ma; the same analyses yield higher HREE abundances, suggesting garnet breakdown during their (re)crystallization. The migmatites yield ca. 14–16 Ma melt-crystallization ages, consistent with the GH having undergone cooling and initial exhumation to cause garnet breakdown by ca. 15 Ma. In comparison, the central Bhutan transect reveals older near-peak metamorphic ages, with garnet-stable monazite populations at ca. 48­–46 Ma within the KT zone, ca. 38–30 Ma for rocks in the middle of the upper-GH, and ca. 25–22 Ma for the structurally-highest sample. Youngest monazites from the central Bhutan transect that yield growth or recrystallization at garnet-unstable conditions range from ca. 17–26 Ma. These results suggest earlier metamorphism and exhumation of GH rocks in central Bhutan compared to those to the east and west. Thus, significant along-strike differences in the burial and exhumation history need to be considered when evaluating models for the tectonic evolution of the GH as a whole.",

The nation’s freshwater resources vulnerability is further exacerbated by consecutive drought events during the past two decades. The intensity and frequency of drought occurrence in this region is expected to increase in the future, thus putting additional stress on the existing freshwater resources. To understand the ramifications of future drought conditions, it is important to distinguish among different types of droughts. In this study, we investigate three different drought types in Jordan: meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural. We use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a hydrological model to simulate the catchment response to these different types of drought. The magnitude, spatial patterns, and temporal variability of these droughts are analyzed to understand the impact on water resources availability for municipal and agricultural use in Jordan. An important component of this study is the association between crop yield and drought magnitude. This association can be used as a tool to project future crop yields, thus enabling water planners to effectively allocate future available freshwater between the urban and agricultural sectors.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation and attendant floods annually result in ~80 fatalities and ~$5 Billion in damages across the U.S. and account for ~50% of annual average U.S. natural disaster losses. The mechanisms that produce extreme precipitation are well known and are relatively well simulated by modern numerical weather prediction models in conjunction with synoptic-scale and mesoscale lift, instability, moisture, and boundaries. The focus of this presentation is on moisture in the form of synoptic-scale water vapor transport and its role in extreme precipitation along the U.S. West Coast.\nMany different terms have been used to describe synoptic-scale water vapor transport over the Northeast Pacific, including: moisture conveyor belts, warm conveyor belts, tropical moisture exports, tropical plumes, moisture plumes, pineapple express events, and atmospheric rivers. Each term respectively attempts to quantify or represent the propagation or instantaneous movement of water vapor from the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks in which they exist. These differences in frameworks often makes comparing and contrasting, for example, warm conveyor belts and atmospheric rivers difficult and may lead to misguided interpretations of long-range trans-oceanic water vapor transport.\nThe purpose of this presentation is to discuss the dynamics of water vapor transport over the Northeast Pacific from the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks and illustrate to what degree the two- and three-dimensional structures of these rivers, exports, and belts overlap. Illustration of overlap between these processes will be shown via case study analysis of synoptic-scale water vapor transport over the Northeast Pacific that led to heavy precipitation along the U.S. West Coast during February 2014 and February 2015.",

            "abstract": "Observational and numerical modeling results demonstrate that solar wind streams and coronal mass ejections drive coherent processes within the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The magnetosphere progresses through a specific sequence of energy-loading and stress-developing states until the entire system suddenly reconfigures. Long-term studies of high-energy particle fluxes in the Earth’s magnetosphere have revealed many of their temporal occurrence characteristics and their relationships to solar wind drivers. In order to observe major energetic particle enhancements, there must typically be a significant interval of southward IMF along with a period of high (VSW≥500 km/s) solar wind speed. This has led to the view that enhancements in geomagnetic activity are normally a key first step in the acceleration of magnetospheric particles to high energies. A second step is suggested to be a period of powerful low-frequency waves that is closely related to high values of VSW or higher frequency (“chorus”) waves that rapidly heat and accelerate electrons. Hence, magnetospheric storms and substorms provide a “seed” population, while high-speed solar wind drives the acceleration to relativistic energies in this two-step geomagnetic activity scenario. This picture seems to apply to most events examined whether associated with high-speed streams or with CME-related changes, but not all. In this work, we address transient solar wind phenomena as they pertain to high-energy particle acceleration and transport. We also discuss various models of particle energization that have recently been advanced. We present remarkable new results from the Van Allen Probes mission and the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission that confirm and greatly extend these key ideas.",

            "abstract": "X-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) has been used to determine phonon dispersion relation of solids since 1940s (Wehinger et al. 2013; Ding et al. 2006; Xu and Chiang 2005). However, its application in high-pressure mineral physics has not been widely recognized. Sound velocities of Earth materials at relevant high pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions are essential for interpreting seismic data, which provides by now the most accurate image of the Earth interior. Comparing with other commonly used techniques for measuring sound velocities in the high-pressure mineral physics community, it has significant advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, it could be used for measuring any single crystals at extreme P-T conditions using diamond anvil cell (DAC), not limited to transparent samples or nuclear resonant isotopes; Secondly, single-crystal elastic constants could be obtained through TDS, and hence directional dependences of sound velocities are available; Finally, experimental setup for TDS measurement is very easy, essentially identical to what is used for routine high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. However, TDS is much less straightforward in data interpretation, which usually involves micro force constant modeling between the nearest neighbor atoms. We developed dependable data collection procedures for TDS measurement under high-pressure conditions. Measurements with single-crystal Si and foresterite under ambient and high-pressure conditions are successful. Using the python code package we developed for analyzing TDS data, we successfully reproduced the previously determined single-crystal elastic moduli of Si and foresterite using Brillouin spectroscopy and ultrasonics. The experimental uncertainty of the single crystal elastic moduli determined from TDS approach is within 4% or better.",

Therefore, any vacillations in the jet stream can alter weather regimes regionally and hemispherically. The most active period for the NH polar jet stream is during boreal winter, when the jet is at its seasonal maximum because of the steepened meridional temperature gradient. Forecasting the position and strength of the jet stream is critical for accurate temperature and precipitation forecasts for the high to middle latitudes.\nOne major mode that describes the movements of the jet stream is the North Atlantic Oscillation or Arctic Oscillation (N/AO). Short-term and seasonal weather forecasters alike seek methods and mechanisms to extend predictability of an otherwise internal mode of variability in order to better prepare society for significant changes in precipitation and temperature during the winter. These changes may include short-lived but high-impact extreme weather events (e.g., cold air outbreaks, snowstorms) or season-long anomalies that can affect society for subsequent seasons (e.g., floods and droughts). Both snow cover and sea ice have been proposed as potentially modifying the N/AO model of variability. I will present some recent observational and modeling results on the hemispheric atmospheric response to snow cover and sea ice variability and the potential predictive skill of these high latitude boundary forcings. The expectation is that by the end of 2015 one of the strongest El Niño’s in the observational record will be in full swing. Therefore I will also present some observational and modeling results on the possible influence of ENSO on extratropical climate variability for comparison with results from snow cover and sea ice.",

            "abstract": "Titan’s atmosphere is opaque in the near infrared due to gaseous absorptions, mainly by methane, and scattering by aerosols, except in a few “transparency windows” (e.g., Sotin et al., 2005). Thus, the composition of Titan surface remains difficult to access from space and is still poorly constrained, limited to ethane in the polar lakes (Brown et al., 2008) and a few possible organic molecules on the surface (Clark et al., 2010). Photochemical models suggest that most of the organic compounds formed in the atmosphere are heavy enough to condense and build up at the surface in liquid and solid states over geological timescale (Cordier et al., 2009, 2011). Acetylene (C2H2) is one of the most abundant organic molecules in the atmosphere and thus thought to present on the surface as well. Here we report direct evidence of solid C2H2 on Titan’s surface using Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data. By comparing VIMS observations and laboratory measurements of solid and liquid C2H2, we identify a specific absorption at 1.55 µm that is widespread over Titan but is particularly strong in the brightest terrains. This surface variability suggests that C2H2 is mobilized by surface processes, such as surface weathering, topography, and dissolution/evaporation. The detection of C2H2 on the surface of Titan opens new paths to understand and constrain Titan’s surface activity. Since C2H2 is highly soluble in Titan liquids (Singh et al. 2015), it can easily dissolve in methane/ethane and may play an important role in carving of fluvial channels and existence of karstic lakes at higher latitudes on Titan. These processes imply the existence of a dynamic surface with a continued history of erosion and deposition of C2H2 on Titan.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating sequences of land surface temperature (LST) observations into a variational data assimilation (VDA) framework has been the subject of numerous studies. The VDA approaches are focused on the estimation of two key parameters that regulate the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes. These two unknown parameters are neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (CHN) (that scales the sum of the turbulent heat fluxes) and evaporative fraction (EF) (that scales partitioning between the turbulent heat fluxes). CHN mainly depends on the roughness of the surface and varies on the time scales of changing vegetation phenology. The existing VDA methods assumed that the variations in vegetation phenology over the period of one month are negligible and took CHN as a monthly constant parameter. However, during the growing season, bare soil may turn into a fully vegetated surface within a few weeks. Thus, assuming a constant CHN value may result in a significant amount of error in the estimation of surface fluxes, especially in regions with a high temporal variation in vegetation cover. In this study, we advance the VDA approach by taking CHN as a function of leaf area index (LAI), which allows us to characterize the dynamic effect of vegetation phenology on CHN. The performance of the new VDA model is tested over four field sites, namely Brookings, Audubon, and Bondville in the US and Daman in China. The results show that the new model outperforms the previous one and decreases the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) in sensible and latent heat flux estimates across the four sites on average by 31% and 19% respectively.",

            "abstract": "Most terrestrial soils exhibit a patchwork of oxygen (O2) availability that varies over spatial scales of microsites to catenas to landscapes, and over temporal scales of minutes to seasons. Oxygen fluctuations often drive microbial iron (Fe) reduction and abiotic/biotic Fe oxidation at the microsite scale, contributing to anaerobic carbon (C) mineralization and changes in soil physical and chemical characteristics, especially the dissolution and precipitation of short-range ordered Fe phases thought to stabilize C. Thus, O2 fluctuations and Fe redox cycling may have multiple nuanced and opposing impacts on different soil C pools, illustrated by recent findings from Fe-rich Oxisols and Ultisols in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico.\nSpatial patterns in surface soil C stocks at the landscape scale correlated strongly (R2 = 0.98) with concentrations of reduced Fe (Fe(II)), reflecting constitutive differences in reducing conditions within and among sites that promote C accumulation in mineral soil horizons. Similarly, turnover times of a decadal-cycling pool of mineral-associated organic matter increased with Fe(II) across a catena, possibly reflecting the role of anaerobic microsites in long-term C stabilization. However, two different indices of short-range order Fe showed highly significant opposing relationships (positive and negative) with spatial variation in soil C concentrations, possibly reflecting a dual role of Fe in driving C stabilization via co-precipitation, and C solubilization and loss following dissimilatory Fe reduction. Consistent with the field data, laboratory incubations demonstrated that redox fluctuations can increase the contribution of biochemically recalcitrant C (lignin) to soil respiration, whereas addition of short-range order Fe dramatically suppressed lignin mineralization but had no impact on bulk soil respiration. Thus, understanding spatial and temporal patterns of Fe redox cycling may provide insight into explaining the relatively rapid turnover of biochemically recalcitrant and mineral-associated C in soils.",

This conclusion is supported by V1 measurements of the magnetic field direction (which remained essentially unchanged) and decreasing solar wind flow speed. Here we show that only the Fisk & Gloeckler (F&G) model for the nose region of the heliosheath can explain the lowest energy portion of the Energetic Neutral Hydrogen (ENH) differential intensity spectra observed by IBEX in the look directions aimed at V1 and V2, respectively. The F&G model provides the simplest explanation for the intensity and spectral shape of 0.006 to 4 keV ENH whose source is not only heliosheath pickup protons but, most importantly, the compressed solar wind which creates nearly all of the < ~0.5 keV ENH. IBEX ENH spectra provide crucial information on the evolution with radial distance of distribution functions of solar wind, pickup and suprathermal tail protons, allowing us to compute radial profiles of the density and pressure of each of these particle populations. Furthermore, low-energy ENH measurements require the uncoupling of the two heliospheric gases (solar wind and the mobile pickup, tails and ACRs protons) of the F&G model, and allow us to compute the radial and speed dependence of the uncoupling and escape probability functions for mobile particles.",

The former species is treated as a major species due to its large abundance near the upper boundary. The effects of exospheric transport are also included in order to simulate realistic seasonal and latitudinal helium distributions. The latter species is treated as a classical minor species, imparting absolutely no forces on the background atmosphere. In this study, we examine the interplay of the various dynamical terms – i.e. background circulation, molecular and Eddy diffusion – as they drive departures from the distributions that would be expected under assumptions of diffusive equilibrium. As this has implications on the formulation of all semi-empirical thermospheric models, we use this understanding to identify the conditions under which helium can significantly affect nowcasts and forecasts of neutral density.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s electron radiation belts consist of toroidal zones in near-Earth space characterized by intense levels of relativistic electrons with distinct energy-dependent boundaries. It has been known for decades that the outer electron radiation belt is highly variable, with electron intensities varying by orders of magnitude on timescales ranging from minutes to years. Now, we are gaining much insight into the nature of this extreme variability thanks to the unprecedented number of observatories capable of measuring radiation belt electrons, the most recent of which is NASA’s Van Allen Probes mission. In this presentation, we analyze and review several of the most extreme events observed in Earth’s outer radiation belt. We begin with very sudden and strong enhancements of the outer radiation belt that can result in several orders of magnitude enhancements of electron intensities up to several MeV that sometimes occur in less than one day. We compare and contrast two of the most extreme cases of sudden and strong enhancements from the Van Allen Probes era, 08-09 October 2012 and 17-18 March 2015, and review evidence of the dominant acceleration mechanism in each event. Sudden enhancements of the radiation belts can also occur from injections by interplanetary shocks impacting the magnetosphere, such as occurred on 24 March 1991. We compare shock characteristics from previous injection events to those from the Van Allen Probes era to investigate why none of the interplanetary shocks since September 2012 have caused MeV electron injections into the slot region and inner radiation belt, which has surprisingly been devoid of measurable quantities of >~1 MeV electrons throughout the Van Allen Probes era. Our last topic concerns loss processes. We discuss drastic loss events, known as “flux dropouts”, and present evidence that these loss events can eliminate the vast majority of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt on time scales of only a few hours. We finish with cases of prolonged outer belt depletions, such as occurred throughout most of 2009 and in September 2014, and discuss how these can result from flux dropout events combined with a subsequent lack of any source of new relativistic electrons.",

            "abstract": "Gravel-capped strath terraces are preserved along the western High Plains, adjacent to the Colorado Front Range. Terrace elevations appear to connect across the landscape, representing previous levels of the Denver Basin during fluvial exhumation. In this tectonically quiescent region, climatically-driven fluctuations in sediment supply are often interpreted to drive terrace occupation and basin exhumation.\nWe dated a series of strath terraces near Boulder, CO using 10Be/26Al cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs) and optically stimulated luminescence. Results reveal: (1) a long history of fluvial occupation (0.5-1.0 Myr duration), with recent (<120 ka) fluvial abandonment of the highest surface; (2) a brief occupation of a narrow spillway, abandoned at 97.0 ± 4.2 ka, preserved because the stream was subsequently pirated; and (3) a long period of fluvial occupation of a lower terrace, recorded by the deposition of distinct gravel packages at 50-75 ka and 40.5 ± 5.0 ka.\nIn conjunction with absolute dating on nearby terraces, our study indicates the system is more complex than originally thought. Ages are not consistent among terraces of similar elevations deposited by different stream systems. The link between terrace age and climate is not straightforward, as terraces can be occupied through several glacial-interglacial cycles. When a surface is abandoned, incision to the next level appears to occur quite rapidly through the soft Cretaceous shales. Long-term incision rates may be derived from elevations and ages of high preserved surfaces, but such incision rates reflect long periods of no vertical erosion punctuated with short periods of rapid incision. Such interpretations would not be possible without paired CRNs or combination with other geochronologic techniques. This study therefore represents a cautionary tale for the interpretation of tectonic or climatic processes and process rates from single-method dating of fluvial terraces.",

            "abstract": "By providing an unprecedented level of reliability in particle flux observations at low L-shells, NASA’s Van Allen Probes mission has yielded a series of discoveries and unanswered questions concerning the inner electron radiation belt. Two such discoveries are: 1) a sharp cutoff in the energy distribution of electrons at ~900 keV, such that fluxes of electrons with energies greater than ~900 keV are below the detectability threshold of the Van Allen Probes’ MagEIS instruments and consistent with upper flux limits of multi-MeV electrons calculated using the Van Allen Probes’ REPT instruments, and 2) that impulsive injections of up to several hundred keV electrons may act as an activity-dependent source of electrons in the slot and inner radiation belt. In this presentation, we discuss results from phase space density (PSD) analysis of inner zone electrons. Such analysis, which examines PSD as a function of the three adiabatic invariants, effectively removes adiabatic variations in the particle observations allowing one to better identify source and loss processes ongoing in the system. We demonstrate that impulsive injections do indeed act as a source of inner radiation belt electrons and, when combined with losses in the slot region, can result in peaked radial distributions of electron PSD in the inner zone. We briefly discuss the nature of these low-L injections, which penetrate inside the plasmasphere and display strong energy and species dependencies. By examining such injections throughout the Van Allen Probes era, we also i) determine the occurrence rate of injections as a function of electron energy (and first adiabatic invariant), geomagnetic activity level, and L-shell; ii) estimate the contribution of such injections to the inner belt population; and iii) investigate how such injections disrupt coherent banded flux structures in the inner zone known as “zebra stripes”.",

Soil moisture observations from more than 50 stations, all with at least 12 continuous years of data, were used to evaluate model soil moisture at three different depth intervals in the soil column: 0 – 10 cm, 10 – 40 cm, and 40 – 100 cm. In addition, we evaluated the ability of the models to capture the temporal variations of the in situ observations in the context of model architecture and land surface parameterization. We find the similarity of in situ and model soil moisture varies both temporally and spatially, attributed to the representativeness of the point soil moisture observation compared to the model grid cell. In general, our results suggest the three components of the NLDAS-2 project can accurately simulate soil moisture seasonal variation, but do show systematic wet and dry bias at several stations across the contiguous United States.",

We identify intervals when the current oval and hence the PCB moved equatorward for extended periods lasting at least 75 minutes and we term these intervals sustained dayside reconnection events (SDRE). We find 1059 SDREs between 2010 and 2012 and go on to study the dynamics of the total electron content (TEC) in the high-latitude region in a superposed epoch sense. Immediately after the beginning of a SDRE a plasma density increase forms at the poleward edge of the PCB and its edge moves from the location of the dayside PCB anti-sunward at speeds of about 500 m/s, consistent with ionospheric convection measurements. Our results show that the TEC inside the polar cap locally increases by up to 20\\%. Averaged over the entire polar region poleward of 55 degrees magnetic latitude, however, we find no significant increase in the TEC, indicating that local increases and decreases are formed by transport and rearrangement of existing plasma rather than by impact ionization due to particle precipitation. We also observe a latitudinally narrow region between the TEC increases equatorward and poleward of the dayside PCB in which the TEC stagnates. This stagnation trough may be due to local flow channels associated with bursty dayside reconnection.",

            "abstract": "When it comes to building durable capacity for implementing state of the art technology and earth observation (EO) data for improved decision making, it has been long recognized that a unidirectional approach (from research to application) often does not work. Co-design of capacity building effort has recently been recommended as a better alternative. This approach is a two-way street where scientists and stakeholders engage intimately along the entire chain of actions from design of research experiments to packaging of decision making tools and each party provides an equal amount of input. Scientists execute research experiments based on boundary conditions and outputs that are defined as tangible by stakeholders for decision making. On the other hand, decision making tools are packaged by stakeholders with scientists ensuring the application-specific science is relevant. In this talk, we will overview one such iterative capacity building approach that we have implemented for gravimetry-based satellite (GRACE) EO data for improved groundwater management in Pakistan. We call our approach a hybrid approach where the initial step is a forward model involving a conventional short-term (3 day) capacity building workshop in the stakeholder environment addressing a very large audience. In this forward model, the net is cast wide to ‘shortlist’ a set of highly motivated stakeholder agency staffs who are then engaged more directly in 1-1 training. In the next step (the backward model), these short listed staffs are then brought back in the research environment of the scientists (supply) for 1-1 and long-term (6 months) intense brainstorming, training, and design of decision making tools. The advantage of this backward model is that it allows for a much better understanding for scientists of the ground conditions and hurdles of making a EO-based scientific innovation work for a specific decision making problem that is otherwise fundamentally impossible in conventional training workshops. We demonstrate here our experience of implementing this hybrid model for capacity building for groundwater management for Pakistan Council for Research on Water Resources (PCRWR) with the ultimate goal of empowering naitonal agencies in their ability to monitor groundwater storage changes independently from satellites.",

This large-amplitude ULF (ultra low frequency) wave was observed in-situ, using both magnetic and electric field data, by the Van Allen Probe B spacecraft. At the same time, Van Allen Probe B observed higher frequency broadband wave power in conjunction with, and modulated by, this ULF wave. A detailed analysis reveals that these broadband waves are kinetic Alfvén waves, possibly generated by large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations coupling to smaller scales. This event suggests that magnetospheric compression by interplanetary shocks can induce abrupt generation of kinetic Alfvén waves over large portions of the inner magnetosphere, potentially resulting in prompt ion heating throughout the inner magnetosphere.",

Using the Cluster observations in 2003, electromagnetic energy conversion at the DFs is investigated by case and statistical studies. The case study indicates strongest energy conversion at the DF. The statistical study shows the similar features that the energy of the fields can be significantly transferred to the plasmas (load, J∙E>0) at the DFs. These results are consistent with some recent simulations. Examining the electromagnetic fluctuations at the DFs, we suggest that the wave activities around the lower hybrid frequency may play an important role in the energy dissipation.",

            "abstract": "We use current density data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) to identify the location of maximum region 1 current at all magnetic local times. We term this location the R1 oval. Comparing the R1 oval location with particle precipitation boundaries identified in DMSP data, we find that the R1 oval is located on average within 1\n∘\nof particle signatures associated with the open/closed field line boundary (OCB) across dayside and nightside MLTs. We hence conclude that the R1 oval can be used as a proxy for the location of the OCB. Studying the amount of magnetic flux enclosed by the R1 oval during the substorm cycle, we find that the R1 oval flux is well organized by it: during the growth phase the R1 oval location moves equatorward as the amount of magnetic flux increases whereas after substorm expansion phase onset significant flux closure occurs as the R1 current location retreats to higher latitudes. For about 15 minutes after expansion phase onset the amount of open magnetic flux continues to increase indicating that dayside reconnection dominates over nightside reconnection. In the current density data we find evidence of the substorm current wedge and also show that the dayside R1 currents are stronger than their nightside counterpart during the substorm growth phase whereas after expansion phase onset the nightside R1 currents dominate. Our observations of the current distribution and OCB movement during the substorm cycle are in excellent agreement with the expanding/contracting polar cap paradigm.",

            "abstract": "The Bakken shale formation in North Dakota is a prolific source of oil and natural gas, producing 361 million barrels of oil in 2014. Drilling activities in the Bakken largely focus on oil, though co-production of natural gas is abundant. Up to 1/3 of the natural gas produced in this play is not captured, but is instead flared. The US EPA considers flare combustion efficiency to be 98%, indicating fugitive emissions of 2% of flared natural gas due to incomplete combustion. Studies of flaring combustion efficiency have been primarily laboratory-based, with minimal real-world analysis in the field. A recent study [Caulton et al., 2014] analyzed ten flares in the Bakken and found extremely high combustion efficiency of over 99.8%.\nDifferences between this field study and the EPA standard have potentially significant implications for methane emissions from flaring, but given the small sample size, further in-field sampling is needed to quantify combustion efficiency in real conditions and assess why it may be different from laboratory studies.\nHere we will present a study on flaring combustion efficiency of methane and ethane in the Bakken field using continuous in-situ airborne observations of methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide. Over thirty flare plumes were observed during a three-week period in the Bakken formation in May 2014 in a range of wind conditions. For each flare we calculate the destruction efficiency and emission factors for methane and ethane. Preliminary results suggest combustion efficiency comparable with the EPA value of 98%, notably lower than the previous study. In addition, we calculate the corresponding mass flux of methane from incomplete flare combustion for the entire field using gas flare volume information and compare to the total emissions from the field calculated using our flight data and a mass-balance approach. Using the combustion efficiency from our study suggests methane emissions from incomplete combustion during flaring could be responsible for almost 10% of the total field emissions, contrasted with <1% if the Caulton numbers are used.",

            "abstract": "The unconventional extraction of shale oil or gas is typically carried out by the subsurface injection of large volumes of fluids. The fluids are used in the process of hydraulic fracturing and subsequent wastewater injection into high volume disposal wells. These operations are usually accompanied by various levels of seismic activity and sometimes result in the occurrence of moderate to large earthquakes. It is suggested that the increase in seismic activity within the central U.S. in the last decade or so is primely associated with large-scale disposal of wastewater. The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) is an active exploration area for the extraction of oil and gas. The average rate of seismicity is lower than in the central U.S., however, there are several active clusters, where in the last 8-10 years, there has been an increase in the occurrence of moderate earthquakes. In this study, we analyze the statistical properties of seismicity associated with the WCSB. We find that the increase in seismicity rate is mostly associated with the hydraulic fracturing operations in several well defined spatial zones. Hydraulic fracturing involves high-pressure injections of fluids and is performed in multiple stages. This is done along horizontal wells which are drilled at average depths of 2 to 3 km. The triggering of large earthquakes is mostly due to injection of fluids into nearby tectonic faults which are close to failure. To model the rate of the occurrence of earthquakes we introduce a modified version of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model. The earthquake occurrence rate associated with several prominent clusters is characterized by bursts of activity associated with specifics of hydraulic fracturing operations. The proposed model can be used in the probabilistic assessment and mitigation of the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing.",

            "abstract": "Impact craters are a ubiquitous feature of solid surfaces of celestial objects. Craters are oftentimes used to constrain the past evolution of their host objects, as well as to assess their crustal structures. The Dawn spacecraft, currently in orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, has revealed a surface peppered with impact craters. Two important facts emerge from their global spatial distribution: i) significant longitudinal and latitudinal asymmetries in the crater areal density, ii) and the lack of well-preserved craters larger than 400 km in imaging data. Interestingly, most of the low crater density terrains are found in the vicinity of the three largest, well-preserved impact craters ranging from ~160 to ~290 km in diameter. These low crater areal density terrains expand over a greater distance than observed for large craters on rocky bodies and icy satellites, which typically are confined within one crater radius from the rim. To assess the collisional history of Ceres we developed a Monte Carlo model that tracks the timing, size and number of collisions throughout the history of the solar system. The model shows that Ceres' collisional evolution should have resulted typically in a factor of 10 more craters than observed, with some ~10 craters larger than 400 km expected to have formed over the last 4.5 Gyr ago. While small craters may have reached an equilibrium level, which does not allow then to further increase in number, the lack of evident large craters is a puzzle. A possibility is that the scars of large craters have been obliterated by topography relaxation due to an ice-rich crust. Here we will present an overview of the Ceres' crater spatial distribution and compare it to other siblings (such as the asteroid Vesta), and collisional evolution models. We will also discuss how these results pose important constraints on the internal structure of the dwarf planet in conjunction with surface composition and gravity data acquired by Dawn.",

            "abstract": "This paper is a synthesis of eight studies which demonstrate the interface between disaster risk management (DRM) and adaptation. The studies; conducted from November 2011 to July 2012 included diverse ecosystems from forests, coastlines, rural areas to a lake region and showed that climate change/variability are major factors among other factors such as deforestation and land degradation, unsustainable land use practices, overharvesting of natural products and invasive species encroachment that are causing changes in ecosystems. The most common extreme events reported included shifts in and shorter rainfall seasons, extended droughts, increased temperatures, extreme heat, heavy rainfall, flooding, inundation, strong winds and sea level rises. As a result of these climate phenomena, adverse impacts on ecosystems and communities were reported as biodiversity loss, reduced fish catch, reduced water for forests/agriculture/consumption, increased rough waves, coastal erosion/sediment deposition and lastly land/mud slides in order of commonality. In response to these impacts communities are practicing coping and adaptation strategies but there is a huge gap between proper DRM and adaptation. This is mainly because the adaptation is practiced as an aftermath with very little effort propelled towards proactive DRM or preparedness. In addition, national level policies are archaic and do not address the current environmental changes. This was demonstrated in Togo where wood energy potential is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate but is projected to increase between 6.4% and 101% in the near and far future if the national forest action plans are implemented; preventing an energy crisis in the country. This shows that appropriate legal and policy frameworks and well planned responses to projected extreme events and climate changes are crucial in order to prevent disasters and to achieve sustainable utilisation of resources in the continent.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to alter streamflow and stream temperatures, such as mean values, seasonality and extreme events. These changes could affect human water use and in turn the reliability of power systems, since power generation is heavily water-dependent (either for cooling or for hydropower generation). Most research on future water availability, especially in terms of power system water use, has been conducted in the western U.S., while the southeastern U.S. has been less studied. As part of a larger study to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on power demand and generation in the southeastern U.S., we implemented the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model at 1/8 degree resolution, linked with the RBM water temperature model, in the Tennessee River basin, where intensive thermal- and hydro-power operations are conducted. A simple reservoir component is also incorporated in the modeling framework. The models are evaluated and calibrated against observed hydrologic data and stream temperatures over the historical period 1950-2010. Daily streamflow and stream temperatures are then simulated over the period 1950-2099, forced by climate projections from multiple global climate model (GCM) runs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Our results suggest that the modeling framework produces generally realistic simulations of streamflow and stream temperature, and reservoir operations play an important role in streamflow seasonality in this region. We present results on projected streamflow and stream temperatures in the region, with a specific focus on periods that are likely to stress energy demand and generation.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers in the western Himalaya exhibit significant spatial variations in morphology and dynamics. Climate, topography and debris cover variations are thought to significantly affect glacier fluctuations and glacier sensitivity to climate change, although the role of topography and radiative forcing have not been adequately characterized and related to glacier fluctuations and dynamics. Consequently, we examined the glaciers in the Karakoram Himalaya, as they exhibit high spatial variability in glacier fluctuation rates and ice dynamics including flow velocity and surging. Specifically, we wanted to examine the relationships between these glacier characteristics and temporal patterns of surface irradiance over the ablation season. To accomplish this, we developed and used a rigorous GIS-based solar radiative transfer model that accounts for the direct and diffuse-skylight irradiance components. The model accounts for multiple topographic effects on the magnitude of irradiance reaching glacier surfaces. We specifically used the ASTER GDEM digital elevation model for irradiance simulations. We then examined temporal patterns of irradiance at the grid-cell level to identify the dominant patterns that were used to train a 3-layer artificial neural network. Our results demonstrate that there are unique spatial and temporal patterns associated with downwasting and surging glaciers, and that these patterns partially account for the spatial distribution of advancing and retreating glaciers. Lower-altitude terminus regions of surging glaciers exhibited relatively low surface irradiance values that decreased in magnitude with time, demonstrating that high-velocity surging glaciers facilitate relief production and exhibit steeper surface irradiance gradients with altitude. Collectively, these results demonstrate the important role that local and regional topography play in governing climate-glacier dynamics in the Himalaya.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems can be significantly altered by the construction of dams and modification of riparian buffers. The effects of these changes are often reflected in spatial and temporal changes in water temperature. To investigate the water temperature implications of spatially and temporally varying riparian buffers and dam-induced hydrologic alterations, we have developed a modeling system that couples a spatially distributed land surface hydrologic model (DHSVM) with a distributed stream temperature model (RBM). We have tested the modeling system using stream temperature observations from two river basins in the Connecticut River basin, the Ottauquechee and White rivers. The former is characterized by a flow regime that is affected by storage and releases from a man-made reservoir, while the latter is an unregulated watershed with a natural flow regime. In the Ottauquechee River, we compared model simulations with observed temperatures for six scenarios associated with the removal of riparian vegetation and existing impoundments. For the unregulated White River, we compared model simulations with observed stream temperatures for three scenarios characterizing a range of riparian vegetation conditions. Results from the Ottauquechee River indicated significant impacts to water temperatures due to alterations in flow and modifications of riparian buffers. In the case of the White River, we reached similar conclusions regarding the modification of riparian buffers.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are mostly atmospheric phenomena but they also generate significant ground motions in the solid earth when they become strong. If a dense seismological array exists along the path of a hurricane, we can learn about some processes near the hurricane eye through seismic data.\n In this study, we report our analysis of Hurricane Arthur which passed near Earthscope’s Transportable Array (TA), a network of seismometers located at the time along the east coast of the US. Hurricane Arthur mostly traveled along the eastern coast of the US from July 1 to July 5, 2014; however, it made landfall for a short time on the coast of North Carolina at 0315 UTC on July 4. The next few hours provided us with a short span of seismic and barometric data associated with the center of Hurricane Arthur.\n Our basic approach to analyze this data is the same as in a previous study we conducted of Hurricane Isaac (2012), where we analyzed the seismic amplitude-distance data and the pressure amplitude-distance data for each 6-hour location of the hurricane. Here, we performed a joint inversion of the seismic and barometric data while Hurricane Arthur was nearest the coast. Barometer data provides the information on pressure source, which is the source of seismic-wave excitation and seismic data provides the resultant wavefields. We confine our analysis to frequencies below 0.02 Hz because in higher frequency bands ocean waves created the dominant seismic waves. In a similar manner to our previous study on Hurricane Isaac, we invert for the pressure correlation length. The results were consistent with what was seen for Hurricane Isaac in that we observed a signal generated by Hurricane Arthur’s eyewall. After landfall, there is a peak at about 70-80km from the center of the hurricane in both the seismic and the barometric data. We also found that the correlation length changes with distance from the hurricane center and also has a peak around 70-80km.",

            "abstract": "Radiation effects due to α-decay of U and Th and spontaneous fission of 238U control the production and recovery of the radiation-induced structure of minerals, as well as the diffusion of elements through the mineral host. However, details of how the damage microstructure is produced and annealed remain unknown. Our recent ion beam experiments demonstrate that ionizing radiation from the α-particle recovers the damage structure. Thus, the damage structure is not only the result of the thermal hisotry of the sample, but also of the complex interaction between ionizing and ballistic damage mechanisms. By combining ion irradiations with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have simulated the damage produced by α-decay and fission. The α-particle induced annealing has been simulated by in situ TEM observation of consecutive ion-irradiations: i.) 1 MeV Kr2+ (simulating 70 keV α-recoils induced damage), ii.) followed by 400 keV He+ (simulating 4.5 MeV α-particle induced annealing). Thus, in addition to the well-established effects of thermal annealing, the α-particle annealing effects, as evidenced by partical recrystallization of the originally, fully-amorphous apatite upon the α-particle irriadations, should also be considered when evaluating diffusion and release of elements, such as He. In addition, the fission track annealing has been simulated by a new sample preparation method that allows for direct observation of radiation damage recovery at each point along the length of latent tracks created by 80 MeV Xe ions (a typical fission fragment). The initial, rapid reduction in etched track length during isothermal annealing is explained by the rapid annealing of those sections of the track with smaller diameters, as observed directly by in situ TEM. In summary, the atomic-scale investigation of radiation damage in minerals is critical to understanding of the influence of raidation damage on diffusion and kinetics that are fundamental to geochronology.",

            "abstract": "With the recent shift towards modeling carbon and nitrogen cycling in support of climate-related initiatives, emphasis has been placed on incorporating increasingly mechanistic biogeochemistry within Earth system models to more accurately predict the response of terrestrial processes to natural and anthropogenic climate cycles. PFLOTRAN is an open-source subsurface code that is specialized for simulating multiphase flow and multicomponent biogeochemical transport on supercomputers. The object-oriented code was designed with modularity in mind and has been coupled with several third-party simulators (e.g. CLM to simulate land surface processes and E4D for coupled hydrogeophysical inversion).\nCentral to PFLOTRAN’s capabilities is its ability to simulate tightly-coupled reactive transport processes. This presentation focuses on recent enhancements to the code that enable the solution of large parameterized biogeochemical reaction networks with numerous chemical species. PFLOTRAN’s “reaction sandbox” is described, which facilitates the implementation of user-defined reaction networks without the need for a comprehensive understanding of PFLOTRAN software infrastructure. The reaction sandbox is written in modern Fortran (2003-2008) and leverages encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide the researcher with a flexible workspace for prototyping reactions within a massively parallel flow and transport simulation framework. As these prototypical reactions mature into well-accepted implementations, they can be incorporated into PFLOTRAN as native biogeochemistry capability. Users of the reaction sandbox are encouraged to upload their source code to PFLOTRAN’s main source code repository, including the addition of simple regression tests to better ensure the long-term code compatibility and validity of simulation results.",

Maps are the primary tool for communicating flood hazard, and their design raises two fundamental challenges: (1) representing the flood hazard in a scientifically defensible manner considering complexity associated with multiple drivers of flooding (e.g., rainfall, streamflow, storm surge, high tides, waves), urban infrastructure, and human interventions (e.g. pumping, sand bags) and (2) effectively communicating hazard information considering the specific needs of decision-makers.\nIn this research we rely on a hydrodynamic model of coastal flooding that can be forced by multiple drivers of flooding (rainfall, high water levels, and waves) to simulate extreme flooding scenarios at street-level resolution. Model scenarios include 20%, 10%, 5%, 2% and 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) scenarios for each possible driver of flooding and for both present and future sea levels. The resulting flood zones and related flood depths are aggregated using GIS techniques and transformed into a set of maps depicting annual exceedance probability, multi-year flood probability, 1% AEP flooding depth, uncertainty associated with model forcing data, and road network accessibility. The usability of each map is assessed through focus group discussions with local stakeholders who have distinct decision-making needs, such as homeowners, planners, and emergency response managers.

            "abstract": "Climatic trends and agricultural intensification in Midwestern U.S. landscapes has contributed to hydrologic regime shifts and a cascade of changes to water quality and river ecosystems. Informing management and policy to mitigate undesired consequences requires a careful scientific analysis that includes data-based inference and conceptual/physical modeling. It also calls for a systems approach that sees beyond a single stream to the whole watershed, favoring the adoption of minimal complexity rather than highly parameterized models for scenario evaluation and comparison. Minimal complexity models can focus on key dynamic processes of the system of interest, reducing problems of model structure bias and equifinality. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of climatic, hydrologic, and ecologic trends in the Minnesota River basin, a 45,000 km2 basin undergoing continuous agricultural intensification and suffering from declining water quality and aquatic biodiversity. We show that: (a) it is easy to arrive at an erroneous view of the system using traditional analyses and modeling tools; (b) even with a well-founded understanding of the key drivers and processes contributing to the problem, there are multiple pathways for minimizing/reversing environmental degradation; and (c) addressing the underlying driver of change (i.e., increased streamflows and reduced water storage due to agricultural drainage practices) by restoring a small amount of water storage in the landscape results in multiple non-linear improvements in downstream water quality. We argue that “optimization” between ecosystem services and economic considerations requires simple modeling frameworks, which include the most essential elements of the whole system and allow for evaluation of alternative management scenarios. Science-based approaches informing management and policy are urgent in this region calling for a new era of watershed management to new and accelerating stressors at the intersection of the food-water-energy-environment nexus.",

            "abstract": "The tongue of ionization (TOI) is a sporadic large-scale feature of the F-region polar ionosphere; a volume of high density plasma transported anti-sunward across the polar cap by the magnetospheric convection electric field. Sometimes the TOI may exist in the form of polar cap patches, owing to the solar wind and M-I coupling causing variations in convection, breaking up the TOI into discrete patchy structures.\nFigure 1 shows an example of a TOI under quiet geomagnetic conditions, from the GPS TEC map for 1637 UT on 05 Nov 2012, a day on which the Kp index was never higher than 1.7. The data is taken from Millstone Hill's on-line Madrigal data base. The TOI is often thought of as a storm-time phenomenon; this work challenges that assumption by examining observations from all levels of geomagnetic activity throughout the period of availability of the GPS TEC maps (2000-2014).\nSojka et al [1994] carried out a modeling study to determine the seasonal and universal time dependence of the tongue of ionization (and polar cap patches); Figure 2 is reproduced from that paper. In essence, this figure is intended to indicate the times when a TOI may and may not exist. A notable feature is the “hole” that is seen during winter days between 0600 and 1200 UT. At the time of that publication it was not possible to test the prediction, but there now exists a wealth of data in the form of maps of total electron content (TEC), available from the on-line Madrigal data base. These TEC maps, especially in the northern hemisphere, cover the mid-latitude and polar cap regions with sufficient resolution to determine whether or not a TOI exists, for nearly every day from the year 2000 to the present time, at 5 minute intervals. In this study we make a comprehensive survey of this immense data base and outline the conditions under which TOIs have been seen in the northern hemisphere, based on seasonal and UT dependencies, as well as levels of geomagnetic disturbance.\nThe winter “hole” in Figure 2, from 0600 to 1200 UT, days 325 to 030, will make it possible to address the question: Is the transport of dayside plasma through the cusp into the polar cap the dominant process responsible for high plasma densities in the dark polar ionosphere? If this is true, then year after year the TEC maps should show few or no polar cap high density structures occurring within this “hole”.",

            "abstract": "Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) allows subsurface imaging to provide geologic context and will be flown on the next two martian rovers (WISDOM on ExoMars and RIMFAX on Mars 2020). The motivation of our research is to minimize the engineering challenges of mounting a GPR antenna to a spacecraft, while maximizing the scientific capabilities of the GPR. The scientific capabilities increase with the bandwidth as it controls the resolution. Furthermore, ultra-wide bandwidth surveys allow certain mineralogies and rock units to be discriminated based on their frequency-dependent EM or scattering properties.\nWe have designed and field-tested a prototype GPR that utilizes bi-static circularly polarized spiral antennas. Each antenna has a physical size of 61 x 61 x 4 cm, therefore two antennas could be mounted to the underbelly of a MSL-class rover. Spiral antennas were chosen because they have an inherent broadband response and provide a better low frequency response compared with similarly sized linearly polarized antennas. A horizontal spiral radiator emits energy both upward and downward directions. After the radiator is mounted to a metal surface (i.e. the underside of a rover), a cavity is formed that causes the upward traveling energy to reverberate and cause unwanted interference. This interference is minimized by 1) using a high metallization ratio on the spiral to reduce cavity emissions, and 2) placing absorbing material inside the cavity. The resulting antennas provide high gain (0 to 8 dBi) from 200 to 1000 MHz. The low frequency response can be improved by increasing the antenna thickness (i.e., cavity depth).\nIn an initial field test, the antennas were combined with impulse GPR electronics that had ~140 dB of dynamic range (not including antennas) and a sand/clay interface 7 feet deep was detected. To utilize the full bandwidth the antennas, a gated Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform system will be developed – similar to RIMFAX. The goal is to reach a total system dynamic range of 180 dB in order to provide significant penetration.",

            "abstract": "The tidal efficiency is commonly included when analyzing the aquifer response to tidal variations in shallow streams that only partially penetrate the aquifer. Strangely enough, the tidal efficiency (more properly called the loading efficiency) is not commonly included in analyzing the aquifer response to arbitrary stage variations. The loading efficiency is the ratio between the instantaneous head response below a stream and the change in the stream stage. In soft soils, such as sand and clay, the instantaneous head response below a stream is equal to the stage change, which means that the loading efficiency is near one. For stiffer porous media, such as sand stones and other porous rocks, the loading efficiency is significantly smaller than one. New solutions are derived for the aquifer response to arbitrary stream stage variations in both single layer and multiple layer models while taking the loading efficiency into account. The effect of the loading efficiency on the aquifer response is analyzed for shallow streams that partially penetrate the aquifer. Guidelines are developed for when to include the loading efficiency for unconfined, semi-confined, and confined flow.",

NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational North American Mesoscale (NAM) weather predictions are combined with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to produce the ozone predictions and test fine particulate matter (PM2.5) predictions. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model provides smoke and dust predictions.\nAir quality observations constrain emissions used by NAQFC predictions. NAQFC NOx emissions from mobile sources were updated using National Emissions Inventory (NEI) projections for year 2012. These updates were evaluated over large U.S. cities by comparing observed changes in OMI NO2 observations and NOx measured by surface monitors. The rate of decrease in NOx emission projections from year 2005 to year 2012 is in good agreement with the observed changes over the same period. Smoke emissions rely on the fire locations detected from satellite observations obtained from NESDIS Hazard Mapping System (HMS). Dust emissions rely on a climatology of areas with a potential for dust emissions based on MODIS Deep Blue aerosol retrievals.\nVerification of NAQFC predictions uses AIRNow compilation of surface measurements for ozone and PM2.5. Retrievals of smoke from GOES satellites are used for verification of smoke predictions. Retrievals of dust from MODIS are used for verification of dust predictions.\nIn summary, observations are the basis for the emissions inputs for NAQFC, they are critical for evaluation of performance of NAQFC predictions, and furthermore they are used in real-time testing of bias correction of PM2.5 predictions, as we continue to work on improving modeling and emissions important for representation of PM2.5.",

            "abstract": "NASA's Europa multi-flyby mission is designed to provide a diversity of measurements suited to enrich our understanding of the potential habitability of this intriguing ocean world. The Europa mission's Ultraviolet Spectrograph, Europa-UVS, is the sixth in a series of successful ultraviolet imaging spectrographs (Rosetta-Alice, New Horizons Pluto-Alice, LRO-LAMP) and, like JUICE-UVS (now under Phase B development), is largely based on the most recent of these to fly, Juno-UVS. Europa-UVS observes photons in the 55-210 nm wavelength range, at moderate spectral and spatial resolution along a 7.5° slit. Three distinct apertures send light to the off-axis telescope mirror feeding the long-slit spectrograph: i) a main entrance airglow port is used for most observations (e.g., airglow, aurora, surface mapping, and stellar occultations); ii) a high-spatial-resolution port consists of a small hole in an additional aperture door, and is used for detailed observations of bright targets; and iii) a separate solar port allows for solar occultations, viewing at a 60° offset from the nominal payload boresight. Photon event time-tagging (pixel list mode) and programmable spectral imaging (histogram mode) allow for observational flexibility and optimal science data management. As on Juno-UVS, the effects of penetrating electron radiation on electronic parts and data quality are mitigated through contiguous shielding, filtering of pulse height amplitudes, management of high-voltage settings, and careful use of radiation-hard parts. The science goals of Europa-UVS are to: 1) Determine the composition & chemistry, source & sinks, and structure & variability of Europa's atmosphere, from equator to pole; 2) Search for and characterize active plumes in terms of global distribution, structure, composition, and variability; 3) Explore the surface composition & microphysics and their relation to endogenic & exogenic processes; and 4) Investigate how energy and mass flow in the Europa atmosphere, neutral cloud & plasma torus, and footprint on Jupiter. Here we present the UVS investigation by describing the science we plan to address, the salient details of the instrument, and the basic concept of operations.",

Daily volumetric water content and percentiles of volumetric water content from each satellite product is compared with the observations from the corresponding station. We evaluate the similarity between the satellite and in-situ products with regard to the climate and biome conditions of the area as well as the representativeness of the in-situ station for the satellite footprint. We find moderate-to-strong correspondence between all satellite products and in-situ soil moisture observations. Differences between the satellite and observation datasets are attributed to varying land cover conditions, snow cover, and the spatial mismatch of the point observation with the satellite product grid cell. In general, our results suggest that the satellite products evaluated can accurately capture temporal variability of soil moisture near the surface, but do show systematic offsets at several stations across the study region.",

Values of temperature and RH covered in the pre-flight calibration [1] overlap only partially with the environmental conditions found at the Phoenix landing site [2,3]. In particular, there is no overlap at dawn, when temperatures are the lowest and the expected RH is the highest [4] and in the middle of the day, when temperatures are relatively high and the expected RH is very low [5].\nHere we plan to produce high-level RH data by calibrating an Engineering Model of the TECP in the Michigan Mars Environmental Chamber (MMEC). The MMEC is capable of simulating the entire range of environmental conditions found at the Phoenix landing site. The MMEC is a cylindrical chamber with internal diameter of 64 cm and length of 160 cm. It is capable of simulating temperatures ranging from 145 to 500 K, CO2 pressures ranging from 10 to 105 Pa, and relative humidity ranging from nearly 0 to 100% [6].\nThe analysis of high-level RH data has the potential to shed light on the formation of liquid brines at Mars' polar latitudes, where it is most likely to occur [7]. In addition, the RH sensor aboard Curiosity is similar to that on the TECP [8], allowing a direct comparison of the near-surface RH measurements at these two different locations on the surface of Mars.\nREFERENCES:\n[1] Zent, A.

            "abstract": "All land parameterizations used in hydrologic, ecological and climate models or assimilation systems contain key closure functions that relate water and energy balances. Key among these closure functions is reduction of evapotranspiration (latent heat flux) due to deficit in soil water availability (EF, the fraction of available energy released as latent heat), This closure is a flux-based diagnostic that can be calculated for any model. Its estimation as a function of soil moisture state (S) can be used to diagnose compatibility and fidelity of parameterizations. Important as this closure is, it remains empirical and mostly untested especially across diverse landscapes and climates. In this study we develop and apply mapping estimation capability for key unknown parameters that link the terrestrial water and energy balance equations. A single cost function is posed that measures moisture and temperature dependent errors solely in terms of observed forcings, surface states and unknown parameters. This cost function is minimized with respect to parameters to estimate key parameters of water and energy balance equation. The uncertainty of the estimated parameters (and associated statistical confidence limits) is obtained through the inverse of Hessian of the cost function, which is an approximation of the covariance matrix. The hessian of the cost function will be used to guide the formulation of a well-posed estimation problem. This calibration free method is verified at point scale and at regional scale using remote sensing measurements. The focus is to find the functional form of the evaporative fraction dependence on soil moisture, the key closure function for surface and subsurface heat and moisture dynamics, using remote sensing data. Accurate estimation of key parameters and closure function of water and energy balance equation can be used to guide the refinement of Land Surface Models and enhance weather and climate forecast skill.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing drought in the Great Basin is a likely portent of future conditions with questions asked on water resource and ecosystem sustainability given increased temperatures and reduced winter snowpack. Research highlights the combined use of integrated models and remote sensing products to explore inter-annual climate variability and its impact on the relationship between vegetation vigor and hydrologic response in semi-arid landscapes. Hydrologic response to the current drought is shown to be similar to a moderate, decadal drought observed during 1952-1961; with moderate droughts expected to increase in frequency over the next century and move hydrologic conditions closer to the equivalent of the most severe drought observed in the 20th century. Vegetation water use in groundwater dependent ecosystems is explored in the context of soil moisture and depth to groundwater, as well as type and water use efficiency of upland vegetation. A case study illustrates that hydrologic sensitivity of meadow groundwater levels to upland woody-plant encroachment depends on precipitation falling out of phase with potential evapotranspiration; and weathered/fractured bedrock having the capacity to store water to sustain deep rooted plant transpiration during seasonally dry periods. Results suggest the meadow groundwater levels operate on a threshold response to precipitation greater than 400 mm per year and are highly responsive to small changes in upland vegetation and climate. Use of remote sensing in conjunction with integrated hydrologic models provides insight on the complex interplay between climate, vegetation, and hydrology.",

            "abstract": "A crossover between atomistic description and continuous representation of grain boundaries in polycrystals is set-up to model the periodic arrays of structural units by using dislocation and disclination dipole arrays along grain boundaries. Continuous modeling of the boundary is built by bottom-up processing, meaning that the strain, rotation, curvature, disclination and dislocation density fields are calculated by using the discrete atomic positions generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Continuous modeling of a 18.9° symmetric tilt boundary in copper [1] is conducted as a benchmark case. Its accuracy is validated by comparison with a similar recent technique [2]. Then, results on the 60.8° Mg2SiO4 tilt boundary [3-4] are presented. By linking the atomistic description with continuum mechanics representations, they provide new insights into the structure of the grain boundary.\n[1] Fressengeas, C., Taupin, V., Capolungo, L., 2014.

            "abstract": "The Chesapeake Bay is a highly eutrophic estuary that undergoes seasonal bottom water hypoxia and its sediments contain methane (CH4) gas bubbles within the upper few cm. Yet, little is known if this greenhouse gas escapes to the water column or the atmosphere. Here, we hypothesized that when bottom waters become anoxic, CH4 is released from sediments, builds-up under the pycnocline, and is released at the end of the anoxia. To test this, bottom water from the Chesapeake Bay was continuously collected using OsmoSamplers from April to October 2013 to give a record of CH4 concentrations every 4 days. In April, CH4 concentrations were low (~1 μM) when bottom waters were still fully oxygenated and steadily increased as hypoxic conditions set-in. By mid-July, CH4 concentrations peaked and reached as high as 40 μM and returned to background levels when normoxic conditions returned in late September. The correlation with oxygen supports our hypothesis, although we can not rule out organic matter input and temperature as contributing, or even dominant drivers of this pattern. Surface water concentrations were 6 times higher in September compared to June, suggesting that CH4 is also released at the end of seasonal hypoxia. We postulate that this process of anoxia enhanced CH4 flux is not specific to our field site and thus that other highly eutrophic estuaries may also experience a similar phenomenon. Collectively, such estuaries may be a larger source of atmospheric CH4 than originally thought.",

            "abstract": "What numbers \"capture\" topography? If stationary, white, and Gaussian: mean and variance. But \"whiteness\" is strong; we are led to a \"baseline\" over which to compute means and variances. We then have subscribed to topography as a correlated process, and to the estimation (noisy, afftected by edge effects) of the parameters of a spatial or spectral covariance function. What if the covariance function or the point process itself aren't Gaussian? What if the region under study isn't regularly shaped or sampled? How can results from differently sized patches be compared robustly? We present a spectral-domain \"Whittle\" maximum-likelihood procedure that circumvents these difficulties and answers the above questions. The key is the Matern form, whose parameters (variance, range, differentiability) define the shape of the covariance function (Gaussian, exponential, ..., are all special cases). We treat edge effects in simulation and in estimation. Data tapering allows for the irregular regions. We determine the estimation variance of all parameters. And the \"best\" estimate may not be \"good enough\": we test whether the \"model\" itself warrants rejection. We illustrate our methodology on geologically mapped patches of Venus. Surprisingly few numbers capture planetary topography. We derive them, with uncertainty bounds, we simulate \"new\" realizations of patches that look to the geologists exactly as if they were derived from similar processes. Our approach holds in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions, and generalizes to multiple variables, e.g. when topography and gravity are being considered jointly (perhaps linked by flexural rigidity, erosion, or other surface and sub-surface modifying processes). Our results have widespread implications for the study of planetary topography in the Solar System, and are interpreted in the light of trying to derive \"process\" from \"parameters\", the end goal to assign likely formation histories for the patches under consideration. Our results should also be relevant for whomever needed to perform spatial interpolation or out-of-sample extension (e.g. kriging), machine learning and feature detection, on geological data. We present procedural details but focus on high-level results that have real-world implications for the study of Venus, Earth, other planets, and moons.",

            "abstract": "We present a set of fully kinetic 2.5D simulations of electron dynamics during rapid magnetic islands coalescence in asymmetric conditions. Simulations are performed using the massively parallel fully kinetic implicit moment method code iPIC3D (Markidis et al. 2010). The domain is a double periodic box with two current sheets initially representing two different reconnection conditions with the same asymmetric ratio. In the upper sheet the conventional hyperbolic continuous functions for magnetic field and density are initialised across the layer (e.g. Pritchett 2008). In the lower layer the same asymmetric conditions are used the presence of an extremely steep gradient describing a pure tangential discontinuity.\nCases with and without guide field are compared.\nWhile the upper layer shows the typical reconnection evolution of an asymmetric configuration, the lower layer very soon develops not-uniformly distributed multiple reconnection points which rapidly evolve in a series of magnetic islands. Quick islands coalescence follows.\nEven though the electrons dynamics during island merging has been studied in both symmetric and asymmetric conditions (e.g. Pritchett 2007, 2008b, Drake et al. 2006, Oka et al. 2010, Huang et al. 2014), these simulations show new interesting features such as the presence of three distinct regions, here named X, M and D, with very different properties. Regions X and M manifest typical signatures of ongoing reconnection, distinguishable thanks to the direct comparison with the outcomes of the upper layer. In particular, M-type regions are different because reconnection occurs between two merging islands in a vertical fashion with respect to the direction of the current sheets initially set. In contrast, regions D present a quite diverse features, not showing the typical signatures of a occurring reconnection.\nThe present work is supported by the NASA MMS Grant NNX08AO84G.

            "abstract": "Significant declines in rainfall have been observed in Hawai‘i since 1920. However, these trends have not been uniform in space or time. It is important to understand past rainfall variations to provide the context for future changes. This is especially important for isolated oceanic islands where resources are limited, and understanding the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater supplies is crucial. Maps of seasonal and annual rainfall trends have been produced for the State of Hawai‘i for the period 1920-2012. However, since rainfall time series can be highly variable and these trend values may be sensitive to the time period chosen, a running trend analysis was performed to assess the stability of these trends through time. Running trend plots were generated for selected stations chosen to represent unique climate regions based on exposure (windward or leeward) and elevation (low, mid or high). The running trend analysis indicates that in many areas, these drying trends are only significant when the last few years of the record are included in the trend period. The only region with persistent trends through time is the Kona region of the Island of Hawai‘i, with significant long-term drying trends, particularly in the dry season. This analysis also highlights the influence of natural variability in short-term trends. These results support previous studies that indicate drying across the state, and reveal the timing of upward and downward trends as well as important spatial details for water resource managers in Hawai‘i.",

Campbell1\n1University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA  \n Around 200 people brave 40-below-zero temperatures to listen to university researchers and scientists give lectures about their work at an event called the Science for Alaska Lecture Series, hosted by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. It is held once a week, for six weeks during the coldest part of a Fairbanks, Alaska, winter. The topics range from space physics to remote sensing. The lectures last for 45 minutes with 15 minutes for audience questions and answers. It has been popular for about 20 years and is one of many public outreach efforts of the institute. The scientists are careful in their preparations for presentations and GI’s Public Relations staff chooses the speakers based on topic, diversity and public interest. The staff also considers the speaker’s ability to speak to a general audience, based on style, clarity and experience.\nI conducted a qualitative research project to find out about the people who attended the event, why they attend and what they do with the information they hear about. The participants were volunteers who attended the event and either stayed after the lectures for an interview or signed up to be contacted later. I used used an interview technique with open-ended questions, recorded and transcribed the interview. I identified themes in the interviews, using narrative analysis.\nPreliminary data show that the lecture series is a form of entertainment for people who are highly educated and work in demanding and stressful jobs. They come with family and friends. Sometimes it’s a date with a significant other. Others want to expose their children to science. The findings are in keeping with the current literature that suggests that public events meant to increase public understanding of science instead draws like-minded people. The findings are different from Campbell’s hypothesis that attendance was based on an interest in Arctic science research, since all the research is related to the polar regions.",

Availability of hyperspectral measurements is further augmenting these LiDAR data by enabling the biogeochemical characterization of vegetation and soils at unprecedented spatial resolutions (~1-10m). Such data have opened up novel opportunities for modeling critical zone processes and addressing questions that were not possible before. We show how an integrated 3-D model at ~1m resolution can enable us to resolve micro-topographic and ecological dynamics and their control on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. We capture vertical vegetation structure, i.e. vertical leaf area profile, using LiDAR point cloud data conditioned on vegetation species identified through hyperspectral data. This allows the resolutions of the vertical light regime and the resulting photosynthesis and latent and sensible heat energy profile. We address the computational challenge of such detailed modeling by exploiting GPU computing technologies. We show results of moisture, biogeochemical, and vegetation dynamics from studies in the Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively managed Landscapes (IMLCZO).",

By combining pairs of shear wave phases such as ScS/S and SKS/SKKS phases, we can constrain seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle, specifically the D” region. Several studies have revealed strong shear wave splitting due to lowermost mantle anisotropy in the D” region along the boundaries of the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP). The two LLSVPs, centered beneath Africa and the Pacific, are robust features of global S wave tomographic models of lower mantle structure, and likely play a role in lower mantle dynamics. Here we present shear wave splitting measurements of SKS, SKKS and ScS phases that reflect seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle beneath Australia, near the southwestern boundary of the Pacific LLSVP. Data from 8 long-running (>20 years) stations in Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica provide splitting measurements for approximately 130 SKS-SKKS pairs. A significant minority (25) of these indicate significant discrepancies between SKS and SKKS splitting behavior, reflecting a contribution from the lowermost mantle. Work is ongoing to to combine this data set with differential S-ScS splitting measurements, which can constrain splitting of the ScS phase due to anisotropy in D”. In combination with SK(K)S measurements, such measurements can provide good sampling of individual regions over a range of propagation directions. Future work will include mineral physics based forward modeling in order to constrain the range of mantle flow scenarios that are consistent with our observations.",

            "abstract": "The land surface is a key component of climate system. It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and latent heat, and partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff. Water and energy cycle are intrinsically coupled through evaporation, which represents a heat exchange as latent heat flux. Accurate estimation of fluxes of heat and moisture are of significant importance in many fields such as hydrology, climatology and meteorology.\nIn this study we develop and apply a Bayesian framework for estimating the key unknown parameters of terrestrial water and energy balance equations (i.e. moisture and heat diffusion) and their uncertainty in land surface models. These equations are coupled through flux of evaporation. The estimation system is based on the adjoint method for solving a least-squares optimization problem. The cost function consists of aggregated errors on state (i.e. moisture and temperature) with respect to observation and parameters estimation with respect to prior values over the entire assimilation period. This cost function is minimized with respect to parameters to identify models of sensible heat, latent heat/evaporation and drainage and runoff. Inverse of Hessian of the cost function is an approximation of the posterior uncertainty of parameter estimates. Uncertainty of estimated fluxes is estimated by propagating the uncertainty for linear and nonlinear function of key parameters through the method of First Order Second Moment (FOSM). Uncertainty analysis is used in this method to guide the formulation of a well-posed estimation problem.\nAccuracy of the method is assessed at point scale using surface energy and water fluxes generated by the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model at the selected AmeriFlux stations. This method can be applied to diverse climates and land surface conditions with different spatial scales, using remotely sensed measurements of surface moisture and temperature states",

            "abstract": "The study of volcanism can further our understanding of Earth’s mantle processes and composition. Continental intraplate volcanism commonly occurs above subducted slabs that stagnate in the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ), such as in Europe, eastern China, and western North America. Here, we use two-dimensional numerical models to explore the evolution of stagnant slabs in the MTZ and their potential to sustain mantle upwellings that can support volcanism. We find that weak slabs may go convectively unstable within tens of Myr. Plume-like upwellings rise out of the relatively warm underbelly of the slab, are entrained by ambient-mantle flow and reach the base of the lithosphere. The first and most vigorous upwellings rise adjacent to lateral heterogeneity within the slab. Ultimately, convective instability also acts to separate the compositional components of the slab—harzburgite and eclogite—from each other with harzburgite rising into the upper mantle and eclogite sinking into the lower mantle. Such a physical filtering process may sustain a long-term compositional gradient across the MTZ. Convective instability rising out of the stagnant slab may moreover render the slab seismically invisible on timescales of ~100 Myr.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that the contributing areas of Prairie streams dominated by depressional (wetland) storage demonstrate hysteresis with respect to catchment water storage. As such contributing fractions can vary over time from a very small percentage of catchment area to the entire catchment during floods. However, catchments display complex memories of past storage states and their contributing fractions cannot be modelled accurately by any single-valued function.\nThe Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform, CRHM, which is capable of modelling all of the hydrological processes of cold regions using a hydrological response unit discretization of the catchment, was used to further investigate dynamical contributing area response to hydrological processes. Contributing fraction in CRHM is also controlled by the episodic nature of runoff generation in this cold, sub-humid environment where runoff is dominated by snowmelt over frozen soils, snowdrifts define the contributing fraction in late spring, unfrozen soils have high water holding capacity and baseflow from sub-surface flow does not exist.\nCRHM was improved by adding a conceptual model of individual Prairie depression fill and spill runoff generation that displays hysteresis in the storage – contributing fraction relationship and memory of storage state. The contributing area estimated by CRHM shows strong sensitivity to hydrological inputs, storage and the threshold runoff rate chosen. The response of the contributing area to inputs from various runoff generating processes from snowmelt to rain-on-snow to rainfall with differing degrees of spatial variation was investigated as was the importance of the memory of storage states on streamflow generation. The importance of selecting hydrologically and ecologically meaningful runoff thresholds in estimating contributing area is emphasized.",

Fluxnet probably saved my MODIS career by developing a global network of rigorously calibrated towers measuring water and carbon fluxes over a wide variety of ecosystems that I could not even envision at the time that first proposal was written. However my enthusiasm for Fluxnet was not reciprocated by the Fluxnet community until we began providing 7 x 7 pixel MODIS Land datasets exactly over each of their towers every 8 days, without them having to crawl thru the global datasets and make individual orders. This system, known informally as the MODIS ASCII cutouts, began in 2002 and operates at the Oak Ridge DAAC to this day, cementing a mutually beneficial data interchange between the Fluxnet and remote sensing communities. This talk will briefly discuss the history of MODIS validation with flux towers, and flux spatial scaling with MODIS data. More importantly I will detail the future continuity of global biophysical datasets in the post-MODIS era, and what next generation sensors will provide.",

            "abstract": "Are we overlooking an important factor for improved numerical prediction of tsunamis in shallow sea to onshore? In this presentation, several case studies on numerical modeling of tsunami-induced sediment transport are reviewed, and the role of sediment transport models for tsunami inundation simulation is discussed.\nLarge-scale sediment transport and resulting geomorphological change occurred in the coastal areas of Tohoku, Japan, due to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami. Datasets obtained after the tsunami, including geomorphological and sedimentological data as well as hydrodynamic records, allows us to validate the numerical model in detail. The numerical modeling of the sediment transport by the 2011 tsunami depicted the severest erosion of sandy beach, as well as characteristic spatial patterns of erosion and deposition on the seafloor, which have taken place in Hirota Bay, Sanriku Coast. Quantitative comparisons of observation and simulation of the geomorphological changes in Sanriku Coast and Sendai Bay showed that the numerical model can predict the volumes of erosion and deposition with a right order. In addition, comparison of the simulation with aerial video footages demonstrated the numerical model is capable of tracking the overall processes of tsunami sediment transport.\nAlthough tsunami-induced sediment erosion and deposition sometimes cause significant geomorphological change, and may enhance tsunami hydrodynamic impact to the coastal zones, most tsunami simulations do not include sediment transport modeling. A coupled modeling of tsunami hydrodynamics and sediment transport draws a different picture of tsunami hazard, comparing with simple hydrodynamic modeling of tsunami inundation.\nSince tsunami-induced erosion, deposition and geomorphological change sometimes extend more than several kilometers across the coastline, two-dimensional horizontal model are typically used for the computation of tsunami hydrodynamics and sediment transport. Limitations of the conventional model and future challenges are discussed regarding further improvement of numerical modeling of tsunami and sediment transport. Improved numerical modeling may provide useful information for assessing sediment-related damages and planning post-disaster recovery.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface winds and air temperature play an important role in the surface energy balance of glaciers and ice sheets, and can be highly variable in space and time. The increasing fraction of debris-covered ice observed in many retreating alpine glacier environments motivates the study of these variables, and the processes that control them, over both clean and debris-covered ice.\nWe use meteorological data collected in the ablation zone of a ~ 5km-long valley glacier in Yukon, Canada, to analyze the diurnal variability of temperature and wind regimes over debris-covered and debris-free ice. Our data reveal pronounced diurnal cycles in temperature lapse rates, wind speeds, and wind directions. Common to both clean and debris-covered areas are: (1) a shallowing of lapse rates in the early morning from 6:00 to 9:00 and a steepening of lapse rates during the day from 9:00 to 16:00, (2) nearly identical lapse rates regardless of surface type between 15:00 and 19:00, and (3) a persistent diurnal wind regime in which up-valley winds occur from late morning to evening, peaking at 16:00-17:00, and relatively weaker down-valley winds occur overnight. Significant differences between the clean-ice and debris-covered sites are also evident in the data, namely: (1) much steeper night-time lapse rates over debris-covered ice than clean ice, (2) the occurrence of steepest lapse rates overnight for debris-covered ice and in late afternoon (around 16:00) for clean ice, and (3) a more pronounced diurnal cycle in windspeed over debris-covered ice than clean ice, despite all stations exhibiting evidence of the diurnal changes in wind direction.\nThe patterns described above conform to a model of weak katabatic flow at night and relatively stronger up-valley winds during the day, peaking in late afternoon. Though absolute temperatures over clean and debris-covered ice are markedly different during the day, lapse rates over both surfaces evolve similarly through the day to achieve steep (< −9K/km) and nearly identical values in late afternoon when up-valley winds are strongest. We have yet to explore the implications of the diurnal cycles described above for the surface energy balance and our ability to model it, but speculate that what we have observed is just one regime of many in which air temperature, winds, and surface type are related.",

            "abstract": "Many quality factors for digital topographic models (DTMs) from stereo imaging can be predicted geometrically. For example, pixel scale is related to instantaneous field of view and range, and vertical precision is a known function of the pixel scale and convergence angle if the image quality is high so that automated image matching reaches its optimal precision (~0.2 pixel). The influence of incidence angle is harder to predict. Reduced quality is expected both at low incidence (where topographic shading disappears) and high incidence (where signal/noise ratio is low and shadows occur). This problem is of general interest, but critical for NASA’s Europa mission. The REASON instrument will obtain a radar sounding profile on each Europa flyby. Stereo images collected simultaneously by the EIS camera will be used to make DTMs needed to distinguish off-nadir surface echos (clutter) from subsurface features. The question is, how much of this DTM strip will be useful, given that incidence angle will vary substantially?\nWe are using simulations to answer this question. We mosaicked 220 m/pixel Galileo images of the Castalia Macula region of Europa and made a DTM by photoclinometry, using a low-incidence image to correct for albedo variations. With the simulation software OASIS we generated synthetic stereopairs that are realistic in terms of image resolution, noise, photometry (including albedo variations based on the low incidence image), and cast shadows. We then use the commercial stereo software SOCET SET (® BAE Systems), which we have used for a wide variety of planetary mapping projects, to produce DTMs. These are compared to the input DTM as “truth” to quantify the dependence of DTM resolution and vertical precision on illumination, and to document the ways that DTMs degrade at high and low incidence angles.\nThis methodology is immediately applicable to other planetary targets, and in particular can be used to address how much difference in illumination can be tolerated in stereopairs that are not (as for EIS) acquired simultaneously.",

The IFIS is designed for use by general public, often people with no domain knowledge and limited general science background. To improve effective communication with such audience, we have introduced a voice-enabled knowledge engine on flood related issues in IFIS. Instead of navigating within many features and interfaces of the information system and web-based sources, the system provides dynamic computations based on a collection of built-in data, analysis, and methods. The IFIS Knowledge Engine connects to real-time stream gauges, in-house data sources, analysis and visualization tools to answer natural language questions. Our goal is the systematization of data and modeling results on flood related issues in Iowa, and to provide an interface for definitive answers to factual queries. The goal of the knowledge engine is to make all flood related knowledge in Iowa easily accessible to everyone, and support voice-enabled natural language input. We aim to integrate and curate all flood related data, implement analytical and visualization tools, and make it possible to compute answers from questions. The IFIS explicitly implements analytical methods and models, as algorithms, and curates all flood related data and resources so that all these resources are computable. The IFIS Knowledge Engine computes the answer by deriving it from its computational knowledge base. The knowledge engine processes the statement, access data warehouse, run complex database queries on the server-side and return outputs in various formats. This presentation provides an overview of IFIS Knowledge Engine, its unique information interface and functionality as an educational tool, and discusses the future plans for providing knowledge on flood related issues and resources.

            "abstract": "The englacial region of temperate glaciers is generally treated as a passive conveyor of water from the surface to the bed. Consequently, few studies have examined this region and relatively little is known. This is an important issue because englacial processes probably exert a first order control on the distribution of water to the subglacial hydraulic system. Controlling the water distribution probably controls the type of subglacial hydraulic features present and therefore sliding behavior. Certainly, englacial conduits play a major, if not primary, role in conveying water in the ablation zone. In regions of over-deepenings, areas highly crevassed, or in the accumulation zone, the importance of englacial conduits is less clear. Field studies have shown that intersecting englacial passageways in these regions are relatively common, implying that large water fluxes can drain efficiently through a network of fractures. Hypothetically, efficient drainage systems composed of englacial conduits develop in response to point input of large surface water fluxes. Where input is small and distributed, common to highly crevassed areas or the accumulation zone, water is probably routed through a network of englacial fractures. Glacier geometry may also play a role. Conduits may not develop in the over-deepened (closed basins) regions of a glacier requiring another flow pathway. That englacial fractures exist and can convey water presents a promising alternative. Measured rates of flow in fractures strongly suggest laminar conditions and a sufficient fracture density exists to accommodate the estimated water flux generated upstream by surface melt. The slow flow rates do not generate sufficient viscous heat to compensate expected rates of closure by freezing, however field observations and seismic evidence point to spontaneous fracture formation at depth that must regenerate the fracture network. It is unfortunate that englacial investigations are ignored in favor of subglacial observations because both can be achieved in the same drilling campaign with little additional effort.",

            "abstract": "Reconstruction of ocean redox chemistry during the Ediacaran Period is important for understanding the causal relationship between environmental oxygen levels and early metazoan evolution. Geochemical data (e.g., high Mo and U concentrations and/or heavy Mo and U isotope compositions from sedimentary rocks) provide evidence of extensive ocean oxygenation shortly after the Marinoan glaciation at ca. 632 Ma [1], during the late Ediacaran Period at ca. 560-551 Ma [2], and multiple times during the early Cambrian Period [3, 4]. These episodes of oxygenation may have been separated by intervals of less oxygenated conditions [1, 2]. However, the global redox state of the ocean during the terminal Ediacaran period (ca. 551-541 Ma) is poorly constrained. We address this knowledge gap by measuring carbonate U isotope compositions (δ238U) – a novel global ocean redox proxy – of the Gaojiashan Member of the late Ediacaran Dengying Formation (ca. 551-541 Ma) in South China. An abrupt negative shift in δ238U from values scattering around -0.45‰ to values averaging -0.95‰ (±0.20‰, 2sd) was observed in the middle Gaojiashan Member, suggesting a globally widespread expansion of ocean anoxia during the terminal Ediacaran Period. The negative δ238U shift coincides with the onset of a pronounced positive carbon isotope excursion (from 0‰ to +6‰), suggesting that ocean anoxia is the major driving force behind enhanced organic carbon burial that led to the carbon isotope excursion. The widespread anoxia recorded by the Gaojiashan Member is bracketed by known intervals of extensive ocean oxygenation, thus indicating that the Precambrian-Phanerozoic transition was characterized by oscillating ocean redox conditions. The Ediacara biota (ca. 541 Ma) [5] disappeared shortly after the widespread ocean anoxia, suggesting that an expansion of ocean anoxia may have triggerred the onset of a mass extinction in the latest Ediacaran time.\n",

            "abstract": "Age determination via the 40Ar/39Ar dating method relies on the intercomparison of measured 40Ar*/39ArK ratios of geological unknowns with those of co-irradiated mineral standards. Good analytical procedure dictates that these ratios (and the evolution of the Ar ion beams underpinning them) be as similar as practical for the greatest accuracy.\nUnfortunately, throughout several intervals of the geological time scale this ‘best practice’ cannot be achieved with existing widely used standards. Only two internationally utilized sanidine standards are available for the middle to late Cenozoic: the Alder Creek Rhyolite sanidine (ACs), at ~1.2 Ma (Turrin et al., 1994; Nomade et al., 2005), and the Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine (FCs) at ~28.2 Ma (e.g., Kuiper et al., 2008; Renne et al, 2011). The situation is even worse throughout much of the rest of the Phanerozoic, as the next oldest standard in common use is the Hb3gr hornblende standard with an age of ~1.1 Ga (Turner, 1971; Jourdan et al., 2006).\nWe propose, as a community effort, the development a set of standards covering the entire target range of high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating, i.e. the Phanerozoic. Their ages would be stepped in a regular fashion with no more than approximately a factor of 3 between standards, such that in the worse case the 40Ar*/39Ar ratios of standards and unknown need differ by no more than a factor of two. While somewhat arbitrary, an approximately 3 X age progression allows the entire time scale to be covered by a manageable number of standards. Anchoring the progression in the widely used ACs, FCs, and Hb3gr (in bold, below) yields the following set of suggested standard ages: 0.4, 1.2, 3.3, 9.4, 28.2, 95, 320, and 1100 Ma.\nA suitable standard should be highly reproducible in age at the grain-to-grain and sub-grain levels, and highly radiogenic. The mineral should be abundant and easily separated from the host rock. These criteria may be most easily achieved by focusing on sanidine phenocrysts in unaltered volcanic deposits, though not exclusively so. Examples include the Zabriskie Wash Tuff of Death Valley at 3.3 Ma; several ~9-10 Ma volcanic units of the Bodie Hills and Snake River Plain, and the ~316 Ma Fireclay Tonstein of the central Appalachian basin. We welcome suggestions and discussions regarding other rock units that might be tapped for this endeavor.",

            "abstract": "Time lapse or 4D gravity and seismic reflection surveys are being conducted at the West Hastings Field near Houston, Texas to monitor the progress of CO2 injection. This Department of Energy supported CO2 sequestration experiment is conducted in conjunction with a Denbury Onshore, LLC tertiary recovery project. The reservoir is at a depth of 1.8 km in the Oligocene Frio sands and has been produced since the 1930s. Goals are an accounting and mapping of the injected CO2 and to determine if migration occurs along intra-reservoir faults. An integrated interpretation of the geophysical surveys will be made together with well logs and engineering data. Gravity monitoring of water versus gas replacement has been very successful, but liquid phase CO2 monitoring is problematic due to the smaller density contrast with respect to oil and water. This reservoir has a small volume to depth ratio and hence only a small gravity difference signal is expected on the surface. New borehole gravity technology introduced by Micro-g-Lacoste can make gravity measurements at near reservoir depths with a much higher signal to noise ratio. This method has been successfully evaluated on a simulation of the Hastings project. Field operations have been conducted for repeated surface and borehole gravity surveys beginning in 2013. The surface survey of 95 stations covers an area of 3 by 5 km and 22 borehole gravity logs are run in the interval above the Frio formation. 4D seismic reflection surveys are being made at 6 month intervals on the surface and in 3 VSP wells. CO2 injection into the targeted portion of the reservoir only began in early 2015 and monitoring will continue into 2017. To date only the baseline reservoir conditions have been assessed. The overall success of the gravity monitoring will not be determined until 2017.",

            "abstract": "Ice-wedge polygons are conspicuous and widespread in arctic landscapes, creating complex microtopography and strong, meter-scale contrasts in hydrology, soil, vegetation, and ground ice conditions. Thaw of the upper portion of ice-wedges results in ground subsidence (thermokarst), plant mortality and the formation of small, flooded pits along the polygon margins. Secondary impacts, such as changes in flowpaths, spatially-variable flooding and drainage of polygon centers, and thermal erosion of permafrost, extend well beyond the thermokarst pits themselves. We delineated small waterbodies in historical airphotos and modern high-resolution satellite imagery and made ground observations across a network of 45 km2 study areas spanning the western and central regions of Alaska’s North Slope. The imagery archive covers three epochs: 1948–1955, 1979–1985, and 2009–2012. Our analysis focused on residual upland surfaces dominated by Holocene-aged ice wedges, where surface water is mainly restricted to degraded ice-wedges. Total extent of flooded pits increased at most landscapes since circa 1980 (range -27 – +135%; median +10.6%). An intriguing regional pattern was evident: degradation of Holocene ice-wedges was already well underway by 1950 across much of the western North Slope, but degradation initiated much more recently on eolian sand and silt (yedoma) deposits prevalent to the east. Our results indicate that recent degradation of Holocene ice wedges across northern Alaska cannot be explained by late-20th century warmth alone. Possible mechanisms for earlier onset of degradation on the western North Slope include differences in recent climate history, snow regime, and thermal and physical properties of surficial materials. These findings provide context for interpreting and predicting ice-wedge thermokarst processes, thresholds, and impacts in Alaska and elsewhere in the circumpolar arctic.",

            "abstract": "Continuous measurements of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux provide essential information about the soil carbon budget in response to an abruptly changing climate at Arctic and Subarctic scales. The Forced Diffusion (FD) chamber technique has a gas permeable membrane, which passively regulates the mixing of atmosphere and soil air in the chamber, in place of the active pumping system inside a regular dynamics efflux chamber system (Risk et al., 2011). Here the system has been modified the sampling routine to eliminate the problem of sensor drift. After that, we deployed the FD chamber system in a tundra ecosystem over the discontinuous permafrost regime of Council, Alaska. The representative understory plants are tussock (17 %), lichen (32 %), and moss (51 %), within a 40 נ40 m plot at an interval of five meters (81 points total) for efflux-measurement by dynamic chamber. The FD chamber monitored soil CO2 efflux from moss, lichen, and tussock regimes at an interval of 30 min during the growing season of 2015. As the results, mean soil CO2 effluxes in sphagnum moss, lichen, and tussock were 1.98 ± 1.10 (coefficient of variance: 55.8 %), 3.34 ± 0.84 (CV: 25.0 %), and 5.32 ± 1.48 (CV: 27.8 %) gCO2/m2/d, respectively. The difference between the 30-min efflux interval and the average efflux of three 10-min intervals is not significant for sphagnum (n = 196), lichen (n = 918), and tussock (n = 918) under a 95 % confidence level. The deploying interval was then set to 30 min and synchronized with eddy covariance tower data. During the deployment period of 2015, soil CO2 efflux over moss, lichen, and tussock using the FD chamber system were 44 ± 24, 73 ± 18, and 117 ± 33 gCO2/m2/period, respectively. Using the dynamic chamber, mean ecosystem respiration (Re) ranges for moss, lichen, and tussock were 2.2‑2.6, 1.8‑2.0, and 3.3‑3.6 gCO2/m2/d, respectively, during June and July of 2015. These techniques provide the representativeness of spatiotemporal variation of soil carbon dioxide emission in response to the abrupt changes in local meteorology and climate of Council, Alaska.",

Of particular interest is how electron precipitation in the evening sector affects the development of the Sub-auroral Polarization Stream (SAPS) electric field that is observed at sub-auroral latitudes in that sector. Our approach is to use the magnetically and electrically self-consistent Rice Convection Model – Equilibrium (RCM-E) of the inner magnetosphere to simulate the stormtime precipitating electron distributions and the electric field. We use parameterized rates of whistler-generated electron pitch-angle scattering from Orlova and Shprits [JGR, 2014] that depend on equatorial radial distance, magnetic activity (Kp), and magnetic local time (MLT) outside the simulated plasmasphere. Inside the plasmasphere, parameterized scattering rates due to hiss [Orlova et al., GRL, 2014] are used. We compare simulated trapped and precipitating electron flux distributions with measurements from Van Allen Probes/MagEIS, POES/TED and MEPED, respectively, to validate the electron loss model. Ground-based (SuperDARN) and in-situ (Van Allen Probes/EFW) observations of electric fields are compared with the simulation results. We discuss the effect of precipitating electrons on the SAPS and inner magnetospheric electric field through the data-model comparisons.",

This study proposed a coupled hydrological-geotechnical model iCRESLIDE (Integration of Coupled Routing and Excess Storage and SLope-Infiltration-Distributed Equilibrium). The iCRESLIDE is designed to remedy the discrepancy of the original landslide model (SLIDE) by coupling with a hydrological model (CREST) and building an integrated system for predicting cascading storm-flood-landslides using remote sensing and geospatial datasets. This coupled system is implemented and evaluated in Macon County, North Carolina, where Hurricane Ivan triggered widespread landslides in September 2004 during the hurricane season. Model simulations from iCRESLIDE show its reliability to predict landslides occurrence (location and time). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrate that the iCRESLIDE has higher global accuracy (0.750) and higher sensitivity (11.36%) compared to the original SLIDE model. Such improved predictive performance demonstrates the advantage of coupling hydrological-geotechnical models, which calls more attentions and deserves further investigations in order to develop a not only geotechnical sound but also hydrological sensitive system for landslides early warning at regional scale.

Where is the extinct spreading ridge (ESR) of the East Sub-basin located? beneath the PSVR (Li et al., 2014)? Or intersecting with the PSVR by N055° orientation (Sibuet et al., submitted)?\nA three-dimensional Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) survey covered both the central extinct spreading ridge and the Zhenbei-Huangyan seamount chain, the IODP Site U1431 (Li et al., 2014) being located just north of the chain. The results of this experiment will provide the essential information to understand the emplacement of the PSVR within the previously formed oceanic crust. The comprehensive seismic record sections of 39 OBSs are of high quality and show clear and reliable P-wave seismic phases, such as Pg, Pn and PmP. These seismic arrivals provide strong constrains for modeling the detailed three-dimensional velocity structure. We will show that the crust is oceanic on each side of the Zhenbei-Huangyan seamount chain, where is the location of the ESR and what is the genetic relationship between the magma chambers and the overlying Zhenbei-Huangyan seamount chain. We suggest that the large thickness of the upper crust is possibly due to volcanic extrusions and the thickened lower crust to magmatic underplating. Combining previous geochemical study of PSVR outcropping samples, the formation mechanism of the seamount chain might be explained by a buoyancy decompression melting mechanism (Castillo et al., 2010).

This year’s session topics range from large-scale data management within global cyberinfrastructures or virtual observatories, to intelligent systems theory, semantics, and handling of near-real-time data streams, to issues of “dark data,” data transparency, reproducibility, and more. The aim of this lecture is to build in part on these themes but to consider more broadly how we might push the boundaries of informatics knowledge more along the lines of use-inspired science (responsive to the needs and perspectives of society while still being fundamental and cutting edge). To wit, as we contend with human impacts on the biosphere recent innovations in computational and data science are now facilitating community resilience to climate change (e.g., helping communities to monitoring air quality or drought, find available drinking water, determine habitat vulnerability, etc.). But not often discussed is a path toward digital resilience. If digital tools are to continue helping communities, it stands to reason that they must engender some resilience themselves. The capacity to deal effectively with change and threats, to recover quickly from challenges or difficulties, even to withstand stress and catastrophe, can apply to data too. As investments in digital data continue to rise, we find ourselves in new “digital world order” comprised of ubiquitous technologies from satellites to wristwatches to human biochip implants. And a significant proportion of these are geospatial, given the incredible power of maps to communicate, persuade, inspire, understand, and elicit action. Therefore, the lecture reviews and recommends seven fundamental digital research and communication practices. The aim is ensuring not only a modicum of resilience for our nascent discipline, but in prototyping and delivering repeatable solutions that all can use to help guide the planet towards a more resilient future.",

            "abstract": "In addition to an individual research project, many researchers are involved in at least one major partnership, perhaps one ocean observatory, or one collaborative. The accompanying data framework may be focused on a subdiscipline of oceanography (i.e., marine geology and geophysics, physical oceanography, marine ecology, etc.) or particular study region. The data framework obviously exists to support research, but also collaboration in data collection, spatial analysis, visualization, and communication of the science to multiple audience. These interactions likely take place at multiple scales: the scale of the individual researcher, of small workgroups within a lab, or of inter-organizational collaboration. There are also frameworks that cut horizontally across discipline and region, connecting to broader national or global initiatives such as NSF EarthCube, other NSF-funded Research Coordination Networks, GEOSS, or ODIP. The Living Atlas of the World is presented as a use case of a data framework seeking to cut effectively across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The Living Atlas was first created in 2014 to make authoritative geographic information accessible via hosted cloud services so that users could more quickly address scientific and societal problems and decisions at spatial scales ranging from a small study area the entire globe, while using a range of interactive map functions to tell engaging narratives along the way (aka “story maps”). What began as a way to build trusted, authoritative, and freely available *basemaps* from data contributed online by the GIS community, has grown to a larger program extending far beyond basemap layers to satellite imagery, bathymetry, water column layers, and hydrology, as well elevation, human population, and 3D web scenes. The Living Atlas is continually under construction with new efforts that now extend beyond just the reading and serving of dataset, to the provisioning of spatial analysis on these *data services* in the cloud, as well as the crosswalking and sharing of workflows and use cases, additional apps for mobile, web, and desktop, community-building events where people gather face-to-face, and close interlinkages to other platforms such as ODIP and NSF EarthCube.",

            "abstract": "For 40 years the cost of Solar Photovoltaics (PV) has decreased by a factor of 2 for every 10X increase in its cumulative-installed electric-generating capacity (CC). The straight line, log-log, experimental and historical data fit of cost versus CC is called Swanson’s Law for its accurate fit of the rapid decrease in cost over 6 orders of magnitude increase in CC with time. Now Solar PV is cost competitive with coal and natural gas in some regions and provides 1% of the world’s electric generating capacity. The Law can next be tested to predict the future. With 2 more orders of magnitude increase in CC, Solar PV could provide 10% and then 100% of the world’s current electric capacity, as the Law projects costs falling by another factor of 4. For the last 10 years CC has doubled every 2 years under strong public policy support. If this doubling and policy support are extended, an order-of-magnitude increase (10X) will occur every 6.6 yrs and installed solar PV capacity could reach 100% of the current world’s consumption in 13 years or by 2028.\nThe world’s solar resource, accessible indefinitely and yearly to PV, is over 1000 times current consumption while coal, uranium, petroleum and natural gas are finite, limited resources, destined to be depleted within our lifetimes or the lives of our children or grandchildren.\nIn 2015 a 56 MW fossil fueled power plant was shut down at Stanford University and replaced with Solar PV and geothermal to save money and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. If more such shut downs could follow this same 2 year doubling time as Solar PV, then the replacements could exceed 14,000 within 26 years or by 2041, including all 7000 current coal-fired plants plus an equivalent number fueled by uranium, petroleum and natural gas. These shut-downs, including all current fossil-fueled-power plants, could start reversing the human-generated, greenhouse-gas-induced, global climate changes by 2041.",

            "abstract": "Variations in the spectral content of volcano seismicity can relate to changes in volcanic activity. Low-frequency seismic signals often precede or accompany volcanic eruptions. However, they are commonly manually identified in spectra or spectrograms, and their definition in spectral space differs from one volcanic setting to the next. Increasingly long time series of monitoring data at volcano observatories require automated tools to facilitate rapid processing and aid with pattern identification related to impending eruptions. Furthermore, knowledge transfer between volcanic settings is difficult if the methods to identify and analyze the characteristics of seismic signals differ.\nTo address these challenges we evaluate whether a machine learning technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can be used to characterize the dominant spectral components of volcano seismicity without the need for any a priori knowledge of different signal classes. This could reduce the dimensions of the spectral space typically analyzed by orders of magnitude, and enable rapid processing and visualization. Preliminary results suggest that the temporal evolution of volcano seismicity at Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i, can be reduced to as few as 2 spectral components by using a combination of SOMs and cluster analysis. We will further refine our methodology with several datasets from Hawai`i and Alaska, among others, and compare it to other techniques.",

            "abstract": "Forest cover attenuation of microwave emission is a significant challenge to the estimation of snow accumulation by remote sensing microwave observations because canopy biomass can attenuate understory snowcover emission and can produce additional emission to that generated by the snowpack and sub-nivean surface. Transmissivity of radiation is the variable that describes how a tree canopy attenuates microwave emission from the ground. Although transmissivity can be measured in the field or estimated by models using field data at the in situ scale, the estimation of transmissivity at regional to global scales is a challenge. Therefore, following the work of Metsamaki et al. (2005), a transmissivity model that uses reflectance data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in snow covered areas (SCA) and adjacent non-snow covered areas is applied to estimate transmissivity at regional scales. In essence, given snow covered forest and adjacent snow covered open areas, the difference in reflectance between these two landscapes will be due to forest attenuation of light which in turn is a function of forest transmissivity. In the work of Metsämaki et al. (2005) transmissivity estimates are a bi-product of the Snow Cover Area model (SCAmod) approach and are applicable to mid- to high-latitude regions where seasonal snow persists. While transmissivity estimates cannot be estimated in dominantly snow-free lower latitude regions, the MOD44B land cover data set is used to extend SCAmod transmissivity data into these lower latitude regions. The influence of vegetation on passive microwave brightness temperatures is explored by comparing the brightness temperatures (Tbs) Tbs in open areas with Tbs in forest covered areas. A regression model between the Tbs contributed by the vegetation and transmissivity was derived. In general, the brightness temperature contributed by the vegetation increases with the increase of forest vegetation density (decrease of the transmissivity). Vegetation tends to contribute more emission in a higher frequency bands or in a horizontally-polarized bands. Application of the transmissivity estimates are used to correct Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer brightness temperatures for snow water equivalent and snow depth estimates in forested regions.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire emissions are an important source of a wide range of trace gases and particles that can impact local, regional and global air quality, climate forcing, biogeochemical cycles and human health. In the western US, wildfires dominate over prescribed fires. However, limited sampling of wildfire emissions means western US emission estimates rely largely on data from prescribed fires, which may not be a suitable proxy for wildfire emissions. Further, interactions of wildfire emissions with urban pollution, commonly the case with California wildfires, are complex and poorly understood.\nThe Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) sampled a variety of Californian wildfire plumes during 2013 and 2014. In addition to wildfire plumes, flights sample upwind, background conditions allowing for an assessment of enhancement ratios of trace gas species (carbon dioxide, methane and ozone).\nThis paper presents airborne measurements of multiple trace constituents downwind of a variety of Californian wildfires, with a focus on the exceptionally large Yosemite Rim wildfire during summer 2013. During its intense burning phases, the Rim wildfire was sampled by AJAX on 29 August as well as by the NASA DC-8, as part of its SEAC4RS mission, on 26 and 27 August. AJAX revisited the wildfire on 10 September when it had reached its smoldering phase. The more extensive payload of the DC-8 helped to bridge key measurements that were not available as part of the AJAX payload (e. g. carbon monoxide). The emission ratios (ER), emission factors (EF) and combustion efficiency are compared with previous wildfire studies.\nIntegration of AJAX data with other available datasets, such as SEAC4RS, Lidar data from the California State University Mobile Atmospheric Profiling System (CSU-MAPS), MODIS/VIIRS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and surface ozone and meteorology measurements is explored to assess the impacts of wildfires on downwind air quality including the densely populated California central valley.",

            "abstract": "The plumbing system of stratovolcanoes (i.e. emplacement of magmatic feeder dikes) mainly depends on the state of stress in the crust and the regional tectonics; yet, the effect of local tectonic deformation on the plumbing system is poorly understood. Scoria cones are considered proxies of magmatic feeder dikes; hence, their study provides insights on the factors controlling their emplacement. Here, we investigate the satellite scoria cones at Llaima volcano, Chile, and their relation to the local tectonic deformation generated by the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault Zone (LOFZ). Based on petrologic characteristics, two groups of scoria cones have been recognized. The first group exhibits glomeroporphyritic textures (ol, cpx, pg), kinked Crystal Size Distributions (CSD) and calculated mineral residence-times up to 20 years. Conversely, the second group exhibits pilotaxitic textures (pg, cpx), log-linear CSDs and residence-times up to 4 years. Whole-rock chemistry compositions are less evolved (50.0-53.5 wt.% SiO2; 4.0-6.0 wt.% MgO; 10-110 ppm Cr) in the first group, than in the second group (53.5-60.0 wt.% SiO2; 2.0-4.0 wt.% MgO; 10-50 ppm Cr). The spatial location of cones is consistent with local tectonic deformation generated by coeval antithetic and synthetic faults, at the northern-end of the LOFZ. The pilotaxitic cones seem to be associated to extensive regimes; while the glomeroporphyritic cones seems to be controlled by the regional stress. Zones of crustal compression do not display scoria cones. We conclude that at Llaima, both the location and composition of scoria cones are the result of the interplay between magmatic processes and local tectonic deformation. Magma recharge and volatile exsolution generated overpressure at the chamber, which controlled the emplacement of the glomeroporphyritic cones. In contrast, local tectonic extension controlled the emplacement of the pilotaxitic cones, which were fed by a fractionating magma that underwent sudden decompression.",

            "abstract": "CMEs have been identified as a prime causal link between solar activity and large, nonrecurrent geomagnetic storm. In order to improve geomagnetic storm predictions, a careful study of CME's propagation characteristics is important. Here, we analyze and quantitatively study the evolution and propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) launched at several positions into a structured real ambient solar wind by using a three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. The ambient solar wind structure during Carrington rotation 2095 is selected, which is an appropriate around activity minimum and declining phase. The CME is initiated by a simple spherical plasmoid model: a spheromak magnetic structure with high speed, high pressure and high plasma density plasmoid. We present a detailed analysis of the plasma, magnetic field, geoeffectiveness, and composition signatures of these CMEs. Results show that the motion and local appearance of a CME in interplanetary space is strongly affected by its interaction with the background solar wind structure, including its velocity, density, and magnetic structures. The simulations show that the initial launched position substantially affects the IP evolution of the CMEs influencing the propagation velocity, the shape, the trajectory and even the geo-effectiveness",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is vital for a better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of the global carbon cycle. In this study we estimated GPP in North America (NA), using the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), MODIS images at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolution, and NCEP-NARR reanalysis climate data. The simulated GPP (GPPVPM) agreed well with the flux tower derived GPP (GPPEC) at 39 AmeriFlux sites (155 site-years). The GPPVPM in 2010 was spatially aggregated to 0.5 by 0.5 degree grid cell, and then evaluated with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data from GOME-2, which is often regarded as the proxy of direct measurement of vegetation photosynthesis. There were good agreements in spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics between GPPVPM and SIF. At biome scale, the relationship between GPPVPM and SIF showed strong linear correlations (R2 > 0.95) and small variations of slopes (4.60 – 5.55 g C m-2 year-1 / (mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1)). The total annual GPPVPM in NA in 2010 was approximately 13.53 Pg C year-1, which accounted for ~11.0% of the global terrestrial GPP and was within the range of annual GPP estimates from several other process-based and data-driven models (11.35 – 22.23 Pg C year-1). Forests contributed most (4.17 Pg C year-1) to the annual GPP in NA. Evergreen broadleaf forests were most productive with an average annual GPP exceeding 2000 g C m-2 year-1. The results from this study has demonstrated the reliable performance of VPM at the continental scale, and the resultant GPP product at 500-m spatial resolution provides more opportunities to improve the studies of carbon cycle, model inter-comparison, and benchmarking.",

            "abstract": "In surface water, environmental contaminants can undergo a range of natural transformation processes mediated by biodegradation, adsorption, and photodegradation. Understanding these processes can help develop more effective remediation strategies. One method that can be used, Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA), is based on the faster reaction rates of molecules containing light (e.g., 12C) versus heavy (e.g., 13C) isotopes. While CSIA is widely used to study the fate and removal of groundwater contaminants, to date, its application to more complex environments such as surface waters is very limited.\nThe objective of this study was to use CSIA to better understand the reaction mechanisms of substituted chlorobenzenes during their aqueous photodegradation. We conducted laboratory experiments using a temperature-controlled photoreactor, and focused on: dichlorobenzene (DCB) isomers, i.e., 1,2-DCB, 1,3-DCB, and 1,4-DCB; 3- and 4-chloromethylbenzene (3- and 4-CMB); and 3- and 4-nitrochlorobenzene (3- and 4-NCB).\nThe results showed that experiments conducted in the absence of light and those focusing on direct photodegradation (i.e., when molecules directly absorb light) showed no significant carbon isotope fractionation. During indirect photodegradation, involving reactions with OH radicals, the CMBs reacted the fastest (first-order reaction rate constant, kCH3 > 1.2 h-1), whereas NCB reacted the slowest (kNO2 < 0.02 h-1). The most pronounced isotope fractionation was observed for the NCBs (up to enrichment factors of -4.8±0.5‰) whereas the least significant were for the CMBs (≤ -1.0±0.1‰). A Hammett plot of these results suggests that reaction rates increase in concert with electron donating groups as present in DCBs and NCBs.\nThese results are among the first successful attempts to apply CSIA to new environments such as surface waters, and transformation reactions such as photodegradation. They suggest that CSIA has the potential to identify chemical reaction mechanisms and distinguish between transformation processes.",

            "abstract": "After over one hundred years of research since the Moho was discovered by seismic refraction, the seemingly straightforward, essential goal of building a global model of the crust is still an on-going endeavor. In addition to seismic refraction/reflection and dispersion of surface waves, scattered wavefield on the receiver-side generated by distant earthquakes (crustal receiver functions) made significant contributions to this effort. However, the most commonly used phase, Ps, is quite small and requires stacking of data from many earthquake sources. To this end, virtual deep seismic sounding (VDSS), which uses SV-to-P conversion off the free surface as a virtual source to generate P-wave reflection off the Moho ( SsPmp phase), has been shown to be effective.\nAt distances less than about 55°, the reflection off the Moho is post-critical, resulting in large amplitudes. Thus, high-quality data from a single earthquake, with no stacking and little filtering, yield a clear signal from the Moho. To minimize source-side scattering, the sources were originally limited to deep earthquakes. Lately, using particle motions, this limitation was overcome by separating P- and S-wave portions of the signal and remove source-side scattering by deconvolution. This advance paves the way for using the large move-out of SsPmp to minimize the trade-off between crustal thickness and the average speed of P-waves in the crust. VDSS has been successfully applied to array data over apertures of more than 1,000 km and in places where the crustal thickness reaches 75 km. Simplicity of the VDSS, deep-penetrating power of earthquakes, low cost and minimal environmental impact attest to the potential of this robust method for providing a uniform measure of crustal thickness when details of the Moho are not the primary concern.",

            "abstract": "To constrain the Holocene history of the North American flux lobe we present new relative paleointensity (RPI) and paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) data from Fish Lake, Harney County Oregon. Located high on Steens Mt, Fish Lake (42° 44' 15\" N, 118° 38' 57\" W, 2,246.7 m) is the largest of several lakes in the Fish Lake glacial valley. Cored along with Pate Lake in the summer of 2012, sediment from four offset holes were cored to a maximum depth of 9 m using a UWITEC coring system. Field based magnetic susceptibility insured that a completely duplicated sediment sequence was recovered. Computer tomographic scans confirmed the quality of the recovered sediment and allowed precise mapping of overlapping sequences. Additional physical properties data, along with Pb-210, radiocarbon dating and discrete tephra layers, including Mazama, tightly constrain this sequence from -0.06 to 14 ka. Progressive alternating field demagnetization of u-channel samples demonstrate that a consistently strong, stable, and low coercivity magnetization is preserved, with low MAD values both before and after deconvolution. Inclinations vary around expected values for the site latitude, with no evidence for inclination shallowing as suggested in previous studies. Declination was reconstructed by initially rotating the declination of each drive to a mean of zero, then further rotating to achieve maximum alignment of overlapping sections, followed by a final rotation of the entire sequence base upon a 400 yr historical model calibration. Remanence is normalized using ARM acquisition, ARM demagnetization, and IRM demagnetization and agreement between these suggests that RPI is preserved. RPI from Fish Lake provides a previously missing proxy for the North American flux lobe that invites comparison with other high quality, high resolution, and independently dated paleomagnetic and archeomagnetic records from the NE Pacific to Europe; allowing us to tease out modes of variability of a large part of the geomagnetic field.",

Most of the published attempts to survey stratospheric microorganisms by the scientific community have involved heavy devices that could not be used on ultralight weight balloons, making this research expensive and thereby reducing the opportunities for sampling. In this project, we attempted to find how high a light weight balloon could collect microorganisms, and to bridge scientific study with hobbyist feasibility at lower cost. Our approach was to use hobbyist level items that lower the weight so that lighter weather balloons could be used. This approach will allow more sampling possibilities while also lowering cost of study. We have conducted two successful test flights. While there were no successful samples from the upper atmosphere, the fact that the system can capture surface organisms with the fact that sensors had viable data shows that anyone with interest can help find and study atmospheric microorganisms.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, ∼55 million years before present, was a period of rapid warming marked by a negative carbon isotope excursion and widespread dissolution of seafloor carbonate. These changes have been attributed to a massive release of carbon into the exogenic carbon cycle, and thus, the event provides an analog for future climate and environmental changes given the current anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Previous attempts to constrain the amount of carbon released have produced widely diverging results, between 2000 and 10,000 gigatons carbon (GtC). Sediment records indicate that acidification of deep waters was generally more extensive and severe in the Atlantic and Caribbean regions, with more modest changes in the Southern and Pacific Oceans. Here we compare simulations integrated with the UVic Earth System Climate Model with reconstructions of temperature and dissolution to present a mechanism that might explain the observed spatial differences and to constrain the total mass of carbon released. Due to the late Paleocene topography, highly corrosive waters accumulate in the deep North Atlantic before the PETM in our simulations. Several thousand years into the event, deep ocean warming destabilizes the North Atlantic water column and triggers deep water formation. This causes the corrosive bottom water to spill over an equatorial sill into the South Atlantic and through the Southern and Pacific Oceans, progressively gaining alkalinity. The simulated pattern of sediment dissolution along the path taken by this corrosive water is consistent with most dissolution estimates made from CaCO3 measurements in the Paleocene-Eocene sediment record. We find two scenarios that agree best with proxy data: a carbon release of 7000 GtC in combination with pre-event atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 840 ppm and a carbon release of 7000-10,000 GtC with pre-event CO2 concentrations of 1680 ppm.",

For the same we have used the seismic data of 22 three component broadband seismometers having a sampling rate of 100 samples/s that were operated and maintained by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun in this region from 2004 to 2013. A total of 476 local seismic events having their epicentres within the NW Himalaya with more than six p and s phases were located initially with the HYPO 71 program and the priori velocity model. Out of this 476 seismic events a mere 125 events with maximum least square residual error of 0.40s was used for travel-time inversion. After a number of iterations for the above mentioned dataset we observed that the least square residual misfit is almost constant at 0.03s. This shows that the iteration has reached its final solution and the velocity model obtained is the minimum 1 D velocity model. The resulting relocation shows a maximum seismicity upto a depth of 30 Km which matched with the ongoing tectonic activity in the region. Later the JHD technique is applied taking the station corrections into account for testing the accuracy of the model and we observed that the misfit in hypocentre location has reduced to ±1 km which confirms the accuracy and stability of the proposed 1 D velocity model.",

Microorganisms can reduce soil organic matter under\nanaerobic conditions, and biotically-reduced soil organic matter can abiotically donate electrons to ferric\noxides. Such soil organic matter-mediated electron transport can facilitate the interactions between\nmicroorganisms and insoluble terminal electron acceptors, i.e. iron minerals. Most previous studies have\nbeen focused on the electron shuttling processes through dissolved soil organic matter, and scant\ninformation is available for solid-phase soil organic matter. In this study, we aim to quantify the electron\naccepting capacity for solid-phase organic matter in soils collected from four different forests in the\nUnited States, including Truckee (CA), Little Valley (NV), Howland (ME) and Hart (MI). We used\nShewanella oneidensisMR-1 to biotically reduce soil slurries, and then quantified the electrons\ntransferred to solid-phase and solution-phase organic matter by reacting them with Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic\nacid (Fe(III)-NTA). The generation of Fe(II) was measured by a ferrozine assay to calculate the electron\naccepting capacity of soil organic matter. Our preliminary results showed that the Truckee soil organic\nmatter can accept 0.51±0.07 mM e-/mol carbon. We will measure the electron accepting capacity for four\ndifferent soils and correlate them to the physicochemical properties of soils.

            "abstract": "Fractures provide significant conduits for fluid flow in tight (low porosity) reservoirs. Hydraulic fracturing is often used to create fractures and thus to increase permeability and enhance hydrocarbon recovery. Although such technique is commonly used in the petroleum and geothermal industry, the relationships between reservoir rock, stress and fracture formation are not well understood partly because the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of subsurface fractures is difficult to image directly at the resolutions required. Microtomography enables the observation of 3D internal structures (both pores and fractures) of rocks at micro-scale. Fractures at micro-scale show similarity with those at macro-scale and can be described by power-laws based on previous two-dimensional (2D) studies of fractures. Aiming to establish the scaling law of fractures in 3D space, we characterize fractures in microtomographic images in this study. In our workflow the first crucial step is to identify individual fractures in the 3D network. Starting from 2D, percolation theory is used to detect the connectivity of fractures, and a modified moving window method is used to detect the strike of a fracture – by changing the placement of the moving window following the intersection of the fracture and the boundary until the end point of the fracture is found. The 3D topology of a fracture is determined by the analysis of the connectivity of fractures in 2D slices. Once individual fractures are identified and registered, the characterization of fractures can then be achievable. Direct characterization parameters include the position of each fracture, the size (in voxels), orientation, and dimensions in three principal orientations. Derivative parameters include the density of fractures, the density of intersections, and the statistics of the direct parameters. This technical progress promises further development of the multi-scale analysis of reservoir fractures.",

            "abstract": "Over 2000 years ago Sri Lanka was known as the granary of the east. This distinction was achieved with a massive rice production aided by an efficient irrigation system. The basic structural unit of this irrigation system -with thousands of man-made lakes- was a large reservoir collecting rain water from tributaries and redistributing it to a cascade of rice paddy farms. The rice cultivation used organic fertilizer and natural pesticides made from ancient Ayurvedic recipes.\nThe sociopolitical changes initiated in the county in 1977 resulted in a modernized agricultural economy with the renovation of the old irrigation system. Heavy use of pesticides, mostly Glyphosate (brand name \"Round Up\") with government subsidized cheap synthetic fertilizer (mostly triple phosphate) contaminated with heavy metals, including Arsenic and Cadmium, became a common practice. As a result, the shallow aquifers in the lowest lying areas, recharged by the irrigation water, was contaminated with Calcium, Magnesium phosphates, and the heavy metals, rendering the drinking water from shallow wells in these areas, extremely hard and unpalatable. The practice of drinking water from the shallow wells in low lying areas, most of which are abandoned now, and the use and spraying of pesticides particularly Glyphosate (often without proper personal protective equipment) have been identified in a case control study, as the main risk factors responsible for a massive epidemic of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affecting 450,000 young farmers, resulting in 23,000 deaths. It is hypothesized that the Glyphosate chelates heavy metals delivering it to the kidney, with contaminated drinking water and food, causing progressive kidney damage. The same irrigation system that contributed to past prosperity has now become a scourge within the realm of a modernized agriculture. Climatic variations, global warming and severe dehydration also have been identified as contributory factors. Similar CKD epidemic killing thousands of sugar cane farmers, in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua have been documented. The same risk factors (particularly the use of Glyphosate and dehydration) may be at play in these countries but at different levels of intensity.",

After estimating future PMPs using future rainfall and dew point temperature information under the Korea Meteorological Administration AR5 RCP 8.5, changes in the PMPs under climate change will be investigated by comparison with present and future PMPs. By separating the changes in PMPs under climate change into the changes caused by rainfall and dew point temperature, the relative impact of future rainfall and dew point temperature information under climate change on future PMPs is quantified.\n<Acknowledgement>\nThis research was supported by a grant ‘Development of the Evaluation Technology for Complex Causes of Inundation Vulnerability and the Response Plans in Coastal Urban Areas for Adaptation to Climate Change’ [MPSS-NH-2015-77] from the Natural Hazard Mitigation Research Group, Ministry of Public Safety and Security of Korea. \n ",

These are believed to form even more massive organic aerosols termed tholins which fall to lower altitudes where they make up the distinct haze layers, and eventually rain down onto Titan’s surface perhaps forming the organic-rich dunes.\nVery tenuous atmospheres were predicted at the smaller icy moons of Saturn [Sittler et al., 2004; Saur and Strobel, 2005], and subsequently detected [Teolis et al., 2010; Tokar et al., 2012]. These are produced when charged particles from Saturn’s magnetosphere interact with moon surfaces, ejecting neutral species. Some portion of these atmospheric neutrals will in turn become ionized and ‘picked up’ by Saturn’s corotating magnetosphere. These pickup ions will then move in cycloidal trajectories that we may intercept using the Cassini spacecraft, even at considerable distance from the moon itself.\nIn this fashion, negative and positive pickup ions have been used to infer a tenuous CO2-O2 atmosphere at Saturn’s moon Rhea [Teolis et al., 2010], and positive pickup ions at Dione [Tokar et al., 2012]. Here we report on the detection of negative pickup ions during a close flyby of Dione by the Cassini CAPS ELS instrument, and the implications that these observations may have for the Dionian atmosphere.\nChaizy, P., et al.

            "abstract": "Satellite retrievals of vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) normally do not explicitly account for aerosol optical effects and surface reflectance anisotropy that vary with space and time. Here, we conduct an improved retrieval of NO2VCDs over China, POMINO, from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and test the importance of aerosol and surface reflectance treatments. POMINO uses a parallelized LIDORT-driven AMFv6 package to derive tropospheric air mass factors, taking slant column densities from DOMINO v2. Prerequisite cloud optical properties are retrieved with a consistent procedure. Aerosol optical properties are taken from GEOS-Chem simulations with subsequent MODIS-based AOD constraints. MODIS bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data are used for surface reflectance over lands. Level-2 data for 2012 are aggregated into monthly means on a 0.25° long. x 0.25° lat. grid.\nPOMINO-retrieved annual mean NO2 VCDs vary from 15–25 x 1015 cm-2 over the polluted North China Plain (NCP) to below 1015 cm-2 over much of west China. The subsequently-constrained Chinese annual anthropogenic emissions are 9.05 TgN yr-1, an increase from 2006 (Lin, 2012) by about 19%. Replacing the MODIS BRDF data with the OMLER v1 monthly climatological albedo data affects NO2 VCDs by up to 40% for certain locations and seasons. The effect on constrained NOx emissions is small. Assuming no aerosols in the retrieval process (as the traditional “implicit” treatment) enhances annual mean NO2 VCDs by 15–40% over much of east China. Seasonally, NO2 VCDs are reduced by 10–20% over parts of the NCP in spring and over north China in winter, despite the general enhancements in summer and fall. The effect on subsequently-constrained annual emissions is -5–30% with large seasonal and spatial dependence. The implicit aerosol treatment also tends to exclude days with high pollution, an important sampling bias. We conclude that the POMINO approach will be useful for quantifying NOx pollution over China and other world regions with high aerosols and/or complex ground conditions.\nRef: Lin, J.-T. et al.: Influence of aerosols and surface reflectance on satellite NO2 retrieval: Seasonal and spatial characteristics and implications for NOx emission constraints, ACPD, 15, 1-62, 2015",

            "abstract": "Two independent studies were undertaken to use anthropogenic emissions to investigate natural systems using a massive Porites coral taken from off the coast of Vietnam (12ο12’49.90”N, 109 ο18’17.51”E). Annual uptake of bomb radiocarbon (14CO2) was measured to investigate the impact of coastal upwelling; while Pb/Ca levels and Pb isotopes were measured to investigate oceanic infiltration of anthropogenic Pb. Both records reveal a signal of sub-surface seawater advection from the tropical North Pacific to the South China Sea (SCS) providing independent evidence for the source and delivery time of the upwelled water off the coast of Vietnam. The radiocarbon record, extending from 1900-1986 at ~annual resolution, shows a post-bomb peak lower and broader than those found from other corals in the SCS and Japan, but higher than those found in the Makassar Strait in Indonesia. The Makassar coral experiences three water masses: the South Equatorial Current (SEC), upwelled and SCS water. The SEC has a relatively low radiocarbon content. However, water in the SCS does not mix with SEC water that enters the Indonesia Seas via the Halmahera as the main throughflow is from north to south. Hence, the upwelling signature must be from the North Equatorial Current that enters from the Luzon strait at depth. Leaded gasoline was phased-out between 1997 and 2000 in most Asian countries, however unlike other regional records, the Pb/Ca of the coral continued to increase until 2004 indicating a non-atmospheric source of Pb to the region. Both records indicate the source of upwelled water from the tropical North Pacific at roughly ~100-200 meters with a transport time of >2-5 years. This water is carried westward, via the Luzon Strait and into the South China Sea, where is it upwelled during the summer months. A higher resolution study of this coral combined with other coral records from the region could further narrow the location and timing of the advection and upwelling.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the evolution in the geomagnetic reversal frequency over hundreds of million years is not a trivial matter. Beyond the fact that there are long periods without reversals, known as superchrons, and periods with many reversals, the way the reversal frequency changes through time during reversing periods is still debated. A smooth evolution or a succession of stationary segments have both been suggested to account for the geomagnetic polarity time scale since the Middle-Late Jurassic. Sudden changes from a reversing mode to a non-reversing mode of the geodynamo may also well have happened, the switch between the two modes having then possibly been controlled by the thermal conditions at the core-mantle boundary. There is, nevertheless, a growing set of magnetostratigraphic data, which could help decipher a proper interpretation of the reversal history, in particular in the early Paleozoic and even during the Precambrian. Although yielding a fragmentary record, these data reveal the occurrence of both additional superchrons and periods characterized by extremely high, not to say extraordinary, magnetic reversal frequencies. In this talk, we will present a synthesis of these data, mainly obtained from Siberia, and discuss their implication for the magnetic reversal behavior over the past billion years.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s electron radiation belts are comprised of two distinct zones of trapped energetic electrons, separated by a ‘slot’ region. Responding uniquely to various magnetospheric processes, radiation belt electrons can exhibit different types of pitch angle distributions. Butterfly distributions, characterized by flux minima at pitch angles around 90º, are broadly observed in both the outer and inner belts and the slot region. Butterfly distributions close to the outer magnetospheric boundary have been attributed to drift shell splitting and losses to the magnetopause, however, its occurrence in other regions of the radiation belts has hitherto not been resolved. By analyzing the particle and wave data collected by the Van Allen Probes, we combine test particle calculations and Fokker-Planck simulations to reveal that scattering by equatorial magnetosonic waves is a significant cause for the formation of energetic electron butterfly distributions in the inner region of the magnetosphere. The recent March 17, 2015 storm show the creation of butterfly distributions of electrons up to 4 MeV under the impact of magnetosonic waves.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind creates a plasma bubble in our very local interstellar medium (VLISM), the heliosphere. Its structure is determined by dynamic processes and by the boundary conditions at the Sun and in the VLISM. Because of the supersonic expansion of the solar wind the structure of the inner (several AU) heliosphere is (nearly) exclusively determined by the Sun. As simple as this may all appear, the problem of linking heliospheric structure to solar features is remarkably complex and has so far eluded satisfactory solutions. ESA and NASA have implemented the Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions to tackle and solve the mystery of how the Sun creates and controls the heliosphere.\nPrevious missions, especially the twin Helios mission, lacked two crucial elements, remote-sensing of solar features and their dynamics, and composition measurements of the solar plasma, wind, and energetic particles. Solar Orbiter has both elements in its highly sophisticated payload and will allow us to link solar features to the solar wind sampled in situ by using composition and energetic particles as tracers. The composition of the solar wind is altered from its photospheric origin by two processes very probably acting at different altitudes in the solar atmosphere. Elemental composition of the solar wind appears to be fractionated by its First Ionization Potential (FIP) or time (FIT), indicating that some mechanism separates neutral atoms from ions. This requires temperatures low enough to allow a substantial neutral fraction of the solar plasma and therefore the FIP-effect is believed to act primarily in the chromosphere. Charge states on the other hand are determined by the expansion and acceleration of the solar wind and the electron temperature high in the corona. In the case of energetic particles, charge state composition affects measured elemental abundances by m/q-dependent acceleration/fractionation processes. Solar Orbiter will allow remote-sensing measurements of the elemental composition – and, to a limited degree – source temperatures of solar features such as coronal holes, active regions, or even flares. Comparison with in situ measurements of solar wind and energetic particle composition and their timing will provide key information about the linkage between Sun and heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "As observed again on the occasion of the November 2014 Nagano-ken Hokubu (Kamishiro Fault), Japan, earthquake, a shallow dip-slip earthquake usually gives asymmetric ground motion in the vicinity of the rupturing fault plane. In the Nagano event, although the dip angle of the associated fault plane is basically relatively large (40-70 degrees) and the plane is nearly vertical near the hypocenter, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) recorded on the hanging wall is some 2.5 times as large as that on the footwall at almost the same epicentral distance. However, the mechanical origin of this asymmetry has not been completely understood so far. Therefore, in this contribution, we investigate the rupture mechanics of a model dip-slip fault plane situated in a two-dimensional, monolithic (scenario I) or stratified (scenario II) linear elastic medium. In the numerical simulations, we employ our finite difference simulator developed on a PC basis, and in the laboratory fracture experiments, we utilize the technique of dynamic photoelasticity in conjunction with a high speed digital video camera system. Both numerically and experimentally, we observe the time-dependent dynamic wave field produced by the crack-like primary rupture along a flat fault plane, and notice that in the scenario I, as numerically predicted by Uenishi and Madariaga (Eos, 2005), geometrical asymmetry is required to have asymmetric seismic motion due to the propagation of the \"corner waves.\" The corner waves are generated by the dynamic interaction of Rayleigh-type waves that are produced by the primary fault rupture and the wave reflection at the free surface. In the scenario II, contrarily, asymmetric geometry is not needed: The (anti-)symmetry of mode-II (in-plane shear) motion in a geometrically symmetric model can be simply broken as soon as secondary fracture occurs at an interface between layers, and like in the 2014 earthquake in Nagano, rupture of a fault plane dipping at a relatively large angle can really produce larger dynamic stresses in the hanging wall than in the footwall.",

            "abstract": "Pure water ice dominates the composition of the micron and sub-micron sized dust particles in Saturn’s E-ring, a ring constantly replenished by active ice jets of the moon Enceladus [1]. Details about the composition of this tenuous, optically thin ring can only be constrained by in situ measurements. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) onboard Cassini investigates the composition of these grains by cationic time-of-flight mass spectra of individual ice grains hitting the instruments target surface. From these spectra three compositional types of E ring ice grains have been identified previously [2,3]: Type-1: Almost pure water, Type-2: Enriched in organics, and Type-3: Enriched in salt.\nUnlike Type-1 and 3, organic-enriched Type-2 spectra have not yet been investigated in depth. Here we report the first detailed compositional analysis of this type. The spectra analysis is supported by a large-scale laboratory ground campaign yielding a library of analogue spectra for organic material embedded in a water ice matrix.\nIn contrast to Type 1 and 3, Type-2 spectra display a great compositional diversity, which indicates varying contributions of several organic species. So far we have identified characteristic fragment patterns of at least three classes of organic compounds: aromatic species, amines, and carbonyl group species. Work is in progress to quantify concentrations of the identified species and to assign yet un-specified organic mass lines in Type 2 spectra.\nDue to the dynamical evolution of the orbital elements of E ring grains a large fraction collides with the icy moons embedded in the E ring. Therefore, the organic components identified by CDA can accumulate on the surfaces of these bodies over time.\nRef: :[1]Kempf et al., Icarus-206, 2010. [2]Postberg et al., Nature-459, 2009.

            "abstract": "This study proposes a new index for monitoring and predicting winter temperature of the Korean Peninsula based on dominant atmospheric winter teleconnection modes and the utilization of the index is extended further to representing the East Asia Winter Monsoon (EAWM). Among the teleconnection modes it is found that both East Atlantic (EA) and Western Pacific (WP) modes are most strongly correlated with the Korean winter temperature in a way that the modes are partly associated with change in sea level pressure (SLP) around the Korean Peninsula. Particularly, the EA and WP modes are related with SLP variation over both Siberian High region and the Kuroshio extension region to the east of Japan, respectively. Based on this relationship, the two boxed regions representing the northeast-southwest SLP gradients are determined for the new index, which is found to be related with the EAWM circulation. The SLP gradients control the intensity of surface winds blowing into the Korean Peninsula from the Siberian regions which can transport cold air. The index shows the best performance in representing winter climate not only for the Korean Peninsula but also for the East Asia among the SLP-based EAWM indices. Furthermore, the new index maintains a better correlation with the winter temperature of both the East Asia and Korea over a certain period of years (i.e., running 30 year periods) than other SLP based EAWM indices and also shows good performance in delineating extreme cold/warm winters. The predictability of the new index and its usable potential for winter temperature prediction in coupled climate models are assessed and discussed further.",

            "abstract": "An experimental nursery was established with two-year-old Pinus densiflora seedlings at Korea University to study soil microbial community responses to air warming (+3°C) and precipitation manipulation (-30% and +30%). Soil samplings were collected monthly from July to November, 2014. Substrate utilization profile of microbial community was examined using BIOLOG EcoPlate. Microbial community composition was assessed by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that warming significantly affected the substrate utilization profile of microbial community (P<0.05), which labile substrates were degraded more quickly in warming plots than unwarmed plots. Only significant effects of warming on fungal community richness and abundance were observed (all P<0.05). Compared with unwarmed and precipitation control treatment, fungal community richness in the others were significantly decreased by 1.22%-15.27% (P<0.05), but community diversity in those treatments were slightly increased (P>0.05). In contrast, compared with unwarmed and precipitation control treatment, the bacterial community richness in the others were increased, but community abundance and diversity in those treatments were decreased (all P>0.05). These changes in microbial community structure resulted in the changes in community functional composition, which microbial metabolic functions were higher in warming plots than unwarmed plots. Since microorganisms differ in their susceptibility to stressors, changes in the soil environment affect the microbial community. Therefore, the results indicated that effects of warming and precipitation manipulation on soil microbial community might be related to warming and precipitation manipulation-induced changes in soil moisture. We suggested that shifts in the microbial community may be important implications for soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a warmer world. This study was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2013R1A1A2012242).",

            "abstract": "This study reveals that sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas plays a crucial role in establishing a new Arctic coupled climate system. The early winter sea ice before 1998 shows double dipole patterns over the Arctic peripheral seas. This pattern, referred as the early winter quadrupole pattern, exhibits the anti-clockwise sequential sea ice anomalies propagation from the Greenland Sea, the Barents-Kara Seas, to the Bering Sea from October to December. This early winter in-phase ice variability contrasts to the out-of-phase relationship in the late winter. The mean temperature advection and stationary wave heat flux divergence associated with the atmospheric zonal wave-2 pattern are responsible for the early winter in-phase pattern.\nSince the end of last century, the early winter quadrupole pattern has broken down due to the rapid decline of sea ice extent in the Barents-Kara Seas. This remarkable ice retreat modifies the local ocean-atmosphere heat exchange, forcing an anomalous low air pressure over the Barents-Kara Seas. The subsequent collapse of the atmospheric zonal wave-2 pattern is likely responsible for the breakdown of the early winter sea ice quadrupole pattern after 1998. Therefore, the sea ice anomalies in the Barents-Kara Seas play a key role in establishing new atmosphere-sea ice coupled relationships in the warming Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity under background conditions and during polluted events (e.g. biomass burning) are investigated based on field measurements made at two distinct locations (Xianghe, Hebei and Xinzhou, Shanxi) in China. Our study is concerned with the impacts of aerosol physicochemical properties on its hygroscopicity and the efficiency as CCN. For particles in accumulated mode, the hygroscopicity parameter kappa (κ) under background conditions is ~20% higher than κ derived under polluted conditions; the situation is more complex especially for biomass burning influenced particles in nucleation or Aitken mode. Accordingly, the CCN nucleation efficiency of aerosols produced by local biomass burning was very low. This is because the particles were freshly emitted with low oxidation level organics and thus are less hygroscopic. The CCN activation efficiency was enhanced significantly when the site was under the influence of air transported from far away, during which aerosol properties changed with more hygroscopic secondary organic and inorganic components.\nWhile the particle number size distribution is found to play a dominant role in predicting (NCCN), a strong dependence of NCCN on the mass fraction of organics (xorg) was also noted. NCCN was underestimated by 52% and 13% at supersaturation levels of 0.13% and 0.76%, respectively, when xorg = 66%. NCCN was slightly overestimated, or in good agreement, with observations when xorg was reduced to 35% (R2=0.94). The applicability of the CCN activation spectrum obtained at Xinzhou to the Xianghe site, about 400 km to the northeast of Xinzhou, was investigated, with the goal of further examining the sensitivity of CCN to aerosol type. Overall, the mean CCN efficiency spectrum derived from Xinzhou performs well at Xianghe when the supersaturation levels are > 0.2% (overestimation of 2-4%). However, NCCN was overestimated by ~20% at supersaturation levels of < 0.1%. This suggests that the overestimation is mainly due to the smaller proportion of aged and oxidized organic aerosols present at Xianghe compared with Xinzhou.",

            "abstract": "To achieve sufficient, effective winter road maintenance, it is important that long-term snow and ice hazard mitigation plans be examined and formulated by taking into consideration the influence of climate change. In this study, we have developed a method of predicting more accurately the indexes of heavy snowfall events that occur over short periods of time and future projections of winter temperatures based on the relationship of observed data to the climate model predicted values. The indexes for heavy snowfall were the maximum 24-hour snowfall and the frequency of 10-cm or more snowfall within a maximum 6-hour period. Indexes for cold weather were the accumulated freezing index in winter and the number of days of freeze-thaw days. Subsequently, we have applied this methodology for Japanese snowy cold regions, in order to clarify the trends for near future and century-end future period changes. The results indicate that current measures to mitigate the effects of extremely heavy snowfall in inland areas of Hokkaido may require enhancement of operational procedures. In addition, the possibility of pavement and concrete damage in the colder regions is expected to increase due to the increment in the number of freeze-thaw days. Based upon the results of this study, we will identify the road management issues associated with climate change using the recent trends and predictions for the near future and century-end future climate periods.",

            "abstract": "In carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems supercritical CO2 is injected into a reservoir and dissolves in the reservoir brine. Subsequently, CO2(aq) diffuses into the cap rock to regions of lower total pressure and temperature and triggers CO2-water-rock interactions that are coupled with mass transport and result in precipitation and/or dissolution of minerals along the CO2 migration path. Such hydrogeochemical interactions change porosities and are responsible for the improvement or deterioration of the long term integrity of the system.\nThis study presents a semi-generic hydrogeochemical model based on chemical equilibrium thermodynamics, data from several CO2 storage systems, and plausible assumptions regarding non-available data. One-dimensional reactive transport modeling is performed by using the U.S.G.S. PHREEQC code (3.1.4-8929; phreeqc.dat database) to identify and quantify the loss or gain of total porosity affected by hydrogeochemical reactions driven by diffusive mass transport exposed to pressure and temperature gradients. A fine spatial and temporal discretization, the use of non-reactive tracers, and a broad variety of modeling scenarios enable the calculation of the relevant timescale for simulations of long-term storage of CO2 and the consideration of the pressure dependent mass action law constants along the CO2 migration path.\nModeling results show that the relevant timescale for simulations of long-term storage of CO2 is in the range of 106 years, and that pressure/temperature conditions, heterogeneities (veins and fractures) and the mineralogical composition of the cap rock have the strongest influence on the increase in cap rock porosity (maximum increase from initial 5 % to 7.5 %). Critical parameter combinations – total pressure effects are crucial – could put long-term integrity at risks. Nevertheless, a wide range of conditions and parameter combinations for safe CO2 storage is identified by other modeling scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Ascension Island, an isolated composite volcano in the south Atlantic, has a wide spectrum of explosive and effusive deposits. Eruptions on the island have produced ash and pumice fall deposits, ignimbrites, scoria cones, lava flows and lava domes, which vary in composition from basalt to rhyolite. We report, for the first time, the presence of multiple, zoned pumice fall deposits. These deposits grade upwards (stepwise or gradationally) from pumice to scoria. We present detailed observations of two key deposits which typify the range in zonation observed in the unusual fall units. Forensic examination of these deposits and their petrological and geochemical characteristics provide critical information about the interactions and processes behind the wide spectrum of magma compositions and past eruptive behaviour on Ascension Island. The first deposit changes gradationally from fayalite-bearing trachytic pumice fall (61.1 wt.% SiO2) at the base, to basaltic trachy-andesite scoria fall (54.5 wt.% SiO2) at the top. The second deposit is more complex. It contains mingled pumice-scoria clasts, has a rapid transition from pumice to scoria and no intermediate clasts were observed. New analyses of H2O, CO2 and key trace elements within melt inclusions combined with systematic whole rock and phenocryst analyses enable us to probe the relationship of these co-erupted magmas to other deposits on the island. This has yielded insights into the magma plumbing system; and improved understanding of the roles that fractional crystallisation and magma mixing play in generating the range in compositions observed at this unique ocean island volcano.",

Instead, this region around La Plata Island experienced periodic seismic swarms as those in 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2010.\nDuring the 2010 swarm, a permanent GPS at La Plata Is. detected a 4-5 days long slow slip event (SSE) with a magnitude 6-6.3 Mw. It was accompanied by an intense microseismicity located downdip of the locked patch centered in the island (Vallée et al., 2013).\nAn onshore-offshore seismic network consisting of 7 BB and 5 OBS deployed in this area recorded the background seismicity during 2 years starting in Nov. 2011.\nIn mid-Jan. 2013, the network recorded an increase in the seismicity around the island (~1000 eqs. from which ~400 were well localized). At the same time La Plata GPS showed a trenchward displacement during 3-4 days. The seismicity lasted ~6 days and possibly started ~0.5 day before the onset of the motion. It started south of the island and it propagated bilaterally northeastward and southwestward. It was organized in 3 lines almost parallel to the tectonic lineations in the subducting oceanic crust observed west of the trench. These lines may mark topographic highs in the plunging plate related to inherited and/or extrados-type fault due to the bending during the subduction, which are acting as seismic asperities.\nThe earthquakes were located in the vicinity of the interface in the lower third of the locked zone, whereas, before the SSE, the seismicity was mostly deeper inland along the plate interface but also along crustal faults. The magnitudes ranged from 2-4.5 (Ml) lower than those of the background seismicity during our experiment (4.7 Ml).\nThis SSE likely occurred at shallow depth (10-15 km) along the megathrust fault. It triggered seismicity in areas that were quiet in the period immediately before. A bilateral migration and a possible control by the topography of the plunging plate are observed.",

Analysis of 8 different cases of marine stratocumuli, based on ~400 aircraft penetrations across the Entrainment Interfacial Layer (EIL), reveals a fine-layered structure of the cloud top and capping inversion. Despite maximum static stability, the inversion and the whole EIL remain turbulent with maximum turbulence intensity just below the cloud top. Anisotropy of velocity fluctuations in the turbulent inversion and the cloud top mixing sublayer indicates significant effect of static stability. The thickness of the EIL corresponds to the thickness of the shear layer in the cloud top region, and adapts to the velocity- and buoyancy-jump between the cloud layer and the free troposphere in such a way, that the gradient Richardson Number across the EIL and its sublayers remains critical. This, in turn, suggests that shear at the cloud top, not radiative cooling or large convective eddies in the boundary layer, is the source of the observed turbulence. This last supposition is confirmed by LES simulations based on data from the POST and DYCOMS-II campaigns. They document the importance of shear-generated turbulence in stratocumulus top dynamics and suggest that entrainment into the stratocumulus topped boundary layer depends on fine-scale properties of this turbulence.",

In theory, this can be an optimal use of scarce resources if crops are grown where they can most efficiently be produced. Several recent analyses examine the export of land and water from food production in developing countries where these resources may be more abundant.\nHere we focus on a developed region and examine the virtual export of land and water from California, the leading agricultural state in the US and the leading global producer of a wide range of fruit, nut, and other specialty crops. As the region faces a serious, ongoing drought, water use is being questioned, and water policy governance re-examined, particularly in the agricultural sector which uses over three-quarters of water appropriations in the state.\nWe look at the blue water embodied in the most widely grown crops in California and use network analysis to examine the trading patterns for flows of virtual land and water. We identify the main crops and export partners representing the majority of water exports. Considered in the context of tradeoffs for land and water resources, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for food production systems to play a sustainable role in meeting human needs while protecting the life-support systems of the planet.",

This peculiar feature of the present geomagnetic field has an internal origin in a prominent patch of reversed polarity flux in the Earth’s outer core. The study of the SAA is an important challenge nowadays, not only for the geomagnetic and paleomagnetic community, but also for other areas focused on the Earth Observation because of the reducing protective role of the geomagnetic field against the charged particles coming from the Sun and forming the solar wind. The SAA has showed to be a persistent feature of the geomagnetic field since its extent at the Earth’s surface has increased during the last four centuries and even accelerated more recently. In this context, the ESA Swarm satellite mission is providing detailed measurements of the intensity and directional elements of the geomagnetic field with high-precision and resolution never reached in the former space missions. This work aims to analyze in detail in space and time the SAA from the core-mantle boundary up to satellite altitudes using the dataset provided by the Swarm satellites and all the available ground-based data.",

            "abstract": "COPA is the passive source component of a multi-method geophysical program aimed at assessing the mineral deposits potential of the Proterozoic Capricorn Orogen.\nPrevious results from the active source surveys, receiver functions and magnetotelluric studies show reworked orogenic crust in the orogen that contrasts with more simple crust in the neighbouring Archean cratons, suggesting progressive and punctuated collisional processes during the final amalgamation of the Western Australian craton. Previous seismic studies are all based on line deployment or single station analyses; therefore it is essential to develop 3D seismic images to test whether these observations are representative for the whole orogen.\nWith a careful design that takes advantage of previous passive source surveys, the current long-term and short-term deployments span an area of approximately 500 x 500 km. The 36-month total deployment can guarantee enough data recording for 3D structure imaging using body wave tomography, ambient noise surface wave tomography and P- and S-wave receiver function Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking techniques. A successive instrument loan from the ANSIR national instrument pool, provided 34 broadband seismometers that have been deployed in the western half of the orogen since March 2014. We expect approximately 40-km lateral resolution near the surface for the techniques we propose, which due to low frequency nature of earthquake waves will degrade to about 100 km near the base of the cratonic lithosphere, which is expected at depths between 200 to 250 km.\nPreliminary results from the first half of the COPA deployment will be presented in the light of the hypotheses that 1) distinct crustal blocks can be detected continuously throughout the orogen (using ambient noise/body wave tomography); 2) distinct lithologies are present in the crust and upper mantle across the orogen (using receiver function CCP images); and 3) crustal and lithosphere deformation along craton margins in general follows the “wedge” tectonic model (e.g. subduction of Juvenile blocks under the craton mantle as represented by craton-ward dipping sutures.",

            "abstract": "Methane-rich fluids that are generated at depth in organic-rich deposits migrate within the sediments to the seafloor where they are expelled to form mud volcanoes or pockmarks. Moreover, these migrating fluids are involved in diagenetic processes as authigenic carbonate formation and they may participate to gas hydrate formation. These features are well-known in the present-day continental margins but their fossil records are relatively scarce. The outcropping Tortonian and Messinian marls in S.E. Spain basins (Lorca, Fortuna, Columbares, Huercal Overa) contain abundant authigenic dolomite nodules. The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of these dolomites exhibit wide ranges (-1.4 < δ18O < +5.6 ; -25.6 < δ13C < +9.3) indicating that carbonate precipitation occurred within the marly sediments due to circulation of fluids modified by gas hydrates formation/dissociation, where anaerobic oxidation of methane and methanogenesis were active. In the Huercal Overa basin, there is a well-preserved mud volcano intruding vertically the Messinian marls. These two features, methane derived authigenic dolomites and mud volcanism, are testifying of the intense methane-rich fluid migration in the marly deposits of the western Mediterranean basins during the late Neogene, which was the time of major paleoenvironmental changes in the Mediterranean sea climaxing during the Messinian salinity crisis.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological heterogeneity is often modeled using categorical geostatistics to differentiate between different hydrogeological units, but the method of dividing the hydrogeology into categories varies across the previous literature. Sedimentology classifications, percentile cutoffs of hydraulic conductivity, and geophysical image processing are examples of common techniques. These methods are often applied with the assumption that the field can be divided into only two categories, primarily due to sparse measurements and modeling ease. This poster depicts an analysis of particle paths through a three-dimensional high-resolution aquifer analog in order to provide better insight into what hydrogeological features are important to consider for improved task-oriented field site characterization. The role of each of the analog’s ten hydrofacies in the particle paths with respect to both time and distance are considered, and Markov clustering is applied to guide the combinations of hydrofacies by the particle path transition probabilities into categories in a hierarchical fashion. The analysis is applied for various portions of the particles’ arrival time distribution to highlight the need for a task-oriented perspective, such as when the left tail of the distribution is of interest for risk assessment. By taking into consideration which features of the hydrogeological heterogeneity drive the particular aspect of transport that needs to be predicted, the first step is taken towards capturing the relevant features in categorical geostatistics and thus stochastic modeling.",

Opening of the Eurasia Basin started here with the tear-off of the continental Lomonossov ridge. Here we present a couple of multichannel reflection seismic lines, covering an area from the Barents Shelf to 83.2 deg N. The profiles extend for about 275 km and 170 km, respectively from the Barents Sea margin (Hinlopen margin) into northern direction and cover together ~300 km of oceanic crust on two parallel lines. One connecting profile was acquired on oceanic crust crossing anomaly C23 (~50-52 Ma). The data were acquired during ice-free conditions and reveal for the first time the architecture of the oldest sediments deposited on the oceanic crust. We discuss the seismic facies of the oldest sediments on the oceanic crust and determine their age by correlation of onlap contacts onto oceanic crust with well defined magnetic anomalies. The lowermost sedimentary unit can be subdivided by at least one more prominent seismic reflector in the distal part of the Nansen Basin and two more seismic reflectors in the proximal part. Furthermore we present images and interpretations of oceanic crust formed at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge (< 20 mm yr-1 full rate). We discuss the basement morphology, volcanic cones and major faults, bounding horsts and grabens in the light of our present understanding of melt-poor ultraslow-spreading ridges.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic vegetation has a determining effect on flow and consequently sediment transport as it generates both skin friction and form drag. The measurement of flow above the vegetation canopy has received much attention and there is now a good process understanding of mean and turbulent flow, although, much of this research has focused on rigid vegetation with relatively simple morphology. However, vegetation immersed in a flow experiences several forces (buoyancy; drag; virtual mass; Basset; and Saffman) which are counteracted by the properties of the vegetation (flexural rigidity; modulus of elasticity; the plant area exposed to the flow and; the packing density of the stems). The ratio of these forces determines the plant motion characteristics which are generally classified as either i) erect with no movement; ii) gently swaying; iii) strong, coherent swaying or; iv) prone.\nHere we report on an investigation into the influence of plant motion on the turbulence structure in the mixing zone as vortices in this region have been shown to account for the majority of the momentum transport between the canopy and the open flow. We report on a series of flume experiments where flow over a canopy of surrogate aquatic vegetation was measured using PIV at a spatial resolution of ~1mm2 and at a temporal resolution of 100 Hz. This provided whole flow field measurements for all three components of flow over the vegetation canopy. Plant motion characteristics were altered by modifying the flow Reynolds number through both velocity and depth. The influences of plant stem length were also assessed. The measured flows were analysed by standard Reynolds decomposition approaches and Eulerian and Lagrangian coherent flow structure identification methods. Kelvin-Helmholtz and Görtler-type vortices were identified within the canopy shear layer that are generated close to the canopy top and evolve downstream into span-wise roller vortices, which expand with both distance and time. When there was no plant movement or gentle swaying, the results support existing canopy layer theory. However, when the canopy showed strong, coherent swaying, the flow pattern was far more complex. The implications of these flow structures on form drag and the dependency of the bulk drag coefficient on Reynolds number are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Salts are common on planetary surfaces, and sulfates have been widely observed on Earth, Mars (Gendrin et al., 2005) and on some of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s icy moons like Europa (Dalton et al., 2007). These minerals can form under a wide range of conditions, and the determination of sulfate formation processes can provide key elements for deciphering past planetary surface conditions. Most terrestrial sulfates form as evaporites in warm environments with high water/rock ratios, but these conditions are rarely encountered on other planets. Here we describe the formation of cryogenic sulfates in an extreme cold and dry environment: the Guanaco glacier located in the Chilean Andes (Fig.1a, Rabatel et al., 2011). Field analyses reveal that it is a cold-based glacier, its surface temperature remains below 0°C throughout the year, and ablation occurs mostly by sublimation. Ablation creates ice cliffs punctuated of pluricentimetric whitish, tapered crystals embedded in the ice (Fig.1b, c). By Raman and chemistry, they proved to be gypsum, covered by micrometric crystals of jarosite, halotrichite and native sulfur. The euhedral morphology of these soft minerals indicates that they are neoformed and have not been transported in the ice. This is supported by the absence of gypsum crystals in ice cores drilled through the glacier. We infer that the crystallization thus occurred at the glacier surface during ice sublimation and does not involve liquid water. To distinguish this original salt formation process from the more common evaporites, we name these minerals “sublimites”. Though this formation process is uncommon and generates minor quantities of sulfates on Earth, it may be dominant on other bodies in the Solar System where sublimation is effective. Examples of planetary sublimites may include gypsum on the North Polar Cap of Mars (Massé et al., 2012), and other sulfates on icy moons where sublimation has been observed (Howard et al., 2008).",

            "abstract": "Improved understanding of processes related to the evolution of stratocumulus clouds is needed, e.g. for more accurate prediction of weather and climate. As a supplement to measurements, numerical simulation is a widely used and valuable tool in stratocumulus studies. However, due to limited computational resources, simulations are often run at resolutions too coarse to account for the smallest eddies involved in e.g. the entrainment process, and possibly in computational domains too small to contain the largest relevant flow structures in the boundary layer. Here we investigate how changes in domain size and spatial resolution affect key parameters such as cloud cover and liquid water path in large-eddy simulations of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL). Details of the entrainment process and subsequent mixing within the STBL is studied by adding a passive scalar to the flow. We use a modified version of the 3D nonhydrostatic anelastic Eulerian-semi-Lagrangian (EULAG) model, and perform both simulations including an explicit sub-grid scale turbulence model and simulations in which the effect of unresolved turbulence is accounted for implicitly by the applied numerical scheme. The simulations are based on measurements from the second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS-II) and Physics of Stratocumulus Top (POST) field campaigns. We show how refining the horizontal resolution facilitate development of small-scale turbulence in the cloud-top region, which enhance entrainment and tends to dissolve the cloud. Refining the vertical grid spacing, on the other hand, allows for stronger vertical temperature gradients which tend to strengthen the capping inversion and inhibit entrainment. The statistics of the flow and the evolution of the cloud is found to be more sensitive to changes in resolution than to changes in domain size. We do however observe still larger flow structures as the horizontal extent of the computational domain is increased.",

            "abstract": "Global land-system change is influenced by a complex set of drivers that transcend spatial, institutional and temporal scales. The notion of “telecouplings” is gaining importance in Land System Science as a framework to address that complexity of drivers. One of them is the trade in land-based products, which forges connections between different geographic regions. Trade in land-based products is growing rapidly, thereby creating an increasing spatial disconnect between the locations where primary products (e.g. crops, fodder or timber) are grown and harvested and where the related environmental pressures occur, and the locations where final products (e.g. food, fiber or bioenergy) are consumed. Governing land-related sustainability issues such as GHG emissions or pressures on biodiversity and ecosystems related with land-use changes requires information on trade-related telecouplings, e.g. in order to avoid leakage effects. However, tracing land use (change) related with flows of traded products is challenging, among others due to (a) the lack of easily implementable metrics to account for differences in land quality and land-use intensity, and (b) the lack of satisfactory methods to allocate land to products that are traded and consumed. Drawing from a database derived from FAO statistics that allows tracing bilateral trade flows between ~200 countries at a resolution of ~500 products for the time period 1986-2006, this presentation will discuss how the framework of embodied human appropriation of net primary production (eHANPP) can help tackling these difficult issues. The HANPP framework allows to consistently represent important aspects of land quality and land-use intensity, e.g. natural productivity potential or land-use efficiency. In terms of allocation of land to products, eHANPP is a factor-based approach, and the presentation will discuss differences to alternative methods such as environmentally extended input-output analysis. We will use the available empirical results on eHANPP to demonstrate the growing importance of global telecouplings related to trade and to discuss the usefulness of that information to better manage ecosystems globally in an increasingly interconnected world.",

            "abstract": "In Chinese loess the Brunhes-Matuyama (B-M) geomagnetic reversal appears to occur about 25 ka prior to the established axial dipole reversal age found in many marine sediments, i.e., in Chinese loess this magnetic reversal boundary is found in glacial loess unit L8 which is thought to be correlated with Marine Isotope Stage 20 (MIS 20), in marine sediment records, however, this boundary is commonly found in interglacial period of MIS 19[1-2], leading to the debate on uncertainties of paleoclimatic correlation between the Chinese loess-paleosol sequences and marine sediments[3-5]. Based on this issue, here we propose to use the cosmogenic 10Be to address this conundrum. 10Be is a long-lived radionuclide produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray spallation reactions and carried to the ground attached to aerosols. Its atmospheric production rate is inversely proportional to the geomagnetic field intensity [6]. This allows us to reconstruct past geomagnetic field intensity variations using 10Be concentrations recorded in different sedimentary archives. We carried out both the 10Be studies and paleogeomagnetic measurements in Luochuan and Xifeng sections in Chinese Loess Plateau. Both loess profiles show that 10Be production rate was at a maximum-an indication of the dipole field reversal-at ca. 780 ± 3 ka BP., in paleosol unit S7 corresponding to MIS 19, proving that the timing of B-M reversal recorded in Chinese loess is synchronous with that seen in marine records [1]. These results reaffirmed the conventional paleoclimatic correlation of loess-paleosol sequences with marine isotope stages and the standard loess timescale as correct. However, it is ~25 ka younger than the age (depth) of the paleogeomagnetic measurements, which show that the B-M boundary is in L8 in these two Chinese loess-paleosol sequences, demonstrating that loess magnetic overprinting has occurred.\n1.Tauxe, L., et al., 1996, EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 140, 133–146\n2.Zhou, L.P., and Shackleton, 1999,EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 168,117-130\n3.Wang, X.S., et al., 2006,PHYS EARTH PLANET IN, 159, 109–117\n4.Liu, Q.S., et al., 2008, EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 275, 1–2,102–110\n5.Jin, C.S.,et al., 2011,PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL, 299, 309–317\n6.Masarik, J., and Beer, J., 1999, Jounal of Geophysical Research, 104, 12099-12111.",

            "abstract": "Based on gravity analysis and previous integrated studies combining potential fields and seismic data, we demonstrate that the Iberia-Africa plate boundary region is characterized by several tectonically inverted transtensional domains inherited from the Jurassic. Gravity data, when filtered for short wavelengths, show conspicuous positive Bouguer anomalies associated with the Gorringe Bank, the Guadalquivir Bank and the Ronda/Beni-Bousera peridotitic massifs. Gravity modelling combined with seismic and geological data shows that the filtered Bouguer anomalies are compatible with relatively high-density and shallow-buried bodies, which correspond to partly serpentinized peridotitic slices with similar densities and geometries as those proved for the Gorringe Bank. The study indicates that the Alpine convergence between Africa and Iberia since Late Cretaceous times reactivated these transtensional domains, which were less deformed westwards and thus preserved their segmentation. The interpretation of these Bouguer anomalies and their distribution substantiates the double-polarity subduction model proposed for the region, and agrees with the present-day seismically diffuse character of the Iberia-Africa plate boundary.",

The main goal of this study is to investigate the impact of this new gravity field and its processed anomalies (Bouguer, Free-air and Vening-Meinesz residual fields) on lithospheric modelling of passive plate margins in the area of the Southern Atlantic. In an area fixed by the latitudes 20° N – 50° S and longitudes 70° W - 20° E we calculated station-complete Bouguer anomalies (bathymetry/topography corrected) both on- and offshore and compared them with the gravity effect of a velocity model which bases on S - waves tomography (Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013). The corresponding maps provide more insight in the abnormal mass distribution of oceanic lithosphere and the ocean-continent transition zones on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean than Free-air anomalies which are masked by bathymetry. In a next step we calculated isostatic residual fields (Vening-Meinesz isostasy with regard to different lithospheric rigidities) to remove global components (long wavelengths) from the satellite gravity. The Isostatic residual field will be compared with the GPE (gravitational potential energy). GPE variations in the Southern Atlantic, relative to the reference state, were calculated as ΔGPE. Often the oceanic lithosphere is characterized by negative ∆GPE values indicating that the ocean basin is in compression. Differences from this observation will be compared with the state of stress in the area of the passive margins of South America and South Africa and the oceanic lithosphere in between.\nSchaeffer, A.

            "abstract": "Thermospheric neutral winds play an important part in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system at high latitudes. Neutral wind speeds have been derived from the CHAMP and GOCE satellites, which carried precise accelerometers in low Earth orbits. Due to the need to simultaneously determine thermosphere neutral density from the accelerometer in-track measurements, only information on the wind component in the cross-track direction, perpendicular to the flight direction can be derived. However, contrary to ground-based Fabry-Perot interferometer and scanning Doppler imager observations of the thermosphere wind, these satellite-based measurements provide equally distributed coverage over both hemispheres. The sampling of seasonal and local time variations depend on the precession rate of the satellite’s orbital plane, with CHAMP covering about 28 cycles of 24-hour local solar time coverage, during its 10 year mission (2000-2010), while the near sun-synchronous orbit of GOCE resulted in a much more limited local time coverage ranging from 6:20 to 8:00 (am and pm), during a science mission duration of 4 years (2009-2013).\nFor this study, the wind data from both CHAMP and GOCE have been analysed in terms of seasonal variations and geographic and geomagnetic local solar time and latitude coordinates, in order to make statistical comparisons for both the Northern and Southern polar areas. The wind data from both satellites were studied independently and in combination, in order to investigate how the strengths and weaknesses of the instruments and orbit parameters of these missions affect investigations of interhemispheric differences. Finally, the data have been compared with results from coupled ionosphere-thermosphere models and from ground-based FPI and SDI measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Central Eurasia region hosts wide deforming areas, with diffused or localized deformation occurring even hundreds of kilometres behind the Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia plate boundaries. A key-parameter controlling the propagation of deformation to the continent interiors is the lithosphere strength. By using a numerical technique based on the thin-sheet approximation, we explore the present-day deformation in Central Eurasia and the relative contributions of the lithospheric structure, rheology, boundary conditions, and friction coefficient on faults on the predicted velocity and stress fields. The lithosphere strength is calculated from the lithosphere structure and thermal regime.\nA crustal and lithospheric map derived from the combination of elevation and geoid anomaly with thermal analysis, showing thin lithosphere beneath the Iranian Plateau and thick lithosphere beneath the Tibetan Plateau, is used to build a reference model. Changes in the rheological parameters, friction coefficient on faults and velocity boundary conditions have been applied. A model with thin lithosphere in NE-Tibet following previous geophysical studies has been also considered. Models have been evaluated by comparing the predictions with available data on seismic deformation, stress directions and GPS velocities.\nA first order approximation of the velocity and stress directions is obtained, reproducing the counter-clockwise rotation of Arabia and Iran, the westward escape of Anatolia, and the eastward extrusion of the northern Tibetan Plateau. To simulate the observed extensional faults within Tibet a weaker lithosphere is required, provided by i) a change in the rheological parameters or ii) reduction of the lithosphere thickness in NE-Tibet. The temperature increase generated by the lithospheric thinning would allow also reconciling the model with the high heat flow and low mantle seismic velocities observed in the area.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic vegetation has a significant influence on the hydraulic functioning of river systems. Plant morphology has previously been shown to alter the mean and turbulent properties of flow, influenced by the spatial distribution of branches and foliage, and these effects can be further investigated through numerical models. We report on a novel method for the measurement and incorporation of complex plant morphologies into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The morphological complexity of Prunus laurocerasus is captured under foliated and defoliated states through terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Point clouds are characterised by a voxelised representation and incorporated into a CFD scheme using a mass flux scaling algorithm, allowing the numerical prediction of flows around individual plants. Here we examine the sensitivity of plant aspect, i.e. the positioning of the plant relative to the primary flow direction, by rotating the voxelised plant representation through 15° increments (24 rotations) about the vertical axis. This enables the impact of plant aspect to be quantified upon the velocity and pressure fields, and in particular how this effects species-specific drag forces and drag coefficients.\nPlant aspect is shown to considerably influence the flow field response, producing spatially heterogeneous downstream velocity fields with both symmetric and asymmetric wake shapes, and point of reattachments that extend up to seven plant lengths downstream. For the same plant, changes in aspect are shown to account for a maximum variation in drag force of 168%, which equates to a 65% difference in the drag coefficient. An explicit consideration of plant aspect is therefore important in studies concerning flow-vegetation interactions, especially when reducing the uncertainty in parameterising the effect of vegetation in numerical models.",

            "abstract": "While snowfall can comprise a significant percentage of the yearly water budget in High Asia, Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) is poorly constrained due to lack of in-situ measurements and complex terrain that limits the efficacy of modeling and observations. Over the past few decades, SWE has been estimated with the SSMI/S and AMSR passive microwave (PM) sensors, with low reliability in High Asia. Despite problematic SWE volume estimation, PM data contains information on the buildup and melt of snowpack, which is difficult to measure in-situ, particularly in remote areas. We present a new methodology for tracking the timing, frequency, and relative intensity of melt events across High Asia.\nTo measure SWE, we use raw swath data from the SSMI/S (1987-2015, F08, F11, F13, F17), AMSR (2002-2011), and GPM (2014-2015) satellites. This allows us to improve both spatial and temporal resolution over daily gridded products by leveraging multiple overpasses per day in an imperfectly overlapping grid pattern. We then examine SWE estimates, intra-day PM variance, and the interacting impacts of satellite look angles and topography on measured PM at arbitrary point locations. We develop a more thorough understanding of the uncertainties in our SWE estimates by examining the impacts of aspect, relief, slope, and elevation across the Tibetan Plateau on Tb and SWE estimates. High Asia, with its large topographic gradients and low relief at high elevations provides an excellent context to examine a wide range of topographic settings and terrain complexities to better constrain our analysis of sensor bias. We find that slopes above ~10° have a strong impact on SWE variability. We also find a consistent intra- and inter-day variability within constant-SWE periods, as defined as periods without precipitation and with constant temperatures below 0°C.\nUsing this measure of native sensor variability, we filter our SWE time series to identify events of snowmelt which are outside of the expected SWE variability envelope. We find that these events correlate with abnormally warm periods, as well as increases in variability in the high frequency (85-92 GHz) Tb channel.\nThis work will improve SWE storage forecasting, as well as help understand the drivers of, and predict the timing of, major snow melt events in remote catchments throughout High Asia.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic fraction of water enables climate reconstruction from ice cores. The use of different heavy isotopes of water such as H218O, H217O or HDO gives information about local temperature but also temperature and humidity of water vapour sources. Quantification of these parameters relies on the good knowledge of equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation at each step of the water cycle. The strongest limitation when interpreting water isotopes in remote Antarctic ice cores is the formulation of the isotopic fractionation at solid condensation (vapour to ice). This classical formulation also implies a good knowledge of coefficients for equilibrium fractionation and water vapour diffusion in air as well as supersaturation in clouds. The uncertainties lying on these different parameters make the formulation of isotopic fractionation at solid condensation only empirical.\nHere, we make use (1) of recent development in the measurements of water isotopes in the water vapour through infra-red spectroscopy and (2) of the possibility to measure accurately 17O-excess of water to test the classical formulation and parameterization of isotopic fractionation at solid condensation. A first experiment involving very strong supersaturation evidences a strong kinetic effect on 17O-excess on solid condensation, similar to d-excess. It also shows the limits of the classical formulation of water isotopic fractionation during solid condensation estimation at very low temperature. A second experiment performed in a cloud chamber in controlled conditions uses CRDS instruments to depict the spatial variability of water vapour isotopic composition due to diffusion (kinetic effect) during solid condensation. These experiments are in agreement with a new theoretical model that we present for the competition between diffusions of different isotopes. This preliminary study opens new perspectives to revisit the classical formulation of water isotopic fractionation during solid condensation at very low temperature.",

During moments of enhanced geomagnetic activity, in particular geomagnetic storms, Ionospheric total electron content (TEC) anomalies can form that have very severe spatial and temporal gradients. Occasionally, these anomalies can be large enough to reduce the accuracy of positioning and timing service from GPS causing serious problems for planes and other systems. This research targets on a particular TEC structure, named TEC plumes, a region of high TEC extending from the mid-latitudes to the higher latitudes and polar areas in the north hemisphere. It has been found recently that the growth and decay of the plumes can be affected by the interplanetary conditions through convection as well as the thermospheric winds. In particular, this research focuses on thermospheric wind effects on plume evolution in terms of longitudinal and hemispheric asymmetries. We use the International Geomagnetic ",

            "abstract": "Our ability to accurately assess water residence times and storage volumes hinges on data availability. However, hydrological data is often limited or non-existing in most regions of the world. This study synthesizes hydrological tracer data with hydroclimatic information in order to disentangle storage volume dynamics and variability across data-limited African catchments. Specifically, we focus on the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania where there is a large potential to develop and expand the agricultural sector and thus increasing food security nationally. The lack hydrological data and subsequent limited process understanding hinders our capacity to assess the sustainability of such an increased and intensified agriculture landscape.\nWe demonstrate how hydrological tracers constitute an exceptionally valuable piece of information for constraining model parameterizations, improving process understanding and representing storage volumes in data limited regions. Geochemical (e.g., Ca2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-) and stable water isotope (d18O and d2H) tracers were used to estimate recharge rates and seasonal shifts in hydrologic flow pathways. End member mixing analysis (EMMA) applied within the GLUE uncertainty framework was used to assess relative source contributions to streamflow and storage volume connectivity across scales.\nStrong variations in stable water isotopes between rainfall seasons in Tanzania and geological partitioning of storages allowed for clear characterization of seasonal variations in hydrologic flow pathway development. Wetlands dominated the wet season flows while variability in the connectivity of water storages could be seen during the dry season. Differences in the wetting up versus drying down storage mixing across the landscape highlights process shifts. This characterization improves our ability to utilize the limited data available in Kilombero Valley as it provides the basis for modelling surface-groundwater interactions regionally and their implicit controls on water residence times and, in turn, resource vulnerability.",

The project is a cooperative work of 26 institutes from 16 countries and links together the description of past tsunamigenic events, the characterization of tsunami sources, the calculation of the impact of such events, and the development of adequate resilience strategies (www.astarte.eu).\nWithin ASTARTE a web-based data base on Mass Transport Deposit (MTD) in the NEAM areas is being created that claims to be the future reference source for this kind of research in Europe. The aim is to integrate every existing scientific reference on the topic and update on new entries every 3 months, hosting information and detailed data, that are crucial e.g for tsunami modeling.\nA relational database managed by ArcGIS for Desktop 10.3 software has been implemented to allow all partners to collaborate through a common platform for archiving and exchanging data and interpretations, such as MTD typology (slide, slump, debris, turbidite, etc), geometric characteristcs (location, depth, thickness, volume, slope, etc), but also age and dating method and eventually tsunamigenic potential.\nOne of the final goals of the project is the sharing of the archived datasets through a web-based map service that will allow to visualize, question, analyze, and interpret all datasets. The interactive map service will be hosted by ArcGIS Online and will deploy the cloud capabilities of the portal.\nAny interested users will be able to access the online GIS resources through any Internet browser or ad hoc applications that run on desktop machines, smartphones, or tablets and will be able to use the analytical tools, key tasks, and workflows of the service.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the interaction of faults plays a crucial role for assessing seismic hazard. The calculation of Coulomb stress changes allows quantifying stress changes on so-called receiver faults in the surrounding of a source fault that was ruptured during an earthquake. Positive Coulomb stress changes bring receiver faults closer to failure, while a negative value indicates a delay of the next earthquake. Besides the coseismic ('static') stress changes, postseismic ('transient') stress changes induced by postseismic relaxation occur. Here we use 3D finite-element models with arrays of normal or thrust faults to study the coseismic stress changes and the stress changes arising from postseismic relaxation in the lower crust. The results show that synthetic receiver faults in the hanging wall and footwall of the source fault exhibit a symmetric distribution of the coseismic Coulomb stress changes on each fault, with large areas of negative stress changes but also some smaller areas of positive values. In contrast, faults positioned in along-strike prolongation of the source fault and outside of its hanging wall and footwall undergo mostly positive stress changes. Postseismic stress changes caused by viscous flow modify the static stress changes in a way that the net Coulomb stress changes on the receiver faults change significantly through space and time. Our models also allow deciphering the combined effect of stress changes caused by the ongoing extension or shortening (leading to an interseismic stress increase) and by the postseismic relaxation (leading to stress increase or decrease). Depending on the viscosity and the dip and position of the receiver fault, stress changes induced by postseismic relaxation can outweigh the interseismic stress increase such that negative Coulomb stress changes can persist for decades. On other faults, the interseismic stress increase is further increased by postseismic relaxation.",

The Gorkha earthquake, as well as its following aftershock sequence, was quickly monitored by the French National Data Center (NDC), which has for mission to monitor seismic activity around the world, and to report on the occurrence of significant seismic events. In addition to the phase picking and localization of the events, seismic source studies are performed at the French NDC. Two approaches using regional and teleseismic data are traditionally considered depending on the magnitude of the events and the distance range between epicenters and stations. In the case of the Nepalese sequence we present source inversion results using several methods for the larger events of the sequence. The source solutions obtained at long periods agree together, and indicate shallow dipping thrust mechanisms on the main Himalayan thrust fault. They also provide information on the coseismic displacements associated with the events. Finally, in-depth source sensitivity studies from waveform inversion and pP/sP phases help constrain the depth of the events.",

The dynamics of charged particles in the atmosphere can be modulated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). High electric fields also affect the alignment of charged particles, allowing more time for interactions.\nThe CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) experiment at CERN has the ability to conduct ionization, charging and high electric field experiments on liquid or ice clouds created in the chamber by adiabatic pressure reductions. A pion secondary beam from the CERN Proton Synchrotron is used to ionize the molecules in the chamber, and Ar+ Corona Ion Generator for Atmospheric Research (CIGAR) is used to inject unipolar charged ions directly into the chamber. A pressurized airgun provides rapid pressure shocks inside the chamber and induces charged ice nucleation. The cloud chamber is accompanied by a variety of analysing instruments e.g. a 3View Cloud Particle Imager (3V-CPI) coupled with an induction ring, a Scattering Intensity Measurements for the Optical detection of icE (SIMONE) and a Nano-aerosol and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS). Using adiabatic expansion and high electric fields we can replicate the ideal conditions for adhesion, sintering and interlocking between ice crystals.\nCharged cloud particles produced measurable variations in the total induced current pulse on the induction ring. The most influential factors comprised initial temperature, lapse rate and charging mechanism. The ions produced in the chamber may deposit onto larger particles and form dipoles during ice nucleation and growth. The small ion concentration was monitored by the NAIS during these runs. Possible short-term aggregates or alignment of particles were observed in-situ with the SIMONE. These and future chamber measurements of charging and aggregation could shed more light on the ambient conditions and dynamics for electrification in the atmosphere.",

However, only few natural processes can initiate a reaction of N2. These natural processes are fire, lightning and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) with BNF being the largest source. In the course of the last century humans have outperformed the natural processes of nitrogen fixation by the production of fertilizer. Industrial and other human emission of reactive nitrogen, as well as fire and lightning lead to a deposition of 63 Tg (N) per year. This is twice the amount of BNF estimated by the default setup of the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (30 Tg), which is a conservative approach. We use different methods and parameterizations for BNF in LPJ-GUESS: 1.) varying total annual amount; 2.) annual evenly distributed and daily calculated fixation rates; 3.) an improved dataset of BNF by cryptogamic covers (free-living N-fixers). With this setup BNF is ranging from 30 Tg to 60 Tg. We assess the impact of BNF on carbon storage and grand primary production (GPP) of the natural vegetation. These results are compared to and evaluated against available independent datasets. We do not see major differences in the productivity and carbon stocks with these BNF estimates, suggesting that natural vegetation is insensitive to BNF on a global scale and the vegetation can compensate for the different nitrogen availabilities. Current deposition of nitrogen compounds and internal cycling through mineralization and uptake is sufficient for natural vegetation productivity. However, due to the coarse model grid and spatial heterogeneity in the real world this conclusion does not exclude the existence of habitats constrained by BNF.",

Drying of soils leads to evapotranspiration (ET) becoming limited (water-stressed) and is accompanied by rises in land surface temperature (LST), land surface-air temperature difference (delta T), and sensible heat flux. Climate models predict sizable changes to the global water cycle but there is variation between models in the time scale of ET decay during dry spells. The e-stress project is developing novel satellite-derived datasets to assess the ability of Earth System Models (ESMs) to capture behaviour that is due to soil moisture controls on ET.\nSatellite records of LST now extend 15 years or more (e.g. MODIS Terra LST - 2000 to present; Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) LST record - 1995 to 2012). As part of the e-stress project these datasets have been used calculate time series of delta T. This paper reports the use of MODIS LST and ESA GlobTemperature ATSR LST with 2m air temperatures from a range of reanalyses to calculate trends in delta T and water-stressed area. We examine the variability of delta T in relation to satellite soil moisture, vegetation and precipitation and model evaporation data.\nDelta T anomalies show significant negative correlations with soil moisture, in different seasons, in several regions across the planet. Global mean delta T anomaly is small (magnitude mostly less than 0.2 K) between July 2002 and July 2008 and decreases to a minimum in early 2010. The reduction in delta T anomaly coincides with an increase in soil moisture anomaly and NDVI anomaly suggesting an increase in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux with reduced sensible heat flux.\nIn conclusion there have been distinct signals in delta T during recent decades and these provide an independent assessment of hydrologically-forced changes in the land surface energy balance which can be used as a metric for the assessment of ESM and global surface flux products.",

            "abstract": "Tide gauges measure local sea-level relative to a benchmark on land, therefore the interpretation of these measurements can be limited by the lack of appropriate knowledge of vertical crustal motions. The oldest sea-level records date back to the 18th century; these observations are the only centuries-old data source enabling the estimate of historical sea-level trends/variations. In general, tide gauge benchmarks were not frequently levelled, except in those stations where natural and/or anthropogenic subsidence was a major concern. However, in most cases, it is difficult to retrieve the historical geodetic levelling data. Space geodetic techniques, such as GNSS, Doris and InSAR are now providing measurements on a time and space-continuous basis, giving rise to a large amount of different data sets. The vertical motions resulting from the various analyses need to be compared and best exploited for achieving reliable estimates of sea level variations. In the Mediterranean area, there are a few centennial tide gauge records; our study focuses, in particular, on the Italian time series of Genoa, Marina di Ravenna, Venice and Trieste. Two of these stations, Marina di Ravenna and Venice, are affected by both natural and anthropogenic subsidence, the latter was particularly intense during a few decades of the 20th century because of ground fluids withdrawal. We have retrieved levelling data of benchmarks at and/or close to the tide gauges from the end of 1800 and, for the last couple of decades, also GPS and InSAR height time series in close proximity of the stations. By using an ensemble of these data, modelling of the long-period non-linear behavior of subsidence was successfully accomplished. After removal of the land vertical motions, the linear long period sea-level rates of all stations are in excellent agreement. Over the last two decades, the tide gauge rates were also compared with those obtained by satellite radar altimetry data.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) are effective tools for the risk mitigation in active seismic regions. Recently, a feasibility study of a nation-wide earthquake early warning systems has been conducted for Italy considering the RAN Network and the EEW software platform PRESTo. This work showed that a reliable estimations in terms of magnitude and epicentral localization would be available within 3-4 seconds after the first P-wave arrival. On the other hand, given the RAN’s density, a regional EEWS approach would result in a Blind Zone (BZ) of 25-30 km in average. Such BZ dimension would provide lead-times greater than zero only for events having magnitude larger than 6.5. Considering that in Italy also smaller events are capable of generating great losses both in human and economic terms, as dramatically experienced during the recent 2009 L’Aquila (ML 5.9) and 2012 Emilia (ML 5.9) earthquakes, it has become urgent to develop and test on-site approaches.\nThe present study is focused on the development of a new on-site EEW metodology for the estimation of the macroseismic intensity at a target site or area. In this analysis we have used a few thousands of accelerometric traces recorded by RAN related to the largest earthquakes (ML>4) occurred in Italy in the period 1997-2013.\nThe work is focused on the integral EW parameter Squared Velocity Integral (IV2) and on its capability to predict the peak ground velocity PGV and the Housner Intensity IH, as well as from these latters we parameterized a new relation between IV2 and the Macroseismic Intensity. To assess the performance of the developed on-site EEW relation, we used data of the largest events occurred in Italy in the last 6 years recorded by the Osservatorio Sismico delle Strutture, as well as on the recordings of the moderate earthquake reported by INGV Strong Motion Data. The results shows that the macroseismic intensity values predicted by IV2 and the one estimated by PGV and IH are in good agreement.",

            "abstract": "Through models, explores the relationships between the interacting drivers of soil profile evolution. Soil hydrology drives the partition of precipitation between overland flow, shallow subsurface flow and deeper percolation/ lateral flow. Critical parts of this interchange occurs close to the surface, within the zone of strong bioturbation, where inorganic composition is determined by the balance between erosion and weathering rates expressed in the chemical depletion ratio. The intensity of organic matter cycling may also limit the final composition of weathering products. Erosion rates are partly driven by the geomorphic environment, through gradient and hydrology, but also constrained by the degree of soil weathering, through particle size and mineralogy. Weathering rates are determined by water movement below the bioturbation zone and ionic diffusion from parent material, which control the rate of decline with soil depth. These interactions are explored through simple equilibrium and evolutionary models for the soil profile that are applicable across a wide range of geological and climatic environments.",

            "abstract": "The crustal evolution of west-central Africa during the Cretaceous was directly related to plate motion associated with the opening of the central Atlantic Ocean. Late Cretaceous (~66 Ma) to recent magmatism related to the Cameroon Line stretches from Northern Cameroon (i.e. Golda Zuelva) to the Gulf of Guinea (i.e. Pagalu) and is considered to be due to mantle-crust interaction. The volcanic rocks at Hadjer el Khamis, west-central Chad, are considered to be amongst the oldest volcanic rocks of the Cameroon Line but their relationship is uncertain because they erupted during a period of a regional extension associated with the opening of the Late Cretaceous (~75 Ma) Termit basin. The silicic volcanic rocks can be divided into a peraluminous group and a peralkaline group with both rock types having similar chemical characteristics as within-plate granitoids. In situ U/Pb zircon dating yielded a mean 206Pb/238U age of 74.4 ± 1.3 Ma and indicates the rocks erupted ~10 million years before the next oldest eruption attributed to the Cameroon Line. The Sr isotopes (i.e. ISr = 0.7050 to 0.7143) show a wide range but the Nd isotopes (i.e. 143Nd/144Ndi = 0.51268 to 0.51271) are more uniform and indicate that the rocks were derived from a moderately depleted mantle source. Major and trace elemental modeling show that the silicic rocks likely formed by shallow fractionation of a mafic parental magma where the peraluminous rocks experienced crustal contamination and the peralkaline rocks did not. The silicic rocks are more isotopically similar to Late Cretaceous basalts in the Doba and Bongor basins (i.e. ISr = 0.7040 to 0.7060; 143Nd/144Ndi = 0.51267 to 0.51277) of southern Chad than to rocks of the Cameroon Line (i.e. ISr = 0.7026 to 0.7038; 143Nd/144Ndi = 0.51270 to 0.51300). Given the age and isotopic compositions, it is likely that the silicic volcanic rocks of the Lake Chad area are related to Late Cretaceous extensional tectonics rather than to Cameroon Line magmatism.",

            "abstract": "The Plio-Pleistocene volcanism in the Djavakheti Highland is characterized by a great number of consecutive lava flows of great extension and reduced thickness. These features combined with available K-Ar dates (Lebedev et al., 2008 and per. com.), provides the right context to study a reliable and constant record of the EMF. The present study was performed on 2 different volcanic sequences. The first one, Apnia is formed of 20 basaltic lava flows and the second one, Korxi, of 27 andesitic lava flows.\nPaleomagnetic measurements yielded a characteristic component in all flows with normal, transitional and reverse polarities being obtained. The Apnia sequence, (3.75 ± 0.25 and 3.09 ± 0.10 My), starts with 13 reverse-polarity flows, which are followed by 2 transitional ones with 5 normal ones in the uppermost part of the section. Comparison with the expected EMF direction shows that while the direction of the reverse polarity group agrees well with the expected one, the direction of the normal polarity group shows a significant difference. The Korxi sequence is divided into two different subsequences of 17 and 10 flows separated by an erosional surface. The lower group has an age of 3.25 ± 0.25 My, and shows a succession of normal polarity flows close to the expected direction. The upper one, (1.9 ± 0.2 My), mainly displays reverse polarity flows with 3 interspersed transitional ones.\nRock magnetic measurements including thermomagnetic, IRM acquisition and hysteresis curves were performed to check the suitability of the studied rocks for paleointensity experiments.\nPaleointensities were determined using three different methods: Multi-specimen, Thellier-Thellier and IZZI. The ultimate goal is to find out how paleointensity varies in relation to the observed polarity changes and anomalous directions. Using different techniques for determining the paleointensity, will also increase the reliability of determinations in cases in which an agreement in the results is observed.\nKeywords: Paleomagnetism, Rock-magnetism, Paleointensity, Plio-Pleistocene lava flows, Caucasus",

            "abstract": "We investigate localized magnetosheath and solar wind density enhancements, associated with magnetic field changes, and therefore referred to as magnetosheath/solar wind plasmoids. Using Cluster data, we show that there are two distinct populations of magnetosheath plasmoids, one associated with a decrease of magnetic field strength (diamagnetic plasmoids), and one with an increased magnetic field strength (paramagnetic plasmoids). The diamagnetic magnetosheath plasmoids have scale sizes of the order of 1-10 RE, while paramagnetic plasmoids are an order of magnitude smaller. The diamagnetic plasmoids are not associated with any change in the magnetosheath plasma flow velocity, and they are classified as embedded plasmoids in the terminology of Karlsson et al. [2012]. The paramagnetic plasmoids may either be embedded or associated with increases in flow velocity (fast plasmoids). An investigation of plasmoids in the pristine solar wind resulted in identification of 62 diamagnetic plasmoids with similar properties to the magnetosheath diamagnetic plasmoids, making it probable that the solar wind is the source of these structures. The solar wind plasmoids are identified as solar wind magnetic holes. No paramagnetic plasmoids are found in the pristine solar wind, indicating that these are instead created at the bow shock or in the magnetosheath. We discuss the relation of the plasmoids to the phenomenon of magnetosheath jets, with which they have many properties in common, and suggest that the paramagnetic plasmoids can be regarded as a subset of these, or a closely related phenomenon. We also discuss results from this study relate to theories addressing the formation of magnetosheath jets.",

We present here the results of a detailed modeling (2-D / 3-D) study of bathymetry and the potential field data (gravity, geoid and magnetic), and the spectral based (admittance/ coherence) analysis to understand the structure, isostasy, rheology and segmentation of the ridge. The study revealed that the CR shows distinctly different geophysical characteristics such as wide and deep axial valley (1.5–3 km) with prominently high residual geoid (degree 10) and mantle Bouguer anomalies in the northwest, and narrow and shallow axial valley type morphology with prominent lows in the southeast. This variation is attributed to less mamgmatic phase with dominant tectonic extension in the northwest, and dominance of magmatic accretion phase in the southeast. It is also noticed that the ridge has only one first order segment along its entire length defined by a well developed transform fault and fracture zone. However, along and across axis residual geoid (degree 10, 30 and 50) and mantle Bouguer anomalies of the CR revealed several 2nd order discontinuities. Inversion of residual mantle Bouguer anomalies reveled along and across axis variation in crustal thickness having 7-10 km close to the spreading centers, 2-5km at the segment ends, and 4-6 km over the flanks of the spreading segments.The Geoid-Topography Ratio (GTR) values computed over the ridge vary between 0.26-0.46 m/km and suggest increase in the apparent compensation depthfrom ~5.5km in north to 9.5 km in the south. On the other hand, the effective elastic thickness (Te) values decrease from 16 km in the north to 5 km in the south. The joint modeling of geophysical data, and the geoid-age relations gave rise to maximum thickness of thermal lithosphere ~85 km in the CR region.",

            "abstract": "Although heralded as the solution to the world’s energy shortage, shale-gas is proving to be extremely problematic from an environmental perspective. Fracking has in many instances led to the contamination of shallow groundwater resources in the vicinity of extraction sites. South Africa has significant energy issues and fracking has many attractions for the country as whole from an alternative energy supply perspective and also from a development perspective. However, the target region, the Karoo Basin, is a very water stressed region with significant ecological and agricultural value.\nThe aim of this project was to establish whether it is possible to distinguish between deep and shallow groundwater throughout the Karoo using a wide variety of geochemical tracers. However, it is not possible to access groundwater located at depths of > 2500m. Therefore, waters derived from thermal springs and boreholes were used as proxies for deep groundwater. Eight locations within the Karoo Basin were chosen for sampling. Two sites were sampled at each location, one from a thermal spring or borehole and one from a shallow borehole in close proximity to the deep site. All of the samples were measured for temperature, pH, EC and alkalinity in the field and collected for major cations and anions, trace elements, O and H isotopes, Sr, B, Ra, Rn and CDIC isotopes, carbon 14, tritium, chlorine 36, He 4, and noble gases. From these analyses it was possible to differentiate thermal groundwater from shallow groundwater. The thermal groundwaters are interpreted to be deep because of their low carbon 14 content and further work, such as comparison of residence times using applicable tracers, is being completed to confirm this. A provisional list of tracers most reliable in identifying deep and shallow groundwater in the area has been developed and this can be used for monitoring programmes to assess the interaction of deep and shallow groundwater should fracking commence in the Karoo.",

The MR analysis demonstrates the varying significance of amphibole major element components assigned to different crystallographic sites (T, M1-3, M4, A) as independent variables in controlling D, and it allows us to retrieve statistically significant relationships for REE, Y, Rb, Sr, Pb, Ti, Zr, Nb (n > 25, R2 > 0.6, p-value < 0.05). For example, DLREE are controlled by SiT, M1-3 site components and CaM4, whereas DMREE-HREE are controlled solely by M1-3 site components. Our overall results for the REE are supported by application of the lattice strain model (Blundy & Wood, 1994).\nA significant advantage of our study over previous work linking D to melt polymerization (e.g. Tiepolo et al., 2007) is the ability to reconstruct melt compositions from in situ amphibole compositional analyses and published D data. We applied our MR analysis to Mt. Lamington (PNG), where Mg-Hst in quenched mafic enclaves are juxtaposed with MgHbl-Tsch phenocrysts from andesitic host lavas. The results indicate that MgHbl-Tsch are crystallized from a cool, rhyolitic melt (800-900±50 ºC, 70-77±5 wt % SiO2; Ridolfi & Renzulli 2012) with lower Rb and Sr and higher Pb, relative to a hot, andesitic-dacitic melt (950-1,000±50 ºC; 60-70±5 wt % SiO2) where MgHst are crystallized. REE and Nb contents are similar in both types of melts despite higher REE and Nb in MgHbl-Tsch. Therefore, the REE compositional disparity between MgHst and MgHbl-Tsch is driven by the difference in the DREE, rather than the melt REE concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy provide direct evidence for the biosphere-atmosphere exchange at the ecosystem scale. Such continuous measurements are typically performed in the atmospheric surface layer above the canopy and integrate fluxes over the entire ecosystem within the footprint. Forest ecosystems, however, have complex vertical structures composed of several layers with different functional properties that are represented to a limited extend by above canopy measurements. Concurrent eddy-covariance measurements below canopy (subcanopy) can provide valuable insights on (1) understory processes, (2) their contributions to total ecosystem fluxes, and (3) the partitioning of component fluxes. Accordingly, there is a large potential for including standardized subcanopy forest measurements into large-scale measurement networks such as FLUXNET. However, our understanding of the performance and limitations for such measurements is still very limited. To gain a better understanding of subcanopy measurements, we conducted (I) a survey across FLUXNET on their availability, and (II) a literature review on published subcanopy measurements. Subsequently, we are preparing a standardized synthesis dataset on subcanopy measurements within FLUXNET. We will present the results from our survey, summarize the current process understanding, and discuss research priorities for concurrent below and above canopy eddy-covariance measurements.",

            "abstract": "Highly siderophile elements (HSE) were strongly sequestered into metallic planetary cores, leaving silicate mantles almost devoid of HSE. Late accretion partially replenished HSE in planetary mantles soon after core formation had ceased [1], which for Earth probably postdated the giant Moon-forming impact. Ancient isolated domains in Earth’s mantle – such as the source of 3.8 Ga Isua basalts – might represent mantle isolated from late accreted material, as suggested based on their small 182W excesses compared to Earth's present-day mantle [2]. However, such 182W excesses may also represent signatures of early differentiation in Earth's mantle, which have been preserved through the giant impact [3]. To assess the origin of 182W anomalies and the 182W composition of the pre-late veneer mantle, we determined HSE abundances and 182W compositions of a suite of mafic to ultramafic rocks from Isua.\nOur data show that the Isua source mantle had HSE abundances at ~60% of the present-day mantle, inconsistent with isolation from the late veneer. For the same samples we obtained a 13±4 ppm 182W excess over the modern terrestrial mantle, in excellent agreement with previous data [2]. Using a range of possible late veneer compositions and taking into account the recently revised 182W value for the Moon [4], we calculate that the Isua mantle source, containing 60% late veneer, would have a 182W value of 9±4 ppm, in very good agreement with the measured value for Isua. The combined HSE-W data, therefore, are consistent with only partial addition of the late veneer to the Isua mantle source, and with the interpretation that the 27±4 ppm 182W excess of the Moon represents the 182W composition of the pre-late veneer Earth's mantle [4].\n[1] Dale et al.

Climate data from the country is a key for advancing our understanding of monsoon climate in the transition zone area.\nPreviously, high-resolution climate signals preserved within δ18O, growth rate, and grey level were successfully extracted from stalagmite NJ-1, collected from Namjang (NJ) cave in the Mae Hong Son province of northwestern (NW) Thailand [Cai et al., 2010; Muangsong et al., 2011]. Present-day climate and cave monitoring in NW Thailand were carried out from August 2012 to October 2013 to investigate the climatic controls on rainfall and stalagmite isotopic properties. The δ18O of rainfall, stalagmite drip water as well as modern stalagmite precipitated on glass plates generally exhibited seasonal response to seasonal monsoon rainfall δ18O. Theses have implications for the use of isotopic composition of natural climate proxies from NW Thailand as a proxy of seasonal climate as well as the study of seasonal changes in moisture trajectories.\nAmong the limited number of tree species suitable for tree-ring studies, teak (Tectona grandis Linn.) trees have great potential for dendrochronology in SE Asia. There are young teak trees growing out a few meters from NJ cave that uptake a common source water of published stalagmite NJ-1. In this study, the unique signals of cellulose δ18O detected in Thai teak were presented. Intra-seasonal and inter-annual variations of tree-ring cellulose δ18O provided detailed insights into seasonal monsoon climate. Comparisons of tree-ring cellulose δ18O with speleothem proxies from the same locality and tree-ring indices from wider geographical areas provide a basis for developing a multi-proxy approach. This is the first study in Thailand with a precise high resolution examination of δ18O in Thai teak as a climate signal, and this is the first preliminary study on a comparison between two natural proxies from a single location. These findings demonstrated the potential of stable isotope climatology from tree rings and stalagmites, and provided an additional basis for seasonal rainfall reconstruction in this region.",

Using experimental data collected from synthetic samples I investigate this.

            "abstract": "As micrometeorological research shifts to increasingly non-idealized environments, the lens through which we view classical atmospheric boundary layer theory must also shift to accommodate unfamiliar behavior. We present observations of katabatic flow over a steep (35.5 degree), alpine slope and draw comparisons with classical theory for nocturnal boundary layers (NBL) over flat terrain to delineate key physical differences and similarities. In both cases, the NBL is characterized by a strong, terrain-aligned thermal stratification. Over flat terrain, this temperature inversion tends to stabilize perturbations and suppresses vertical motions. Hence, the buoyancy term in the TKE budget equation acts as a sink. In contrast, the steep-slope katabatic flow regime is characterized by buoyant TKE production despite NBL thermal stratification. This buoyant TKE production occurs because streamwise (upslope) heat fluxes, which are typically treated as unimportant over flat terrain, contribute to the total vertical buoyancy flux since the gravity vector is not terrain-normal. Due to a relatively small number of observations over steep terrain, the turbulence structure of such flows and the implications of buoyant TKE production in the NBL have gone largely unexplored. As an important consequence of this characteristic, we show that conventional stability characterizations require careful coordinate system alignment and interpretation for katabatic flows. The streamwise heat fluxes play an integral role in characterizing stability and turbulent transport, more broadly, in katabatic flows. Therefore, multi-scale statistics and budget analyses describing physical interactions between turbulent fluxes at various scales are presented to interpret similarities and differences between the observations and classical theories regarding streamwise heat fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Current assessments of slope stability rely on the use of point sensors, the results of which are often difficult to interpret, have relatively high associated installation and maintenance costs, and do not provide large-area coverage. A new system is currently under development, based on the use of integrated geophysical - geotechnical sensors to monitor ground water conditions via electrical resistivity tomography. This study presents the results of an in-situ electrical resistivity tomography survey, gathered over a two year investigation period at a full-scale clay test embankment in Northumberland, UK. The 3D resistivity array comprised 288 electrodes, at 0.7m grid spacing, covering an area of approximately 90 m2. The first year of investigation involved baseline data collection, followed by a second year which saw a series of deliberate interventions targeted at weakening the slope, to determine whether corresponding geotechnical property changes would be reflected in resistivity images derived from ERT. These interventions included the manual extension of four tension cracks already present in the slope, and the installation of a sprinkler system, eight months later. Laboratory methods were employed to derive a system of equations for relating resistivity to geotechnical parameters more directly relevant to slope stability, including moisture content, suction and shear strength. These equations were then applied to resistivity data gathered over the baseline and intervention periods, yielding geotechnical images of the subsurface which compared well with in-situ geotechnical point sensors. During the intervention period, no slope movement was recorded, however, tensiometers at 0.5 m and 1.0 m depths showed elevated pore pressures, with positive pressures being recorded at depths less than 0.5 m. Resistivity images were successful in capturing the extension of the tension cracks, and in identifying the development of a potential shear failure plane as water infiltrated these cracks over the course of one year.",

            "abstract": "The Mantaro basin (MB) is located in the central Peruvian Andes. Occasionally, cold episodes are observed during austral summer (January-March), that strongly damage crops. However, little is known about the causes and impacts of such cold episodes. The main goal of this study is thus to characterize cold episodes in the MB and assess their large-scale circulation and teleconnections over South America (SA) during austral summer.\nTo identify cold events in the MB daily minimum temperature (Tmin) for the period 1958-2014 from Huayao station, located within the MB was used. A cold episode is defined when daily minimum temperature drops below its 10-percentile for at least one day. Additionally, to study the sensitivity between physical mechanisms associated with cold episodes and temperature, cold episodes are classified in three groups: Weak cold episodes (7.5 ≤ Tmin ≤ 10 percentile), strong cold episodes (Tmin ≤ 2.5 percentile), but excluding the 9 coldest events (Tmin ≤ 0 ͦ C), henceforth referred to as extraordinary cold episodes. Several gridded reanalysis were used to characterize the large-scale circulation, cloud cover and rainfall over SA associated with these events.\nWeak and strong cold episodes in the MB are mainly associated with a weakening of the Bolivian High-Nordeste Low system by tropical-extratropical interactions. Both types of cold episodes are associated with westerly wind anomalies at mid- and upper-tropospheric levels aloft the Peruvian Central Andes, which inhibit the influx of humid air masses from the lowlands to the east and hence limit the development of cloud cover (e.g., positive OLR anomalies over MB). The resulting clear sky conditions cause nighttime temperatures to drop, leading to cold extremes below 10-percentile. Simultaneously, northeastern Brazil (NEB) registers negative OLR anomalies, strong convection and enhanced cloud cover because displacement of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) toward the northeast of its climatologic position. By contrast, extraordinary cold episodes in the MB are associated with cold and dry polar air advection at all tropospheric levels toward the central Peruvian Andes. On interannual timescales, El Niño may limit the occurrence of all types of cold episodes in the MB through enhanced tropical tropospheric background warming.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally wind turbines learn about the incoming wind conditions by means of a wind vane and a cup anemometer. This approach presents two major limitations: 1) because the measurements are done at the nacelle, behind the rotor blades, the wind observations are perturbed inducing potential missalignement and power losses; 2) no direct information of the incoming turbulence is extracted, limiting the capacity to timely adjust the wind turbine against strong turbulent intensity events. Recent studies have explored the possibility of using wind LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to overcome these limitations (Angelou et al. 2010 and Mikelsen et al., 2013). By installing a wind LIDAR at the nacelle of a wind turbine one can learn about the incoming wind and turbulent conditions ahead of time to timely readjust the turbine settings. Yet several questions remain to be answered such as how far upstream one should measure and what is the appropriate averaging time to extract valuable information. In light of recent results showing the relevance of atmospheric stratification in wind energy applications, it is expected that different averaging times and upstream scanning distances are advised for wind LIDAR measurements.\nA Large Eddy Simulation (LES) study exploring the use of wind LIDAR technology within a wind farm has been developed. The wind farm consists of an infinite array of horizontal axis wind turbines modeled using the actuator disk with rotation. The model also allows the turbines to dynamically adjust their yaw with the incoming wind vector. The flow is forced with a constant geostrophic wind and a time varying surface temperature reproducing a realistic diurnal cycle. Results will be presented showing the relevance of the averaging time for the different flow characteristics as well as the effect of different upstream scanning distances. While it is observed that within a large wind farm there are no-significant gains in power output by scanning further upstream, much can be learned about the incoming turbulence, hence allowing improved wind turbine readjustments. Time correlations with the upstream incoming turbulence have been computed through an entire diurnal cycle, and a non-dimensional analysis shows the existence of different behaviors throughout the day.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of ice deformation mechanisms is a key point for ice flow modeling and interpretation of climatic signal extracted from ice cores. During deformation inside an ice sheet, recrystallization processes will impact texture and viscosity of ice. Recrystallization processes in ice are very similar to the ones observed in metals and rocks. Along ice cores, Continous (rotation) Dynamic Recrystallization (CDRX) and Discontinuous (migration) Dynamic Recrystallization (DDRX) occur, le later being observed mainly in the deeper part, where temperature and deviatoric stress are higher. The role of nucleation and grain boundary migration associated with DRX on texture development are still badly constrained. In this study, we associated ice creep experiments and high resolution EBSD observations (Electronic Microscopy) to better understand nucleation processes occurring during DRX. Ice is an hexagonal material in which deformation mainly occurs by dislocation glide along the basal plane conferring a strong viscoplastic anisotropy to the single crystal. Hence, during polycrystalline ice deformation the incompatibilty between grains lead to highly heterogeneous strain-field. DRX mechanisms arrise from these strong heterogeneities and induce a new microstructure and texture that relaxe the incompatibilites. The high resolution EBSD observations shown in this study are performed on selected samples of laboratory made polycrystalline columnar ice deformed until 3% macro strain (T=-7°C and σ=0.5 MPa). The analyse show that various kind of nucleation occur under these conditions such as polygonization (tilt bands, kink bands), bulge nucleation by SIGBM (strain Induced Grain Boundary Migration), and nucleation of grains with no obvious relationship with surrounding grains. All these nucleation processes are discussed regarding the associated dislocation fields using the Weigthed Burgers Vector analysis. These analyses highlight the strong heterogeneity of these fields and question the nature of dislocations involved.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) strongly affects the evolution of microstructure (grain size and shape) and texture (crystal preferred orientation) during deformation at high temperature. Since texturing leads to anisotropic physical properties, predicting the effect of DRX in metals is essential for industrial applications, in rocks for interpreting geophysical data and modeling geodynamic flows, or in ice for predicting ice sheet flow and climate evolution.\nAlong ice cores extracted from ice sheets, Continuous DRX (CDRX) and Discontinuous DRX (DDRX) mechanisms are observed at various depths, the later being favoured by the high temperature encountered close to the bedrock, and local high level of strain. In laboratory conditions, with higher strain rate and stress levels, DDRX dominates mechanical response during tertiary creep, when deviatoric stress is low enough to avoid micro fracturation (σ < 1MPa).\nSimilarly to the case of metals or rocks, relations between DRX nucleation mechanisms and strain heterogeneities at the grain scale remain poorly known and therefore poorly constrained in DRX modeling.\nWe will present recent observations performed on laboratory made and deformed ice polycrystals (σ ~ 0.5 MPa, T ~ -7°C) that enable to access high resolution observations of intragranular sub-structures (dislocation field, subgrains, nucleus) via Electron BackScattering Diffraction (EBSD), and high resolution strain field measurements around DRX nucleation area.\nAnalyses of these observations highlight the complexity of nucleation mechanisms in ice, with the formation of kink bands, of bulging, and of “spontaneous” nucleation. Strain field measurements evidence the influence of nucleation on the relaxation of strain incompatibilities at grain boundaries and triple junctions. At last, torsion experiments enabled to draw hypotheses about the role of nucleation on DRX textures.",

            "abstract": "Timing is everything: accurate dating of the geological record is essential to an understanding of our Earth's history. Chronology underpins our understanding of the past, but beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~60 ka), sites become more difficult to date. Amino acid geochronology uses the time-dependent breakdown of proteins in biominerals, with the racemisation reactions (conversion between mirror-images) of amino acids having the potential to date the whole of the Quaternary. Recent studies have shown that a very small fraction of ‘intra-crystalline’ protein within mollusc shells, opercula and eggshell forms a closed system, and if this is targeted, the difficulties due to leaching, contamination and environmental factors are removed. The analysis of a coherent calcite intra-crystalline system has enabled the development of a robust chronology for Britain back to at least 2.8 Ma.\nCorrelation of Quaternary sequences, even in adjacent regions, is often problematic, but the development of regional aminostratigraphies promises to provide robust chronologies, enabling more confident correlation. The calcitic opercula of bithyniid (or similar) gastropods occur commonly in many Quaternary sequences, offering potential for development and correlation of regional aminostratigraphies around the world. Extending the British framework to continental Europe (and beyond) is one of the first steps, and we present preliminary results from analyses of a series of key archaeological and palaeontological sites from across northern Europe from France to Russia. In order to build the most comprehensive framework possible, we are targeting type localities for various interglacial stages, as well as horizons that can be related to glacial sediments, river terrace sequences, biostratigraphy and archaeology. We have tested the technique against other geochronological techniques, and a detailed understanding of the temperature effects on the extent of protein breakdown allows us to make comparisons between regions, and correlations to the marine oxygen isotope record. Our research focuses on building chronological frameworks on a wide spatial and temporal scale, and ever expanding the range of materials we are testing.",

            "abstract": "The earth system experiences continuous heat input, but a “climate hiatus” of upper ocean waters has been observed in this century. This leads to a question: where is the extra heat going? Using four in situobservation datasets, we explore the ocean subsurface temperature changes from 2004 to 2013. The observations all show that the ocean has continued to gain heat in this century, which is indicative of anthropogenic global warming. However, a distinctive pattern of change in the interior ocean is observed. The sea surface (1-100 m) temperature has decreased in this century, accompanied by warming in the 101-300 m layer. This pattern is due to the changes in the frequency of El Niño and La Niña events (ENSO characteristics), according to both observations and CMIP5 model simulations. In addition, we show for the first time that the ocean subsurface within 301-700 m experienced a net cooling (or insignificant warming), indicative of another instance of variability in the natural ocean. The strong ocean cooling (freshening) in Northwest Pacific gyre region is mostly responsible for the 301-700m cooling (freshening). Furthermore, the ocean layer of 701-1500 m has experienced significant warming.\nBesides, spurious OHC estimate can be obtained due to the change of the observation system from historical ship-based system to Argo-based system. The authors will show how the observation system change could impact the OHC calculation in Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. For instance: a very quick but spurious warming rate could be obtained from late 1990s to early 2000s in Indian Ocean. This is a crucial issue during the interpretation of the observation-based results.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the effects of freshwater forcing during the last glacial-interglacial transition, the Last Termination, is critical to our comprehension of rapid climate change. In particular, the role of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) and freshwater from the eastern seaboard of the North Atlantic has been entirely disregarded in the context of the abrupt regional hydroclimate shifts that characterized this period. Here we infer freshwater input variations from the FIS to the Nordic Seas based on two accurately dated hydroclimate reconstructions from lake sediment records from Southern Sweden and one SST reconstruction from the Nordic Seas.\nThe records indicate a number of abrupt freshwater discharges into the Nordic Seas at the start of the Bølling interstadial and during the Allerød interstadial. We observe that these intervals of enhanced FIS freshwater outflow correspond to different modalities of hydroclimate regime shifts in Greenland. Using a set of climate model simulations, we show that the dominant Greenland hydroclimate state can be influenced by the degree of FIS freshwater recirculation in the Nordic Seas, which redirects the excess of sea ice partitioned into the Barents Sea towards the eastern Greenland Current. The tradeoff between buildup and recirculation of sea ice in the Nordic Seas generate large-scale sea-level pressure anomalies that may explain the sign and magnitude of the isotopic and temperature changes inferred from Greenland and North European reconstructions. We conclude that air-sea interactions in the North Atlantic are more sensitive to Fennoscandian freshwater forcing than previously thought. These results could help to solve the problematic relationship between origin, timing and magnitude of freshwater perturbations and abrupt deglacial changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation in numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "On August 29, 2014, a volcanic activity started in the lava field of Holuhraun, at the north east of the Bardarbunga caldera in Iceland. The activity was declared finished on February 27, 2015, thus lasting for about 6 months. During these months the magma chamber below the caldera slowly emptied, causing the rare event of caldera collapse. In this scenario, TanDEM-X remote sensing data is of particular interest. By producing high-resolution and accurate elevation models of the caldera, it is possible to evaluate volume losses and topographical changes useful to increase the knowledge about the volcanic activity dynamics. 5 TanDEM-X InSAR acquisitions have been commanded between August 01, 2014 and November 08, 2014. 2 acquisitions have been commanded before the eruption and 3 acquisitions afterwards. To fully cover the volcanic activity, also the lava flow area at the north-west of the caldera has been monitored and a couple of acquisitions have been employed to reveal the subglacial graben structure and the lava path.\nIn this context, the expected elevation accuracy is studied on two levels. Absolute height accuracy is analyzed by inspecting the signal propagation at X-band in the imaged medium. Relative height accuracy is analyzed by investigating the InSAR system parameters and the local geomorphology. It is shown how the system is very well accurate with mean height errors below the meter. Moreover, neither InSAR processing issues, e.g. phase unwrapping errors, nor complex DEM calibration aspects are problems to tackle.\nCaldera is imaged in its entirety and new cauldron formations and, in general, the complete restructuring of the glacial volcanic system is well represented. An impressive caldera volume loss of about 1 billion cubic meters is measured in about two months. The dyke propagation from the Bardarbunga cauldron to the Holuhraun lava field is also revealed and a graben structure with a width of up to 1 km and a sinking of a few meters is derived. These results show how TanDEM-X mission is capable to provide to emergency institutions and geophysicists reliable measures not easy to retrieve with on-site instruments.",

            "abstract": "The Jovian and Saturnian systems are similar in that they are relatively rapidly rotating gas giants with internal magnetic fields. They also possess ring systems and a large number of satellites (67 and 62, respectively) with a single moon in each system serving as the primary magnetospheric heavy particle source (Io and Enceladus, respectively) but with Jupiter’s primary particle source orbiting further from the planet. Jupiter’s magnetic field is over an order of magnitude stronger than the Saturnian field and is tilted by almost 10 degrees while Saturn’s magnetic field has no detectable tilt from its rotational axis. Additionally, Saturn is about twice as far from the Sun as Jupiter. Even considering these differences, however, it is very interesting that Jupiter’s magnetosphere is dominated by plasma while Saturn’s magnetosphere contains much more neutral than charged particles. Such a difference has extremely significant impacts on magnetospheric generation and dynamics. The wealth of information provided by Cassini over the last 10 years has provided unprecedented insight in to Saturn’s magnetosphere and has well positioned us to conduct studies comparing Saturn’s and Jupiter’s magnetospheres. A better understanding of neutral tori not only sheds valuable insight into past observations but also provides critical preparation for the upcoming ESA and NASA missions to the Jovian system.\nFor this work, we combine all available data for these two systems as well as neutral tori modeling to quantify the differences between these two magnetospheres. From the analysis, we illustrate how various neutral tori are generated and evolve. The results provide insight into the critical factors that determine how large gas giant magnetospheres can evolve into such significantly different configurations.",

This is unexpected for bodies the sizes of Pluto and Charon several billions after their formation. Radiogenic heating is expected to be rather low at present, and tidal heating due to the interaction between the two companions may have played a role but only during the early stage of the evolution before the system reached dual synchronization (Robuchon and Nimmo, Icarus 2011; Barr and Collins, Icarus 2015). Recent resurfacings may suggests a slow cooling of the interior associated with recent activation of dynamical processes in the interior, possibly helped by the presence of anti-freezing compounds, such as ammonia and methanol, and low-conductivity gas clathrates.\nIn order to determine in which conditions Pluto and Charon may be active several billions after their formation, we investigate the role of anti-freezing compounds (ammonia and methanol) and gas compounds on the formation and evolution of an internal ocean. Using a parameterized model initially developed for Titan (Tobie et al. Icarus, 2005), we model the thermo-chemical evolution of Pluto’s and Charon’s interior, including the formation of an internal ocean and its subsequent crystallization, the formation/dissociation of gas clathrates and their feedback on the internal cooling rate, by assuming various initial compositions. A particular attention will be paid on the conditions under which convective instabilities may initiate in the outer ice shell, on the coupling between ocean crystallization and surface deformation, and on their consequences for the geological activity of Pluto and Charon.",

This anisotropy gives rise to strong strain incompatibilities between grains during deformation, and therefore impacts texture and microstructure evolution. Accurate understanding of ice mechanical properties is significant for several areas of research such as glaciology, planetary sciences, but also in geosciences and metallurgy as ice can be seen as a model material with easier experimental handling at near melting temperatures.\n In the present study, we used torsion experiments to study non-coaxial shear strain (γ), very common in natural environments, up to very high values of γ. Numerous studies determined microstructure and texture evolution in polycrystalline assemblage submitted to torsion (metallic alloys and geological materials) but a very limited number focused on polycrystalline ice.\n Full cylinders of randomly oriented polycrystalline ice (grain size ~ 1 mm) were placed in a torsion apparatus and deformed under ductile regime under constant imposed torque at 266K (0.97 Tf). Macroscopic shear was monitored using a LVDT device or a rotary encoder. Several torsion tests with maximal shear strain up to γmax = 1 were performed. Tangent and axial sections were analyzed ex-situ using Automatic Ice Texture Analyzer (AITA) and Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD).\n We were able to confirm the previously observed bimodal preferred orientation of the basal slip plane. Macroscopic strain evolution γ(t) displays a weakening after γmax = 0.04 (εmax ≃ 2 %), due to the beginning of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) processes. EBSD data provide novel informations on the microstructure that suggest very efficient grain boundary migration processes. In particular, we were able to measure differences of intra-granular misorientations density between the two ODF maxima populations that can highlight the role of DRX processes on texture formation.",

Experiments were conducted in a D-DIA apparatus using simultaneously X-ray diffraction and acoustic emission monitoring, to estimate both stress-strain relationship and occurrence of micro-earthquakes.\nWe use sintered powders of San Carlos olivine and Corsica antigorite, which is the HT serpentine polymorph. Our results demonstrate that around 2 GPa, serpentinized peridotite with serpentine content of 5% has a seismogenic potential. In the same conditions, no acoustic emission is detected in melanges with larger serpentine content (20%). At higher pressure (3.5 GPa) acoustic emissions are observed for melanges with up to 20% serpentine.\nSerpentine contents may favor initiation of mechanical failure of the olivine “load bearing” network for contents lower than a threshold value, at which connection of the weak phase (serpentine) prevents from stress rise in the stronger matrix (olivine). This threshold seems to increase with pressure. Thus mechanical instability may originate in serpentine dehydration for part of the intermediate-depth earthquakes, and hence at least part of the lower Benioff zone seismicity. Serpentine dehydration would act as a triggering mechanism for earthquakes nucleating and propagating in the olivine network.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the fine root dynamics of different life forms in forest ecosystems is critical to understanding how the overall belowground carbon cycling is affected by climate change. However, our current knowledge regarding how endogenous or exogenous factors regulate the root dynamics of understory vegetation is limited.\nWe selected a suite of study sites representing different habitats with gradients of soil moisture and solar radiation (shading or no shading). We assessed the fine root production phenology, the total fine root production, and the turnover among six understory shrub species in a subtropical climate, and examined the responses of the fine root dynamics to gradients in the soil moisture and solar radiation. The shrubs included three evergreen species, Loropetalum chinense, Vaccinium bracteatum, and Adinandra millettii, and three deciduous species, Serissa serissoides, Rubus corchorifolius, and Lespedeza davidii.  We observed that variations in the annual fine root production and turnover among species were significant in the deciduous group but not in the evergreen group. Notably, V. bracteatum and S. serissoides presented the greatest responses in terms of root phenology to gradients in the soil moisture and shading: high-moisture habitat led to a decrease and shade led to an increase in fine root production during spring. Species with smaller fine roots of the 1st+2nd-order diameter presented more sensitive responses in terms of fine root phenology to a soil moisture gradient. Species with a higher fine root nitrogen-to -carbon ratio exhibited more sensitive responses in terms of fine root annual production to shading. Soil moisture and shading did not change the annual fine root production as much as the turnover rate.\nThe fine root dynamics of some understory shrubs varied significantly with soil moisture and solar radiation status and may be different from tree species. Our results emphasize the need to study the understory fine root dynamics in the achievement of a complete understanding of the overall belowground carbon cycling in a forest ecosystem, particularly ecosystems in which the understory fine root highly contributes to the belowground biomass.",

            "abstract": "The failures of two recent deep geothermal energy projects in Switzerland (Basel, 2006; St. Gallen, 2013) have again highlighted that one of the key challenges for the successful development and operation of deep underground heat exchangers is to control the risk of inducing potentially hazardous seismic events. In St. Gallen, after an injection test and two acid injections that were accompanied by a small number of micro-earthquakes (ML < 0.2), operators were surprised by an uncontrolled gas release from the formation (gas kick). The “killing” procedures that had to be initiated following standard drilling procedures led to a ML3.5 earthquake. With ambient seismic noise cross correlations from nine stations, we observe a significant loss of waveform coherence that we can horizontally and vertically constrain to the injection location of the fluid. The loss of waveform coherence starts with the onset of the fluid injections 4 days prior to the gas kick. We interpret the loss of coherence as a local perturbation of the medium. We show how ambient seismic noise analysis can be used to assess the aseismic response of the subsurface to geomechanical well operations and how this method could have helped to recognize the unexpected reservoir dynamics at an earlier stage than the microseismic response alone, allowed.",

The associated island arc extends from St Martin (to the north) to Grenada Island (to the south). The northern half of the volcanic arc presents a peculiar morphology with (i) an eastern outer arc that was active from Eocene to Oligocene from St Martin to Martinique and (ii) a western inner one from Saba to Martinique which is active since the Miocene attesting for a westward jump of the volcanic arc at that time. The long-term deformation pattern and kinematics affecting the Lesser Antilles arcand its evolution from Eocene to Miocene, before its westward jump, remain poorly constrained.\nThis study aims at constraining the deformation pattern expressed in the eastern outer arc of the Lesser Antilles during Eocene time, which is contemporaneous with arc formation. To achieve this goal, St Barthelemy Isand (St Barth) is a key target as it consists of Eocene volcanites inter layered with carbonate platform sequences, intruded by Oligocene dykes and pipes. During fieldwork, we accurately mapped the main tectonic features that affect the island, and characterized the mineralogy of the gouges and fluid circulation along the main faults. The kinematics data were used to perform inversions in order to recover the paleostate of stress and datable minerals found in fault gouge will be further used to constrain the timing of fault activity.\nWe discuss the observed deformations within the regional tectonic framework and the birth of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. Firstly, we recover the Eocene local paleostress in St Barth corresponding to the first stages of island arc building. Secondly, we discuss the Eo-Oligocene evolution of the stress field at the island scale. Thirdly, thanks to the observed mineralogy we decipher the different deformation stages that occurred at distinct structural levels.",

The depth location, however, remains a challenge. We use 3D wavefield simulations to investigate the lapse-time dependent depth sensitivity of seismic coda waves towards velocity perturbations in an elastic heterogeneous medium. We introduce a thin layer with a perturbed velocity at different depths. Then, we determine the apparent relative velocity changes due to this layer at different times in the coda and for different degrees of heterogeneity of the model. We show that in all cases, the depth sensitivity can be modeled as a combination of bulk and surface wave sensitivity. The partition ratio between bulk and surface waves shows a universal behavior and can be used to construct probabilistic 3-D sensitivity kernels for imaging purposes that combine surface and bulk wave propagation. We show numerical results where we use these 3D kernels to locate changes in different types of media.",

Several stalagmites have been dated by AMS 14C dating method since 230Th/U is not applicable due to very low U contents. Twenty (20) AMS 14C dates on Stalagmite JL20131005-10 (10-cm long) show “Bomb carbon curve”, spanning the past 60 years. Lamination counting further confirms the chronology. Thirty nine (39) AMS 14C dates on Stalagmite JL20131005-12 (33-cm long) reveal 2300-year continuous growth. Stalagmite YLY20130727-12 (10-cm long) from Yilingyan Cave covers a continuous record of past 2300 years. All studied stalagmites in the caves contain low dead carbon fractions. The annual resolution δ18O and δ13C records obtained from the stalagmites allow us to compare the stalagmite δ18O records with the instrumental rainfall and temperature records, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and Sunspot variation, etc. The δ18O and δ13C records exhibit relatively good correlation throughout the time, indicating climatic control on vegetation change. Based on the high-resolution δ18O and δ13C records, we interpret that dry climatic conditions and poor vegetation coverage during periods of AD1880~1850, 1700~1600, 1460~1320, 1210~1280, 860~750, 540~420, 300~220, and AD100~0 shown by increased δ18O and δ13C. The δ18O and δ13C were strongly depleted during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP between AD900 and AD1100) and Current Warm Period (CWP, since AD1900), reflecting strongly increased East Asian Summer Monsoon. After AD1900, the δ13C decreased about 6‰, perhaps indicating human impact on surface vegetation. The δ18O records from the study area are comparable to the published WX42B δ18O record of Wanxiang Cave (Zhang et al., 2008) except for the period of AD1400~1850. Our study suggests that AMS 14C dating is an alternative method for stalagmites containing low U and high Th contents.",

            "abstract": "During the accretion of Titan, impact heating may have been sufficient to allow the global melting of water ice (Monteux et al. 2014) and the release of volatile compounds, with CO2 and NH3 as main constituents (Tobie et al. 2012). Thus, on primitive Titan, it is thought that a massive atmosphere was in contact with a global water ocean. Similar configurations may occur on temperate water-rich planets called ocean planets (Léger et al. 2004, Kitzmann et al. 2015).\nDue to its rather low solubility in liquid water, carbon dioxide is expected to be one of the major components in the atmosphere. The atmospheric amount of CO2 is a key parameter for assessing the thermal evolution of the planetary surface because of its strong greenhouse effect. However, ammonia significantly affects the solubility of CO2 in water and hence the atmosphere-ocean thermo-chemical equilibrium. For primitive Titan, estimating the mass, temperature and composition of the primitive atmosphere is important to determine mechanisms that led to the present-day N2-CH4 dominated atmosphere. Similarly, for ocean planets, the influence of ammonia on the atmospheric abundance in CO2 has consequences for the definition of the habitable zone.\nTo investigate the atmospheric composition of the water-rich worlds for a wide range of initial compositions, we have developed a vapor-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where we account for the non-ideal comportment of both vapor and liquid phases and the ion speciation of volatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase. We show that adding NH3 to the CO2-H2O binary system induces an efficient absorption of the CO2 in the liquid phase and thus a lower CO2 partial pressure in the vapor phase. Indeed, the CO2 partial pressure remains low for the CO2/NH3 ratio of liquid concentrations lower than 0.5.\nAssuming various initial compositions of Titan's global water ocean, we explore the thermal and compositional evolution of a massive primitive atmosphere using the thermodynamical model. We are currently investigating how a massive atmosphere may be generated during the satellite growth and how it may then evolve toward a composition dominated by N2. Applications to ocean planets will also be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Injecting fluids into a well deforms the enveloping rocks in a complex pattern that increases in magnitude and expands outward with time. While this evolving strain field creates space needed to store these fluids, it can also signal problems. Fault slip occurs when stresses caused by injection reach a critical value, and maintaining stresses below a critical stress state is important for limiting the risk of faulting and subsequent leakage. Since it is impossible to measure stresses directly, the approach is to measure displacement or strain, and then calculate stress change. The geodetic research community has developed borehole strainmeters capable of measuring the horizontal strain tensor with high resolution (>1 nanostrain), but these require permanent installation and are too expensive to be abandoned after short term studies.\nA far less expensive, removable instrument capable of measuring four components of strain and two components of tilt has been developed. Each sensing component employs non-contact eddy current transducers capable of measuring nanometer displacements. While not as precise as permanent borehole instruments, this new removable system should be able to resolve ground deformations associated with 0.5 to 1 microstrain per day rates expected at a proposed CO2 injection site. This system should also be well-suited for aquifer monitoring as well as for some geophysical signals.\nFinite element techniques are used to simulate a field injection test within the Bartlesville sandstone reservoir at the Avant field CO2 storage analog site, Oklahoma. These models suggest that measuring strain change at shallow depths, on the scale of 100s of ft, can be used to monitor the proposed water injection during a water flooding operation at a depth of approximately 1700 ft. A set of stochastic optimization algorithms are then used to iteratively generate a sequence of parameter estimates, and a high performance cluster computer efficiently evaluates this computationally expensive forward model for each set of parameters. The set of converged parameter estimates is then used to find the expected value of each parameter, as well as the uncertainty of each expected value as required by the measurement limitations (noise, model error, spatial/temporal constraints) we impose on the dataset.",

            "abstract": "A recent comparison of stratospheric water vapor measurements by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and frost point hygrometers (FPs) during 2004-2012 reported agreement better than 1% from 68 to 26 hPa, small but statistically significant biases at 83 and 100 hPa, and no compelling evidence of long-term linear trends in FP–MLS differences [Hurst et al., 2014]. A previous comparison [Voemel et al., 2007] also found good agreement above 83 hPa. Recently it has become evident that differences between FP and MLS stratospheric water vapor measurements have widened during the last 5 years at two Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitude sounding sites.\nHere we examine differences between coincident MLS and FP measurements of stratospheric water vapor at five sounding sites: two in the NH mid-latitudes (Boulder, Colorado and Lindenberg, Germany), two in the tropics (San Jose, Costa Rica and Hilo, Hawaii), and one in the SH mid-latitudes (Lauder, New Zealand). Analyses of the Boulder and Lindenberg data reveal reasonably uniform breakpoints in the timeseries of FP–MLS differences throughout the stratosphere, indicating that trends after mid-2010 are statistically different from trends before mid-2010. At Boulder and Lindenberg the post-breakpoint trends are statistically significant and fairly consistent over eight MLS retrieval pressures (100-26 hPa), averaging –0.08 ± 0.02 and –0.05 ± 0.02 ppmv per year, respectively (Figure 1). These translate to mean changes in stratospheric FP–MLS differences of –0.42 ± 0.08 ppmv (–10 ± 2%) and –0.23 ± 0.08 ppmv (–6 ± 2%) between mid-2010 and mid-2015. Breakpoints for the eight MLS pressure levels above Lauder are less uniform than for the two NH sites, however forced breakpoints of mid-2010 produce a mean stratospheric trend of –0.05 ± 0.02 ppmv per year in the FP–MLS differences. Breakpoints for the two tropical sites are inconsistent, as are the trend results with forced breakpoints of mid-2010.\nHurst, D.F., et al., (2014), J. Geophys. Res.

            "abstract": "Rezasurin has been used as a smart tracer in stream ecosystems to indicate metabolic activity, specifically aerobic respiration by heterotrophic bacteria. Resazurin is a blue compound which is irreversibly reduced to the pink resorufin in the presence of aerobic bacteria. The degree and speed of colour change from blue to pink is a measure of the degree of oxygen consumption and thus an indirect indication of the concentration of aerobic bacteria in a given medium.\nA high concentration of bacteria in water indicates a bad water quality. In our work a method was developed using resazurin agar plates to find a quick and easy way for testing water quality and comparing concentrations of bacteria in freshwater and seawater samples. The theory was to concentrate bacteria from a defined volume of water sample onto polycarbonate filters (0.2 μm), which are then placed onto the resazurin agar plate. The presence of aerobic bacteria on the filter will reduce the resazurin in the agar and the compound changes its colour.\nFirst tests conducted with different dilutions of a pure culture of yoghurt bacteria showed promising results and confirmed the feasibility of the method.\nIn a further assay, we used water samples from different water layers and different temperatures and were also able to observe differences in the concentration of bacteria, depending on these different environmental conditions.\nThe assay was also successfully used with seawater samples, collected from 2 different stations at 3 different depths in the Baltic Sea (salinity=15). The discolouration of the plates showed good correlation with the oxygen concentrations in the water.\nThe resazurin-agar plate method is economical and fast. Several samples could be investigated at the same time without sacrificing the reliability of the results. Thus it is a good pre-screening test for a quantitative evaluation of bacteria in a water sample.",

            "abstract": "Few direct meteorological observations exist in Antarctica, which limits our understanding of the modes of climate variability in this region. In particular, atmospheric reanalyses do not produce a coherent picture of the known warming trend since 1979. Here we analyze a suite of paleo-temperature proxies to gain insight into both the recent temperature trend and the multi-decadal climate variability in Antarctica over the last 1000 years.\nWe present temperature records from two sites in Antarctica: WAIS Divide (79°S, 112°W, 1766 m a.s.l), and Talos Dome (72°S, 159°E, 2315 m a.s.l), reconstructed from the combination of inert gas isotopes from the ice core and borehole temperature measurements. Borehole temperature provides an absolute estimate of long-term trends, while noble gases track decadal to centennial scale changes. In addition, we use water isotopes to infer information about circulation changes.\nWe find a strong warming trend in West Antarctica over the last 50 years (+0.23°C/decade), which is accelerating (+0.8°C/decade since 1980). The longer temperature record shows that such a trend has analogs happening about every 200 years. However, the study of other climate proxies suggests that the recent trend is due to a different mechanism than the previous events.\nWe also find a long term cooling trend over the last 1000 years, which is stronger in East Antarctica (Talos Dome) than in West Antarctica (WAIS-Divide). At WAIS Divide, we find that \"Little Ice Age\" cold period of 1400-1800 was 0.52°C colder than the last century. Overall, both records are consistent with the idea that the solar minima and persistent volcanic activity of the Little Ice Age (1400-1850 A.D.) had a significant impact on the surface temperature in Antarctica. The feedbacks amplifying the forcing were likely stronger on the East Antarctic plateau than on the more marine-influenced West Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "We examined 6 months of seismic recordings collected in 2014 during a temporary experiment carried at Tungurahua. This andesitic stratovolcano has been erupting since 1999 and its activity since late 2008 is characterized by the occurrence of eruptive phases lasting from few weeks to months, separated by quiescence periods. These phases have quite variable temporal evolutions. They include the emission of ash and gases with the occurrence of Strombolian to Vulcanian explosions. We use data from the temporary network and permanent monitoring network which includes 6 broadband and 6 short period stations. The temporary network was installed at the end of October 2013 to improve the density and azimuthal coverage. In 2014, it included 11 broadband stations located up to 4200 m elevation. This network is still running at the time of writing.\nWe processed the data including the eruptive phases of February and April 2014 which started with major Vulcanian explosions generating plumes up to 13,000 m elevation and pyroclastic flows. We first applied waveform classification techniques to search for characteristic short period repeating events. Results outline the presence of several families mostly grouping explosion quakes (EQs) and Long Period events(LPs). We then focused on the location of the seismo-volcanic sources. Volcano-tectonic events are not frequent at Tungurahua. As suggested by waveform classification most of the seismicity is related to eruptive processes with EQs, LPs and tremors. To locate such signals which are often emergent or steady, we used a method based on the decay of the amplitude as a function of the distance. Amplitudes calculated at the different stations are corrected for site effect using coda site amplification factors. Approximating that seismic amplitudes decay as a function of distance as body waves in a homogeneous medium, we use an inversion technique to locate the source of the events. We used this technique to locate the source of tremor observed during the vent opening phases of February 1st and April 4, the source of explosion quakes and the source of a few episodes of harmonic tremor. At this point all source locations indicate an almost common source at about 1 km below the crater. A downward migration of tremor sources is possibly observed during the February vent opening phase.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation has increased by 25% over the last century in the Netherlands. In this period, conversion of peat areas into grassland, expansion of urban areas, and the creation of new land in Lake Ijssel were the largest land cover changes. Both station data analysis (\nDaniels et al. 2014\n) and high-resolution (2.5 km) simulations with the atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model suggest that the observed increase in precipitation is not due to these land cover changes. Instead, the change from historical (1900) to present (2000) land cover decreases precipitation in WRF (Figure).\nHowever, WRF seems to be very sensitive to changes in evapotranspiration. The creation of new land and the expansion of urban areas are similar from a moisture perspective, since they locally decrease evapotranspiration, and therefore affect the soil moisture-precipitation feedback mechanism. In our simulations, the resulting feedback is always positive, as a reduction in evapotranspiration causes a reduction of precipitation.\nThere is a difference between urban areas and land in WRF however. Over urban areas, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height increases more than the lifting condensation level (LCL), and the potential to trigger precipitation hereby increases. This in turn decreases the strength, but not sign, of the soil moisture-precipitation feedback. WRF is therefore unable to reproduce the observed precipitation enhancement downwind of urban areas. In all, it seems the sensitivity of WRF to changes in surface moisture might be too high and this questions the applicability of the model to investigate land cover changes.\nDaniels, E. E., G.

Nearly 4,600 individual observations of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) were made over the seven phenoseasons of a deciduous forest in the Piedmont Region, Maryland. Additionally, to quantify of the effect of various photointensities on the physiological ecology of Lindera benzoin L. Blume (northern spicebush) grown in the lab, health was determined by monitoring physical growth and biomass, and by UV-vis spectrophotometry analysis of leaf extract. Results show understory PAR is typically less than 40% of open PAR. Leafless subcanopy PAR values were almost 10 times higher than leafed season PAR, and sunflecks often three orders of magnitude higher than mean subcanopy PAR during the leafed season. Phenoseason is responsible for nearly three-quarters of the variation between plant canopy levels. Spicebush growth occurred at study locations receiving higher incidence of PAR (> 64th percentile). UV-vis spectrophotometry analysis showed significant differences in root to shoot ratios, biomass, initial stomatal conductance, chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids. Spicebush under lab conditions significantly alter their biomass and individual pigments and pigment ratios in response to high intensity light conditions. Results suggest temporal light sequences in the field may be a very important factor in the functional ecology of northern spicebush.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing consensus to recognize that rheological law established for olivine at high-temperature (ca. >1000°C) fail when extrapolated to low temperatures relevant for the lithospheric mantle. Hence it appears necessary to fit rheological laws against data at low temperatures where olivine tends to become more and more brittle. The usual approach consists in applying confining pressure to inhibit brittleness. Here we propose an innovative approach based on the use of very small samples and numerical modelling.\nNew commercial in situ TEM nanotensile testing equipment recently developed by Hysitron.Inc is combined with weak-beam dark-field TEM diffraction contrast imaging in order to obtain information on the elementary mechanisms controlling the plasticity of olivine: namely glide of [001] screw dislocations. The olivine tensile beams dedicated for in situ TEM nanomechanical testing were produced using microfabrication techniques based on MEMS-type procedures. The testing geometry was designed as to induce maximum resolved shear stresses on the [001](110) slip system. Under tensile loads between 2 and 3 GPa, ductile behaviour was reached with the development and propagation of dislocation loops across the sample allowing to measure the velocity of screw and non-screw dislocations as a function of stress. This information is introduced into a numerical model involving Dislocation Dynamics in order to obtain the stress-strain curves describing the mechanical response of olivine single crystals deformed in tension at room temperature.",

            "abstract": "A suite of enigmatic near-infrared reflectance spectra with a ‘doublet’ absorption between 2.2 and 2.3 µm is observed in CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) hyperspectral images over Ius and Melas Chasma on Mars. The doublet-bearing deposits are found alongside other hydrated minerals including clays, sulfates, and silica, but the mineral(s) responsible for the spectral signature has yet to be identified. Reflectance spectra of rocks and sediments at Rio Tinto, Spain exhibit similar absorptions at airborne, field, and lab spatial scales. Coupled X-ray diffraction and reflectance spectra of these terrestrial examples indicate the absorption arises from a mixture of jarosite, a ferric sulfate, and Al-phyllosilicates (illite/muscovite). Detailed analysis of CRISM data over Ius and Melas Chasma suggests that these deposits also contain mixtures of jarosite and Al-phyllosilicate, where the latter may include halloysite, kaolinite and/or montmorillonite in addition to illite/muscovite. This interpretation is supported because (1) the two absorptions in the doublet feature vary independently, implying the presence of two or more phases, (2) the position of the absorptions is consistent with Al-OH and Fe-OH vibrations in both the Rio Tinto and CRISM spectra and (3) Al-phyllosilicates and jarosite are identified separately in nearby regions. Multiple formation mechanisms are proposed based on stratigraphy in Ius Chasma, where the strength of absorptions varies within a single stratigraphic unit as well as between different units. Mechanisms include authigenic formation of jarosite, which would indicate locally acidic and oxidizing conditions, mixed with detrial Al-phyllosilicates, or authigenic formation of Al-phyllosilicates and jarosite. Each implies different conditions in terms of aqueous geochemistry, redox, and sediment transport. Results from the field, lab, and CRISM analysis will be presented to discuss how placing these spectral observations in proper geologic context is critical for assessing water-rock interaction through space and time within Valles Marineris on Mars.",

            "abstract": "Anomalous warming occurred in the equatorial central-eastern Pacific in early May 2014, attracting much attention to the possible occurrence of an extreme El Niño event that year because of its similarity to the situation in early 1997. However, the subsequent variation in sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) during summer 2014 in the tropical Pacific was evidently different to that in 1997, but somewhat similar to the situation of the 1990 aborted El Niño event. Based on NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) oceanic and atmospheric reanalysis data, the physical processes responsible for the strength of El Niño events are examined by comparing the dominant factors in 2014 in terms of the preceding instability of the coupled ocean–atmosphere system and westerly wind bursts (WWBs) with those in 1997 and 1990, separately. Although the unstable ocean–atmosphere system formed over the tropical Pacific in the preceding winter of 2014, the strength of the preceding instability was relatively weak. Weak oceanic eastward-propagating downwelling Kelvin waves were forced by the weak WWBs over the equatorial western Pacific in March 2014, as in February 1990. The consequent positive upper-oceanic heat content anomalies in the spring of 2014 induced only weak positive SSTAs in the central-eastern Pacific–unfavorable for the subsequent generation of summertime WWB sequences. Moreover, the equatorial western Pacific was not cooled, indicating the absence of positive Bjerknes feedback in early summer 2014. Therefore, the development of El Niño was suspended in summer 2014.",

The GIC due to the SSC was much higher than that during the storm main phase. This phenomenon is more likely to happen at low latitude locations, highlighting the importance of SSC in inducing GIC at low latitude power networks. Furthermore, we run a global MHD model to simulate the GIC during this SSC event by using the solar wind observation as input. The model results reproduced the main features of the GIC. It is also shown that the eastward component of the geoelectric field is dominant for low latitude locations due to the SSC events, topology and electrical parameters of the power grids make significant differences in the GIC levels.",

            "abstract": "In the northern Tethys Himalaya, sporadically distributed oceanic red beds (the Chuangde Formation) have been described. The sequence was interpreted to be firstly deposited in the outer continental shelf and upper slope, and later slumped into deep basin. Based on this model, and paleomagnetic data of shallow water deposits from the southern Tethys Himalaya, the CORBs were derived from the northern tip of the passive margin of the greater India. If so, the CORBs would provide more accurate record of the northern extent of the greater India, which is an important parameter for estimating the initial time of India-Asia continental collision and the amount of crustal shortening. The well studied and most accessible section is located in the Chuangde village, about 40km east from the Gyangze city. The formation is about 25m thick, ranging from 84 to 75Ma in age according to fossil records of planktonic foraminiferal species. The lower and upper parts are 2 and 5 meter thick marlstones, respectively, and the middle section is dominated by shale with a few layers of centimeter scale marlstones. Fifty cores were collected from the marlstones of the section, and for the purpose of fold test, 30 more cores were collected from the upper part of the formation from a second section located in the Pulong village, ~10km to the north of the Chuangde village. All samples were subject to stepwise thermal demagnetization. About 60% of the samples yielded interpretable demagnetization results. The middle part of the formation show reversed high temperature component, and the lower and upper parts show normal polarity. The Chuangde section data failed reversal test, because the normal polarity direction is likely not fully resolved from overprint component. However, the well resolved reversal direction from the Chuangde village and the normal direction from Pulong pass both reversal and fold tests. The mean paleomagnetic data indicate a paleolatitude of 10+/-2 degree north, ~2000 km distance from the southern Tethys Himalaya. Therefore, the formation is not formed near the greater Indian continental margins. Based on recent plate tectonic reconstruction, the CORBs are very likely formed within an island arc depositional setting.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds are an important part of the Earth radiation budget but an accurate assessment of their role remains highly uncertain. Cirrus optical properties such as Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and ice crystal effective particle size are often retrieved with a combination of Visible/Near InfraRed (VNIR) and ShortWave-InfraRed (SWIR) reflectance channels. Alternatively, Thermal InfraRed (TIR) techniques, such as the Split Window Technique (SWT), have demonstrated better accuracy for thin cirrus effective radius retrievals with small effective radii. However, current global operational algorithms for both retrieval methods assume that cloudy pixels are horizontally homogeneous (Plane Parallel Approximation (PPA)) and independent (Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA)). The impact of these approximations on ice cloud retrievals needs to be understood and, as far as possible, corrected.\nHorizontal heterogeneity effects in the TIR spectrum are mainly dominated by the PPA bias that primarily depends on the COT subpixel heterogeneity; for solar reflectance channels, in addition to the PPA bias, the IPA can lead to significant retrieval errors due to a significant photon horizontal transport between cloudy columns, as well as brightening and shadowing effects that are more difficult to quantify. Furthermore TIR retrievals techniques have demonstrated better retrieval accuracy for thin cirrus having small effective radii over solar reflectance techniques. The TIR range is thus particularly relevant in order to characterize, as accurately as possible, thin cirrus clouds.\nHeterogeneity effects in the TIR are evaluated as a function of spatial resolution in order to estimate the optimal spatial resolution for TIR retrieval applications. These investigations are performed using a cirrus 3D cloud generator (3DCloud), a 3D radiative transfer code (3DMCPOL), and two retrieval algorithms, namely the operational MODIS retrieval algorithm (MOD06) and a research-level SWT algorithm.",

The Observatory provides data, infrastructure and educational resources to scientific, educational and general public audiences. We designed NEON’s Education and Outreach (E & O) activities to meet several high-level goals, including (1) facilitating public understanding of ecological science, (2) providing tools to use NEON data, (3) educating the next generation of ecologists, and (4) enhancing diversity within the ecological community. The suite of activities we developed ranges from online resources for using NEON data to a Citizen Science project to traditional undergraduate internship programs and workshops for graduate students/early career scientists.\nThe NEON Construction Project represents one of the first large facilities that included E & O activities as set of deliverables with defined requirements in parallel to other components of construction. This approach proved to be both an opportunity to build a multifaceted E & O program in collaboration with NEON science and engineering, and a challenge as competing priorities sometimes left E & O resource development teams without necessary technical expertise. The result, however, is a robust suite of online educational resources, citizen science opportunities, and in-person training programs. Early evaluation efforts have helped us fine tune our programming to meet the needs of target audiences, including diverse undergraduate students, graduate students, scientists, faculty, edcuators, and citizen scientists. Moving into Operations, we envision an evolving suite of resources and programs that further NEON’s mission and engage audiences in “doing science,” both by using NEON data in a diversity of contexts and participating in our citizen science opportunities.",

            "abstract": "Based on the current state of knowledge, the megathrust/tsunami hazard estimation in the Lesser Antilles forearc remains uncertain. Some major events have been reported (e.g. the 1843 earthquake estimated with a IX intensity), however no associated mega-tsunami has been recorded, maybe because of the nature of the event (slab locked up to the trench or not) or the too short observation period.\nGNSS monitoring networks are deployed on all Caribbean Islands (Guadeloupe and Martinique in particular). However, land areas are far from the trench, and their configuration is not optimal for the strain measurement related to a possible locking between the two plates up to the seafloor.\nThe GPS/Acoustics (GPS/A) technique aims to overcome this limitation. It consists of a surface platform used as a relay between aerial and underwater media. The position is obtained in a global reference frame by GNSS kinematic processing and is transferred to the seafloor by acoustic ranging to a set of transponders permanently installed on the seabed. Repeated measurements over the years will allow to compute the velocity of the study area in a global reference frame.\nWe present a case study for a future deployment of this kind of submarine network off the French Caribbean Islands. Numerical simulations of GPS/A are performed in order to evaluate the accuracy achievable in the Antilles context, using water variability information from past oceanographic campaigns and MOVE buoys. The kinematic GNSS treatments are carried out on test cruises data by different methods (real-time differential, differential post treatment and Precise Point Positioning) to assess the performances in different conditions.\nIn order to characterize the geophysical context, we also present a reprocessing of the GNSS stations of the Guadeloupe and Martinique Islands using a PPP approach with the CNES GINS software, along with a finite element model of the subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Post-collisional magmatism is markedly different in nature and composition than pre-collisional magmas. This is widely interpreted to mark a change in the thermal structure of the system due to the loss of the oceanic slab (slab breakoff), allowing a different source to melt. Early modelling studies suggest that when breakoff takes place at depths shallower than the overriding lithosphere, magmatism occurs through both the decompression of upwelling asthenopshere into the slab window and the thermal perturbation of the overriding lithosphere (Davies & von Blanckenburg, 1995; van de Zedde & Wortel, 2001). Interpretations of geochemical data which invoke slab breakoff as a means of generating magmatism mostly assume these shallow depths. However more recent modelling results suggest that slab breakoff is likely to occur deeper (e.g. Andrews & Billen, 2009; Duretz et al., 2011; van Hunen & Allen, 2011).\nHere we test the extent to which slab breakoff is a viable mechanism for generating melting in post-collisional settings. Using 2-D numerical models we conduct a parametric study, producing models displaying a range of dynamics with breakoff depths ranging from 150 - 300 km. Key models are further analysed to assess the extent of melting. We consider the mantle wedge above the slab to be hydrated, and compute the melt fraction by using a simple parameterised solidus. Our models show that breakoff at shallow depths can generate a short-lived (< 3 Myr) pulse of mantle melting, through the hydration of hotter, undepleted asthenosphere flowing in from behind the detached slab. However, our results do not display the widespread, prolonged style of magmatism, observed in many post-collisional areas, suggesting that this magmatism may be generated via alternative mechanisms. This further implies that using magmatic observations to constrain slab breakoff is not straightforward.",

Seismic and Topas data collected on board were used to organize a coring plan for this expedition. Selection of piston core locations was based on spatial variation in vertical gas migration across seismic patterns indicating BSR migration toward the sediment surface. Higher molecular weight gases were not observed at this location suggesting a biogenic gas source. Across this transect, methane concentrations varied by more than an order of magnitude at stations within a few hundred meters. The highest methane concentrations were 5051.7 ppm in Core 004 at and 2413.4 ppm in Core 036. Concentrations at other sites ranged from 23.8 to 125.9 ppm. Methane concentrations showed a strong correlation with seismic and Topas data that suggested high vertical migration and large shallow gas pockets. While these data focused on locations across a BSR, higher methane concentrations, ranging from 1529 to 7862 ppm were observed in three cores from a nearby site where a BSR was not observed. This presentation will compare spatial variation in the vertical gas migration and stable isotopic composition of sediment organic and inorganic carbon, methane and porewater dissolved inorganic carbon among the core locations to better understand vertical methane migration and shallow sediment methane cycling.",

            "abstract": "The tsunami caused by the 2010 Maule earthquake (MW 8.8) significantly affected the village of Tirúa (Central Chile). In order to estimate the hazard potential of tsunami events it is essential to reliably identify and differentiate tsunami deposits from deposits of other high-energy events like storms. Recently, the microtextural analysis of quartz grain surfaces was introduced as a method to differentiate between tsunami and other deposits.\nWe tested the microtextural analysis method for its capability to identify tsunami deposits using paleotsunami intercalations from a bank profile of the Tirúa river. A total of 815 quartz grains of 4 river bank samples (2 tsunamigenic, 2 non-tsunamigenic) and of 3 reference samples from nearby beach, dune and river were analyzed. In order to generate a valid statistical basis even within individual grain size fractions a large number of grains was studied. Another reason was to compensate the error of the operator’s subjectivity during random picking and microtexture observation. Grain surfaces were analyzed using SEM. We detected 30 individual microtextures grouped into five microtextural families according to angularity, fresh surfaces, percussion marks, adhering particles and dissolution.\nThe grains from the tsunami deposits have high numbers of fresh surfaces and percussion marks. However, in comparison with the non-tsunamigenic deposits and all reference samples (beach, dune and river) the tsunamigenic deposits do not show statistically significant differences in characteristics and abundances in all microtextural families.\nThe homogeneity in microtextural results of all samples indicate the absence of differences between tsunamigenic, beach dune and river deposits. A distinct tsunami signature could not be identified from our microtextural analysis. Our study indicates that the microtextural analysis of quartz grains may not be a suitable method to identify tsunami deposits.",

            "abstract": "Emergency warning systems are the last line of defense for reducing losses from natural hazards. Well-designed systems enable populations-at-risk in impending disasters to take appropriate protective actions. There have been a limited number of research efforts designed to quantify the performance of various types of warning systems and these have been primarily technology-specific. This paper describes the result of research on developing models of warning systems based of the 3 stages of warning: deciding to issue a warning, disseminating the warning to the population-at-risk and initiating a protective action. The warning issuance stage is the time between emergency warning officials being notified of the existence of a threat and reaching a decision to activate the warning system. The warning dissemination stage is the time between that decision and individuals receiving the first warning. The protective action stage is the time between receiving the warning and initiating a protective action. A fourth stage consisting of implementing the protective action is not discussed in this paper.\nThe basic method used in developing models of each stage of the warning process was to first review previous modeling research. Second, assemble historic data on the timing of the warning process. This included point data as well as cumulative distributions. Third, develop a modeling approach to specify a diffusion equation. Fourth, compare the empirical data to the results of the simulation. The attached figure depicts a comparision between simulated warning diffusion and empirical data\nFor each stage, best and worst case curves are develop. Several moderate or average curves are also developed. Factors associated with identifying which curves would be appropriate for a large range of potential event scenarios are identified and discussed. Potential application to lose of life modeling and hazard mitigation strategies are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Measurements from continuous global positioning system (cGPS) networks continue to unfold details about transient strain signals [Mavrommatis et al., 2014; Heki, 2003]. Linking these transient strain signals to seismic events remains elusive, as it requires detailed information about the steady-state tectonic loading sources, faulting geometries, and strain distribution with depth. Here we use cGPS measurements to uncover a regional strain transient peaking just prior to the M6.0 August 24, 2014 South Napa earthquake. This signal appears to have produced a coulomb stress increase, favoring slip on the West Napa faulting system. Analysis of cGPS time series during the interseismic period from 2006 to 2014 shows a stacked summer dilatational lobe of +142 ± 64 x 10-9 in the 100 km2 earthquake region.\nThe Napa region is part of a broad, long wavelength, zone of positive dilatational strain and coulomb stress increase peaking each summer season. Summer transients are associated with horizontal displacements of 3–5 mm directed eastward toward the Sacramento Basin and of 1–3 mm directed southwest toward the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. Winter transients involve the opposite of these motions, causing negative dilatational strains and negative coulomb stress changes in the Napa region.\nWe observe a significant increase in summer seismicity rates (greater than 95% confidence for a Chi-square test) within regions of positive coulomb stress change in Northern California. Large scale models of vertical hydrologic loading predict some components of the long-wavelength horizontal signal in Northern California, but this loading accounts for only 20 – 30% of the total anomalous signal. We hypothesize that the remaining signal is associated with smaller-scale seasonal groundwater fluctuations in local basins (e.g., the Sonoma and Napa sub-basins) along with thermoelastic effects. We provide details regarding the amount of thermoelastic strain from the elastic portion of the Earth’s crust that contributes to our signal [Prawirodirdjo et al., 2006; Ben Zion and Allam, 2013]. Our results suggest that densely instrumented geodetic networks are capable of monitoring subtle strain changes within the crust and have the potential to improve region-specific seismicity forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The onsets and development of large solar energetic (E > 10 MeV) particle (SEP) events have been characterized in many studies. The statistics of SEP event onset delay times from associated solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which depend on solar source longitudes, can be used to provide better predictions of whether a SEP event will occur following a large flare or fast CME. In addition, size distributions of peak SEP event intensities provide a means for a probabilistic forecast of peak intensities attained in observed SEP increases. SEP event peak intensities have been compared with their rise and decay times for insight into the acceleration and transport processes. These two time scales are generally treated as independent parameters describing the development of a SEP event, but we can invoke an alternative two-parameter description based on the assumption that decay times exceed rise times for all events. These two parameters, from the well known Weibull distribution, provide an event description in terms of its basic shape and duration. We apply this distribution to several large SEP events and ask what the characteristic parameters and their dependence on source longitudes can tell us about the origins of these important events.",

            "abstract": "Numerous existing hydrological models are different perspectives of the system, and inevitably, are imperfect representations of reality. Irrespective of the choice of models, the major source of error in any hydrological modeling is due to the uncertainty in the determination of model parameters, owing to a mismatch between model complexity and the level of data which is available to parameterize, initialize, and calibrate such models. A sensitivity analysis (SA) to determine the possible values assigned to the parameters and the qualitative and or quantitative variations in the output of a model associated should be an integral part of any hydrological modelling study. SA methods help to identify the parameters that have a strong impact on the model outputs and hence influence the model response.Various methods are available to perform sensitivity analysis and the perturbation technique varies from approach to approach. In this study the applicability of a more complex sensitivity analysis approach, variance based method, is studied. However, since, variance based methods considers the entire range of parameter space and their possible interactions, hence making it computationally intensive; therefore, Latin hypercube sampling method is employed to screen the sample space. To check the feasibility of integrating Variance based method with Latin hypercube sampling, this hybrid approach is applied on the outputs generated by Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC), which is a semi-distributed model having the feature of sub grid variability. Mahanadi basin (India), draining an area of around 1,41,600sq km, has been selected as the study area, as it is repetitively facing the adverse hydro-meteorological conditions such as floods, droughts and cyclones in the recent times. The developed methodology, in addition to some relaxation over computational time, provide more rigorous analysis of model parameters by capturing the influence of the full range of variation of all model parameters on model output.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we present new insights in nutrient sources and transport processes in an agricultural-dominated lowland water system based on high-frequency monitoring technology. Starting in October 2014, we have collected semi-continuous measurements of the TP and NO3 concentrations, conductivity and water temperature at a large scale pumping station at the outlet of a 576 km2 polder catchment. The semi-continuous measurements complement a water quality monitoring program at six locations within the drainage area based on conventional monthly or biweekly grab sampling. The NO3 and TP concentrations at the pumping station varied between 0.5 and 10 mgN/L and 0.1 and 0.5 mgP/L. The seasonal trends and short scale concentration dynamics clearly indicated that most of the NO3 loads at the pumping station originated from subsurface drain tubes that were active after intensive rainfall events during the winter months. A transfer function-noise model of hourly NO3 concentrations reveals that a large part of the dynamics in NO3 concentrations during the winter months can be predicted using rainfall data. In February however, NO3 concentrations were higher than predicted due to direct losses after the first manure application. The TP concentration almost doubled during operation of the pumping station. This highlights resuspension of particulate P from channel bed sediments induced by the higher flow velocities during pumping. Rainfall events that caused peaks in NO3 concentrations did not result in TP concentration peaks. Direct effects of run-off, with an association increase in the TP concentration and decrease of the NO3concentration, was only observed during rainfall event at the end of a freeze-thaw cycle. The high-frequency monitoring at the outlet of an agricultural-dominated lowland water system in combination with low-frequency monitoring within the area provided insight in nutrient sources and transport processes that are highly relevant for water quality management.",

            "abstract": "The role of natural organic matter in regulating the redox reactions as an electron shuttle has received lots of attention, because it can significantly affect the environmental degradation of contaminants and biogeochemical cycles of major elements. However, up to date, limited studies examined the role of natural organic matter in affecting the microbial dehalogenation of emergent organohalides, a critical detoxification process. In this study, we investigated the humic substance (HS)-mediated microbial dehalogenation of triclosan, a widely used antimicrobial agent. We found that the presence of HS stimulated the microbial degradation of triclosan by Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32. In the absence of HS, the triclosan was degraded gradually, achieving 8.6% residual at 8 days. With HS, the residual triclosan was below 2% after 4 days. Cl- was confirmed by ion chromatography analysis, but the dehalogenation processes and other byproducts warrant further investigations. The impact of HS on the degradation of triclosan was highly dependent on the concentration of HS. When the HS was below 15 mg/L, the degradation rate constant for triclosan increased with the organic carbon concentration. Beyond that point, the increased organic carbon concentration decreased the degradation of triclosan. Microbially pre-reduced HS abiotically reduced triclosan, testifying the electron shuttling processes. These results indicate that dissolved organic matter plays a dual role in regulating the degradation of triclosan: it mediates electron transport and inhibits the bioavailability through complexation. Such novel organic matter-mediated reactions for organohalides are important for evaluating the natural attenuation of emergent contaminants and designing cost-effective engineering treatment.",

            "abstract": "An important goal of science education is to support development of citizens to participate in public debate and make informed decisions relevant to their lives and their worlds. The NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) suggest engaging students in science classrooms in argumentation as a practice to help enhance the quality of evidence based decision making. In this multi-case study, we explored the use of written argumentation in eight secondary school science classrooms during a lesson on the relationship between ocean temperature and its CO2 holding capacity. All teachers of these classrooms were trained during a day long NSF funded Climate Literacy Workshop on the basic concepts of climate science, scientific practices and implementation of an activity called “It’s a Gassy World”. The data of the current study involved students’ written arguments, teachers’ written reflections on the implementation of the activity as well as field notes from the Climate Literacy Workshop. A qualitative discourse analysis of the data was used to find common themes around affordances and challenges of argument as a connective discourse for scientific practices to teach climate change. The findings show that participating in written argumentation process encouraged students to discuss their experimental design and use data interpretation for their evidences. However, the results also indicated the following challenges: a) teachers themselves need support in connecting their evidence to their claims, b) arguing a socioscientific issue creates a sensitive environment c) conceptual quality of an argument needs to be strengthen through background in courses other than science, and d) graphing skills (or lack of) can interfere with constructing scientifically accurate claims. This study has implications in effectively teaching climate change through argumentation, and thus creating opportunities for practicing authentic climate science research in K-12 classrooms.",

The inclusion of finite temperature effects makes the fourth order dispersion relation become sixth order.\nWe compare our results with the work done by previous researchers for cold plasma environments, using two near earth space models (NGO and GCPM).\nInclusion of finite temperature closes the otherwise open refractive index surface near the lower hybrid resonance frequency and affects the magnetospheric reflection of whistler waves.

A further statistical comparison of observed timescales of SEP events from behind the west limb with events similarly poorly magnetically connected to the eastern hemisphere shows the longer timescales of the latter group.

            "abstract": "Long runout landslides are one of the most remarkable and enigmatic geologic processes. During these events, large masses of rock fall a height, H,from a mountainside and runout extraordinary distances, L, along relatively flat surfaces. For rock masses with volumes exceeding 109 m3, these landslides regularly runout more than 10 times longer than the height they fall from (H/L<0.1). Even at seemingly safe distances from mountainsides, these landslides are devastating to life and property. Understanding this puzzling process can aid in hazard mitigation and may even help us understand the apparent reduction of friction observed in other geologic processes such as earthquakes. Campbell et al. [1995, doi:10.1029/94JB00937] model long runout landslides as granular flows using a soft-particle code. Their model largely simulates landslides from first principles and, although no fluid or obvious mechanism for reduction of friction is included, the model successfully reproduced many observations of long runout landslides (eg. the preservation of source stratigraphy in the final slide mass and decreasing H/L with increasing slide volume). We extend the work of Campbell et al. [1995] with a focus on the mechanism that reduces friction in these slides. We find sliding preferentially occurs when the overburden is relieved by pressure variations in the slide, similar to the pore pressure fluctuations observed in debris flows [Iverson and LaHusen, 1989 doi:10.1126/science.246.4931.796], but in this case without interstitial fluid. Although this is the hallmark of the acoustic fluidization hypothesis, we find that low frequency pressure variations are responsible for the relief of overburden instead of the kilohertz frequencies suggested by Melosh [1979, doi:10.1029/JB084iB13p07513].",

            "abstract": "In the general context of understanding the possible destabilization of the magnetotail before a substorm, a kinetic model for electromagnetic instabilities in resonant interaction with trapped bouncing electrons has been proposed for several years. Fruit et al. 2013 already used it to investigate the possibilities for electrostatic instabilities. Tur et al. 2014 generalizes the model for full electromagnetic perturbations.\nIt turns out that some corrections should be added to the electrostatic version of Fruit et al. 2013. We propose to revist the theory in this present paper.\nStarting with a modified 2D Harris sheet as equilibrium state, the linearized gyrokinetic Vlasov equation is solved for electrostatic fluctuations with period of the order of the electron bounce period (a few seconds). The particle motion is restricted to its first Fourier component along the magnetic field and this allows the complete time integration of the non local perturbed distribution functions. The dispersion relation for electrostatic modes is finally obtained through the quasineutrality condition.\nThe new feature of the present model is the inclusion of diamagnetic drift effects due to the density gradient in the tail. It is well known in MHD theory that drift waves are driven unstable through collisions or other dissipative effects. Here electrostatic drift waves are revisited in this more complete kinetic model including bouncing electrons and finite Larmor radius effects. A new mode has been found with original propagation proprieties. It is moreover mildly unstable due to electron or ion damping (dissipative instability).",

            "abstract": "Flash flooding causes widespread disruption and damage across the UK, with recent research indicating that the occurrence and severity of intense rainfall is likely to increase in the future. To date, our ability to model such events at anything other than local scales has been hindered both by a lack of data at adequate spatial and temporal resolutions and a limited understanding of the processes involved in flooding from short duration, high intensity rainfall events. To enable effective flood risk management and decisions, it is essential that we improve our understanding of the variability in risk from such events across the UK and this requires an ability to undertake flash flood modelling at regional scales.\nIn this study, we have implemented a coupled hydrological – hydrodynamic model for the representation of flash flooding at regional scales over long durations. To provide inputs to these models, we have developed a gridded sub-daily (hourly) rainfall record of the UK from 1993 to 2011. This enables us to more accurately represent flooding resulting from short duration rainfall events that are poorly represented by commonly utilised daily rainfall data. For a given region of interest we cascade rainfall estimates from our sub-daily dataset into a semi-distributed hydrological model (Dynamic Topmodel) in order to generate river discharge estimates which are then used to force a widely utilised inundation model (LISFLOOD-FP).\nHere we present the results from a test case in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the modelling framework over a variety of events with differing characteristics. The results will provide an insight into our capabilities of representing flash flooding and highlight key areas for future model development and enhanced process understanding.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's iron-rich inner core is seismically anisotropic, which may be due to the preferred orientation of Fe-rich hexagonal close packed (hcp) alloy crystals. Elastic anisotropy in a hexagonal crystal is related to its c/a axial ratio; therefore, it is important to know how this ratio depends on volume (or pressure), temperature, and composition. Experimental data on the axial ratio of iron and alloys in the Fe–Ni–Si system from 15 previous studies are combined here to parameterize the effects of these variables. The axial ratio increases with increasing volume, temperature, silicon content, and nickel content. When an hcp phase coexists with another structure, sample recovery and chemical analysis from each pressure–temperature point is one method for determining the phase's composition and thus the position of the phase boundary. An alternate method is demonstrated here, using this parameterization to calculate the composition of an hcp phase whose volume, temperature, and axial ratio are measured. The hcp to hcp+B2 phase boundary in the Fe–FeSi system is parameterized as a function of pressure, temperature, and composition, showing that a silicon-rich inner core may be an hcp+B2 mixture. These findings could help explain observations of a layered seismic anisotropy structure in the Earth's inner core.",

            "abstract": "Most people live near a river which is actively transporting sediment, and for many, a change in sediment\ndynamics can greatly a ffect livelihoods. A better understanding of sediment transport mechanics is critical\nfor improving our coexistence with river systems, especially in the face of a changing climate. However,\nthere are currently few ways in which to measure and quantify sediment transport rates in rivers. Tracer\nexperiments are laborious and time consuming, sediment traps are di\u000effcult to construct without altering\nflow dynamics, and reservoir in fill methods require long observation timescales. The di\u000efficulty in obtaining\nthese data has precluded its collection on a large scale and is limiting progress within the fi eld. A method\nthat circumvents these issues would be invaluable.\nWe present a new means to estimate the sediment transport rates of rivers using luminescence, a property\nof minerals used by the geoscience community for geochronology. Luminescence is a concentration of energy\nstored within the crystal lattice of minerals that can be removed by sunlight and restored by natural radiation.\nWe use a continuity equation to describe the change in luminescence equivalent doses as a function of\ndownstream distance and compare against eld data. Our model can reproduce fi eld measurements from\ntwo rivers with varying sediment transport styles for fi ne sand (180-200 µ\u0016m). The fi eld data and modeling\nresults reveal two patterns of interest for both rivers: an upstream region showing a gradual decline in\nluminescence followed by a region where the luminescence is approximately constant. When the observed\nluminescence is spatially constant, this represents a balance between bleaching and in flux of unbleached\nsediment. The information obtained from applying the model to these regions can be used to estimate\nsediment velocity and erosion and deposition of unbleached and bleached grains. Potential exists to extend\nthe model to bedload transport.",

            "abstract": "The transport of terrestrial organic carbon (OC) to downstream systems via the fluvial network represents a “leakage” of terrestrial net primary production. The age of OC exported ranges from modern OC, derived from surficial soils and leaf litter, to ancient OC that had been stored for millennia on land. The age and ultimately the fate of this OC has ramifications for both the terrestrial carbon balance and the anthropogenic CO2 budget. Consequently, it is critical to understand the environmental and landscape associated factors that influence the age of OC laterally transferred to aquatic systems. We compiled radiocarbon data for both dissolved OC (DOC) (n = 670) and particulate OC (POC) (n = 722) for both rivers and streams. Sampling locations (n = 382) and their associated watersheds (1x10-2 km2 to 4.7x106 km2) encompassed a range from 38.7 oS to 74.9 oN. These radiocarbon values were paired with associated ancillary data, when available (OC concentration, δ13C), and subsequently combined with a spatial dataset developed in ArcGIS for corresponding watersheds. The spatial dataset contained a range of landscape parameters including mean elevation, relief, mean slope, and stream order as well as soil typology and land use. Δ14CDOC ranged from -974 ‰ to +383 ‰ (mean = 3 ‰, standard deviation (s.d.) = 150 ‰) and Δ14CPOC ranged from -992 ‰ to +227 ‰ (mean = -234 ‰, s.d. = 253 ‰) demonstrating a trend of younger DOC relative to its particulate counterpart. Landscape characteristics were first analyzed for their influence on radiocarbon ages of DOC and POC at a global scale. The data were then aggregated by biome (n = 14) to assess the role of regional environmental characteristics (i.e. precipitation, temperature, soil organic carbon) on DOC and POC age. Models were derived to determine the principle drivers of the radiocarbon age of OC in streams and rivers, among the landscape and environmental characteristics, for each biome.",

We provide in-depth training as well as an alumni network for ongoing learning, implementation support, leadership development, and coalition building. Our goals are to achieve a systemic national impact, embed our work within multiple ongoing regional and national climate change education networks, and leave an enduring legacy. Our project represents a cross-disciplinary partnership among climate scientists, social and cognitive scientists, and informal education practitioners. We have built a growing national network of more than 250 alumni, including approximately 15-20 peer leaders who co-lead both in-depth training programs and introductory workshops. We have found that this alumni network has been assuming increasing importance in providing for ongoing learning, support for implementation, leadership development, and coalition building.\nAs we look toward the future, we are exploring potential partnerships with other existing networks, both to sustain our impact and to expand our reach.

The temperature, density and macro-velocity variations are calculated as functions of both column and linear depths for different mixed beams revealing strong sweeping of a flaring atmosphere under the quiet photosphere level (QFL). This results in subsequent plasma evaporation into the upper atmosphere and formation of supersonic shocks moving into the solar interior and terminating at depths of 300-5000 km beneath the QFL. The shocks deposited at different depths below the photosphere are found to define the parameters of seismic responses in the interior and their observation as sunquakes, according to the hydrodynamic model of wave propagation (Zharkov, 2013). In addition, we compare temporal and spatial distributions of HXR and optical emission in a few acoustically active flares with those produced by the complex simulations above, in attempt to resolve the puzzle of co-spatial formation of HXR and WL emission reported by Martinez-Oliveros et al.

            "abstract": "Over the last several decades there has been a marked increase in the number of dams removed in the United States, including the recent removal of large dams impounding millions of cubic meters of sediment. From these removals, common findings have begun to emerge: (1) Rivers are resilient, showing rapid geomorphic and sedimentary response to dam removals, especially when removals are sudden rather than prolonged, and where rivers have adequate stream power. Rivers can rapidly evacuate large percentages of stored reservoir sediment (≥40% within one year)—particularly where sediment is coarse-grained (sand and gravel), and can move evacuated sediment long distances (>20 km downstream) within a year, given sufficient transport capacity. The channel downstream typically takes months to years—not decades—to achieve a degree of stability within its natural range of variability. (2) Modest flows can erode large amounts of reservoir sediment and move it downstream. Large floods are not required to move substantial sediment volumes, especially from non-cohesive reservoir deltas. Once the most easily accessed sediment is eroded, however, larger floods can continue to access the remnant reservoir sediment and redistribute it downstream. Portions of the redistributed sediment remain (up- and downstream of the dam site), shaping a new landscape. (3) Dam height, sediment volume, and sediment grain size and cohesion strongly influence response to dam removal. Although removals of small dams with little stored sediment are more common, removals of large dams (≥10 m) with major sediment releases have had longer-lasting and more widespread downstream effects. (4) Downstream valley morphology and hydrology strongly influence the distribution of released sediment. Bedrock confinement versus wide alluvial reaches, downstream channel gradient, locations and depths of channel pools, locations and geometries of existing channel bars, position of the dam within a watershed, and flood occurrence all influence the downstream fate of released sediment. These findings increase understanding of the physical response to dam removal, set the stage for anticipating habitat and ecological changes, and allow better predictions for the outcomes of future dam removals.",

            "abstract": "We present the methodology and results from the development of a near-global 'bare-earth' Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. Digital Elevation Models are the most important input for hazard modelling, as the DEM quality governs the accuracy of the model outputs. While SRTM is currently the best near-globally [60N to 60S] available DEM, it requires adjustments to reduce the vegetation contamination and make it useful for hazard modelling over heavily vegetated areas (e.g. tropical wetlands). Unlike previous methods of accounting for vegetation contamination, which concentrated on correcting relatively small areas and usually applied a static adjustment, we account for vegetation contamination globally and apply a spatial varying correction, based on information about canopy height and density. Our new 'Bare-Earth' SRTM DEM combines multiple remote sensing datasets, including ICESat GLA14 ground elevations, the vegetation continuous field dataset as a proxy for penetration depth of SRTM and a global vegetation height map, to remove the vegetation artefacts present in the original SRTM DEM.\nIn creating the final 'bare-earth' SRTM DEM dataset, we produced three different 'bare-earth' SRTM products. The first applies global parameters, while the second and third products apply parameters that are regionalised based on either climatic zones or vegetation types, respectively. We also tested two different canopy density proxies of different spatial resolution. Using ground elevations obtained from the ICESat GLA14 satellite altimeter, we calculate the residual errors for the raw SRTM and the three 'bare-earth' SRTM products and compare performances. The three 'bare-earth' products all show large improvements over the raw SRTM in vegetated areas with the overall mean bias reduced by between 75 and 92% from 4.94 m to 0.40 m. The overall standard deviation is reduced by between 29 and 33 % from 7.12 m to 4.80 m. As expected, improvements are higher in areas with denser vegetation. The final 'bare-earth' SRTM dataset is available at 3 arc-second with lower vertical height errors and less noise than the original SRTM product.",

We performed a large-scale statistical study on 7 years of THEMIS particle data when these are suitably located close to the magnetopause. Our findings show that combined double populations in both ions and electrons appear much less frequently than double ion populations alone. The analysis of IMF data suggests that such boundary layers form preferentially under northward IMF but with a significant By component. We interpret this trend as a result of reconnection of the same magnetosheath field line in both hemispheres, but with at least one end reconnecting in its hemisphere at a rather low latitude with a closed magnetospheric field line which already contains a hot electron source. We explain how a full understanding of the dayside magnetopause topology under northward IMF will require much higher resolution observations at the subsolar magnetopause by MMS.",

Analyses are carried out for both hemispheres and several smaller sub-regions. These datasets allow assessing the long and short-term variability of these events beyond the past 60 years covered by common reanalysis products. Due to the damage-related impact of strong cyclones and wind storms, knowledge about their variability is of high importance for societies and economies. Cyclones and wind storms are identified using two objective algorithms based on six hourly mean sea level pressure fields and near-surface wind speeds, respectively.\nCyclone and windstorm time series are low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1/31 years. High-frequency time series are obtained by calculating the residuum between the original and the low-pass filtered time series. Additionally, linear trends are calculated to analyse long-term trends for three periods: 1901-1930, 1931-1960 and 1961-1999.\nThe results show substantial differences regarding the long-term trends of cyclones and wind storms between both datasets, especially during the early 20th century. In general, better agreement is found for the end of the century and to some extend also for the most severe cyclones. In contrast, higher-frequency variability is in general in good agreement between both datasets regardless of different long-term trends and also has a higher agreement at the end of the century.\nThe outcome of this study indicates that based on these two datasets no reliable conclusion about long-term trends of extra-tropical cyclones and wind storm events before the mid of the 20th century can be drawn. However, analyses focusing on higher-frequency variability of these events and its drivers may be useful, if taking into account long-term trends.",

This can lead to significant uncertainties in the position and concentration of the modelled ash cloud downwind of the vent. Methods such as inversion modelling have successfully constrained such uncertainties, but in this work estimation of the eruption source parameters for the atmospheric dispersion model NAME is bypassed by implementing data insertion. Using this method under development, ash cloud properties retrieved from satellite imagery are used to create ash sources downwind from the volcano vent, from which dispersion simulations are initialised. Using the satellite retrievals, a set of simulations are initialised from different times and combined to create forecasts. In other experiments the simulations are sequentially updated using a probabilistic cloud / ash / clear classification scheme to correct the model state over time. Simulations from the Eyjafjallajökull and Grímsvötn eruptions compare well against other established modelling methods and satellite observations.",

Relative green vegetation fraction was calculated from seasonally-acquired Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data using pre-drought 2011 AVIRIS data as a baseline. Land surface temperature was retrieved from MODIS-ASTER Simulator (MASTER) data. Deeply rooted tree species, tree species found on more mesic north-facing slopes, and tree species found in riparian areas had the least change in relative green vegetation fraction in 2013 and 2014 (e.g. QUAG and UMCA in the figure below). Coastal sage scrub and chaparral shrub species demonstrated greater variability as well as a long-term decline in relative green vegetation fraction. Three Ceanothus species (CECU, CEME, and CESP in the figure below) had more severe reductions in relative green vegetation fraction in comparison to another common chaparral shrub species, Adenostoma fasciculatum (ADFA). Species formed clusters in the space defined by land surface temperature and relative green vegetation fraction. Declining relative green vegetation fraction corresponded with increasing land surface temperature. Combined, routine acquisition of imaging spectrometer and thermal infrared imagery should provide new opportunities for monitoring drought impacts on ecosystems.",

This study tested performance of three single-polarized (HH) TDM acquisitions for forest structure estimation over a coniferous forest of Sierra Nevada. Complex interferometric coherences were calculated and applied in a widely used scattering model – the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model to retrieve the forest structural properties. Scattering phase height (SPH) was derived from the interferometric phase for an evaluation of the average scattering height of this forest and the overall penetration capability of TDM X-band signal over this area. Since only single-polarized TDM data are available, in order to keep the RVoG inversion balanced and solvable, either one of the following two strategies can be applied: 1) simulating the ground phase using a digital terrain model (DTM) from Lidar, and 2) assuming a fixed extinction coefficient value for the entire study area when a Lidar DTM is not used. This study firstly used a 5-m Lidar DTM to estimate the SPH and RVoG forest height. All SPH of the three TDM acquisitions have demonstrated strong correlations to the Lidar RH100 (canopy top height) with r2 of 0.75~0.77, bias of -11.60~-12.58m (i.e. the mean height difference between SPH and canopy top height; this bias can be associated to the average penetration depth) and RMSE of 12.79~13.73m at 90m. An r2 of 0.79~0.81, bias of 0.37~1.97m and RMSE of 5.11~5.56m was observed between all the RVoG forest height and Lidar RH100. The study also tested the second method by fixing the extinction value, i.e. without applying a Lidar DTM for the ground phase. Despite the large variety of forest density and height over this area, the derived RVoG forest height has a surprisingly good correlation to the Lidar RH100 with r2 of 0.45~0.55, bias of 1.01~1.61m and RMSE of 7.65~8.85m for all TDM acquisitions. These results are promising as they demonstrate the great potential of the TDM mission for very large-scale forest structure estimation in the future.",

The goal and purpose of such a system is to reduce, or minimize, the damage, costs, and casualties resulting from an earthquake. A demonstration earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert) is undergoing testing in the United States by the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, Caltech, ETH Zurich, University of Washington, the USGS, and beta users in California and the Pacific Northwest.\nThe UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory has created a smartphone app called MyEEW, which interfaces with the ShakeAlert system to deliver early warnings to individual users. Many critical facilities (transportation, police, and fire) have control rooms, which could run a centralized interface, but our ShakeAlert Beta Testers have also expressed their need for mobile options. This app augments the basic ShakeAlert Java desktop applet by allowing workers off-site (or merely out of hearing range) to be informed of coming hazards.\nMyEEW receives information from the ShakeAlert system to provide users with real-time information about shaking that is about to happen at their individual location. It includes a map, timer, and earthquake information similar to the Java desktop User Display. The app will also feature educational material to help users craft their own response and resiliency strategies.

            "abstract": "Intermittency is one of the critical unsolved problems in solar-wind turbulence. Intermittency is important not just because it affects the observable properties of turbulence in the inertial range, but also because it modifies the nature of turbulent dissipation at small scales. In this talk, I will present recent work by colleagues A. Schekochihin, A. Mallet, and myself that focuses on the development of intermittency within the inertial range of solar-wind turbulence. We restrict our analysis to the transverse, non-compressive component of the turbulence. Previous work has shown that this component of the turbulence is anisotropic, varying most rapidly in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. We argue that, deep within the inertial range, this component of the turbulence is well modeled by the equations of reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We then develop an analytic model of intermittent, three-dimensional, strong, reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with zero cross helicity. We take the fluctuation amplitudes to have a log-Poisson distribution and incorporate into the model a new phenomenology of scale-dependent dynamic alignment. The log-Poisson distribution in our model is characterized by two parameters. To calculate these parameters, we make use of two assumptions: that the energy cascade rate is independent of scale within the inertial range and that the most intense coherent structures at scale lambda are sheet-like with a volume filling factor proportional to lambda. We then compute the scalings of the power spectrum, the kurtosis, higher-order structure functions, and three different average alignment angles. We also carry out a direct numerical simulation of RMHD turbulence. The scalings in our model are similar to the scalings in this simulation as well as the structure-function scalings observed in the slow solar wind.",

The last large volcanic eruption, the June 15, 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, was the best observed eruption ever, and serves as a canonical example for studies of aerosol production and transport, climate response, and deposition on ice sheets. However, many aspects of both eruptions were poorly observed, climate model simulations of the response are imperfect, and new scientific issues, such as stratospheric sulfate geoengineering, raise new scientific questions that could be answered by better observations of the next large volcanic eruption. In this talk I will summarize what we know and do not know about large volcanic eruptions, and discuss new questions that can be addressed by being prepared for the next large eruption. These include:\nHow and how fast will SO2 convert to sulfate aerosols?\nHow will the aerosols grow?\nWhat will be the size distribution of the resulting sulfate aerosol particles?\nHow will the aerosols be transported throughout the stratosphere?\nHow much fine ash gets to the stratosphere, how long does it stay there, and what are its radiative and chemical impacts?\nHow will temperatures change in the stratosphere as a result of the aerosol interactions with shortwave (particularly near IR) and longwave radiation?\nAre there large stratospheric water vapor changes associated with stratospheric aerosols? Is there an initial injection of water from the eruption?\nIs there ozone depletion from heterogeneous reactions on the stratospheric aerosols?\nAs the aerosols leave the stratosphere, and as the aerosols affect the upper troposphere temperature and circulation, are there interactions with cirrus and other clouds?",

            "abstract": "West Africa has been highlighted as a hot spot of land surface–atmosphere interactions. This study analyses the outputs of the project Land-Use and Climate, IDentification of Robust Impacts (LUCID) over West Africa. LUCID used seven atmosphere–land models with a common experimental design to explore the impacts of Land Use induced Land Cover Change (LULCC) that are robust and consistent across the climate models. Focusing the analysis on Sahel and Guinea, this study shows that, even though the seven climate models use the same atmospheric and land cover forcing, there are significant differences of West African Monsoon variability across the climate models. The magnitude of that variability differs significantly from model to model resulting two major \"features\": (1) atmosphere dynamics models; (2) how the land-surface functioning is parameterized in the Land surface Model, in particular regarding the evapotranspiration partitioning within the different land-cover types, as well as the role of leaf area index (LAI) in the flux calculations and how strongly the surface is coupled to the atmosphere. The major role that the models’sensitivity to land-cover perturbations plays in the resulting climate impacts of LULCC has been analysed in this study. The climate models show, however, significant differences in the magnitude and the seasonal partitioning of the temperature change. The LULCC induced cooling is directed by decreases in net shortwave radiation that reduced the available energy (QA) (related to changes in land-cover properties other than albedo, such as LAI and surface roughness), which decreases during most part of the year. The biophysical impacts of LULCC were compared to the impact of elevated greenhouse gases resulting changes in sea surface temperatures and sea ice extent (CO2SST). The results show that the surface cooling (related a decrease in QA) induced by the biophysical effects of LULCC are insignificant compared to surface warming (related an increase in QA), which is induced by the regional significance effect of CO2SST due to a small LULCC imposed. In contrast, the decrease of surface water balance resulting from LULCC effect is a similar sign to those resulting from CO2SST but the signal resulting of the biophysical effects of LULCC is stronger than the regional CO2SST impact.",

One of its major products will be the measurements of continental water extent, including the width, height, and slope of rivers and the surface area and elevations of lakes. The mission will improve the monitoring of continental water and also our understanding of the interactions between different hydrologic reservoirs. For rivers, SWOT measurements of slope must be carried out over predefined river reaches. As such, an a priori dataset for rivers is needed in order to facilitate analysis of the raw SWOT data. The information required to produce this dataset includes measurements of river width, elevation, slope, planform, river network topology, and flow accumulation. To produce this product, we have linked two existing global datasets: the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) database, which contains river centerline locations, widths, and a braiding index derived from Landsat imagery, and a modified version of the HydroSHEDS hydrologically corrected digital elevation product, which contains heights and flow accumulation measurements for streams at 3 arcsecond spatial resolution. Merging these two datasets requires considerable care. The difficulties, among others, lie in the difference of resolution: 30m versus 3 arseconds, and the age of the datasets: 2000 versus ~2010 (some rivers have moved, the braided sections are different). As such, we have developed custom software to merge the two datasets, taking into account the spatial proximity of river channels in the two datasets and ensuring that flow accumulation in the final dataset always increases downstream. Here, we present our preliminary results for a portion of South America and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the method. ",

These emissions are relevant to both air quality and climate change. Since 2010 in the US, new engines are required to be equipped with emission control systems that greatly reduce both PM and NOx emissions, by ~98% relative to 1988 levels. To reduce emissions from the legacy fleet of older trucks that still remain on the road, regulations have been adopted in Califonia to accelerate the replacement of older trucks and thereby reduce associated emissions of PM and NOx. Use of diesel particle filters will be widespread by 2016, and universal use of catalytic converters for NOx control is required by 2023. We assess the air quality consequences of this clean-up effort in Southern California, using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), and comparing three scenarios: historical (2005), present day (2016), and future year (2023). Emissions from the motor vehicle sector are mapped at high spatial resolution based on traffic count and fuel sales data. NOx emissions from diesel engines in 2023 are expected to decrease by ~80% compared to 2005, while the fraction of NOx emitted as NO2 is expected to increase from 5 to 18%. Air quality model simulations will be analyzed to quantify changes in NO2, black carbon, particulate matter, and ozone, both basin-wide and near hot spots such as ports and major highways.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades, X-ray spectroscopic techniques using very intense synchrotron radiation (SR) have become indispensable tools for studying geomaterials. Due to the rather low absorption of hard X-rays, SR opens up the possibility to perform measurements in high-pressure, high temperature cells. The range of elements accessible by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) techniques in these cells is limited by the absorption of X-rays due to the sample environment, i.e. the diamond windows. The indirect measurement of XAFS spectra by inelastic X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) provides a workaround to access absorption edges at low energies (e.g. low Z elements). Therefore, XRS enables measurements that are similar to electron energy loss spectroscopy but offer to measure at in-situ conditions and not just in vacuum.\nMeasurements of the O K-edge of H2O from ambient to supercritical PT-conditions (up to 600°C @ 134 MPa; 400°C @ 371 MPa) were used to trace structural changes of the hydrogen-bonded network, which controls many physical and chemical properties of H2O [1]. The Fe M3,2-edge measured by XRS were used to characterize the oxidation state and local structure in crystalline compounds and glasses [2]. Furthermore, the M3,2 yields detailed insight to the crystal-field splitting and electronic spin state. In a reconnaissance study, the pressure-induced high-spin to low-spin transition of Fe in FeS between 6 and 8 GPa was measured. By multiplet calculations of the spectra for octahedral Fe2+, a difference in crystal field splitting between the two states of ca. 1.7 eV was estimated [3]. Finally, we successfully assessed the electronic structure of Fe in siderite by measurements of M and L-edge up to 50 GPa, covering the spin transition between 40 and 45 GPa.\n[1] Sahle et al.

The use of reference images over a longer baseline and/or different spectral windows is currently limited by the unknown nature of PSF stability across time and wavelength. We present the results of ongoing work to create a reference PSF library using campaign data from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES). This library is designed to construct more correlated reference images over a longer baseline and bandwidth and also to better characterize stability of the GPI PSF. Our work has direct application to improve PSF subtraction algorithms for the GPIES campaign but is more generally applicable to any current or future high contrast imaging survey instrument, such as WFIRST or a second generation ELT planet finder, where this technique will advance our capabilities of directly imaging habitable planets.",

            "abstract": "Spatial scales of the earthquake cycle, from rapid deformation associated with earthquake rupture to slow deformation associated with interseismic and transient slow-slip behavior, span from fractions of a meter to thousands of kilometers (plate boundaries). Similarly, temporal scales range from seconds during an earthquake rupture to thousands of years of strain accumulation between earthquakes. The complexity of the multiple physical processes operating over this vast range of scales and the limited coverage of observations leads most scientists to focus on a narrow space-time window to isolate just one or a few process. We discuss here preliminary results on the vertical crustal deformation associated with both slow and rapid crustal deformation along a profile across the forearc region of the central Mexican subduction zone on the Guerrero sector, where the Cocos plate underthrusts the North American plate. This sector of the subduction zone is characterized by a particular slab geometry (with zones of rapid bending-unbending of the slab), irregular distributed seismicity, exceptionally large slow slip events (SSE) and non-volcanic tremors (NVT). We used the river network and geomorphic features of the Papagayo River to assess Quaternary crustal deformation. The Papagayo drainage network is strongly controlled by Late Cenozoic tectonic, Holocene and recent earthquake cycle processes. This is particularly true for the southern section of the drainage basin; from the dam in La Venta to the river mouth, where W-E structures commonly offset the course of the main river. River terraces occur along the course of the river at different elevations. We measured the height of a series of terraces and obtained OSL ages on quartz extracts to determine long-term rates of deformation. Finally, we discuss associations of the topography and river characteristics with the Cocos slab geometry, slow earthquakes, crustal deformation, and interseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "Increased weathering resulting from the uplift of the Himalayan Mountains has been cited as one cause (among others) of late Cenozoic cooling. Orogenic uplift generally results in the development of high relief and enhanced erosion, which in turn induces rapid chemical weathering and uptake of atmospheric CO2. Tracing these processes can be accomplished using techniques such as the budget of major element and/or Sr isotopes of the dissolved load. However, in the Himalaya, Sr isotopic compositions are extreme even in carbonate phases, making it difficult to produce realistic estimates of silicate and carbonate inputs to Himalayan rivers. In this study, we explore the potential of the 40K-40Ca system to quantify the relative contributions of silicate and carbonate weathering to river dissolved loads. To this end, we analysed a suite of 40 rivers draining the main litho-tectonic units of the Himalaya, sediments, bedrock, mineral separates and soil and gravel. Our results show that Himalayan carbonates exhibit no radiogenic 40Ca excess despite highly variable 87Sr/86Sr signatures (0.73-0.85). The silicate fraction of bedload sediments is variably radiogenic (+1 to +4), with ε40Ca correlating with the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Analyses of plagioclase, biotite and muscovite separates from a HHC gneiss and greywacke show homogeneous ε40Ca despite highly variable K/Ca ratios, indicating recent metamorphic equilibration on a mineral scale. Thus, incongruent weathering of high K/Ca minerals should not represent a significant factor when considering the transfer of radiogenic calcium to the dissolved load. The ε40Ca signatures of dissolved river material are significantly influenced by silicate lithologies, and range from +0.1 in carbonate dominated catchments to >+2 ε-units in rivers draining predominantly silicate catchments. The silicate contributions estimated from our 40Ca results are in line with major element budgets when considering small catchments but largely exceeds these estimates for the major tributaries. This could indicate the presence of a yet unidentified source of radiogenic 40Ca, or major element budgets that generally overestimate the carbonate contribution to Himalayan rivers.",

            "abstract": "The Solomon Islands-Vanuatu composite subduction zone represents a tectonically complex region along the Pacific-Australia plate boundary in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Here the Australia plate subducts under the Pacific plate in two segments: the South Solomon Trench and the Vanuatu Trench. The two subducting sections are offset by a 200 km long, transform fault – the San Cristobal Trough (SCT) – which acts as a Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) fault.\nThe subducting segments have experienced much more frequent and larger seismic events than the STEP fault. The northern Vanuatu trench hosted a M8.0 earthquake in 2013. In 2014, at the juncture of the western terminus of the SCT and the southern South Solomon Trench, two earthquakes (M7.4 and M7.6) occurred with disparate mechanisms (dominantly thrust and strike-slip respectively), which we interpret to indicate the tearing of the Australia plate as its northern section subducts and southern section translates along the SCT. During the 2013-2014 timeframe, little seismic activity occurred along the STEP fault. However, in May 2015, three M6.8-6.9 strike-slip events occurred in rapid succession as the STEP fault ruptured east to west.\nThese recent events share similarities with a 1993 strike-slip STEP sequence on the SCT. Analysis of the 1993 and 2015 STEP earthquake sequences provides constraints on the plate boundary geometry of this major transform fault. Preliminary research suggests that plate motion along the STEP fault is partitioned between larger east-west oriented strike-slip events and smaller north-south thrust earthquakes. Additionally, the differences in seismic activity between the subducting slabs and the STEP fault can provide insights into how stress is transferred along the plate boundary and the mechanisms by which that stress is released.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of intermediate depth seismicity in intracontinental settings is rare, but it has been postulated with various degrees of certainty in several regions. One such region is the Middle Atlas of Morocco. In the last twenty years, more than a dozen intermediate depth earthquakes were reported in this region by Spain’s National Geographic Institute (IGN). The apparent deep nature of these events is hard to reconcile with well-established geophysical evidence of a thin lithosphere under the Middle Atlas. We relocate 4 events with IGN-reported depths greater than 80 km that were recorded by a relatively dense temporary deployment; using a recent regional 3D velocity model obtained through teleseismic body and surface wave tomography. The relocation procedure uses a grid-search approach to minimize the mean normalized misfit, where each travel-time misfit is normalized by the estimated pick uncertainty. We find that our observed arrivals are much better fit by shallow (<5 km) depths than the reported depths of >80 km. We propose that these shallow foci earthquakes are the result of regional crustal deformation of this region caused by the present convergence between the African and Eurasian Plates. This study is an example of how local earthquake locations can be significantly improved by using a well-constrained 3-D velocity model and a dense local seismic array.",

The hydrocarbon production from its low-porosity, nano-darcy permeability and interbedded chalk-marl reservoir intervals is very challenging. The post-diagenetic processes have altered the mineralogy and pore structure of its sourcing and producing rock units. A rock typing analysis in this play can help understand the reservoir heterogeneity significantly. In this study, a petrophysical rock typing workflow is presented for the Niobrara Formation by integrating experimental rock properties with geologic lithofacies classification, well log data and core study.\nVarious Niobrara lithofacies are classified by evaluating geologic depositional history, sequence stratigraphy, mineralogy, pore structure, organic content, core texture, acoustic properties, and well log data. The experimental rock measurements are conducted on the core samples recovered from a vertical well from the Wattenberg Field of the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Selected lithofacies are used to identify distinct petrofacies through the empirical analysis of the experimental data-set. The grouped petrofacies are observed to have unique mineralogical properties, pore characteristics, and organic contents and are labelled as discrete Niobrara rock types in the study area.\nMicro-textural image analysis (FESEM) is performed to qualitatively examine the pore size distribution, pore types and mineral composition in the matrix to confirm the classified rock units. The principal component analysis and the cluster analysis are carried out to establish the certainty of the selected rock types. Finally, the net-to-pay thicknesses of these rock units are compared with the cumulative production data from the field to further validate the chosen rock types.\nFor unconventional shale plays, the rock typing information can be used to locate hydrocarbon sweetspots, facilitate the placement of the horizontal section of the wells along the sweetspots, and can augment engineers' abilities on suitable well placement considerations. It can also help enhancing the effectiveness of the hydraulic fracture stimulation and completion operation.",

We have carried out measurements along Varanasi to Kanpur (NH-2), Varanasi to Durgapur (NH-2), Varanasi to Singrauli (SH-5A) and Varanasi to Ghazipur (NH-29). We have found high concentration of BC along highways, the average BC mass concentrations vary in the range 20 – 40 µg/m3 and found high BC mass concentrations up to 600 µg/m3. Along the highways high BC concentrations were characteristics of the presence of industrial area, power plants, brick kilns and slow or standing vehicles.

            "abstract": "Deep-sea hydrothermal plumes occur when hot fluids from hydrothermal vents replete with chemically reduced elements and compounds like sulfide, methane, hydrogen, ammonia, iron and manganese mix with cold, oxic seawater. Chemosynthetic microbes use these reduced chemicals to power primary production and are pervasive throughout the deep sea, even at sites far removed from hydrothermal vents.\nAlthough neutrally-buoyant hydrothermal plumes have been well-studied, rising hydrothermal plumes have received little attention even though they represent an important interface in the deep-sea where microbial metabolism and particle formation processes control the transformation of important elements and impact global biogeochemical cycles.\nIn this study, we used genome-resolved metagenomic analyses and thermodynamic-bioenergetic modeling to study the microbial ecology of rising hydrothermal plumes at five different hydrothermal vents spanning a range of geochemical gradients at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) in the Western Pacific Ocean. Our analyses show that differences in the geochemistry of hydrothermal vents do not manifest in microbial diversity and community composition, both of which display only minor variance across ELSC hydrothermal plumes. Microbial metabolism is dominated by oxidation of reduced sulfur species and supports a diversity of bacteria, archaea and viruses that provide intriguing insights into metabolic plasticity and virus-mediated horizontal gene transfer in the microbial community. The manifestation of sulfur oxidation genes in hydrogen and methane oxidizing organisms hints at metabolic opportunism in deep-sea microbes that would enable them to respond to varying redox conditions in hydrothermal plumes. Finally, we infer that the abundance, diversity and metabolic versatility of microbes associated with sulfur oxidation impart functional redundancy that could allow it to persist in the dynamic settings of hydrothermal plumes.",

In this study, during the harvest season, were determined PM10, PM2.5, ions, heavy metals and PAHs concentrations in the air of 8 different regions of Costa Rica. The sampling methodology included 47 events with 3 sampling sites per each; these sites covered different climate regions of the country. PM10 and PM2.5 were collected using Hi-vol samplers with quartz-fiber filters using a thermal pre-preprocess for organics. PM10 ranged from 25 to 390 µg/m3, PM2.5 from 25 to 354 µg/m3; the minimum results were obtained at the sixth region and the maximum ones at the second one, both located in the North Pacific. As a reference, in the metropolitan area of Costa Rica the PM10 usually have had annual means behind 30 µg/m3. The most abundant ions found in PM10 were chloride, nitrate and sulfate. Meanwhile, the ranges of Fe, Cr, Cu, and Pb were 0,03 – 6,80 µg/m3, 10,6 – 358,0 ng/m3, 11,8 – 361,4 ng/m3 and 0,67 – 479,50 ng/m3, respectively. The PAH most abundant were the naphthalene and the acenaphthylene. The mean total concentration of PAHs in PM10 was 7,9 ng/m3 with a standard deviation of 3,3 between regions. According to the PM10 medians, the regions with more pollution levels were the 3 and 4, while the regions 4 and 5 were the least contaminated. On the other hand, the atmospheric contaminants’ concentration was significantly higher in the diurnal burnings than the nocturnal ones. The sampling sites were directly affected by the emission of the sugar-cane burning.",

            "abstract": "Isparta Angle (IA) constitutes a triangular shape elevated tectonic domain in SW Turkey which contains units stacked with opposing thrust vergences during Late Cretaceous to Miocene. The region which is located at the junction between Aegean and Cyprus arcs separated by a slab tear is now bounded by Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone (FBFZ) in the west and Akşehir-Afyon Fault Zones (AAFZ) in the east. In the area, seismicity displays ongoing extension along active grabens oriented at different directions. In the past, many competing geodynamic scenarios had been proposed to explain the complex tectonic evolution of the area. In this study, we used both P and S receiver functions (RFs) to present high resolution crustal and upper mantle images down to 200 km. Moho and upper crustal discontinuities were well resolved by P Rfs; however S RFs were utilized to image lithospheric-asthenospheric boundaries having the benefit of being free of multiple conversions. RFs were calculated from 916 teleseismic earthquakes (Mw ≥ 5.5) recorded by 42 permanent and temporary broadband stations BU-KOERI/NEMC, DEMP/ERD and Isparta Angle Seismic Experiment deployed by collaboration of BU-KOERI and University of Missouri. Totally, 4501 P and 946 S RFs with the cut-off frequencies of ~1.0 Hz and ~0.5 Hz, respectively, were obtained by applying iterative-time domain deconvolution. Crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios were calculated by grid search of maximum amplitude of P RFs(Ps,PpPs and PsPs+PpSs) in depth and Vp/Vs domain. Then, we created 2-D P and S migrated cross-sections to observe crustal and lithospheric-asthenospheric discontinuities beneath the region. P RFs indicates that, average crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio is ~36 km and 1.78 in the region with small changing values close to the edges. Migrated P RFs cross-sections revealed a sharp change in Moho (Moho offset) on the western boundary that spatially correlates with the FBFZ. We also found a relatively flat Moho in the center and what appears to be imaged northern tip of slab at ~45 km depth. Finally, ~30km crustal thickness released in southeast beneath the Cyprus. On the other hand; preliminary results of S RFs cross-sections present the LAB boundary between ~60 to ~90 km depth range, observed almost beneath all profiles and clear positive phase arrivals right below the LAB depths.",

When biochars are incorporated in the soil they act as carbon sinks and improve plant health by supporting microbial communities, improving soil tilth, and improving water holding capacity.

Biochar quality can be varied with feedstocks and processing conditions. Biochar processes and formulations are emerging that can replace or enhance more expensive materials like peat and activated carbon.

            "abstract": "The 29 May 2012 Kingfisher supercell was sampled during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment. The storm was within range of the 3-D Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (OK LMA) and the Oklahoma City Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler (WSR-88D), KTLX for its entire lifetime, but the behavior of lightning during a period late in its lifetime in which it merged with a left moving supercell storm has not been studied previously. The merger occurred toward the end of its lifetime and produced maximum flash rates of almost 500 flashes min-1. The storm decayed rapidly following the merger. This study will focus on the electrical characteristics of the storm in the last 1.5 hours of its life: before, during, and following the merger process. Reflectivity and radial velocity data from KTLX will be used to support the discussion of lightning characteristics. Initial results show that cloud-to-ground (CG) flash rates increased markedly during the merger and increased even more following the merger. Additionally, the vertical distribution of very high frequency (VHF) source densities from lightning flashes were maintained while total flash rates decreased. The interactions of charge regions and lightning flashes between the two merging supercells will be the primary focus of this study, as well as how those interactions affected the evolution of the rates and average spatial extent of flashes and the evolution of the spatial distribution of flash initiations and CG lightning.",

The formation and degradation processes of organic nitrates affect the dynamics of reactive nitrogen and ground-level ozone. To better understand the fate of these organic nitrates, the isomer 4-nitrooxy-2-methyl-2-buten-1-al (4,1-nitrooxyaldehyde) was synthesized for photochemical reaction chamber experiments. The rate constants for reaction of this species with O3 and OH, as well as its photolysis rate were determined. A chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) with I(H2O)n- as the reagent ion was used to monitor the loss of isoprene nitrooxyaldehyde and formation of its oxidation products. Possible reaction pathways are discussed based on the CIMS measurements.",

In the meantime the combination of L1 resources (ACE,WIND,SOHO) and STEREO-A at 1 AU, and Mars Express and MAVEN missions at ~1.5 AU, provide opportunities. Comparative conditions at the Earth orbit and Mars orbit locations are of special interest because they are separated by the region where most solar wind stream interaction regions develop. These alter the propagation of disturbances including the interplanetary CME-driven shocks that make the space radiation affecting future Human mission planning.

            "abstract": "The World Gravity Map satellite gravity data were used to investigate the lithospheric structure beneath the Cenozoic-age Malawi Rift which forms the southern extension of the Western Branch of the East African Rift System. An analysis of the data using two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum methods indicates the two distinctive discontinuities at depths of 31‒44 km and 64‒124 km as defined by the two steepest slopes of the power spectrum curves. The shallower discontinuity corresponds to the crust-mantle boundary (Moho) and compares well with Moho depth determined from passive seismic studies. To understand the source of the deeper discontinuity, we applied the 2D power spectrum analysis to other rift segments of the Western Branch as well as regions with stable continental lithospheres where the lithospheric structure is well constrained through passive seismic studies. We found that the deeper discontinuity corresponds to a mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD), which is known to exist globally at depths between 60‒150 km and as determined by passive seismic studies. Our results show that beneath the Malawi Rift, there is no pattern of N-S elongated crustal thinning following the surface expression of the Malawi Rift. With the exception of a north-central region of crustal thinning (< 35 km), most of the southern part of the rift is underlain by thick crust (~40‒44 km). Different from the Moho, the MLD is shallower beneath the axis of the Malawi Rift forming a N-S trending zone with depths of 64‒80 km, showing a broad and gentle topography. We interpret the MLD as representing a sharp density contrast resulting from metasomatized lithosphere due to lateral migration along mobile belts of hot mantle melt or fluids from a distant plume and not from an ascending asthenosphere. These fluids weaken the lithosphere enhancing rift nucleation. The availability of satellite gravity worldwide makes gravity a promising technique for determining the MLD globally.",

            "abstract": "The surface and basal roughness of glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves can pose a significant obstacle to the visual interpretation and quantitative analysis of radar sounding data. Areas of high surface roughness – including grounding zones, shear margins, and crevasse fields – can produce clutter and side-lobe signals that obscure the interpretation of englacial and subglacial features. These areas can also introduce significant variation in bed echo strength profiles as a result of losses from two-way propagation through rough ice surfaces. Similarly, reflections from rough basal interfaces beneath ice sheets and ice shelves can also result in large, spatially variable losses in bed echo power. If unmitigated and uncorrected, these effects can degrade or prevent the definitive interpretation of material and geometric properties at the base of ice sheets and ice shelves using radar reflectivity and bed echo character. However, these effects also provide geophysical signatures of surface and basal interface character – including surface roughness, firn density, subglacial bedform geometry, ice shelf basal roughness, marine-ice/brine detection, and crevasse geometry – that can be observed and constrained by exploiting roughness effects in radar sounding data. We present a series of applications and approaches for characterizing and correcting surface and basal roughness effects for airborne radar sounding data collected in Antarctica. We also present challenges, insights, and opportunities for extending these techniques to the orbital radar sounding of Europa’s ice shell.",

Geographical variations in the magnitude of this intensification are clearly evident in the simulations, but most previous efforts to understand the factors responsible for the changes in extreme precipitation have focused on zonal averages, neglecting the variations that occur in different regions at the same latitude. Here we present climate-model simulations for an ocean-covered earth having simple idealized continents with north-south mountain barriers in its northern midlatitudes. We show that the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to increases in the global mean surface temperature is 3 %/K lower over the mountains than over the oceans and the plains. Fundamental factors responsible for changes in precipitation intensity may be divided between thermodynamic effects, arising through changes in temperature and moisture, and dynamical effects, produced by changes in the ascent rates of saturated air parcels. The difference in sensitivity among these regions is not due to thermodynamic effects, but rather to differences between the gravity-wave dynamics governing vertical velocities over the mountains and the cyclone dynamics governing vertical motions over the oceans and plains.",

            "abstract": "On 30 April 2015 the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft completed its mission of slightly more than 4 years of operations in orbit around the planet Mercury. To meet mission thermal constraints, MESSENGER’s orbit around Mercury was eccentric, with a periapsis located at high northern latitudes. During its primary mission, the periapsis altitude was maintained between 200 and 500 km. For more than two years thereafter, the periapsis altitude was left to evolve naturally, reaching a maximum of 450 km in March 2013, after which it started to decrease. In MESSENGER’s second extended mission, altitudes as low as 15–25 km above the surface of Mercury were achieved.\nRadio tracking data acquired by the Deep Space Network (DSN) at the X-band frequency have been used to determine models of the gravity field of Mercury. The resolution of these global models, expressed in spherical harmonics, increased as data at lower altitudes became available. However, because of MESSENGER’s eccentric orbit, the data cover only the northern hemisphere, and coverage is less dense toward the equator. Local solutions, which use basis functions that do not have global support, are especially suitable to handle such uneven data coverage.\nHere, we present gravity field solutions based on gravity anomalies arranged on a grid with a resolution of 1 degree by 1 degree. We use line-of-sight derivatives of Doppler data, which are obtained by numerical differentiation of the time series of DSN tracking data. Our local solution covers the northern hemisphere from 10° N to 88° N. Our solution shows increased correlations with topography in areas with low-altitude data coverage. We also compare our local solution to global models of similar resolution.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind variations and magnetospheric processes result in a dynamic electron population within the outer Van Allen radiation belt, where electron energies range from several 10’s to several 1000’s KeV . Geomagnetic storms and various solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes including convection cause both dramatic particle flux increase or decreases. Here we analyze the occurrence of a drop out of ~ 0.04 – 4.5 MeV electron fluxes measured by NASA's Van Allen Probes, THEMIS and NOAA’s GOES during a magnetic cloud-driven geomagnetic storm which started at September 12, 2014. The ~3-day storm left a steady low flux of outer belt energetic electrons that lasted for twelve days (Figure 1). At higher energy levels, electron fluxes decreased by ~1 order of magnitude throughout the vast region from L* ~3 to 6.6. Simulation of a 2 MeV relativistic electron orbit, with 90◦ pitch angle, during the most compressed magnetosphere period shows that magnetopause shadowing can be responsible for the electron dropout observed at radial distances larger than ~ 6 RE). Wave-particle interaction are associated with loss occurring at L < 4. We discuss the solar wind drivers, in particular the contribution of the magnetic cloud parameters for magnetospheric dynamics during the whole period analyzed, i.e., September 13-24, 2014.",

            "abstract": "The Data Life Cycle is an important general concept for thinking about data collection, management, and preservation practices across the geophysical scientific data community. The cycle generally spans the scientific process from ideation, through experimental design, observation collection, data analysis and visualization, publication, archive, distributions and eventual reuse. During the cycle, the data may change through new analyses, presentations, and responsible parties, but, historically, the format and organization of the data have generally remained the same. Data collected as a time series at a point remains as a time series and data collected/calculated as grids remains as grids. BIP is BIP and BSQ is BSQ. In fact, in many large data centers, the native format remains sacrosanct and, in the scientific community, reformatting is avoided because of fear of losing information or introducing data quality problems and irreproducible results.\nThis traditional approach has worked well in areas where data are collected and used for a single purpose throughout the life cycle and domains where comparisons across different data sets are rare and problematic due to conflicting data organizational structures or incomplete documentation. This is not the world we live in today. Reuse for unexpected purposes and data (and model) comparisons are becoming increasingly common (e.g. climate model / observation comparisons). Data sets are preserved for future global investigators that may be unaware of the original project or purpose of the data. Also, it is becoming more common for data to be restructured and reformatted for particular problem or to support a flexible web service. Unfortunately, many of these efforts do not preserve the metadata that, hopefully, accompanies the data in the original format.\nIn this presentation we will discuss alternative approaches to data management that will facilitate data reuse across teams and disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Southern Patagonia is a key region for paleoclimatic reconstructions in the Southern Hemisphere as it is the only landmass located in the Southern Hemisphere westerly wind (SHW) belt. Within the framework of the ICDP drilling campaign PASADO (\"Potrok Aike Maar Lake Sediment Archive Drilling Project\"), a high resolution sediment record was recovered from Laguna Potrok Aike (LPTA, 51°58´S, 70°23´W).\nIn order to identify the sources of organic matter contributions to the sedimentary archive, we investigated long-chain n-alkanes as tracers for terrestrial and aquatic plants. We analysed n-alkane distributions and their compound-specific hydrogen (δD) and stable carbon (δ13C) isotopic composition in various sample types such as soils, dust, aquatic and terrestrial plants and lake surface sediments. Based on two different model approaches, one using the n-alkane distributions and the other the compound-specific isotope values, we traced the origin of mid- (n-C23) and long- (n-C29) chain n-alkanes into modern lake sediments. Both models yield similar results: around 70% of the n-C23 originates from aquatic plants and more than 80% of the n-C29 is delivered from dust and terrestrial plants to the sediment. These results provide the basis for a robust paleo-environmental reconstruction of the lipid biomarker isotope records from LPTA.\nCompound-specific δD and δ13C records for the last 55,000 years from the PASADO core are interpreted in the framework of these findings. Here, δD of the n-C23 alkane serves as proxy for lake water isotopic changes driven by the precipitation-evaporation balance, moisture sources and water column stratification. In contrast, we interpret changes in δD of the n-C29 alkane to reflect dust source area changes and therefore, the intensity of the SHW. A 50‰ shift in the δD record of the n-C23 alkane between 10.000 to 8.000 years age indicates a major hydrological change affecting the lake level while isotopic changes in the n-C29 alkane were minor.",

            "abstract": "Manizales is a mid-mountain Andean city located near the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in west-central Colombia, this location exposes it to earthquakes, floods, landslides and volcanic eruptions. It is located in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and presents a climate with a bimodal rainfall regime (Cortés, 2010). Its mean annual rainfall is 2000 mm, one may observe precipitation 70% of the days over a year. This rain which favors the formation of large masses of clouds and the presence of macroclimatic phenomenon as “El Niño South Oscillation”, has historically caused great impacts in the region (Vélez et al, 2012). For example the geographical location coupled with rain events results in a high risk of landslides in the city.\nManizales has a hydrometeorological network of 40 stations that measure and transmit data of up to eight climate variables. Some of these stations keep 10 years of historical data. However, until now this information has not been used for space-time classification of precipitation events, nor has the meteorological variables that influence them been thoroughly researched.\nThe purpose of this study was to classify historical events of rain in an urban area of Manizales and investigate patterns of atmospheric behavior that influence or trigger such events. Classification of events was performed by calculating the “n” index of the heavy rainfall, describing the behavior of precipitation as a function of time throughout the event (Monjo, 2009). The analysis of meteorological variables was performed using statistical quantification over variable time periods before each event.\nThe proposed classification allowed for an analysis of the evolution of rainfall events. Specially, it helped to look for the influence of different meteorological variables triggering rainfall events in hazardous areas as the city of Manizales.",

            "abstract": "Calcite is one of the most common minerals on the earth’s surface and controls the chemical composition of ground and surface waters. Its reactivity in water is intimately related to the surface complexation reactions occurring in the electrical double layer (EDL) around the grains. The properties of the EDL cannot be directly measured, but they can be estimated using the zeta potential, which is the electrical potential at the shear plane between the grains and the surrounding water. The zeta potential of calcite is usually deduced from streaming potential experiments, but in dilute water (ionic strength < 0.1 mol L-1) and inertial laminar flow, the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski (HS) equation may considerably underestimate the intrinsic zeta potential because of surface conductivity and Reynolds effects. A triple layer model (TLM) is used to calculate the electrical potential and ions distribution at the calcite/water interface and the apparent zeta potential deduced from the HS equation is corrected for the surface conductivity of the Stern and diffuse layer and the Reynolds number. The corrected zeta potential corresponds to the electrical potential at the beginning of the diffuse layer computed by our TLM, confirming our calculations of intrinsic zeta potentials of larger magnitudes than apparent zeta potentials. This model is also used to predict the low frequency complex conductivity of carbonates.",

            "abstract": "Cave stalagmite records show strong evidence of abrupt changes in summer monsoons during Heinrich events, but we lack rigorous constraints on the amount of wetting or drying occurring in monsoon regions. Studies on shoreline deposits of closed-basin lakes can establish quantitative bounds on water balance changes through mapping-based estimates of lake volume variations.\nWe present new dating constraints on lake level variations in Agua Caliente I and Laguna Loyoques, two closed-basin, high-altitude paleolakes on the Altiplano-Puna plateau of the Central Andes (23.1°S, 67.4°W, 4250 masl). Because this area receives >70% of its total annual precipitation during austral summer, the region is ideally suited to capture a pure response to changes in the South American summer monsoon (SASM). The plateau is home to several small (<40 km2) lakes surrounded by well-preserved paleoshorelines that indicate past wetter conditions. Agua Caliente I is unique, having multiple shorelines encrusted with biologically-mediated calcium carbonate \"tufa\" deposits. Initial U-Th dating of these massive shoreline tufas reveals that these deposits are dateable to within ±50 to 300 years due to high U concentrations and low initial Th content (as indicated by high 230Th/232Th).\nOur U-Th dates show that Agua Caliente I was greater in lake surface area during two periods: 17.5-14.5 kyrs BP, coincident with Heinrich Event 1 (HE1), and 24-23 kyrs BP, roughly coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At these times, Agua Caliente I also overflowed into a neighboring lake basin (Loyoques) through an 8-km long southeast-trending stream channel. Thus, during HE1 and the LGM, the lake was ~9 times larger in surface area relative to modern.\nHydrologic modeling constrained by paleotemperature estimates is used to provide bounds for these past precipitation changes. We also tentatively explore physical mechanisms linking Heinrich events and the regional hydroclimate by comparing freshwater hosing experiments and transient climate simulations. Our results in Agua Caliente I and Laguna Loyoques act as a proof of concept, and lend us confidence in expanding our U-Th work to other shoreline tufas in the surrounding region to produce a more detailed, spatiotemporal record of water balance changes in South America.",

The JPSS-1 (J1) spacecraft is scheduled to launch in January 2017. VIIRS instrument was designed to provide measurements of the globe twice daily. It is a cross-track scanning radiometer using a rotating telescope with spatial resolutions of 375 and 750 m at nadir for its imaging and moderate bands, respectively. It has 22 spectral bands covering wavelengths from 0.412 to 12.01 µm, including 14 reflective solar bands (RSB), 7 thermal emissive bands (TEB), and 1 day-night band (DNB). VIIRS observations are used to generate 22 environmental data products (EDRs), enabling a wide range of applications. This paper describes J1 VIIRS pre-launch testing program, instrument calibration and characterization strategies, and its projected performance based on independent analyses made by the NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team (VCST). It also discusses the effort made the joint government team to produce sensor at-launch baseline performance parameters and the metrics needed to populate the Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) needed for the sensor data records (SDR) production. Sensor performance to be illustrated in this paper include signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), dynamic range, spatial and spectral performance, response versus scan-angle (RVS), and polarization sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Surface slip on the 15-km-long 2014 Napa rupture occurred mostly as afterslip on its southern 8-9 km, but mostly coseismically on its northern section, with maximum coseismic slip reaching 0.4-0.5 m. Urban post-earthquake recovery demands rapid and realistic answers to: How much more afterslip can occur? How long will it last? About 69% of all surface slip was postseismic. Cumulative slip approaches 0.3-0.5 m in the middle of the rupture, estimated with program AFTER (Boatwright et al., 1989). At 1-yr post-earthquake, slip should be 96-99% complete on the southern section. However, 0.8 km north of the coseismic maximum (site NLOD), slip is ≤92% complete. Model estimates of total fault displacement (Uf) improved in the weeks following the earthquake. By 3 weeks, uncertainties were ≤±5 cm; by 3 months, 3 sites had stable Uf values and ≤±1 cm uncertainties, except site NLOD, where at 9 months its formal Uf-uncertainty was ±2 cm, but the model is uncertain. To estimate the impact of afterslip following a large future earthquake expected on the Hayward fault in the densely populated San Francisco East Bay, we are analyzing how rapidly we can resolve final displacement (Uf) from other records, e.g., the M6.0, 2004 Parkfield earthquake. Napa uncertainties resolve faster than Parkfield’s by a few months. Although 1-yr solutions are shown to be accurate for the central Parkfield rupture, at the rupture tips, afterslip rates, and thus Uf estimates, increased considerably in later years. Unstable Uf values at NLOD resemble behavior at the Parkfield rupture tips. Unlike Napa, Parkfield afterslip was only ~74% complete after 1 year,~91% after 6 years, and ultimately taking 8-11 yr to reach interseismic creep rates. The Napa and Parkfield afterslip behaviors represent end members, locked-versus-creeping fault sections. Though we might expect the creeping Hayward Fault to behave more like Parkfield, its much larger expected magnitude (M6.8) could make an important difference.",

            "abstract": "Tree-ring reconstructions of streamflow are uncommon in the eastern US compared to the western US. While the eastern US does not experience severe drought on the scale of the west, multi-year droughts have stressed the water management systems throughout the east. Here, we reconstruct three rivers serving population centers in the northeast (Beaver Kill River serving New York City, NY), mid-Atlantic (Potomac River serving Washington, D.C.), and southeast (Flint River serving Atlanta, GA) to demonstrate the ability to reconstruct in the eastern US. Then, we conducted an interbasin comparison to identify periods of common variability and examined synoptic scale drivers of drought and pluvial events. Finally, we discuss the utility of multi-species reconstructions in the moist, biodiverse eastern US. Our calibration models explained 66 – 68% of the variance in the instrumental record and passed verification tests in all basins to 1675 CE. Drought and pluvial events showed some synchrony across all basins but the mid-Atlantic acted as a hinge, sometimes behaving more like the northeast, and other times like the southeast. Weak correlations with oceanic-atmospheric oscillations made identification of synoptic scale drivers difficult. However, there appears to be a relationship between the position of the western ridge of the North Atlantic Subtropical High and streamflow across the basins of the east. Given the many factors influencing tree growth in closed canopy systems, we have shown that careful standardization of individual tree-ring series, nested regression models, and the use of multiple species can produce robust proxies in the east.",

            "abstract": "Within the context of a globally changing climate, efficient management of freshwater resource management is becoming an increasingly critical issue. As an indicator of vegetation health and soil moisture status, remotely sensed estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) estimation can provide valuable information about water usage in managed landscapes. The two source energy balance (TSEB) model has been widely applied to quantify field scale ET over agricultural systems using thermal infrared remote sensing data. However, limitations on the spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite data combined with the effects of cloud contamination constrain the amount of detail that a single satellite can provide. Fusing multi-satellite data with varying spatial and temporal resolutions can give a more continuous estimation of daily ET at field scale. In this study, we used the regional TSEB modeling system (Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse; ALEXI) to map ET at 4-km resolution over the continental U.S. using imagery from geostationary satellites. These 4-km regional estimates were disaggregated to 1-km (daily timesteps) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) input data and down to 30-m with Landsat data 8 scenes during the growing season) using the disaggregation scheme DisALEXI, applied over a managed pine plantation in North Carolina, USA. The MODIS and Landsat ET retrievals were then combined using the Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to estimate daily ET estimates at 30-m resolution. The modeled daily ET was in good agreement compared with observations at two Ameriflux eddy covariance flux tower sites (US-NC2, mid-rotation site and US-NC3, recently clear cut site). Seasonal water use patterns varied significantly with stand age, with higher rates of ET from mid-rotation stands in comparison with younger stands. Water use also varies with land cover types, with higher rates of ET from forested areas than from agricultural fields. The results demonstrate the capability of using ALEXI/DisALEXI with multi-satellite data to estimate stand-scale water usage associated various land cover types and stand ages, which can provide useful information for water resource management in forested landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Hydrochemical and isotopic composition of hydrothermal fluids discharged from 3 different volcanic areas of São Miguel has been analysed to create a conceptual model for the evolution of a geothermal system in a basaltic ocean island with still pronounced volcanic activities. Besides the fluids, associated solid-phase precipitates and local volcanic rocks were collected for geochemical investigations. Thermal discharges were divided into springs (up to 75 °C) and boiling pools. Major classification based on dominant dissolved ions divided fluids in Na-SO4, Na-HCO3 and Na-Cl types. Temperatures estimated from water hydrochemistry (e.g. Na-K, Na-K-Ca cationic geothermometers) let us assume that the in-situ solutions with discharging temperatures exceeding 32°C were close to thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to local rocks. The aqueous solutions have their origin in meteoric water with a δ18O(H2O) value of -3 ±1 ‰ (V-SMOW) and a δD(H2O) value of -13 ±7 ‰ (V-SMOW). Only the δ18O and δD values of Ferraria reveal mixing of meteoric with sea water. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is chemically evolved by the uptake of volcanic carbon with δ13C(DIC) = -5 ±3 ‰ (V-PDB). The isotopic composition of sulphate with δ34S(SO4) = 0.4 ± 0.3‰ (V-CDT) is close to typical igneous rock values. The extent of basaltic rock leaching depends on the availability of volcanic CO2 and on temperature. The molar Mg/Ca ratio (0.8) of all thermal discharges reflects leaching of the local basalt. In Furnas, at higher temperatures, the concentrations of dissolved Si(OH)4, K+ and Sr2+ increased due to intensive leaching of basaltic rocks, whereas in contrast Al3+ and ΣFe decreased due to the precipitation of e.g. alunite. Annual supply of dissolved CO2 in Furnas springs was calculated to be about 61 t. In Fogo the Na-SO4 type dominated and at higher altitude in particular CO2 rich (up to 23 mmol L-1) water at T ≈ 20 °C occurs. It is further suggested that the isotope signature and hydrochemistry of the fluids can be used to estimate the distance to the magma sources and as a general indicator of volcanic activity.",

These have an angular resolution of about 0.5º and differential photometric stability of about 1% per map throughout this time. When individual bright stars are removed from the maps and an empirical sidereal background subtracted, the residue is dominated by the zodiacal light. This sky coverage enables the formation of an empirical zodiacal-light model for observations at 1 AU which summarizes the SMEI data. When this is subtracted, analysis of the ensemble of residual sky maps sets upper limits of typically 1% for potential secular change of the zodiacal light for each of nine chosen ecliptic sky locations. An overall long-term photometric stability of 0.25% is certified by analysis of three stable sidereal objects. Averaging the nine ecliptic results together yields a 1-σ upper limit of 0.3% for zodiacal light change over this 8.5 year period.",

What that means depends, in no small measure, on your understanding of—and relationship—to the ecosystems as evidenced by the currencies in which you measure ecosystem change. Thus, an ecologist will tend to focus on the impacts on energy flow and organizational complexity; conservationists on ecosystem services and biodiversity; and subsistence hunters on food security and cultural identity. Policy makers (a poorly defined group) will attempt to integrate all of the above within the very real limits of their fluency with each currency.\nThe situation is further complicated by unavoidable ambiguities; abiotic and biotic influences can be difficult to distinguish, scale impacts ecosystem response unevenly, and ecosystems are useful concepts but not amenable to precise boundaries. As the risks of climate change become more evident, the cost of ambiguities and disparate currencies increases. It is imperative that scientists, conservationists, subsistence hunters, and policy makers appreciate and overcome their different ways of understanding environmental change.\n ",

            "abstract": "Fluidic models are used to replicate and improve understanding of fluid flow in rocks. In this study, a shale-mimicking fluidic model is developed by characterizing a shale sample, converting that information into a 2D representation, excising this pattern into a substrate while preserving its nano-scale features, and sealing the etched pore structure without altering nano-scale components. Imaging, helium pycnometry, nitrogen sorption, mercury injection, and total organic carbon (TOC) measurements are collected on a Bakken shale sample. Using Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) Scanning Electron Microscopy, a 3D image of the sample is collected with a voxel size of 2.44 nm² by 5 nm. Pore volume and organic content are calculated using image segmentation and confirmed via helium pycnometry, mercury injection, and TOC measures. Pore and throat sizes used in the model result from 3D image analysis and pore size distributions calculated from sorption data. These findings are used to create a quasi 2D representation of the sample with interconnected pore space. To create a nanofluidic chip, one consideration is the smallest size that can be etched onto a substrate. This depends on etching technique, equipment capabilities, user experience, and substrate itself. To that end, channels were etched using FIB under various settings onto substrates. For Pyrex, the smallest feature created was about 50 nm; however, characterization revealed porosity features as small as 5 nm. We are exploring the use of e-beam lithography techniques to create more scalar representations. Successful bonding is as a major challenge. We have had success bonding Pyrex to Pyrex using a combination of pressure and temperature to create microfluidic chips – chips with smallest features of a few micrometers. The main concern is that pressure and temperature treatment will likely result in significant degradation of smaller pattern features in nanofluidic chips.",

MTB utilize magnetosomes through magnetotaxis, the alignment and movement along magnetic field lines to navigate towards preferred environmental conditions. MTB are sensitive to different environments and are thought to exhibit varying magnetosome morphologies, compositions, sizes, and quantities in regards to the environments which they inhabit. These characteristics allow MTB and magnetofossils (preserved magnetosomes) to be used as modern/paleoenvironmental recorders and biomarkers for environmental change(s). Devil’s Bathtub (Mendon Ponds Park, Honeoye Falls, NY) is a meromictic glacial kettle pond surrounded by deciduous tree cover. Here we examine one species of MTB based on prominence of this particular morphology at this locale. Magnetotaxis and morphology of this species have been observed using light microscopy. Micrographs have also been taken using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to verify cell morphology and to determine magnetosome morphology. TEM and magnetic hysteresis measurements were done to find and test the composition of magnetosomes. In this study we also focus on DNA sequencing and characterization of this MTB, as there are few MTB species which have been DNA sequenced successfully. Data from these experiments are directly applicable to this up-and-coming area of research as it will aid in the understanding and correlation of magnetosome and magnetofossils with environmental characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation influences the atmosphere in complex and non-linear ways. Large-scale changes in vegetation can drive changes in climate on both local and global scales. Interactions between the land and atmosphere are controlled by shifts between terms controlling the surface energy budget. Depending on the magnitude and location of land surface changes, imbalances in energy at large spatial scales can be introduced which shift atmospheric circulation on a global scale. Various studies have explored the impacts of large area changes in vegetation, but how the climate response scales with the area of vegetation change has not been demonstrated. Here, we systematically evaluate the response of climate to linearly increasing the area of forest cover over the northern mid-latitudes. We show that global circulation changes the atmospheric cross-equatorial energy transport in a linear fashion with respect to the area of afforestation (a relationship which has not previously been demonstrated). We also identify how vegetation-induced changes in cloud cover further feedback on changes in the global energy balance - a concept that has been largely ignored in most large-scale vegetation manipulation experiments. The changes in atmospheric energy transport induced by vegetation changes result in remote shifts in precipitation; the relationship between the change in energy transport and the shift in tropical precipitation is shown to be model dependent. Our results highlight the importance of considering both local and remote effects of large-scale vegetation change, and explore how the effects of vegetation change on climate scale with the area of land surface changed. We demonstrate how vegetation changes can modify the surface energy budget both directly and through impacts on cloud cover through land-atmosphere interactions.",

            "abstract": "Detailed source and flash detection efficiencies for Lightning Mapping Arrays (LMA) are needed for observational and climatological work with the data. Simulations of the LMAs active during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry campaign (DC3) were performed with a new Monte Carlo interactive tool. As with previous simulations, it propagated emissions from a given source point, added Gaussian observed timing errors to the retrieval times at each station and used a least squared algorithm to find the best solution for the source. This simulation added the ability to account for variable receiver thresholds to restrict the stations contributing to the solution based on received power, which allowed a better examination of the overall impacts of site selection. The average errors were then calculated as has been done previously but with the addition of the probability of detection for a given source location. Based on a 17 month climatology of flashes over the West Texas Lightning Mapping Array (WTLMA), the distribution of flashes by number of sources was used to relate the source detection efficiency from the simulation to the most likely flash detection efficiency.\nAs observed in previous theoretical and observational studies, the average errors in azimuth, range and especially altitude of the source point solutions increased with increasing distance from the center of the network, with the standard deviations of these errors highly dependent on the station configuration and noise thresholds. The source and therefore flash detection efficiency also decreased with range as expected, but its centroid was offset from the center of the WTLMA when variable, observed receiver thresholds were used instead of uniform thresholds across the network. With the observed WTLMA thresholds, 95% of flashes could be detected to approximately 150 km from the center of the network, where average altitude errors were less than 0.4 km but the standard deviation of those errors approached 3 km. This resulted in a more realistic view of LMA network performance than a simulation without consideration of actual receiver thresholds.",

            "abstract": "Among variables relevant to river form and discharge that can be observed from space, river width is perhaps the simplest to measure. Width can be extracted directly from optical or radar imagery, and application of remotely sensed widths to problems in hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and ecology dates back more than two decades. Despite this long heritage, until very recently remotely sensed width measurements have largely been made on an ad-hoc basis for individual studies over relatively small regions. Global studies that required river widths have largely relied on estimates from downstream hydraulic geometry relationships with basin area, which inevitably simplify width variability and may, in practice, underestimate the fraction of wide rivers and the total river surface area in many basins.\nOver the last two years, multiple new regional- and global-scale, satellite-derived river width datasets have been developed that have substantially improved our global understanding of river form. These datasets include the Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR), which provides width measurements for rivers wider than ~180 m, and all rivers wider than ~300 m, based on the SRTM water mask and the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL), which provides measurements for rivers as narrow as 30 m and all rivers wider than ~100 m. Several regional-scale datasets have also been developed. These datasets will facilitate improvements to regional and global scale hydrodynamic models, will provide more robust information on global river surface area for gas flux studies, and constitute novel information on global patterns of fluvial geomorphology. These datasets represent the beginning, not the end, of global river width measurements, however, as in the future multitemporal width measurements can be combined with recently developed algorithms to estimate river discharge for many rivers, globally.",

Here we present results from our effort to quantify the atmospheric transport contribution to the uncertainty in the optimized fluxes of the NASA JPL CMS-Flux global 4 x 5-degree GOSAT XCO2 satellite inversion for CO2 in 2010. We embed the PSU WRF-Chem mesoscale model, at 30 km resolution in the North American domain, in the CMS-Flux posterior solution (with tracers incorporating the optimized biosphere fluxes, prior fluxes for other components of the carbon cycle, and boundary conditions), creating a coupled WRF-CMS modeling system. Using alternative WRF model physics and perturbations to the meteorological driver data, we create an ensemble of WRF-Chem forward simulations. The ensemble WRF outputs, together with the global model solution, provide a rich data set which can be analyzed for meteorological bias (with WMO atmospheric soundings), for XCO2 bias (with simulated ACOS GOSAT XCO2), and CO2 profile bias (with NOAA aircraft profile and in situ observations). Meteorological impacts on CO2 fields at pressure levels in the atmosphere used in XCO2 averaging kernels will also be shown. This analysis framework is transferable to other atmospheric tracers and space-based sensors, such as global atmospheric inversions using OCO-2 XCO2.

            "abstract": "Post-earthquake, field-based assessments of surface displacement commonly underestimate offsets observed with remote sensing techniques (e.g., InSAR, image cross-correlation) because they fail to capture the total deformation field. Modern earthquakes are readily characterized by comparing pre- and post-event remote sensing data, but historical earthquakes often lack pre-event data. To overcome this challenge, we use historical aerial photographs to derive pre-event digital surface models (DSMs), which we compare to modern, post-event DSMs. Our case study focuses on resolving on- and off-fault deformation along the Lost River fault that accompanied the 1983 M6.9 Borah Peak, Idaho, normal-faulting earthquake. We use 343 aerial images from 1952-1966 and vertical control points selected from National Geodetic Survey benchmarks measured prior to 1983 to construct a pre-event point cloud (average ~ 0.25 pts/m2) and corresponding DSM. The post-event point cloud (average ~ 1 pt/m2) and corresponding DSM are derived from WorldView 1 and 2 scenes processed with NASA’s Ames Stereo Pipeline. The point clouds and DSMs are coregistered using vertical control points, an iterative closest point algorithm, and a DSM coregistration algorithm. Preliminary results of differencing the coregistered DSMs reveal a signal spanning the surface rupture that is consistent with tectonic displacement. Ongoing work is focused on quantifying the significance of this signal and error analysis. We expect this technique to yield a more complete understanding of on- and off-fault deformation patterns associated with the Borah Peak earthquake along the Lost River fault and to help improve assessments of surface deformation for other historical ruptures.",

To date, the thermal winds have been dismissed as a mechanism to explain these differences. However, these studies have relied on a simplified form of the thermal wind equation that assumes purely geostrophic flow and small Rossby numbers that are not applicable to Neptune.

In nuclear explosion seismology, the practice of discriminating Earthquake and explosions using regional wave spectra and spectral ratios relies on a fundamental assumption that Earthquakes and explosions excite various regional waves in a systematically-different manner. We have been carrying out a systematic study to retrieve source time functions (STFs) from seismic sources using the empirical Green’s function (EGF) approach. In phase 1 of the study, we focus on retrieving STFs from moderate earthquakes in east and central Asia using regional Lg, Pg, Lg coda, and Sn and Pn waves to see whether or not the shape of the STFs varies with the wave type. We explored various methods to reduce the noise in the deconvolved STFs which tend to be higher for the relatively weaker Pg, Sn, Pn and coda waves. For example, an array-stacking method is used to enhance source pulses and reduce the level of side-lobes. Preliminary results suggest that Lg and Lg coda STFs may be similar, as generally believed. Pg STF is less similar to Lg STF. For example, when a stacked Lg STF is clearly asymmetric with a sharp-rise time, the stack Pg STF seems to be fairly symmetric. In general, our confidence on this kind of dissimilarity is still limited by the non-diminishing deconvolution noise in the retrieved Pg STFs, and by the small number of events studied. We are trying to further reduce the deconvolution noise for each regional wave, and find and analyze more moderate events. We will present newly-retrieved STFs from each of the various regional waves and coda, and compare the pulse widths and shapes of the STFs from different waves. We will also present estimates of source-radiated energy and apparent stresses using the estimated Lg STFs without using various simplified source models and Q corrections.",

Nutrient-limited boreal bogs are long-term sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), but sources of methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas. We fertilized Mer Bleue Bog, a Sphagnum moss and evergreen shrub-dominated ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Ontario, for 10-15 years with N as NO3 and NH4 at 5, 10 and 20 times ambient N deposition (0.6-0.8 g N m-2 y-1), with and without phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Treatments were applied to triplicate plots (3 x 3 m) from May – August 2000-2015 and control plots received distilled water. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration, and CH4 flux with climate-controlled chambers; leaf-level CO2 exchange and biochemistry; substrate-induced respiration, CH4 production and consumption potentials with laboratory incubations; plant species composition and abundance; and microclimate (peat temperature, moisture, light interception). After 15 years, we have found that NEE has decreased, and CH4 emissions have increased, in the highest nutrient treatments owing to changes in vegetation, microtopography, and peat characteristics. Vegetation changes include a loss of Sphagnum moss and introduction of new deciduous species. Simulated atmospheric N deposition has not benefitted the photosynthetic apparatus of the dominant evergreen shrubs, but resulted in higher foliar respiration, contributing to a weaker ecosystem CO2 sink. Loss of moss has led to wetter near-surface substrate, higher rates of decomposition and CH4 emission, and a shift in microbial communities. Thus, elevated atmospheric deposition of nutrients may endanger C storage in peatlands through a complex suite of feedbacks and interactions among vegetation, microclimate, and microbial communities.",

This analysis allows us to determine the impact of climatic changes from 1981 to 2011 on soil carbon (C) sequestration. We use observed global monthly global Climatic Research Unit (CRU) weather data from 1900 to 2011 (0.5° x 0.5° spatial scale) to calculate annual changes in the climatic decomposition index (CDI), an analog for soil decay rates. The CRU data was also used to calculate annual changes in precipitation, mean annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration (AET) rates at the 0.5° x 0.5° spatial scale. Annual changes in plant production (NPP) at the global scale were calculated using global satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets. At the global scale CDI showed little change from 1900 to 1980 but increased by 4% from 1980 to 2011. CDI increased by more than 10% in tundra and boreal forest systems from 1980 to 2011 (< 4% for all other biomes). Changes in CDI are well correlated to changes in AET rates (r2 > 0.8) with a 2 to 4% increase in AET for most biomes (no change for dry grassland and desert biomes). NPP increased by > 6% for tundra, boreal forest and temperate forest from 1980 to 2011 with latitudinal average changes in NPP and CDI following similar patterns (greatest increases in the +40° to +75° latitudes). Global patterns in NPP are well correlated to AET and CDI (r2 > 0.8) but have different patterns (linear for AET and curvilinear for CDI). Latitudinal averaged ratio of NPP:CDI is correlated to Harmonized World Soil Database soil C levels (r = 0.67). Statistically significant trends (1980–2011) in NPP:CDI suggest increases in soil C for the boreal forest and temperate dry grassland and decreases in soil C for humid tropical forests (no trends for other biomes) from 1980 to 2010. Statistical analysis of the observed increases in NPP and CDI for the northern latitudes is most correlated to observed increases in air temperature.",

After 5 years of research (culminating in 2015) under the USGS Alaska Science Center’s Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative, we found strong relationships between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and nutrient abundance (N g/m2) and availability (%N) in halophytic graminoid habitat. The relationships between NDVI and nutrient abundance and availability were strong whether using NDVI derived from high (spectrometer), moderate (WorldView-2 satellite) or low (eMODIS satellite) resolution data. Correlations established and validated at one location were used to predict nutrient abundance using NDVI readings from other locations, allowing interpretation of satellite derived NDVI in terms of nutrient abundance across broad areas of mapped salt marsh habitat. Further, NDVI seasonal timelines were used to predict the timing of peak nutrient availability using the period of most rapid increase in NDVI value. Currently, we are using WorldView-2 imagery to create vegetation maps of the central Arctic coastal zone (~20 km inland) of Alaska, covering approximately 1000 km of coastline, with a focus on identifying all salt marshes. Such maps will enable monitoring programs and allow for modeling to predict spatial and temporal changes in halophytic graminoid habitat and the nutrients available to geese in the early stages of life.",

We use a 3-D trajectory model to initialize a dense grid of particles throughout the troposphere and stratosphere each day, advect them forward in time, and identify those crossing the tropopause to compute STE. Exchanged particles are separated into four categories for analysis to identify the significance of known transport mechanisms in each reanalysis: 1) vertical stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT), 2) vertical troposphere-to-stratosphere transport (TST), 3) lateral STT (that occurring between tropics and extratropics and across the tropopause “break”), and 4) lateral TST.

            "abstract": "The seasonal precipitation pattern of the Central American region is marked by a temporary reduction of precipitation during the typical May-October rainy season, often termed the mid-summer drought. A mid-summer drought (MSD) has been defined as a period of significant decrease in precipitation over a time period greater than one month. Different characteristics of the MSD, including the start date, duration, and intensity, have implications for regional ecosystems, crop production, and the livelihood of farmers in the region. The characteristics and driving mechanisms of the MSD have been investigated for many years, and recently an objective algorithm for the presence and intensity (or strength) of the MSD was developed based on monthly precipitation data. The current work develops an objective algorithm for MSD intensity and duration based on daily precipitation from a data set of gridded observations. The algorithm is then applied to future daily precipitation projections for the Central American region, produced by statistically downscaling climate model output produced as part of the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. This allows a representation of the projected changes in MSD at a finer temporal scale, and may help in shaping adaptation measures promoted to cope with these changes.",

            "abstract": "Approximately half of the Cerrado has been deforested in Brazil’s drive to develop export-oriented mechanized agriculture. We focus our analysis on Brazil’s newest–and potentially final–agricultural frontier, Mapitoba. Using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, we map land-use change within Mapitoba between 2003 and 2013 with 87% accuracy. During our study period, row-crop agriculture more than doubled, expanding from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha. We use MODIS evapotranspiration (ET) data and quantify the impacts of agricultural conversion on ET in Mapitoba. Monthly ET was, on average, 26 mm mo-1 higher over areas of natural vegetation for all months except January, February, and March. These 26 mm mo-1 equate to a 22% (April) to 77% (September) difference in ET rates depending on the month. In January and February, ET occurs at similar (~100%) or slightly higher (~107%) rates over row-crop agriculture than natural vegetation. ET is negatively correlated with single-cropped agricultural area for August through December and April through July across all years. Single-cropped area is positively correlated with ET in February across all years, and January and March across most years. Double-cropping is positively correlated with ET across all years during January, April, and May, and a majority of the study period during February, March, and June. The change in dry season (June-August) ET is linearly related (R2 = 0.81) to the cumulative amount of land converted to row-crop agriculture. For every new 1000 ha of row-crops, 1.7 million m3 less water is recycled back to the atmosphere. If row-crop were to expand onto the 8.2 million ha of remnant Cerrado suitable for agriculture in Mapitoba, we estimate an additional reduction of 14 km3 of water each year during these 3 months alone. Land-use-change-induced climate feedbacks may extend the dry season and threaten both the health of the natural vegeation and sustainabiltity of continued agricultural production.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) may change due to external climate forcing and internal climate variability. Some recent studies have shown considerable changes in terrestrial ET since the early 1980s, but the causes of these changes are unclear. In this study, the relative contributions of the external forcing and the internal climate variability to the recent ET changes since 1982 are examined. Three datasets of global terrestrial ET (estimated from satellite observations and land-model simulations) and the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean ET are analyzed, respectively, for the actual and externally forced ET changes, while the unforced ET variations are estimated as the actual ET minus the forced component. Large discrepancies and uncertainties of the ET, in terms of its trend, variability, and the temperature- and precipitation-dependence, are found among the three datasets. Results show that the global-mean forced ET exhibits an upward trend of 0.08 mm day-1 century-1 for the period from 1982-2010, which results primarily from rising evaporative demands in response to warmer temperatures and secondarily from increased precipitation that are caused by increasing anthropogenic emissions including greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols. The forced ET also contains considerable multi-year to decadal variations during the latter half of the 20th century that are caused mainly by volcanic aerosol forcings. For the unforced ET, the global-mean trend during 1982-2010 ranges from -0.07 to 0.06 mm day-1 century-1 with varying spatial patterns among the three datasets. Furthermore, linkages between the unforced ET and internal climate modes are examined. The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is found to be correlated with the global ET, but significance of the correlation varies among the three datasets. The results suggest that there are large uncertainties in our current estimates of global terrestrial ET for the recent decades, and the GHGs and aerosol external forcings seem to account for a large part of the apparent trend and variations in the recent terrestrial ET, although the impact of the IPO and other internal climate variability are also significant.",

Here we present laboratory and ambient measurements of gaseous organic compounds by means of a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (HR-ToF-CIMS) using nitrate ion (NO3-) chemistry, which recently has proven capable of selectively detecting oxidized organic molecules in the gas-phase via clustering with NO3- and its high order clusters. Such low and extremely low volatility organic compounds (LVOC, ELVOC) have an important role in particulate phase chemistry and formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).\nThe HR-ToF-CIMS was deployed during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) at the forest site in Centreville, AL (June 1 - July 15, 2013), where emissions were dominated by biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), occasionally mixing with anthropogenic emissions. During SOAS, the HR-ToF-CIMS detected oxidation products of both isoprene (typically C5 LVOC) and terpenes (typically C10 ELVOC). The isoprene-related LVOC showed a diurnal cycle with a day time peak, while two groups of terpene ELVOC were identified, one peaking at night and one peaking during the day. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analyses are applied to the dataset to further interpret these observations. The effect of anthropogenic pollution on the biogenic-dominated environment was also investigated during periods of elevated nitrous and sulfur dioxide levels. To further aid in interpretation of the SOAS dataset, oxidized organic molecules were produced via OH and O3 initiated oxidation of biogenic gas-phase precursors in targeted laboratory studies and detected using the HR-ToF-CIMS. Spectra were obtained in these studies over a range of simulated atmospheric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones show significant along-strike variations of different subduction features. In particular there is a good correlation between variations of overriding plate thickness and variations of slab dip, seismic anisotropy and subduction velocity. Previous numerical models have shown that overriding plate thermal state influences the slab dip and variations in slab dip can cause trench-parallel flow above the slab. This suggests a causal link between overriding plate structure, slab geometry and mantle flow in subduction zones. Models also show that interplate coupling is stronger for colder overriding plates, which might lead to lower subduction velocities.\nWe implement generic numerical models to study the effect of the overriding plate structure on the evolution of slab geometry, induced mantle flow and subduction velocity. We solve the 3D, time dependent thermo-mechanical equations with a non-linear rheology to simulate buoyancy driven subduction processes. We find that along-strike variations in thermal thickness of the overriding plate cause increased hydrodynamic suction and shallower slab dip beneath the colder portion of the overriding plate; the variation in slab geometry drives strong trench-parallel flow beneath the slab and a complex flow pattern above the slab. Induced mantle flow varies significantly with time, suggesting that the global variability in seismic anisotropy observations in subduction zones is in part due to the non-steady-state behavior of these systems. This new mechanism for driving trench-parallel flow provides a good explanation for seismic anisotropy observations from the Middle and South America subduction zones. Our results also show that increased interplate coupling beneath a colder portion of the overriding plate leads to a reduction of the subduction velocity in the region, leading to along-strike variations subduction velocity. These results provide a good explanation of the observed present-day variations in subduction velocity in Middle and South America, as well as the Phillipine Sea Plate. Therefore, in addition to mechanisms such as variations in subduction plate age or slab length in the upper mantle, the possible role of overriding plate structure should be taken into account in interpreting mechanisms for variation subduction velocity.",

Improvements in atmospheric HOx and NOx budgets, and therefore daytime HONO constraints, are necessary to improve air quality control strategies in adversely affected regions. In this presentation HONO measurements made using multiple collocated instruments during the UBWOS 2013 and 2014 field studies will be discussed. These results suggest that our ability to measure HONO is heavily dependent on our understanding of sampling artifacts, measurement interferences, and background determinations. We also present mid-latitude tropospheric observations of HO2NO2, as high as 1.5 ppbv, that coincide with the observed maxima in daytime HONO. These coinciding observations of both HONO and HO2NO2 will be presented with a particular emphasis on potential vertical gradients, surface chemistry, and daytime budgets. Results of this work may be relevant to interpretation of HONO observations in a range of environments from clean arctic to relatively polluted urban summertime regions. Measurements of HONO from the Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emission, and Reactivity (WINTER) project in 2015 will be shown for comparison.",

JPSS J1 VIIRS Day Night Band (DNB) has anomalous non-linear response at high scan angles based on prelaunch testing. The flight project has proposed multiple mitigation options through onboard aggregation, and the Option 21 has been suggested by the VIIRS SDR team as the baseline aggregation mode. VIIRS GEOlocation (GEO) code analysis results show that J1 DNB GEO product cannot be generated correctly without the software update. The modified code will support both Op21, Op21/26 and is backward compatible with SNPP. J1 GEO code change version 0 delivery package is under development for the current change request.

            "abstract": "As the climate changes, altered disturbance-recovery dynamics in forests worldwide are likely to result in significant biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks to the climate system. Climate shapes forest disturbance events including tree mortality and fire, with consequent climate feedbacks. For instance, in forests globally, drought increases tree mortality rates, having a stronger impact on larger trees and resulting in greater feedbacks to climate change than would occur if drought sensitivities were equal across tree size classes. Forest regeneration and associated biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks are also shaped by climate: across the tropics the rate of biomass accumulation is faster in everwet than in seasonally dry climates, and in the Klamath region (N California / S Oregon), post-fire vegetation dynamics and microclimate are shaped by aridity. Forest recovery dynamics will be affected by elevated CO2 and climate change; for instance, models predict that forest regeneration rate, successional dynamics, and climate feedbacks will all be altered under elevated CO2. In combination, climatic impacts on disturbance and recovery can result in dramatic shifts in forest cover on the landscape level. For instance, in fire-prone forested landscapes, forest cover decreases with increasing frequency of high-severity fire and decreasing forest recovery rate, both of which could be altered by climate change, producing rapid loss of forest on the landscape level. Such effects may be amplified by the existence of alternative stable states, which can cause systems to experience non-reversible changes in cover type. Critical transitions in landscape-level forest cover would have significant biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks. Thus, altered disturbance-recovery dynamics under a changing climate may have sudden and dramatic impacts on forest-climate interactions.",

            "abstract": "The orbital properties, compositions, and physical properties of the diverse populations of small outer solar system bodies provide a forensic map of how our solar system formed and evolved. Perhaps the most potentially diagnostic, but least explored, of those populations are the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, which orbit at ~5 AU in the L4 and L5 Lagrange points of Jupiter. More than 6200 Jupiter Trojans are presently known, but these are predicted to be only a small fraction of the 500,000 to 1 million Trojans >1 km in size. The Trojans are hypothesized to be either former Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) that were scattered into the inner solar system by early giant planet migration and then trapped in the 1:1 Jupiter mean motion resonance, or bodies formed near 5 AU in a much more quiescent early solar system, and then trapped at L4 and L5.\nThe 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey identified important questions about the origin and evolution of the solar system that can be addressed by studying of the Trojan asteroids, including: (a) How did the giant planets and their satellite systems accrete, and is there evidence that they migrated to new orbital positions? (b) What is the relationship between large and small KBOs? Is the small population derived by impact disruption of the large one? (c) What kinds of surface evolution, radiation chemistry, and surface-atmosphere interactions occur on distant icy primitive bodies? And (d) What are the sources of asteroid groups (Trojans and Centaurs) that remain to be explored by spacecraft?\nThe Trojan Tour and Rendezvous (TTR) is a New Frontiers-class mission designed to answer these questions, and to test hypotheses for early giant planet migration and solar system evolution. Via close flybys of a large number of these objects,, and orbital characterization of at least one large Trojan, TTR will enable the first-time exploration of this population. Our primary mission goals are to characterize the overall surface geology, geochemistry and mineralogy of these worlds; to characterize their internal structure and dynamical properties; to investigate the nature, sources and history of activity on these bodies; and to explore the diversity of the broader Trojan asteroid population.",

            "abstract": "International concern for the environmental impact of jet engine exhaust emissions in the atmosphere has led to increased attention on gas turbine engine emission testing. The Society of Automotive Engineers Aircraft Exhaust Emissions Measurement Committee (E-31) has published an Aerospace Information Report (AIR) 6241 detailing the sampling system for the measurement of non-volatile particulate matter from aircraft engines, and is developing an Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) for methodology and system specification. The Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) Center for Excellence for Aerospace Particulate Emissions Reduction Research has led numerous jet engine exhaust sampling campaigns to characterize emissions at different locations in the expanding exhaust plume.\nParticle loss, due to various mechanisms, occurs in the sampling train that transports the exhaust sample from the engine exit plane to the measurement instruments. To account for the losses, both the size dependent penetration functions and the size distribution of the emitted particles need to be known. However in the proposed ARP, particle number and mass are measured, but size is not. Here we present a methodology to generate number and mass correction factors for line loss, without using direct size measurement. A lognormal size distribution is used to represent the exhaust aerosol at the engine exit plane and is defined by the measured number and mass at the downstream end of the sample train. The performance of this line loss correction is compared to corrections based on direct size measurements using data taken by MST during numerous engine test campaigns. The experimental uncertainty in these correction factors is estimated. Average differences between the line loss correction method and size based corrections are found to be on the order of 10% for number and 2.5% for mass.",

            "abstract": "Climate disruption is changing the behavior of extreme hydroclimatic events. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in certain areas have been observed and are projected to accelerate through the 21st century, which affect hydrologic extremes. In addition, increased temperatures have effects on whether precipitation falls as rain or snow, as well as the rate of snow melt. These all have the potential to change the peak flood levels that produce large losses to society every year. This provides the motivation for this study, in which changes in flood frequency and intensity are explored. Focusing on 421 gauge stations across the western United States for 30-year time periods: 1971-2000, 2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2099, flood levels are calculated using the standard flood frequency analysis method outlined in Bulletin 17B by the United States Interagency Committee on Water Data. Daily flow data was obtained, which had been produced by a hydrologic model forced with statistically downscaled climate projections produced by GCM runs from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Annual peak flow data is examined to determine the percent change in flow values at difference recurrence intervals and by inverting the process, the future recurrence intervals of historic flood levels are determined. We assess the ability to generalize the results, based on spatial coherence of the changes. Results indicate that floods with a historical recurrence interval of 100 years will be expected to occur more frequently by the end of the 21st century at 94% of the gauge sites.",

Models indicate that carbon-rich planets, composed largely of SiC and C, may be abundant around carbon rich stars (Kuchner and Seager 2005, Moriarty et al 2014). In order to understand the structure and evolution of such an unfamiliar planet, the basic thermodynamic phase relations of the major materials present must first be constrained. Using the laser heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC) in combination with Raman analysis and X-Ray diffraction, this study investigates the high pressure and temperature phase diagram of SiC. Microprobe and diffraction data indicate that SiC decomposes at high P-T and that the change follows a negative Clapeyron slope. This has interesting implications for the interior “mantle” structure and dynamics of a SiC-based planet.",

            "abstract": "Extreme events are proven to be affected by climate change, influencing hydrologic simulations for which stationarity is usually a main assumption. Studies have discussed that this assumption would lead to large bias in model estimations and higher flood hazard consequently. Getting inspired by the importance of non-stationarity, we determined how the exceedance probabilities have changed over time in Johnson Creek River, Oregon. This could help estimate the probability of failure of a structure that was primarily designed to resist less likely floods according to common practice. Therefore, we built a climate informed Bayesian hierarchical model and non-stationarity was considered in modeling framework. Principle component analysis shows that North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Western Pacific Index (WPI) and Eastern Asia (EA) are mostly affecting stream flow in this river. We modeled flood extremes using peaks over threshold (POT) method rather than conventional annual maximum flood (AMF) mainly because it is possible to base the model on more information. We used available threshold selection methods to select a suitable threshold for the study area. Accounting for non-stationarity, model parameters vary through time with climate indices. We developed a couple of model scenarios and chose one which could best explain the variation in data based on performance measures. We also estimated return periods under non-stationarity condition. Results show that ignoring stationarity could increase the flood hazard up to four times which could increase the probability of an in-stream structure being overtopped.",

            "abstract": "Forests yield high-quality water supplies to communities throughout the world, in part because forest cover reduces flooding and the consequent transport of suspended and dissolved constituents to surface water. Disturbance by wildfire reduces or eliminates forest cover, leaving watersheds susceptible to increased surface runoff during storms and reduced ability to retain contaminants. We assessed water-quality response to hydrologic events for three years after a wildfire in the Fourmile Creek Watershed, near Boulder, Colorado, and found that hydrologic and geochemical responses downstream of a burned area were primarily driven by small, brief convective storms that had relatively high, but not unusual, rainfall intensity. Total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, and manganese concentrations were 10-156 times higher downstream of a burned area compared to upstream, and water quality was sufficiently impaired to pose water-treatment concerns. The response in both concentration and yield of water-quality constituents differed depending on source availability and dominant watershed processes controlling the constituent. For example, while all constituent concentrations were highest during storm events, annual sediment yields downstream of the burned area were controlled by storm events and subsequent mobilization, whereas dissolved organic carbon yields were more dependent on spring runoff from upstream areas. The watershed response was affected by a legacy of historical disturbance: the watershed had been recovering from extensive disturbance by mining, railroad and road development, logging, and fires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and we observed extensive erosion of mine waste in response to these summer storms. Therefore, both storm characteristics and historical disturbance in a burned watershed must be considered when evaluating the role of wildfire on water quality.",

            "abstract": "Availability of no-cost satellite images helped in development and utilization of remotely sensed images for water use estimation. Remotely sensed images are increasingly used for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) at different temporal and spatial scales. However, selecting any particular model from a plethora of energy balance models for estimating ET is challenging as each different model has its strengths and limitations. We compared four commonly used ET models, namely, Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model, Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model, Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model using Landsat images for estimating ET in the Midwest United States. We validated our model results using three AmeriFlux cropland sites at Mead, Nebraska. Our results showed that the METRIC and the SSEBop model worked very well at these sites with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1 mm/day and an R2 of 0.96 (N=24). The mean bias error (MBE) was less than 10% for both the METRIC and the SSEBop models. In contrast, the SEBAL and the SEBS models have relatively higher RMSE (> 1.7 mm/day) and MBE (> 27%). However, all four models captured the spatial and temporal variation of ET reasonably well (R2 > 0.80). We found that the model simplification of the SSEBop for operational capability was not at the expense of model accuracy. Since the SSEBop model is relatively less data intensive and independent of user/automatic selection of anchor (hot/dry and cold/wet) pixels, it is more user friendly and operationally efficient. The SSEBop model can be reliably used for estimating water use using Landsat and MODIS images at daily, weekly, monthly, or annual time scale even in data scarce regions for sustainable use of limited water resources.",

This has allowed for a nearly constant awareness of the quality of the incoming data and the general health of the instrumentation around the time of data capture. Modern quality assurance systems are evolving to provide ready access to a large variety of metrics, a rich and self-correcting history of measurements, and more importantly the ability to access these quality measurements en-masse through a programmatic interface.\nThe MUSTANG project at the IRIS Data Management Center is working to achieve ‘total archival data quality’, where a large number of standardized metrics, some computationally expensive, are generated and stored for all data from decades past to the near present. To perform this on a 300 TB archive of compressed time series requires considerable resources in network I/O, disk storage, and CPU capacity to achieve scalability, not to mention the technical expertise to develop and maintain it. In addition, staff scientists are necessary to develop the system metrics and employ them to produce comprehensive and timely data quality reports to assist seismic network operators in maintaining their instrumentation. All of these metrics must be available to the scientist 24/7.\nWe will present an overview of the MUSTANG architecture including the development of its standardized metrics code in R. We will show examples of the metrics values that we make publicly available to scientists and educators and show how we are sharing the algorithms used. We will also discuss the development of a capability that will enable scientific researchers to specify data quality constraints on their requests for data, providing only the data that is best suited to their area of study.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 80 years, 8 MW>6.7 strike-slip earthquakes west of 40º longitude have ruptured the North Anatolian fault (NAF), largely from east to west. The series began with the 1939 Erzincan earthquake in eastern Turkey, and the most recent 1999 MW=7.4 Izmit earthquake extended the pattern of ruptures into the Sea of Marmara in western Turkey. The mean time between seismic events in this westward progression is 8.5±11 years (67% confidence interval), much greater than the timescale of seismic wave propagation (seconds to minutes). The delayed triggering of these earthquakes may be explained by the propagation of earthquake-generated diffusive viscoelastic fronts within the upper mantle that slowly increase the Coulomb failure stress change (CFS) at adjacent hypocenters. Here we develop three-dimensional stress transfer models with an elastic upper crust coupled to a viscoelastic Burgers rheology mantle. Both the Maxwell (ηM=1018.6-19.0 Pa∙s) and Kelvin (ηK=1018.0-19.0 Pa∙s) viscosities are constrained by viscoelastic block models that simultaneously explain geodetic observations of deformation before and after the 1999 Izmit earthquake. We combine this geodetically constrained rheological model with the observed sequence of large earthquakes since 1939 to calculate the time-evolution of CFS changes along the North Anatolian Fault due to viscoelastic stress transfer. Critical values of mean CFS at which the earthquakes in the eight decade sequence occur between -0.007 to 2.946 MPa and may exceed the magnitude of static CFS values by as much as 180%. The variability of four orders of magnitude in critical triggering stress may reflect along strike variations in NAF strength. Based on the median and mean of these critical stress values, we infer that the NAF strand in the northern Marmara Sea near Istanbul, which previously ruptured in 1509, may reach a critical stress level between 2015 and 2032.",

            "abstract": "Stable carbon isotope data (i.e., δ13C) from soils and herbivore tissue are commonly used as a proxy for the relative abundance of C4 and C3 plants at a site. These data are also increasingly used to represent other climatologically relevant properties of vegetated environments, such as productivity, aridity, water use efficiency, and tree cover. The δ13C values of soils and herbivore tissues are generally assumed to resemble their source vegetation, after accounting for diverse fractionation processes during litter decomposition and tissue metabolism and turnover. However, δ13C values have rarely been compared to source vegetation at a regional to continental scale. As a result, the quality of δ13C as a proxy has not been thoroughly evaluated, and the importance of modifying factors have not been assessed at biogeographically relevant scales. To address some of these issues, we combined three multi-source datasets from North America: herbaceous C4 plant abundances from thousands of vegetation plots, hundreds of soil δ13C measurements, and hundreds of bison collagen, hair, and enamel δ13C data (tissues with different turnover rates). These datasets were resampled to common grid for comparison. A stronger relationship with C4 vegetation existed for bison as compared to soil δ13C. To determine which factors might explain deviations in the vegetation plot and isotopic data, we used statistical models to quantify the influence of soil variables, mean annual precipitation and temperature, tree cover, presence of invasives, and fire frequency in conjunction with plot-based C4 abundance data. Our bison model was only improved by the addition of invasives. In contrast, our soil model was significantly improved when accounting for tree cover (C3 vegetation and shade), precipitation, various soil parameters, and invasive grasses, suggesting that soils are more likely to be biased from source vegetation in ways that could influence interpretation as a proxy at broad scales.",

            "abstract": "Bentonite is a naturally occurring clay-rich sediment containing montmorillonite, a smectitic clay mineral that has a high cation exchange capacity and swells upon contact with water. Owing to these characteristics, highly compacted bentonite (HCB) is an often included component of engineered barrier systems (EBS) designed to protect used fuel containers (UFCs) in deep geological repositories (DGR) for high-level nuclear waste. The low water activity and high swelling pressure of HCB suppresses microbial activity and the related production of sulphide that could cause microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of UFCs\nThe Canadian Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) has chosen a UFC that consists of an inner steel core and outer copper coating which is resistant to corrosion. However, under anaerobic conditions, MIC can still contribute to UFC corrosion if sulphides are present in the groundwater. Therefore the EBS consisting of bentonite blocks and pellets has been designed to impede the movement of sulphides to the UFC. In order to examine the effectiveness of the EBS, a 3D numerical model was developed capable of simulating the diffusive transport of sulphide within the NWMO EBS. The model was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics, a finite element software package and is parametric which allows the impact of different repository layouts to be assessed. The developed model was of the entire NWMO placement room, as well as, a stand-alone UFC and included conservative assumptions such as a fully saturated system and a constant concentration boundary condition. The results showed that the highest sulphide flux occurred at the semi-spherical end caps of the UFC. Further studies examined the effect of sulphide hotspots and fractures, representing possible EBS failure mechanisms. The model results highlight that even with conservative assumptions the chosen EBS will effectively protect the UFC from microbiologically influenced corrosion.",

            "abstract": "In the last 50ky, Dominica Island (Lesser Antilles Arc) has experienced three major pumiceous ignimbritic eruptions: Layou (~50ka), Roseau (~30ka), and Rosalie (~20ka). These eruptions emitted magma volumes one order of magnitude larger (tens of km3 DRE/eruption) than those of the neighboring islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe (<1 km3/eruption). Reservoir processes and pre-eruptive magma dynamics of these eruptions are still poorly constrained.\nOur study focuses on the basal Plinian fallout deposit of these three eruptions. We studied the crystal assemblage and performed a detailed analysis of chemical zoning patterns, textures and composition variations on orthopyroxene crystals (12-16% total crystal content). A system analysis approach is conducted to unravel crystals’ remobilization processes in the reservoir before eruption. Timescales of these processes have been calculated performing Fe2+-Mg interdiffusion modelling on selected orthopyroxenes by intercalibration of high resolution BSE images with EPMA analyses.\nResults suggest the existence of a main magmatic environment, containing approximately 80-85% of the total orthopyroxene amount. The remnant 15-20% orthopyroxenes exhibit clear zoning with normal, reverse and double zoning for Layou and Rosalie eruptions and almost reverse and double zoning for Roseau. They display cyclic interaction with smaller magmatic environments of an either more or less evolved composition. Mobilization of crystals in between these different environments causes the simple or double normal and reverse zoning in crystals.\nIn order to constrain timescales of reservoir processes, diffusion has been modelled along the a- and b-axis on zoned orthopyroxenes of Layou and Roseau eruptions at 850°C. For both eruptions, dating of diffusion kinetics on crystal zoning provides comparable timescale distributions of ~3-4 years before each eruption. This suggests magma remobilization of about 3 years prior each eruption, likely acting as a final eruption trigger.",

The effects of these spills include dead wildlife, oil covered marshlands and contaminated water. Deepwater horizon cost approximately $50 billion and severely challenged response capabilities. In such large spills optimizing a coordinated response is a particular challenge. This challenge can be met in a revolutionary new way by using an objectively optimized Cyber Physical Decision Making System (CPS) for rapid response products and a framework for objectively optimized decision-making in an uncertain environment.\nThe CPS utilizes machine learning for the processing of the massive real-time streams of Big Data from comprehensive hyperspectral remote sensing acquired by a team of low-cost robotic aerial vehicles, providing a real-time aerial view and stream of hyperspectral imagery from the near UV to the thermal infrared, and a characterization of oil thickness, oil type and oil weathering. The objective decision making paradigm is modeled on the human brain and provides the optimal course trajectory for response vessels to achieve the most expeditious cleanup of oil spills using the available resources.\nIn addition, oil spill cleanups often involve surface oil burns that can lead to air quality issues. The aerial vehicles comprehensively characterize air quality in real-time, streaming location, temperature, pressure, humidity, the abundance of 6 criterion pollutants (O3, CO, NO, NO2, SO2, and H2S) and the full size distribution of airborne particulates. This CPS can be readily applied to other systems in agriculture, water conversation, monitoring of stream quality, air quality, diagnosing risk of wild fires, etc..",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic models are often calibrated to streamflow observations at discrete points along a river network. Even if the area contributing to each flow location is discretized into multiple model elements, the calibration parameters are typically adjusted uniformly, either by setting them to the same value or transforming them in the same way (for example, multiply each parameter value by a given factor). Such a procedure typically results in sharp gradients in calibrated parameters between neighboring subbasins and disregards parameter heterogeneity at the subbasin scale. Here we apply a streamflow disaggregation procedure to develop daily, spatially-distributed runoff fields at the same resolution as the model application. We then use these fields to calibrate selected model parameters for each model grid cell independently.\nWe have implemented two hydrologic models (the Variable Infiltration Capacity model and the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System) across the Columbia River Basin plus the coastal drainages in Oregon and Washington at a subdaily timestep and a spatial resolution of 1/16 degree or ~6km, resulting in 23,929 individual model grid cells. All model grid cells are calibrated independently to the distributed runoff fields using the shuffled complex evolution method and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as the objective function. The KGE was calculated on a weekly time step to minimize the effects of timing errors in the disaggregated runoff fields. We will present calibrated parameter fields and then discuss their structure (or lack thereof), which can provide important insight into parameter identifiability and uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Wax Lake Delta is a prograding delta formed where Atchafalaya River water is diverted down the Wax Lake Outlet into Atchafalaya Bay. The delta, which is preferentially composed of sand, has multiple distributary channels leading to the bay. Sand transport and deposition within this channel network is the primary driver of the delta’s progradation. We present results of a three-month field campaign to analyze channel velocities and turbidities in a pair of distributary channels in the Wax Lake Delta to understand controls on sand transport in the system. Background river velocities and tidal heights in the channels align with each other in both phase and magnitude, but tidal velocities differ greatly. This difference leads to flow in one channel that reverses on tidal timescales while the other channel is always outflowing. This unexpected behavior is explained using a simple, analytical model of tidal propagation into and through a branching system. Differences in tidal velocities drive differences in sediment transport, as shear velocities in the reversing channel are generally lower than that in the channel with unidirectional flow, and are commonly lower than settling velocities for sand grains typically found in the system. This effect is observed with turbidity measurements during the field campaign and with bed observations of the two channels.",

The characteristic seismicity during the sustained dome-building phase of the 2004–2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens (MSH), USA was cyclic LP “drumbeating”. However, accompanying the LP drumbeating was a near-continuous, randomly occurring series of tiny LP seismic events (LP “subevents”), which may hold important additional information on the mechanism of seismogenesis at restless volcanoes. We employ template matching, phase-weighted stacking, and full-waveform inversion to image the source mechanism of one multiplet of these LP subevents at MSH in July 2005. We apply network-based template matching to 8 days of continuous velocity waveform data from 29 June to 7 July 2005. We stack waveforms for high-quality triggers at each station and component, using a combination of linear and phase-weighted stacking to produce clean stacks for use in waveform inversion. The derived source mechanism points to the volumetric oscillation (~10 m3) of a subhorizontal crack located at shallow depth (~30 m) in an area to the south of Crater Glacier in the southern portion of the breached MSH crater. A possible excitation mechanism is the sudden condensation of metastable steam from a shallow pressurized hydrothermal system as it encounters cool meteoric water in the outer parts of the edifice.",

            "abstract": "While volcanic lightning has been reported for millennia, the physics that generate charge in plumes still require clarification. Lightning observations during the Augustine (2006) and Redoubt (2009) eruptions have revealed a new form of lightning: nearly continuous, vent discharges associated with the explosive phase of the eruption. Vent lightning is often small (10-100 m in length) and disorganized, suggesting the existence of multiple, transient charge centers proximal to the volcanic vent. Thomas et al., 2007 and Behnke et al., 2012 have postulated that this form of lightning is driven by fragmentation charging [James et al., 2008]. However, triboelectrification—frictional charging arising from particle-particle collisions as material is advected up to the vent—should also play an important role. Because tribocharging is modulated by collision rates and energies, it is within the conduit and the gas-thrust regions that this frictional process should be most efficient. Indeed, the work of Cimarelli et al., 2014 has suggested that lightning can be generated at the vent via triboelectric charging alone. Using an energy-based comparison, we investigate the relative efficiencies of fracto- and triboelectric charging. To generate charged particles via a fragmentation process, we employ Prince Rupert's Drops (PRDs), meta-stable, tadpole-shaped structures formed by quenching molten glass in water. While a PDR's head is extremely strong, even the slightest damage to the tail causes explosive disintegration of the drop [Silverman et al., 2012]. A set of PDRs are disrupted in a controlled environment and the charge on the resulting particles is measured using a set of Faraday cups. The energy density associated with the breaking of PRDs is on the order of 105-106 J/m3. Then, to investigate tribocharging at similar energies, we eject spherical particles at high velocities, producing particle-particle collisions in a novel Faraday cube sensor. Our setup allows us to measure the initial and resulting charges on impacting particles and explore how charge transfer is modulated by collisional energy. Using these techniques, we construct a complete model for chthonic electrification—that is, subsurface charging—in volcanic systems, describing the dynamics needed to produce vent lighting.",

DJP from the south fork is located ~9 km west of Lake Vanda. The basin floor is 117 m above mean seawater level with activity to the north and south rising above 1000 m. The DJP brine does not freeze and may be a model environment for Ca and Cl weathering and distribution on Mars.\nOur findings indicate that DJP and DQP have formed in similar climatic and geological environments, but likely experienced different formation conditions. Samples were collected from surface, soil pits and depth profiles during the 1979/1980, the 1990/1991 and the 2005/2006 field seasons. Elemental abundances and mineralogy were evaluated for several sets of sediments. The DJP basin shows low surface abundances of halite and relatively high abundances of sulfates throughout with gypsum or anhydrite dominating at different locations. The DQP area has high surface abundances of halite with gypsum present as the major sulfate. Two models have been proposed to explain these differences: DQP may have formed through a combination of shallow and some deep groundwater influx, while deep groundwater upwelling likely played the dominant role of salt formation at DJP. Our study seeks to understand the formation of DQP and DJP as unique terrestrial processes and as models for Ca, Cl, and S weathering and distribution on Mars.",

            "abstract": "A body of work has shown that there are trends and variability in stratospheric water vapor closely related to variability in tropical tropopause temperatures, upwelling variations, the quasi-biennial oscillation, volcanic aerosol loading and sea surface temperatures. Prior studies have also shown that stratospheric water vapor has a small but non-negligible effect on global radiative forcing; therefore it is key to understand both trends and long-term variations. In this presentation, we will examine both the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and stratospheric water for the time period where we have global lower stratosphere water vapor measurements (primarily since the early 1990s), as well as the relationship between tropical tropopause temperatures and assorted atmospheric indices for the longer time period where we only have temperature measurements. We will present results from climate model runs testing the impact of volcanic aerosol loading on UTLS temperatures, stratospheric water vapor and tropical upwelling. Using our climate model runs, we also isolate the impact of the QBO on tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. With WACCM, we found that the tropical tropopause temperature annual cycle amplitude was smaller than observed by ~30% in a case run without QBO nudging; in this presentation we explore the reasons for that and its impact on stratospheric water vapor.",

            "abstract": "Solar energetic particle (SEP) pitch angle distributions arise from the competing effects of magnetic focusing and scattering as the particles travel through the interplanetary medium, and can therefore indicate interplanetary conditions far from the observer. The STEREO Low Energy Telescopes measure SEP pitch angle distributions for protons, helium, and heavier ions with energies of about 2-12 MeV/nucleon. A wide variety of particle anisotropies was observed in the extreme SEP event of 23 July 2012. At the STEREO-Ahead spacecraft, the solar source of the activity was near central meridian and the pitch angle distribution was initially an outward-flowing beam. High time resolution (1-minute) observations revealed peculiar oscillations in beam width on a timescale of several minutes; such behavior does not seem to have been previously reported in other events. Particle flow became bidirectional while inside a magnetic cloud following a tremendous shock. Particle intensities at the Behind spacecraft, from which the event occurred over the east limb of the Sun, were about 1000 times lower than at Ahead. Pitch angle distributions during the peak of the event show inward-flowing particles that underwent partial mirroring closer to the Sun and formed a distinctive loss-cone distribution (indicating that the magnetic field strength at the mirror point was too small to turn around particles with the smallest pitch angles). We present the observations of this rich variety of anisotropies within a single event, compare with observations in other events, and discuss the implications for SEP transport in the inner heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of the total particulate mass of the plumes of Enceladus are important to constrain theories of particle formation and transport at the surface and interior of the satellite. We revisit the calculations of Ingersoll & Ewald (2011), who estimated the particulate mass of the Enceladus plumes from strongly forward scattered light in Cassini ISS images. We model the plume as a combination of spherical particles and irregular aggregates resulting from the coagulation of spherical monomers, the latter of which allows for plumes of lower particulate mass. Though a continuum of solutions are permitted by the model, the best fits to the ISS data consist either of low mass plumes composed entirely of small aggregates or high mass plumes composed of large aggregates and spheres. The high mass plumes can be divided into a population of large aggregates with total particulate mass of 116 ± 12 × 103 kg, and a mixed population of spheres and aggregates consisting of a few large monomers that has a total plume particulate mass of 166 ± 42 × 103 kg, consistent with the results of Ingersoll & Ewald (2011). Meanwhile, the low particulate mass aggregate plumes have masses of 25 ± 4 × 103 kg, leading to a solid to vapor mass ratio of 0.07 ± 0.01 for the plume. If indeed the plumes are made of such aggregates, then a vapor-based origin for the plume particles is possible. The process of aggregate formation by the coagulation of monomers, which depends on the bulk monomer number density inside the plume vents, requires a total plume vent cross sectional area of at most 1800 m2 to allow for the aggregates to form before the monomers are ejected into space. Differentiation between the high mass and low mass solutions may be possible if forward scattering observations are taken at scattering angles <2°, or else an independent plume particulate mass measurement becomes available.",

Accurate imaging of the internal structure of volcanic systems is critical in order to characterize and quantify mass and energy transport mechanisms in such dynamic environments.\nTo produce high-resolution velocity/reflectivity structures of Axial volcano, here, we combined a synthetic ocean bottom experiment (SOBE), 3-D traveltime tomography, 2D elastic full waveform and a reverse time migration (RTM) formalism.\nWe present an updated and more complete outlook of Axial volcano upper crustal structure. We find that the addition of 469,891 traveltime arrivals, from twelve different multichannel seismic lines, to a previous OBSs-based traveltime tomography inversion, greatly improved the resolution of the three-dimensional velocity structure. We observe two elongated crustal magma reservoir beneath the central volcano. We investigate the extent, volume and physical state of those magma reservoirs and provide images of the volcanic plumbing system. We use our 3D velocity structure to relocate several months of seismicity and track magma movements between the caldera and the eruption site. We show that crustal-aging is controlled by pipe-like pattern of focused hydrothermal circulation. We suggest that the subsiding caldera floor at Axial Volcano was initiated ~720kyr +/-100kyr and provides a near perfect trap for the ponding of lava flows.",

This 8-week long program is designed for mid-career graduate students in related fields to come to LANL, receive lectures on space physics and space environment topics, and carry out a research project under the mentorship of LANL staff members. We accept typically 6-8 students to the program, with a strong applicant pool to choose from. This type of summer school program is relatively unique in the space physics community—there are several other summer schools but they are of shorter duration and do not include the mentor-research project aspect which builds a strong one-on-one connection between the summer student and his/her LANL mentor(s). From the LANL perspective, this program was intended to have several benefits including building collaborations between LANL staff and universities and recruitment of potential postdocs. From the student perspective, this program is not only an educational opportunity but a strong networking opportunity and a chance to enhance their professional skills and publication record. Students are permitted to work on projects directly related to their thesis or on projects in areas that are completely new to them. At the end of the summer school, the students also develop their presentation skills by preparing and giving AGU-style presentations on their research projects to the research group. Over the past five years the summer school has increased in popularity, and the feedback from the student participants has been very positive. Alumni of the program have continued collaborations with their mentors, resulting in publications and conference presentations, and one postdoc hire to date.",

ACME is a high-resolution climate model with a 0.25 degree in horizontal and more than 60 levels in the vertical. It starts from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with notable changes to its physical parameterizations and other components. This presentation provides an overview on the ACME model’s capability in simulating clouds and precipitation and its sensitivity to convection schemes. Results with using several state-of-the-art cumulus convection schemes, including those unified parameterizations that are being developed in the climate community, will be presented. These convection schemes are evaluated in a multi-scale framework including both short-range hindcasts and free-running climate simulations with both satellite data and ground-based measurements. Running climate model in short-range hindcasts has been proven to be an efficient way to understand model deficiencies. The analysis is focused on those systematic errors in clouds and precipitation simulations that are shared in many climate models. The goal is to understand what model deficiencies might be primarily responsible for these systematic errors.",

The first camera functioned as a contextual imager to show the location and structure of the strokes. The other two cameras were operated as slit-less spectrometers, with resolutions of 0.2 to 1.0 nm. The imaging camera was operated at a readout rate of 48,000 frames per second and provided an image-based trigger mechanism for the spectrometers. Each spectrometer operated at a readout rate of 400,000 frames per second. The sensors were deployed on the southern edge of Albuquerque, New Mexico and collected data over a 4 week period during the thunderstorm season in the summer of 2015. Strikes observed by the sensor suite were correlated to specific strikes recorded by the National Lightning Data Network (NLDN) and thereby geo-located. Sensor calibration factors, distance to each strike, and calculated values of atmospheric transmission were used to estimate absolute radiometric intensities for the spectral-temporal data. The data that we present show the intensity and time evolution of broadband and line emission features for both leader and return strokes. We highlight several key features and overall statistics of the observations. A companion poster describes a lightning model that is being developed at Sandia National Laboratories.",

Additionally, quick response capabilities will provide affordable, low risk support for emergency management teams. NASA’s partnerships with commercial, university and other government agency teams are bringing new capabilities to research and emergency management communities.\nNew technology platforms and instrument systems are gaining momentum for stand-off remote sensing observations, as well as penetration and detailed in-situ examination of natural and anthropogenic phenomena. Several pioneering investigations have provided the foundation for this development, including NASA projects with Aerosonde, Dragon Eye, and SIERRA platforms. With miniaturized instrument and platform technologies, these experiments demonstrated that previously unobtainable observations may significantly aid in the understanding, prediction, and assessment of natural hazards such as storms, volcanic eruptions, floods, and the potential impact of environmental changes. Remote sensing observations of storms and fires have also been successfully demonstrated through NASA’s efforts with larger UAS such as the Global Hawk and Ikhana platforms. The future may unfold with new high altitude and/or long endurance capabilities, in some cases with less size and costs as payload capacity requirements are reduced through further miniaturization, and alternatively with expanded instrumentation and mission profiles.\nSeveral new platforms and instrument development projects are underway that will enable affordable, quick response observations. Additionally, distributed measurements that will provide near-simultaneous coverage at multiple locations will be possible - an exciting new mission concept that will greatly aid many observation scenarios. Partnerships with industry, academia, and other government agencies are all making significant contributions to these new capabilities.",

We estimated net P accumulation (legacy P) for the Baltic Sea using the Net Anthropogenic Phosphorus Inputs (NAPI) approach and historical records of food and feed trade and riverine fluxes. Net P inputs to the catchment peaked at 0.7 million tons per year during the 1970’s and since the political and economical changes in Eastern Europe during the 1990’s, decreased to 0.2-0.3 million tons per year. P accumulation on land is ten times greater than accumulation in the sea (20 million and 2 million tons, respectively). Of the P retained on land, the majority (18-19 million tons) is in agricultural lands, with the balance in lake sediments. Of the 2 million tons in the sea, two-thirds are in sediments and one-third in the water column. The success of nutrient management actions in reducing river nutrient fluxes will lead to improvement in the Baltic Sea environment, but the massive accumulation of P on land will complicate efforts to achieve complete recovery.",

            "abstract": "Paleoscientists seek fundamental knowledge of Earth systems, and have unique views of system dynamics on the timescales longer than recent observations. This is important, because some processes that may control the trajectory of change in the not-so-distant future are not well illustrated or constrained in the short history of instrumental observations; paleo data offer our only observational window on these longer scales. But paleo vision is also a bit blurry, and sometimes biased. It matters how we approach the records to focus on the right things, and it matters how we communicate our insights so that we can teach models to approximate real Earth system behaviors. In the six decades since Cesare Emiliani set us on the path of quantitative observational paleoscience, we’ve observed more and more. Each year brings more “proxies,” more sites, more resolution, and the more we look the more we find interpretable signals. This data complexity makes the paleo literature daunting to outsiders; it is hard to get past the stories. Most of our narratives are grounded in linear systems, focusing on forcing and response, and we data generators struggle to infer even modest nonlinearity. But the concept of massive nonlinearity, tipping points, has recently entered the public consciousness, and the search is on anew for such events in paleo data. The reality of tipping points as well as the processes that may drive such events are not yet fully clear, but the search is essential because if humanity does indeed push the Earth system across an irreversible tipping point into a new state, we need to know how this might play out and over what time frames. Can we really learn about such occurrences, and the processes that control them, in paleo records? Do we need to think about the past differently? Will this change how we think about the future? Will it inform what we do about the future? Emiliani thought it should. This lecture will explore how.",

            "abstract": "Under certain meteorological conditions it is possible for a wildfire to generate a convective event known as pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb). When a pyroCb forms, smoke and ash from the emitted by the fire is entrained into a deep convective column. An intense pyroCb is capable of injecting smoke into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. At present, little is known about the frequency of occurrence of these high altitude aerosol injections, the mechanisms by which pyroCb occur, and their climatological impact. In order to better understand and characterize this phenomenon, it is necessary to develop methods for detection and monitoring of pyroCb.\nThis study focuses on daytime-only detection of pyroCb using GOES-15 imager data for 41 large wildfires observed during the 2013 fire season in North America. We use a simple thresholding technique to isolate potential pyroCb using multiple assumptions: 1) pyroCb occur close to significant fire events; 2) pyroCb are optically thick, 3) pyroCb reach high altitudes, and 4) entrained smoke reduces cloud top particle size thereby increasing albedo in the shortwave infrared. Based on these assumptions, the algorithm first identifies clouds near fires that are cold in the longwave (high altitude and optically thick). Microphysical changes are identified by a shortwave brightness temperature that is significantly higher than in longwave. For the 41 fires studied, the resulting algorithm proved capable of detecting pyroCb as observed by the scientific community and was also able to detect a significant number of pyroCb that were not previously identified. This algorithm can be extended to next-generation geostationary sensors such as the Advanced Baseline Imager (GOES-R) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (Himawari-8), which will likely provide even greater ability to identify and detect stratospheric smoke injections.",

            "abstract": "Widespread storage of meltwater within the compacting snow (firn) in the southeastern region of the Greenland ice sheet exists throughout the year. The water saturated firn (~10-30 m below the snow surface) extends to an average depth of 20 m and overlays the firn-ice transition. The aquifer resides mainly within the percolation zone at elevations between 1200 and 2000 m, in areas of high snow accumulation. Depth specific hydrologic measurements in several boreholes within the Greenland ice sheet firn aquifer are used to understand water recharge, transport, and discharge, as well as the aquifer’s relationship with the broader englacial drainage system. Measurements within the aquifer (~20-30 m below the snow surface) include hydraulic conductivity, water levels, and environmental tracer concentrations in the liquid water (tritium, CFCs, and noble gasses). Tritium concentration profiles (from the surface to ~50 m depth) were also measured in firn core above, within, and below the aquifer. Similarities and differences to land-based groundwater aquifers are observed. Slug and aquifer pumping tests indicate high hydraulic conductivity (~10-4 m/s). Water samples show minor differences in tritium variation with depth and larger difference in dissolved noble gasses with depth. Tritium concentrations at depth in water and firn are similar to each other but differ from predicted concentrations based on a core-derived firn depth-age model and tritium decay. CFC concentrations are lower than atmospheric solubility. Tritium and CFC results suggest that exchange between liquid water and the atmosphere is very different in this firn aquifer than a conventional groundwater aquifer. These first of their kind measurements taken from the Greenland perennial firn aquifer contribute to our understanding of aquifer behavior and it’s relation to regional ice-sheet dynamics and contribution to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic field intensities corresponding to virtual axial dipole moments of up to 200 ZAm2, more than twice the modern value, have been inferred from archeomagnetic measurements on artifacts dated at or shortly after 1000 BC. Anomalously high values occur in the Levant and Georgia, but not in Bulgaria. The origin of this spike is believed to lie in Earth's core: however, its spatio-temporal characteristics and the geomagnetic processes responsible for such a feature remain a mystery. We show that a localized spike in the radial magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) must necessarily contribute to the largest scale changes in Earth's surface field, namely the dipole. Even the limiting spike of a delta function at the CMB produces a minimum surface cap size of 60 degrees for a factor of two increase in paleointensity. Combined evidence from modern satellite and millennial scale field modeling suggests that the Levantine Spike is intimately associated with a strong increase in dipole moment prior to 1000 BC and likely the product of north-westward motion of concentrated near equatorial Asian flux patches like those seen in the modern field. New archeomagnetic studies are needed to confirm this interpretation. Minimum estimates of the power dissipated by the spike are comparable to independent estimates of the dissipation associated with the entire steady state geodynamo. This suggests that geomagnetic spikes are either associated with rapid changes in magnetic energy or strong Lorentz forces.",

The changes in runoff under simultaneous hydro-climatic or climate-land use perturbations were notably different than the summations of their individual contributions. The developed model was used to estimate the potential stormwater budget of the Kissimmee River Basin in 2050s using downscaled GCM-RCM climate projections and anticipated land use/cover scenarios.

            "abstract": "Seismic discontinuities within the mantle arise from a wide range of mechanisms, including changes in mineralogy, major element composition, melt content, volatile abundance, anisotropy, or a combination of the above. In particular, the depth and sharpness of upper mantle discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depth are attributed to solid-state phase changes sensitive to both mantle temperature and composition, where regions of thermal heterogeneity produce topography and chemical heterogeneity changes the impedance contrast across the discontinuity. Seismic mapping of this topography and sharpness thus provides constraint on the thermal and compositional state of the mantle.\nThe EarthScope USArray is providing unprecedented access to a wide variety of new regions previously undersampled by the SS precursors. This includes the boundary between the oceanic plate in the western Atlantic Ocean and continental margin of eastern North America. Here we use a seismic array approach to image the depth, sharpness, and topography of the upper mantle discontinuities, as well as other possible upper mantle reflectors beneath this region. This array approach utilizes seismic waves that reflect off the underside of a mantle discontinuity and arrive several hundred seconds prior to the SS seismic phase as precursory energy.\nIn this study, we collected high-quality broadband data SS precursors data from shallow focus (< 30 km deep), mid-Atlantic ridge earthquakes recorded by USArray seismometers in Alaska. We generated 4th root vespagrams to enhance the SS precursors and determine how they sample the mantle. Our data show detection of localized structure on the discontinuity boundaries as well as additional horizons, such as the X-discontinuity and a potential reflection from a discontinuity near the depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. These structures are related to the transition from predominantly old ocean lithosphere to underlying continental lithosphere, as while deeper reflectors are associated with the subduction of the ancient Farallon slab. A comparison of the depth of upper mantle discontinuities to changes in seismic velocity and anisotropy will further quantify the relationship to mantle flow, compositional layering, and phases changes.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission was launched in January 2015. The objective of the mission is global mapping of soil moisture and landscape freeze/thaw state. SMAP utilizes L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-meter mesh reflector antenna. Merging of active and passive L-band observations enables an unprecedented combination of accuracy, resolution, global coverage and revisit-time for soil moisture and freeze/thaw retrievals. The primary validation reference of the data products will be ground-based measurements. Well characterized sites with calibrated in situ measurements will be used to determine the quality of the data products; these sites are designated as core validation sites. The mission success criteria will be evaluated with respect to these core site comparisons. Other remote sensing and model-based products will be used as additional resources to expand the spatial and temporal scope of the evaluation. In an effort to ensure the geographic distribution and diversity of conditions of the core validation sites, SMAP has partnered with investigators across the globe. Because different SMAP Level 2 soil moisture products have different spatial scales, the suitability of the various sites for validation of the different products must be done for each site while considering several factors. The main factors are gravimetric calibration of the sensors within a site and determination of a spatial scaling function of the sensor measurements up to the SMAP resolution scales. The mission has been able to utilize the core site measurements since the launch of the satellite because the infrastructure for data transmission and processing was established well before the launch. The validated soil moisture products will be released by May 2016. In this presentation we will show the performance of the beta version of the soil moisture products (released by November 2015) and discuss the status of the validation process.",

Precipitation anomalies in particular are associated with NHJ variability and the resulting floods/droughts can have considerable societal and economic impacts. Therefore a better understanding of NHJs role in regional climate is essential in assessing the natural and socio-economic impacts of projected future change in NHJ features.\nWe developed a new climatology of the 300 hPa NHJ based on its seasonally explicit latitudinal position. We used the 20th Century Reanalysis V2 (20CR) data at monthly resolution from 1930-2012 to define the latitudinal position of NHJ as the latitude with the greatest 300 hPa scalar wind speed (m s-1). From these data, we identified four seasons with coherent NHJ patterns (January-February, April-May, July-August, and October-November) and detected longitudinal sectors (total of 15 sectors for all the seasons) where the seasonal jet shows strong spatial coherence. We examined the influence of seasonal NHJ position on the geographical distribution of precipitation and temperature patterns for all sectors.\nFurthermore, we compared NHJ positions to atmospheric circulation indices at inter-annual and multi-decadal time scales. We found a significant relationship between the NHJ position and the North Atlantic and Arctic oscillations for all seasons and across the majority of longitudinal sectors. In addition to this, our NHJ data set supports a connection with ocean-atmosphere interactions over the northern Pacific Ocean on various time scales: we found significant correlations between the North Pacific Jet and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation for all seasons and with El Niño Southern Oscillation for the winter season.\nOur results emphasize the importance of the seasonal and spatial characteristics of NHJ, as well as climate teleconnections, when considering regional temperature and precipitation variability.",

We use the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and water balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration, P-ET) through 1982 to 2009 to study the drought conditions in China. The results showed that the anomaly PDSI and P-ET values all showed significant decreased trend. The areas of drought in China have increased from 1982 to 2009. Almost 75% of China showed decreased trend especially in southern China and the northwest China become wetter. The precipitation, evapotranspiration and temperature led to this condition comprehensively. Temperature exerts a growing influence on drought and the effects of precipitation become weaker. The drought may cause the positive feedback for the decreased precipitation, increased evapotranspiration and increased temperature. We should make policy based on this condition to enhance the sustainable use of water resources, particularly for agricultural development and slow down this feedback.",

            "abstract": "Some researchers have highlighted the fact that most of the river classification schemes have not evolved at the same pace as river morphodynamics models have done it. The most prevailing classification scheme of meandering river was proposed by Brice (1975) and is mainly based on observational criteria. Likewise, thermodynamics principles have been applied on geomorphology over a relatively long period of time. Thus, for instance, a strong analogy between meander angle of deflection and the distribution of momentum in gas dynamics has been identified.\nBased on the analysis of curvature data from 16 natural meanders (which totals 52 realizations) ranging from class B to class G related to the Brice classification scheme, we propose a two-parameter meandering classification schemen, namely: [1] the yearly Shannon wavelet based negentropy gradient (ΔSWT), and [2] a quantitative continuum of the degree of confinement, which is estimated from the dimensonless Frechet distance (δF*) between the meandering centerline curvature and that of the mean center. Our results show that δF* identifies a threshold of ˜650 to discriminate freely from confined rivers; thereby, scales of the second and third degree of confinement are quantified. Likewise, the proxy parameter ΔSWT suggests that there are 4 degrees of meandering morphodynamics which lay in the intervals [10-1-100], [100-101], [101-102], and [102-103]. Our results also suggest that the lower negentropy corresponds to G1 meanders (two phase, bimodal bankfull sinuosity, equiwidth) and class B2 (single phase, wider at bends, no bars). Class G2 (two phase, bimodal bankfull sinuosity, wider at bends with point bars) and class C (single phase wider a bends, no bars) exhibit higher negentropy (single phase wider at bends width point bars). Likewise, the middle-negentropy group is comprised by both confined meanders (B1, single phase and equiwidth channel, and D, single phase, wider at bends with point bars and chutes) and free meanders (class F, two phase underfit, low water sinuosity).\nIn the light of these results, we believe that our meandering classification scheme has the potential to complement the prevailing observational Brice classification scheme.

The ERT survey line was installed in north-south direction which is perpendicular to the strike direction of mineral vein according the drilling data. In order to study the effect of the drilling data on the inversion resolution, a synthetic resistivity model is carried out. The anomalous body consists of 11 conductivity blocks. We assumed that the drilling data sets are measured from four boreholes. Then, the traditional resistivity inversion and the drilling data constrained resistivity inversion are employed, and the two subsurface resistivity maps obtained. From the maps, the inverted resistivity map by the drilling data constrained resistivity inversion has a better resolution and can describe the anomalous body well, however, the one from the traditional resistivity inversion cannot reveal the subsurface resistivity distribution especially to the depth. By the same way, we conducted traditional resistivity inversion and the drilling data constrained resistivity inversion of field study ERT data, two subsurface resistivity maps obtained.

This study considers solfataric alteration as a potential formation mechanism for opal, sulfate and clays on Mars. Alteration via fumaroles in the Kilauea caldera, HI, have created a light-toned solfataric bank on the south wall of the crater where Keanakakoi ash was deposited. Bands of orange, beige and whitish crusted material are present where jarosite and gypsum are observed in a silica/clay matrix. We have analyzed the chemistry and mineralogy of several chunks and particulate samples from this site using visible/near-IR (VNIR), mid-IR and Mössbauer spectroscopies as well as XRD, SEM and BSE imaging.\nMineralogical analyses show the presence of opal, saponite, gypsum, jarosite and ferric oxides/hydroxides in the ash as well as remnants of the original basaltic components and volcanic glass. The alternating bands of light-toned gypsum-bearing material and orange-colored bands of jarosite-bearing material likely mark changes in the acidity of the hydrothermal fumes. SEM reveals Fe sulfate, Mg smectite and palagonitic rinds surrounding sideromelane and pyroxene crystals. Mössbauer spectra indicate the presence of ferric oxide-bearing species in addition to jarosite. The VNIR spectra show changes in the Fe bands for the bright and orange bands in the outcrop. The VNIR spectra also include features consistent with hydrated silica, gypsum, jarosite and saponite. XRD shows that opal-A is prevalent over opal-CT. Mid-IR reflectance and emissivity spectra are consistent with gypsum, jarosite, and silica. Bulk chemical analyses and BSE imaging indicate basaltic components in addition to the opal, sulfates and saponite. Using multiple lab techniques to characterize the alteration products of hydrothermal and solfataric alteration on Kilauea, we hope to enable improved interpretation of orbital and in situ data of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost thaw causes ground subsidence or thermokarst. Thermokarst terrain on hilly slopes can lead to the formation of thaw slumps, which dramatically alter soil properties and carbon emissions, but little is known regarding the effects of thaw slumps on the biogeochemical processes of soil carbon. In the present study, we measured the soil carbon contents and physiochemical properties in different thaw slump stages (no slump, slumping and slumped) in the upper reach of the Heihe River Basin in the northeastern Qinghai Tibetan Plateau (QTP). With these samples, the C mineralization rates were measured using laboratory incubations. Meanwhile, the chemistry changes of organic matter were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyzer before and after the incubation. The results showed that there was a significant decrease in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in the slumping and slumped stages. The loss of organic carbon and total nitrogen was 29.6 ± 5.9% and 31.1 ± 8.8% in the upper 0-10 cm layer of the slumping soil compared to the no slump soil. The slumped soil had a significantly lower loss of carbon and nitrogen content than the slumping soil (t-test, p < 0.05). The incubation results implied that slumped soil has significantly higher cumulative CO2 production than that of slumping soil (t-test, p < 0.05). In addition, the slumped soil had a higher intensity of hydrocarbons and lignin/phenol backbone composition than that of no slump and slumping soil for the 0-10 cm layer. This study demonstrates that abundant carbon and nitrogen loss occurs during the process of thaw slumps. Slumped soil can accumulate some organic matter, accompanied by substantial changes in its carbon chemical structure and characteristics. These results demonstrate that thaw slump plays an important role in the impact of permafrost thaw on chemical characteristics of organic matter and merits greater attention.",

            "abstract": "The feasibility of quantifying soil constituents over large areas using airborne hyperspectral data [0.35 - 2.5 μm] in an ensemble bootstrapping lasso algorithmic framework has been demonstrated previously [1]. However the effects of coarsening the spatial resolution of hyperspectral data on the quantification of soil constituents are unknown. We use Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected at 7.6m resolution over Birds Point New Madrid (BPNM) floodway for up-scaling and generating multiple coarser resolution datasets including the 60m Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) like data. HyspIRI is a proposed visible shortwave/thermal infrared mission, which will provide global data over a spectral range of 0.35 - 2.5μm at a spatial resolution of 60m. Our results show that the lasso method, which is based on point scale observational data, is scalable. We found consistent good model performance (R2) values (0.79 < R2 < 0.82) and correct classifications as per USDA soil texture classes at multiple spatial resolutions. The results further demonstrate that the attributes of the pdf for different soil constituents across the landscape and the within-pixel variance are well preserved across scales. Our analysis provides a methodological framework with a sufficient set of metrics for assessing the performance of scaling up analysis from point scale observational data and may be relevant for other similar remote sensing studies.\n[1] Dutta, D.; Goodwell, A.E.; Kumar, P.; Garvey, J.E.; Darmody, R.G.; Berretta, D.P.; Greenberg, J.A., \"On the Feasibility of Characterizing Soil Properties From AVIRIS Data,\" Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on, vol.53, no.9, pp.5133,5147, Sept. 2015. doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2015.2417547.",

The technology aims to improve the efficiency of acquisition or enhance the image quality through the dense spatial sampling. Previous methods usually use several source of the same type, we propose applying onshore sources with different central frequencies to image multiscale target layers at different depths. Low frequency seismic source is used to image the deep structure but has low resolution at shallow depth, which can be compensated by high frequency. By combing the low and high frequency imaging together, we obtain high resolution profiles on both shallow and deep. Considering all of above, we implemented a 2-D cruise using 300Hz and 2000Hz central frequency spark source whcich are randomly shooted with certain delay time. In this process we separate blended data by denoising methods, including middle filter and curvelet transform, and then match prestack data to obtain final profiles. Median filter can restrain impulse noise and protect the edges while curvelet transform has multi-scale characteristics and powerful sparse expression ability. The iterative noise elimination can produce good results. Prestack matching filter is important when integrate wavelet of two different spark sources because of their different characteristics, making data accordant for reflecting time, amplitude, frequency and phase. By comparing with profiles used either single type of source, the image of blended acquisition shows higher resolution at shallow depth and results in more information in deep locations.",

            "abstract": "The increasing importance of sustainable urban water use practices globally has motivated the creation of various conservation and management schemes. However, many of the operational and management models used to inform these policies do not simulate the hydrologic system holistically. Anthropogenic fluxes and changes to the hydrologic cycle are known to have significant and interacting impacts on the hydrologic system as a whole; however, only recently has the hydrologic community been able to quantify the effects and understand their behavior. At regional scales in humid cities, infrastructure leakage has an overwhelming impact on subsurface storage change. In semi-arid cities, both the large amount of water importation and the natural hydrometerological regime are particularly important drivers of land surface processes. This work seeks to understand the relative importance of land cover change, unmanaged infrastructure recharge, and urban irrigation on the hydrologic fluxes of urban semi-arid regions. To assess the impacts of these changes we utilize an integrated hydrologic model (ParFlow) coupled to a land surface model (CLM) to simulate Ballona Creek watershed and the underlying groundwater system in Los Angeles, CA. All simulations are conducted at a very high (30-m) spatial resolution over the watershed, a 388-km2 (150 sq. mi.) domain, and modeled over a 2-year period at an hourly timestep. The following model simulations are used to study anthropogenic impacts to the semi-arid urban water cycle: (1) a “naturalized” hydrologic simulation with no anthropogenic inputs and no land-surface feedbacks; (2) a hydrologic simulation with current imperviousness levels; (3) a simulation with the inclusion of urban land use/land cover features to assess their impacts; (4) using the model developed in 3, we evaluate the impact of infrastructure leakage; (5) using the model developed in 3, we assess the effects of the urban irrigation flux; (6) finally, we simulate the full land surface and hydrologic system with both infrastructure leakage and urban irrigation included. This approach assesses the processes individually and provides an understanding of how the anthropogenic effects may interact.",

            "abstract": "Speleothem 18O/16O records have revealed key aspects of past hydroclimates in the northern Australasian monsoon domain on orbital to millennial scales, but much less is known about the southern half of the monsoon system. We aim to develop a hydroclimate history for the southern Australasian monsoon based on speleothems from southwest Sulawesi and Flores, Indonesia (latitudes 5-9oS), which extend back to ~530 kyr BP and 90 kyr BP, respectively.\nTo date, the 18O/16O record for Sulawesi covers glacial terminations TIV (~340 kyr BP), TIII (~245 kyr BP) and TI (~18 kyr BP). The details of each termination are different, however two important hydroclimate patterns are emerging. First, the 18O/16O record shows sharp weakening of the monsoon immediately before each termination. This surprisingly robust pattern marks a southern extension of the northern ‘weak monsoon interval’, and reinforces the idea that southward monsoon displacement is a fundamental feature of terminations. Second, monsoon intensification around Sulawesi lags the rise in atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperature by several thousand years, but parallels the 18O/16O decrease in atmospheric O2. Our finding extends that of Wang et al. (2008) and Cheng et al. (2009) who noted the influence of the low-latitude hydrological cycle on the 18O/16O of tropical transpiration, and its potential for correlating ice core and paleomonsoon records.\nFurther south, the 90-kyr 18O/16O record for Flores shows clear precession-scale antiphasing with China, and southerly positioning of the summer monsoon rainfall belt during Heinrich stadials. Heinrich stadials 5, 4, 2 and 1 occur during wetter intervals in Flores that accompanied relatively high southern summer insolation. Intriguingly, these events are associated with abrupt atmospheric CH4 signals that may be due to increased Southern Hemisphere CH4 production related to intensification of monsoon rainfall over southern tropical land areas (Rhodes et al., 2014).",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the recent warming stoppage that started from about 2000 by using a recently developed methodology that can successfully identify and separate the dynamically induced and radiatively forced surface air temperature (SAT) changes from raw SAT data. The results illustrated that the dynamically induced SAT changes exhibited an obvious cooling effect relative to the warming effect of the adjusted SAT in the temperature hiatus process. A correlation analysis suggests that the cooling effect of dynamically induced is dominated primarily by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). It confirms that dynamically induced variability caused the warming trend slowdown (WTS). The radiatively forced SAT changes are determined mainly by anthropogenic forcing, indicating the warming influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which reached levels of 400 ppm during the hiatus period. Therefore, the global SAT will not remain permanently neutral. The increased radiatively forced SAT will be amplified by increased dynamically induced SAT when the natural mode returns to a warming phase in the next period.",

            "abstract": "Deformation processes inside subduction channels or during subduction and exhumation of HP and UHP nappes in collisional orogens are a matter of debate. Dehydration embrittlement, localized faulting and dissolution-precipitation creep have been suggested as major deformation processes. These processes, however, do not correspond to the field-based deformation record of penetrative foliations and stretching lineations in most HP and UHP nappes of the Central Alps, indicative of dislocation and diffusion creep processes including metamorphic reaction transfer. The Eclogite Zone of the Tauern Window (Eastern Alps) consists of fresh and retrogressed eclogites in a matrix of metasediments. Peak metamorphism was at 600°C and 2.0-2.5 GPa in the Oligocene followed by fast exhumation within a few million years. Eclogites and blueschists display a pronounced foliation and lineation fabric. Fresh and retrogressed samples have been investigated by neutron diffraction texture, electron backscatter diffraction and microprobe analysis. All investigated eclogites exhibit a pronounced crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of omphacite. In retrogressed eclogites the glaucophane CPO is strong as well and matches topologically always that of omphacite. Omphacite microstructures are characteristic of subgrain rotation recrystallization, identifying high-stress dislocation creep as main deformation mechanism. Diffusion and reaction transfer can be derived from the variable jadeite contents in omphacite porphyroclasts and recrystallized grains. The corresponding CPO of omphacite and glaucophane indicates that progressive CPO development spanned the whole high-pressure part of metamorphism and lasted until retograde blueschist grade. We propose that deformation in the Eclogite Zone was mostly distributed and continuous during subduction and exhumation and that dislocation and diffusion creep processes accommodated most of the strain below the frictional-viscous transition.",

            "abstract": "Fine roots are important for water and nutrient uptake and storage of carbon and nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. In order to examine effects of climate change on fine root of Pinus densiflora seedlings, an open-field experiment with the warming treatment and precipitation manipulation had been conducted at a nursery in Seoul, South Korea. Two-year-old P. seedlings were planted in April, 2013. The air temperature of the warmed plots (W) was set to increase by 3°C compared to the temperature control plots (C) using infrared lamps. The precipitation manipulation consisted of the precipitation decreased using transparent panel (-30%; P-), the precipitation increased using pump and drip-irrigation (+30%; P+), and the precipitation control (0%; P0). The fine root length of the seedlings near the soil surface (0–15 cm depth) was estimated from January, 2014 to January, 2015 trimonthly using minirhizotrons. The mean fine root length (mm mm-2) were 115.0 (WP0), 163.7 (WP-), 90.5 (WP+), 114.4 (CP0), 130.2 (CP-), and 100.6 (CP+) during the study period, respectively. The mean fine root length was significantly affected by the precipitation manipulation (P<0.0001); however, it was not influenced by the warming treatment (P>0.1). There was no interaction between warming and precipitation effects in fine root length. The fine root length in P- plot was higher than those in P0 plot and P+ plot, regardless of the warming treatment, which indicated that water stress caused by P- might stimulate the fine root growth. Meanwhile, the no consistent patterns of fine root length by warming treatment was found under P+ plot and P0 plot, but a positive effect of warming on fine root length was observed under P+ plot only. Estimations of fine root production and mortality are required to determine the interaction between warming and precipitation effects on fine root dynamics more exactly.\nThis study was supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (2014001310008).",

Dynamical downscalings are conducted by Non-Hydrostatic Regional Climate Model (NHRCM) with 20 km from the global climate projections using Meteorological Research Institute-Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-AGCM). Fifty ensemble experiments are performed in the present climate. For the future climate projections, 90 ensemble experiments are performed based on the six patterns of SST changes in the periods when 4 K rise in global-mean surface air temperature is projected.\nThe accumulated snowfall in winter decreases in Japan except for the northern parts of Japan. Especially, the inland areas in the Sea of Japan side, which is famous for the heaviest snowfall region in the world, shows the remarkable decrease in snowfall in the future climate. The experiments also show increased number of days without snowfall and decreased number of days with weak snowfall due to significant warming in the most parts of Japan. On the other hand, the extreme daily snowfall, which occurs once ten years, would increase at higher elevations in the Sea of Japan side. This means that extreme daily snowfall in the present climate would occur more frequently in the future climate. The warmer atmosphere can contain more water vapor and warmer ocean can supply more water vapor to the low atmosphere. The surface air temperature at higher elevations is still lower than 0 degree Celsius, which could result in the increased extreme daily snowfall.",

            "abstract": "Gross primary production (GPP), or the amount of atmospheric CO2 fixed by vegetation through photosynthesis, represents the largest carbon flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Despite its importance, large-scale estimates of GPP remain highly uncertain for some terrestrial ecosystems. In this context, measurements of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is emitted in the 650-850nm spectral range by the photosynthetic apparatus of green plants, have the potential to provide a new view on vegetation photosynthesis.\nGlobal monitoring of SIF from space have been achieved in the last years by means of a number of atmospheric spectrometers, which have turned out to provide the necessary spectral and radiometric sensitivity for SIF retrieval. The first global measurements of SIF were achieved in 2011 from spectra acquired by the Japanese GOSAT mission. This breakthorugh was followed by retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instruments onboard MetOp-A and MetOp-B, which enable a continuous spatial sampling, and lately from ENVISAT/SCIAMACHY. This observational scenario is completed by the first SIF data from the NASA-JPL OCO-2 mission (launched in July 2014) and the upcoming Copernicus' Sentinel 5-Precursor to be launched by early 2016. OCO-2 and TROPOMI offer the possibility of monitoring SIF globally with a 100-fold improvement in spatial and temporal resolution with respect to GOSAT, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY.\nIn this contribution, we will provide an overview of global SIF monitoring and will illustrate the potential of SIF data to improve our knowledge of vegetation photosynthesis and GPP at the synoptic scale. We will show examples of ongoing research exploiting SIF data for an improved monitoring of photosynthetic activity at different ecosystems, highlighting the usefulness of SIF to constrain estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation through photosynthesis.",

In an effort to incorporate the “wisdom of the crowd” in the identification and mitigation of flood hazard, this public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) study leveraged tablet computers and cloud computing to collect mental maps of flooding from 166 households in Newport Beach, California. The mental maps were analyzed using GIS techniques and compared with professional hydrodynamic model of coastal flooding. The results revealed varying levels of agreement between residents’ mental maps and professional model of flood risk in regions with different personal and contextual characteristics. The quantification of agreement using composite indices can help validate professional models, and can also alert planners and decisionmakers of the need to increase flood awareness among specific populations.",

            "abstract": "Ice shelf basal melting freshens and cools the fluid in the ice shelf-ocean boundary layer, producing Ice Shelf Water (ISW). The potential temperature of ISW is below the surface freezing point. Antarctic sea ice that has been affected by supercooled Ice Shelf Water (ISW) has a unique crystallographic structure and is called platelet ice. We have synthesized platelet ice observations to construct a continent-wide map of the winter presence of ISW at the ocean surface. Where suitable observations exist, oceanic heat fluxes are derived from sub-ice platelet layer measurements and these are shown in the figure. They demonstrate that in some regions of coastal Antarctica, supercooled ISW drives a negative oceanic heat flux of approximately -30 Wm-2 that persists for several months during winter. This heat flux from the sea ice to the ocean significantly increases the sea ice thickness close to an ice shelf. In other regions, particularly where the thinning of ice shelves is believed to be greatest, platelet ice is not observed. The most extensive dataset, which includes our new results, dates back to 1902 and extends north of the combined Ross and McMurdo Ice Shelf front in the southern Ross Sea. Here the surface water is held just below its freezing point as it enters McMurdo Sound from beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf. Despite a more recent decrease in ocean salinity consistent with observations in the south-western Ross Sea, there has been no detectable change in the volume or temperature of this supercooled ISW under sea ice since the early twentieth century. The inclusion of platelet ice into first year sea ice is an annual process. Hence it will respond immediately to changes in the sub-ice shelf circulation pattern and its export of supercooled water, emphasizing the urgent need for careful, Antarctic-wide monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The fixation of water in the oceanic crust and upper mantle, the flux of stored water into subduction zones and the partial liberation of those fluids underneath the forearc and arc are mechanisms that impact on almost every aspect of subduction zone processes, e.g. intensity and type of arc volcanism, deposition of ores and seismicity of the subduction fault, but also on global geochemical budgets by recycling material back into the continental crust. Much of that water fixation happens at the outer rise of subduction zones in particular by deep percolation of fluids to the upper mantle along bend faults.\nOffshore Chile, the age of the subducting Nazca Plate varies between 0 Ma at the Chile Triple Junction (46°S) and ~38 Ma at the latitude of Valparaíso (32°S). Age-related variations in the thermal state of the subducting Nazca Plate impact on the water influx to the subduction zone, as well as the volumes of water that are released under the continental forearc or, alternatively, carried into the deeper mantle. Southern Central Chile is an ideal setting to study this effect, because other factors important for the subduction zone water budget appear constant.\nWe determine the water influx by calculating the crustal water uptake and by modeling the upper mantle serpentinization at the outer rise of the Chile Trench. The water release under forearc and arc is determined by coupling FEM thermal models of the subducting plate with stability fields of water-releasing mineral reactions for upper and lower crust and hydrated mantle. Results show that both the influx and the release of water vary drastically over a length of 1500 km. In particular, the oldest and coldest segments carry roughly twice as much water into the subduction zone as the youngest and hottest segments, but their release flux to the forearc is only about one fourth of the latter. This high variability over a subduction zone of ~1500 km length shows that it is insufficient to consider subduction zones as uniform entities in global estimates of subduction zone fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Combining the new teleseismic body waves recorded by TIBET-31N passive seismic array with waveforms from several previous temporary seismic arrays, we carried out finite-frequency tomographic inversions to image three-dimensional velocity structures beneath southern and central Tibetan Plateau to examine the roles of the upper mantle in the formation of the Tibetan Plateau. Continuous high velocities are observed beneath the Himalayas and Lhasa Terrane with a moderate northward inclining angle. We interpret this high velocity anomaly as the subducting Indian continental lithosphere, which shows a slight east-west variation of northern extent, reaching ~31°N along 85°E and ~30°N along 91°E to 350-km depth. Strong low P- and S-wave velocity anomalies that extend from lower crust to about 200 km depth beneath the Cona rift, Yadong-Gulu rift, Tangra Yum Co rift, suggesting that rifting in southern Tibet is probably a process that involves the entire lithosphere. And these upper mantle low velocities also show east-west variations of depth extent. The one beneath Tangra Yum Co extends shallower to about 180 km, and the ones west of Yadong-Gulu rift and east of Cona rift have extended more than 300 km. The low velocity west of Yadong-Gulu rift extends further north and appears to connect with the massive upper mantle low velocity beneath central Tibet.\nWe propose a three-dimensional dynamic model for Indian continental lithosphere that is consistent with these important observations. The most importrant features of this 3-D dynamic model are: the northward moving Indian continental lithosphere is currently subducting beneath the southern Tibetan Plateau with a moderate angle of 40 degrees, reaching to Bangong-Nujiang Suture at depth of 350 km; the subducting Indian continental lithosphere is fragmented beneath the surface rifts with the largest gap beneath the Yadong-Gulu rift; and the fragmentation induced local upwelling asthenosphere beneath the Yadong-Gulu rift flow northward mixing with the hot asthenosphere in central Tibetan Plateau. Establishing the 3-D images of the subducting Indian continental lithosphere is an essential step toward the full understanding of the Indian-Eurasia continental collision and the construction of the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The effect of grain size on mantle viscosity is comparable to that of temperature and pressure. The current 3-D distribution of grain size in the mantle is, however, unknown. To explore the possible variability of grain size, we use the following: geodynamic inferences of effective viscosity, vacancy diffusion rates in upper mantle minerals and perovskite in the lower mantle, lateral variations in temperature derived from seismic images, and different geotherms. An important outcome of this modelling is a new mapping of lateral viscosity variations throughout the mantle. We find a correlation between grain size variability in the mantle and absolute changes with depth. We also find that lateral grain size variations give rise to reduced lateral viscosity variations. The corresponding 3-D variations in grain size are characterized by 2 orders of magnitude changes. Our results suggest that traditional models of 3-D variability in mantle viscosity based only on temperature-dependent vacancy diffusion, ignoring grain size variations, provides an incomplete description of the microphysics that determines its effective bulk viscosity.",

            "abstract": "As an index representing the hydrologic characteristics of the watershed, Horton index can be cited. This index is defined as the ratio of the amount of vaporization for the wetting amount and often used as a value of quantifying the water use efficiency of vegetation in the watershed. Since this index is relatively small annual fluctuations, this index is being evaluated as a good indicator of precipitation partitioning characteristics of the watershed. Thus, using this index, many studies on the relationship among the climate, terrain and vegetation of the watershed are being conducted in various ways. In this presentation, the seasonal effect of climate on the hydrologic partitioning of the watershed is analyzed using Horton index. The probability density of the soil moisture is stochastically simulated using the meteorologic date at Seoul, Daegu, Busan and Jeju observation site in the Korean peninsula and Horton index is calculated using the simulated probability density of the soil moisture. As a result of examining the relationship between Horton index and annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration, annual precipitation is a strong negative correlation with Horton index, while annual potential evapotranspiration is found to have a very weak positive correlation. This means that the amount of water supplied to the watershed has a greater impact on Horton index rather than the energy fed to the watershed. In order to investigate the impact of the climate seasonality on the hydrologic partitioning, Horton index considering the climate seasonality and Horton index removing the climate seasonality are calculated, respectively. It can be seen that the seasonality has an effect in reducing Horton index. Considering Horton index is proportional to the water use efficiency of vegetation, seasonality can be thought to inhibit the vegetation water use efficiency. In addition, much more than usual precipitation in seoul with a wet climate and much less than usual precipitation in daegu with a dry climate tend to disappear to the influence of seasonality on Horton index\nAcknowledgement\nThis subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment as \"The Eco Innovation Project : Non-point source pollution control research group\"",

It plays an important role in the land surface water and energy cycles, and has significant influence on yield of agricultural crops and vegetation growth. We evaluated the accuracies of the soil temperature profiles from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) at nine observational networks in the world to find a reliable global soil temperature profile dataset for future hydrological and ecological studies. Comparing with in-situ observations at different soil depths, the soil temperature profile data generated by the Noah model driven by the GLDAS forcing data (GLDAS/Noah10) and its latest version (GLDAS/Noah10_v2) were found skillful in terms of daily, monthly, and mean seasonal variations, showing great potential for applying these data in global hydrological and ecological studies. Further analysis showed that the overestimation of the GLDAS/CLM10 was mainly caused by its overestimation of ground heat flux, whereas the underestimation of the GLDAS/Noah10 was due to underestimation of downward longwave radiation from the forcing data. Thus, more accurate forcing data for the Noah model and improved thermal parameterization scheme for the CLM should be a future focus, as they can improve the simulation of soil temperatures.\n ",

            "abstract": "In the solar wind, flux ropes, e.g., magnetic clouds (MCs), are a frequently observational phenomenon. Their magnetic field configuration or the way that the field lines wind around the flux rope axis is one of the most important information to understand the formation and evolution of the observed flux ropes. Most MCs are believed to be in the force-free state, and widely modeled by the Lundquist force-free solution, in which the twist of the field line increases from zero at the axis to infinity at the boundary. However, Lundquist solution is not the only form of a force-free magnetic field. Some studies based on suprathermal electron observations and models have shown that MCs may carry magnetic field lines more likely to be uniformly twisted. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation of solar magnetic field also suggests that the field lines of a flux rope twist limitedly. In this study, we have developed a velocity-modified uniform-twist force-free flux rope model, and fit observed MCs with this model. By using this approach, we test how well the observed MCs can be fitted into a uniform-twist flux rope. Some interesting results will be given in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "As the world’s top trading country, China is now one of the most polluted regions worldwide. Much attention has been paid to the global impacts of Chinese pollution via atmospheric transport processes. However, a large portion of pollution produced in China is associated with its production of goods for foreign consumption via international trade. International trade allows for separation of regions producing and consuming the products, altering the spatial distribution of associated emissions and leading to substantial changes in regional air pollution and global transport. Along with China’s rapid economic growth in recent years, its economic-trade structure and volume has been changing all the time, resulting in large changes in total emissions and the shares of trade-related emissions. Our previous work has shown considerable variability in the contributions of export-related emissions to Chinese total emissions from 2000 to 2009.\nHere, we attempt to assess the influence of China’s changing total and export-related emissions between 2000 and 2009 on its atmospheric pollution loadings and global impacts, by exploiting simulations of a global chemical transport model. Given the distinctive contributions of different economic sectors to pollutant emissions, we also attempt to investigate the sectoral contributions to pollution loadings and transport.\nOur study will help understand the role of international trade in the trends and variability of Chinese pollution.",

            "abstract": "Fossil rifted margins, whereby originally extended continental crust is subsequently stacked in orogenic belts, provide the opportunity to track rift-related tectonics across different crustal levels. As a result, the crustal and/or lithospheric architecture at different stages of the rift history can be elucidated. In this study, the tectono-thermal evolution of the fossil Adriatic continental margin, sampled in the Italian Southern Alps, is investigated to shed light on the processes responsible for rift localization and hyper-extension in the Mesozoic Alpine Tethys system. This area records distributed upper crustal stretching at 245-190 Ma followed by rift localization at ca. 185-180 Ma along the future western edge of the Adriatic micro-plate, culminating in exhumation of sub-continental mantle at 165-160 Ma. The minor orogeny-related overprint allowed investigation of the Temperature-time evolution of upper crustal rocks from different parts of the margin by (U-Th)/He zircon (ZHe) thermochronology, providing insights on the thermal evolution of rocks in the 160-200°C temperature window. Our study reveals a progressive westward younging of ZHe ages, from 280-240 Ma in the proximal margin to 215-200 Ma at the eastern edge of the future hyper-extended margin, where rocks located underneath ca. 3 km of overburden attained temperatures in excess of 160°C in the late Triassic. Published studies from the originally underlying lower crustal rocks of the Ivrea Zone, also cropping out in the Southern Alps, indicate that protracted fluid flow and minor magmatism were affecting the base of the Adriatic crust in the late Triassic, too. The spatial distribution of the detected heating-cooling cycle suggests that rift localization along the future western edge of the Adriatic plate was favored by a crustal-scale thermal anomaly, established at 215-210 Ma, followed by thermal decay by 200-190 Ma. Subsequent crustal necking, starting at 185-180 Ma, led to excision of continental crust and mantle exhumation. Importantly, this study demonstrates that rifted margins are likely to undergo crustal-scale heating-cooling cycles. Understanding the timing, amplitude, lateral extent and tectonic context of these thermal anomalies is currently one of the main challenges in the study of rifted margins.",

K-NET and KiK-net, which are nationwide strong motion networks operated by NIED, cover all Japan by about 1750 stations in total. More than half of the stations transmit the ground-motion indexes and/or waveform data in every second. Traditionally, strong-motion data were recorded by event-triggering based instruments with non-continues telephone line which is connected only after an earthquake. Though the data from such networks mainly contribute to preparations for future earthquakes, huge amount of real-time data from dense network are expected to directly contribute to the mitigation of ongoing earthquake disasters through, e.g., automatic shutdown plants and helping decision-making for initial response. By generating the distribution map of these indexes and uploading them to the website, we implemented the real-time ground motion monitoring system, Kyoshin (strong-motion in Japanese) monitor. This web service (www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp) started in 2008 and anyone can grasp the current ground motions of Japan. Though this service provides only ground-motion map in GIF format, to take full advantage of real-time strong-motion data to mitigate the ongoing disasters, digital data are important. We have developed a WebAPI to provide real-time data and related information such as ground motions (5 km-mesh) and arrival times estimated from EEW (earthquake early warning). All response data from this WebAPI are in JSON format and are easy to parse. We also developed Kyoshin monitor application for smartphone, ‘Kmoni view’ using the API. In this application, ground motions estimated from EEW are overlapped on the map with the observed one-second-interval indexes. The application can playback previous earthquakes for demonstration or disaster drill. In mobile environment, data traffic and battery are limited and it is not practical to regularly visualize all the data. The application has automatic starting (pop-up) function triggered by EEW. Similar WebAPI and application for tsunami are being prepared using the pressure data recorded by dense offshore observation network (S-net), which is under construction along the Japan Trench.",

Impact craters are common, but have densities well below saturation levels over much of the surface, indicating an extended history of resurfacing. Charon's surface is cut by several sets of fractures, hundreds of kilometers long and up to several kilometers deep, and large regions have been resurfaced by plains material, which is cut by rille-like depressions and forms moats around several isolated mountains. Dark terrain centered on the north pole may be dominantly of exogenic origin but also shows evidence for control by underlying topography. Elsewhere, complex albedo patterns, often associated with impact craters, may offer clues about subsurface structure and composition. The implications of these features for the geological history of Charon will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The early Paleoproterozoic was an eventful period in the Earth’s history. The first portions of free oxygen emerged in the atmosphere, Snowball Earth glaciations happened several times and the first supercontinent broke up due to extensive rifting. These events should have affected the stable isotopic composition of the hydrosphere. In this study, we use rocks that were altered in underwater hydrothermal systems to investigate the stable isotopic composition of the hydrosphere 2.39-2.45 billion years ago (hereinafter, Ga). Extremely low-δ18O (down to -27.5‰ SMOW) rocks from 2.39 Ga metamorphosed subglacial hydrothermal systems of the Belomorian belt, Baltic Shield formed at near-equatorial latitudes suggesting a Snowball (or Slushball) Earth glaciation. These results motivated us to look at temporally and geographically close hydrothermal systems from the unmetamorhposed 2.45 Ga Vetreny Belt rift. The length of the rift is 250 km and it is composed of high-Mg basalts, mafic-ultramafic intrusions and sedimentary successions. We examined several localities of high-Mg basalt flows that include astonishingly fresh pillow lavas, often with preserved volcanic glass, eruptive breccias, and hydrothermal alteration zones. Collected samples serve a great textural evidence of water-rock interaction that occurred in situ while basalts were cooling. The preliminary results from coexisting quartz and epidote (T, D18O=311°C), and from coexisting calcite and quartz (T, D18O=190°C) yield values of δ18O of involved water between -1.6 and -0.9 ‰. The values of δ13C in calcites vary between -4.0 and -2.3 ‰. It is likely that hydrothermal fluids operated in the Vetreny Belt rift were derived from seawater that is no different from modern oceanic water in terms of δ18O. Apparently, the rift was a Paleoproterozoic analog of the modern Red Sea, filled with oceanic water. The result is important because the Vetreny Belt rift predates the onset of Snowball Earth glaciation at 2.4 Ga. The results of our studies can be used as an initial point for meteoric water distillation models of the Paleoproterozoic hydrosphere that was involved in the global Snowball Earth glaciations.",

The waves exhibited horizontal wavelengths of 40–60 km. On 13 May 2013, long concentric waves of $500 km wavelength were also seen west of India, far away ($1500 km) from their estimated center near Mahasen. Concentric gravity waves in the stratosphere were observed nearly simultaneously by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on the Aqua satellite.

            "abstract": "The B ring is Saturn's brightest and most opaque ring, but many of its fundamental parameters, including its total mass, are not well constrained. Elsewhere in the rings, the best mass density estimates come from spiral waves driven by mean-motion resonances with Saturn's various moons, but such waves have been hard to find in the B ring. We have developed a new wavelet-based technique, for combining data from multiple stellar occultations that allows us to isolate the density wave signals from other ring structures. This method has been applied to 5 density waves using 17 occultations of the star gamma Crucis observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft. Two of these waves (generated by the Janus 2:1 and Mimas 5:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances) are visible in individual occultation profiles, but the other three wave signatures ( associated with the Janus 3:2, Enceladus 3:1 and Pandora 3:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances ) are not visible in individual profiles and can only be detected in the combined dataset. Estimates of the ring's surface mass density derived from these five waves fall between 40 and 140 g/cm^2. Surprisingly, these mass density estimates show no obvious correlation with the ring's optical depth. Furthermore, these data indicate that the total mass of the B ring is probably between one-third and two-thirds the mass of Saturn's moon Mimas.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is the result of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, which records the aggregation of billions of individual decisions. While systemic and structural changes receive great attention for addressing climate change, the contribution that individual citizens can make is often overlooked, especially in developed countries where per-capita emissions are highest. Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We find that four widely applicable high-impact actions have the potential to reduce personal emissions by more than 1 tonne CO2-equivalent per year: having one fewer child (59.2 tonnes of reductions), living car-free (2.3 tonnes), avoiding airplane travel (1.5 tonnes per flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.82 tonnes). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like recycling (4 times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing lightbulbs (8 times). However, high school textbooks from Canada and government resources from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia largely fail to mention these actions, instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential impact. We conclude that climate policy should focus not only on national and international targets, but also on encouraging responsible behaviour, especially for adolescents who will grow up in the era of climate change and are poised to establish a lifelong pattern of sustainable lifestyle choices.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements are commonly used to obtain an estimate of the pore size distribution in a saturated material. The NMR relaxation time T2 is inversely proportional to the surface-area-to-volume (S/V) ratio of the pore space. An estimate of pore size is obtained by defining a geometrical parameter (α) linking pore radius to (S/V) -1. For example, for a spherical pore α =3; i.e. the radius is equal to 3(S/V)-1.\nCarbonate rocks have a complex pore structure, being composed of many different materials. In this study we assessed the use of NMR to differentiate between the water held in the pore space in micrite (carbonate mud) and in the pore space of micro-porous skeletal grains, two major constituents in carbonates. We expected to find significant differences in NMR T2 measurements on these two materials, given that the pore and particle size of the micrite is ~100 times smaller than that of the skeletal grains. However, we found that the T2 distributions for the two materials overlap. Measurements of porosity and measurements of surface area with a nitrogen BET method showed that S/V of the two materials is very similar. The skeletal grains have very high surface area due to surface roughness and micro-porosity. The geometric factor (α), relating (S/V) -1 to pore radius, was found to be two orders of magnitude larger for the skeletal grains than for micrite. We concluded that knowledge of the geometric value is needed in order to accurately estimate pore size from NMR T2 data.",

            "abstract": "Mexico City is facing a severe water shortage; current drought conditions in the city have led to an increase in the demand for groundwater, the pumping of which can cause significant land subsidence. In this study we explored what new information interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected by the TerraSAR-X satellite could bring to water resource managers in the city so that they can efficiently and sustainably allocate water resources.\nPrevious work done over Mexico City indicates that InSAR can be used to detect deformation due to groundwater pumping. Cabral-Cano et al. (2008) processed InSAR data acquired from ERS between 1996-2000 and from ENVISAT between 2003-2005. They compared the deformation map to geology maps of the region with information obtained by seismic methods. They found that a spatial correlation between the land deformation and the presence of young lacustrine clay beds, which indicate that the subsidence was caused by fluid pressure loss in the aquitard. They also concluded that the subsidence, for the most part, had no seasonal variation and continues to occur at near-constant, high rates.\nTerraSAR-­X satellite data is known to be more sensitive to small deformations than the data from satellites used in previous studies in the region because of its frequent revisit cycle, short wavelength, and accurate orbital information. For this project, we derived long sequences of crustal deformation time series from TerraSAR-­X data between May 2011 and December 2012 using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method. The resulting time series was then compared to GPS data for calibration and validation. We observed a long-term deformation that was similar to those found in previous studies. The next step in our work is to determine whether the increased sensitivity of the TerraSAR-­X data allows us to detect a seasonal deformation pattern over the study area.",

            "abstract": "Identification of source water and loss within northern watersheds is of significant importance due to multifaceted changes in physiography as a result of climate change within this region. Understanding the dominant processes is paramount to assess and anticipate the effects of these changes on the flow regime. Evapotranspiration loss has been identified as a primary component of the hydrologic cycle in northern Canadian watersheds and has high seasonal variability; however research within these remote watersheds is very limited. Coupled flow-isotope models have been used to improve process identification at the catchment scale, particularly using stable water isotopes which are affected by evaporation. Using a coupled flow-isotope model to temporally partition evapotranspiration, by exploiting the difference in fractionation of evaporation and transpiration, improved understanding of evapotranspiration in these watersheds is accomplished. Simulating the difference of evaporative fractionation of oxygen-18 and deuterium helps to constrain the output and reduce uncertainty. To assess the temporal evapotranspiration partition established by the coupled flow-isotope model, a dual isotope transit time model will be applied on a monthly time-step to compare using effective precipitation input. Results indicate that the partition of evapotranspiration follows a seasonal trend, consistent with the time of abscission in the watersheds and length of the growing season. Transpiration is the dominant portion of evapotranspiration during the growing season, however as temperatures decrease, vegetation retains moisture and the dominant partition changes to evaporation. Utilizing stable water isotopes has been shown to have good potential at identifying the partition with limited spatial and temporal data, however, assessment of model results against long term or higher spatial resolution data would further reduce uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "A dynamic initialization (DI) scheme for binary vortices (BVDI) is proposed to improve the initial conditions for the simulations of binary tropical cyclones (TCs) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. This BVDI scheme is based on a new hurricane/typhoon DI (HTDI) formulated for the single TC, which is a modification of the DI developed by Cha and Wang (2013) while further introduces the adjustment of initial vortex size and wet bogus vortex.\nTwo TC cases, i.e., Super Typhoon Saomai (2006) and Tropical Storm Bopha (2006) in Western North Pacific, have been selected as a sample of binary TCs to test the performance of different DI schemes. The adjustment of initial vortex scale in HTDI makes improvements to the evolution of intensity and structure of Saomai. Moreover, the introduced wet bogus vortex ensures the spinning-up of Bopha’s initial vortex. In addition, BVDI not only has the merits of HTDI, but also shows its advantage in reflecting the impact of the interaction on this pair of binary TCs within the initial condition. With that the tracks, intensities and structures as well as their evolutions (e.g. rapid intensification and concentric eyewall) of both Saomai and Bopha could be successfully captured comparing with the observations, which is advantage than other DI schemes. The results indicate that it is necessary to improve the representation of two TCs in the initial conditions and include their interactions in the binary TCs forecast.",

            "abstract": "Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of four deep sediment cores (≤ 20m depth), in conjunction with shallow vibracores (≤ 6m depth), obtained from mid-channel bars in the lower Columbia River (LCR), USA, provides new insights into the mid-Holocene to present geomorphic and coupled sedimentological evolution of the LCR fluvial-tidal zone. These data reveal that the relatively coarse-grained basal sediments of mid-channel bars positioned across the LCR tidal-fluvial hydraulic regime were deposited at c. 2.5 to 2.0 ka, and not at c. 8.0 ka as previously reported. Thus, these younger depositional ages of basal sediments relative to previous studies coupled with the overall sedimentary architecture of these bars, and the absence of a temporal lag in the timing of basal sedimentation between bars located from river kilometer 51.1 to 29.3, challenges existing models that these bars represent: (a) estuarine tidal-bars, or (b) bay-head deltaic deposits. Within the context of post glacial Holocene sea-level rise, our results suggest these bars represent vertical construction of a LCR fluvial top-set from c. 2.5- 2.0 ka to the present, as the regional rate of sea-level rise slowed to ≤ 1.4 mmyr-1. Within this geomorphic context, two tidal-fluvial sedimentological signatures can be identified: (i) in the downstream direction, basal bar deposits incorporate a larger percentage of finer-grained interbeds, and (ii) vertically stacked silt/very-fine sand draped current ripple cross-laminae become prevalent from approximately 5 m in depth to the bar surfaces. The preservation of finer-grained interbeds within basal bar deposits is reasoned to be caused by the flocculation and settling of suspended sediment enhanced by the turbidity maximum. The stacked draped current ripple cross-laminae are interpreted to result from tidal-currents generating asymmetric current ripples that were draped by fine-sediment entrained by wind-waves, which fell-out of suspension during reduced wave activity, slackwater intervals, and periods when the turbidity maximum was active.",

            "abstract": "Imaging probes, collecting data on particles from about 20 or 50 microns to several centimeters, are the probes that have been collecting data on the droplet and ice microphysics for more than 40 years. During that period, a number of problems associated with the measurements have been identified, including questions about the depth of field of particles within the probes’ sample volume, and ice shattering, among others, have been identified. Many different software packages have been developed to process and interpret the data, leading to differences in the particle size distributions and estimates of the extinction, ice water content and radar reflectivity obtained from the same data.\nGiven the numerous complications associated with imaging probe data, we have developed an optical array probe simulation package to explore the errors that can be expected with actual data. We simulate full particle size distributions with known properties, and then process the data with the same software that is used to process real-life data. We show that there are significant errors in the retrieved particle size distributions as well as derived parameters such as liquid/ice water content and total number concentration. Furthermore, the nature of these errors change as a function of the shape of the simulated size distribution and the physical and electronic characteristics of the instrument. We will introduce some methods to improve the retrieval of particle size distributions from real-life data.",

The purpose of DS study was to provide NASA with a mission roadmap for the subsequent 10 years together with the high priority science and societal questions that needed to be addressed. One of the missions recommended was The Hyperspectral and Infrared Imager (HyspIRI).\nThe HyspIRI mission includes a visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) scanner together with an onboard data processing/downlink system referred to as the Intelligent Payload Module (IPM). The TIR instrument will acquire data in 8 discrete spectral bands between 4 and 12 µm for each pixel, have a revisit of 5 days and a spatial resolution of 60 m. Both instruments will provide global observations over the land surface and surrounding shallow waters. Over the deeper oceans the data will be resampled to 1 km spatial resolution.\nThe HyspIRI-TIR instrument is a multispectral TIR scanner with 8 spectral bands. Seven of the eight bands are between 7.5 and 12 um and the remaining band is at 4 µm and designed specifically for the detection of hot targets. As part of the TIR risk reduction studies the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) supported the development of the Prototype HyspIRI Thermal Infrared Radiometer (PHyTIR) for engineering risk reduction. The PHyTIR instrument was developed to demonstrate that the HyspIRI-TIR hardware would perform correctly in a space environment. PHyTIR was a space-flight ready laboratory engineering model. In 2014 PHyTIR was selected for deployment to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on the Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission. ECOSTRESS will use 6 of the 8 available bands from PHyTIR. It will have a spatial resolution of ≤69 x ≤38 m and a revisit of 4 days for most of the contiguous United States.",

We found that the WUE was well positively linear correlated (r2=0.90) with the GEP both in the DS and FS. Due to our desert steppe was very sensitive to the precipitation, WUE was co-varied with the precipitation. WUE increased with the GEP increase under good water conditions, when the GEP reached its maximal value (DS: 3 g C m-2, FS: 2 g C m-2), the WUE was suppressed and kept a stable value during the peak growing season. Both GEP and WUE was near zero when the soil moisture was lower. We also found that the WUE was negatively correlated with ET. The WUE was higher in GS than that in FS. The mean seasonal WUE was 0.93 in GS and 0.54 g C kg-1 H2O in FS, with a peak monthly WUE of 1.32 in GS and 0.73 g C kg-1 H2O in FS, respectively. The difference between GS and FS mainly caused by that the ET was changed with the GEP during the entire growing season. This suggests the importance of both plant population dynamics and water statues should be considered in WUE studies.",

            "abstract": "Over 5 km of Neogene marine sedimentary strata are well exposed in the St. Elias Range along the coast of Alaska. Immediately offshore in the Gulf of Alaska, the cores from the IODP Expedition 341 document correlative strata but provide a better temporally constrained record of more distal marine depositional processes. Together the onshore and offshore sedimentary records contain a transition from proximal to distal marine environments and provide insight on tectonics and surface processes interactions across a glaciated convergent margin. In this ongoing study, we document changing tectonic and climatic signals using U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology, zircon fission track thermochronology, and sedimentary lithofacies. For example, upper Miocene proximal strata consist of mudstone and sandstone that contain hummocky stratification that we interpret as being deposited in marine shelf environments. U-Pb detrital zircon ages from this unit have dominant populations from 59-63 and 85-90 Ma. In the distal submarine fan record, the upper Miocene strata consist of bioturbated mud and coarse sand that we interpret as marine sedimentary gravity flows followed by longer periods of hemipelagic deposition. The detrital zircon ages from these strata have dominant age populations from 53-54 and 60-80 Ma. The similar detrital ages from both the upper Miocene proximal and distal environments requires a common sediment link across the entire convergent margin by this time and the start of tectonic uplift of the modern mountain range. The start of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 5.5 Ma in the proximal record is marked by submarine gravity flows interpreted to be reworked from alpine glacial deposits but to date there is no clear evidence of this climatic event in the distal record. The first clear record of glacial sediment input in the distal submarine fan environment is during the Plio-Pleistocene transition and recorded by ice-rafted muddy diamict beds.",

            "abstract": "Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt with a radius of approximately 470 km. It is large enough to attain a shape much closer to hydrostatic equilibrium than major asteroids. Pre-Dawn shape models of Ceres (e.g. Thomas et al., 2005; Carry et al., 2008) revealed that its shape is consistent with a hydrostatic ellipsoid. After the arrival of the Dawn spacecraft in Ceres orbit in March 2015, Framing Camera images were used to construct shape models of Ceres. Meanwhile, radio-tracking data are being used to develop gravity models. We use the Dawn-derived shape and gravity models to constrain Ceres’ internal structure. These data for the first time allow estimation of the degree to which Ceres is hydrostatic. Observed non-hydrostatic effects include a 2.1 km triaxiality (difference between the two equatorial axes) as well as an 660-m center-of-mass – center-of-figure offset. The Dawn gravity data from the Survey orbit shows that Ceres has a central density concentration. Second-degree sectorial gravity coefficients are negatively correlated with topography indicating a peculiar interior structure. We compute the relative crustal thickness based on the observed Bouguer anomaly. Hydrostatic models show that Ceres appears more differentiated based on its gravity than on its shape.\nWe expand the Ceres shape in spherical harmonics, observing that the power spectrum of topography deviates from the power law at low degrees (Fig. 1). We interpret the decrease of power at low degrees to be due to viscous relaxation. We suggest that relaxation happens on Ceres but, unlike modeled in Bland (2013), it is important only at the lowest degrees that correspond to scales of several hundreds of km. There are only a few features on Ceres of that size and at least one of them (an impact basin provisionally named Kerwan) appears relaxed. The simplest explanation is that Ceres’s outer shell is not pure ice or pure rock but an ice-rock mixture that allows some relaxation at the longest wavelengths. We use the deal.ii finite-element library (Bangerth 2007) to compute relaxed topography spectra. In out future work, we plan to model viscous relaxation to constrain the viscosity profile and thermal evolution.",

The 341 boreholes represent a cross-margin transect that sampled the continental shelf, slope, and deep sea Surveyor Fan of the Gulf of Alaska.\nOur dataset currently consists of ~ 650 detrital zircons selected for double dating method utilizing both detrital zircon fission track (FT) and U-Pb analysis from sand and diamict beds, as well as zircon U-Pb geochronology and apatite FT from igneous and gneissic clasts. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of sand records dominant peak ages of 53, 62, 70, and 98 Ma with minor populations of 117, 154, and 170 Ma. Most of these ages can be correlated to primary igneous sources in the Coast Plutonic Complex, the Chugach Metamorphic Complex, the plutonic rocks of Wrangellia, and the Sanak-Baranoff plutonic belt. All samples analyzed to date, covering a 10 Myr range, share nearly identical detrital zircon populations suggesting similar primary sediment sources and reworking of sediment in thrust belts and accretionary prisms along this convergent margin.\nPlutonic and gneissic clasts collected from the boreholes on the shelf have already been double dated. These clasts have general U-Pb zircon crystallization ages of 52-54 Ma and apatite fission track cooling ages of 10-12 Ma. These results, along with previous published studies, indicate that these clasts were derived from the Chugach Metamorphic Complex and were eroded and transported by the Bagley Ice Field and Bering Glacier. Future results using this approach should allow us to pinpoint which parts of the exhumed onshore ranges and which glacial systems provided sediment to marine environments in the Gulf of Alaska.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated the dynamics of Newtonian fluids with viscosities (10-1000 Pa s; corresponding to mafic to intermediate silicate melts) during slow decompression, in a Plexiglas shock tube. As an analogue fluid we used silicon oil saturated with Argon gas for 72 hours. Slow decompression, dropping from 10 MPa to ambient pressure, acts as the excitation mechanism, initiating several processes with their own distinct timescales. The evolution of this multi-timescale phenomenon generates complex non-stationary microseismic signals, which have been recorded with 7 high-dynamic piezoelectric sensors located along the conduit. Correlation analysis of these time series with the associated high-speed imaging enables characterization of distinct phases of the dynamics of these viscous fluids and the extraction of the time and the frequency characteristics of the individual processes. We have identified fluid-solid elastic interaction, degassing, fluid mass expansion and flow, bubble nucleation, growth, coalescence and collapse, foam building and vertical wagging. All these processes (in fine and coarse scales) are sequentially coupled in time, occur within specific pressure intervals, and exhibit a localized distribution in space. Their coexistence and interactions constitute the stress field and driving forces that determine the dynamics of the system. Our observations point to the great potential of this experimental approach in the understanding of volcanic processes and volcanic seismicity.",

            "abstract": "The environmental system consists of various physical, chemical, and biological processes, and environmental models are always built to simulate these processes and their interactions. For model building, improvement, and validation, it is necessary to identify important processes so that limited resources can be used to better characterize the processes. While global sensitivity analysis has been widely used to identify important processes, the process identification is always based on deterministic process conceptualization that uses a single model for representing a process. However, environmental systems are complex, and it happens often that a single process may be simulated by multiple alternative models. Ignoring the model uncertainty in process identification may lead to biased identification in that identified important processes may not be so in the real world. This study addresses this problem by developing a new method of global sensitivity analysis for process identification. The new method is based on the concept of Sobol sensitivity analysis and model averaging. Similar to the Sobol sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters, our new method evaluates variance change when a process is fixed at its different conceptualizations. The variance considers both parametric and model uncertainty using the method of model averaging. The method is demonstrated using a synthetic study of groundwater modeling that considers recharge process and parameterization process. Each process has two alternative models. Important processes of groundwater flow and transport are evaluated using our new method. The method is mathematically general, and can be applied to a wide range of environmental problems.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost affected soils contain 1,300 Pg organic carbon which is about twice the amount of the global vegetation. Most of this carbon (C) is locked in the perennially frozen ground (permafrost) and only a minor part is stored in the seasonal surface thaw layer (active layer). Rising arctic temperatures will cause deeper active layer thaw and permafrost degradation, which liberates additional soil organic matter (SOM) for microbial mineralization. After thaw, old permafrost C will be mixed with fresh organic matter from plant residues, e.g. by cryoturbation or leaching. Recent incubation studies have increased our understanding on how fast permafrost SOM may be mineralized to the greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). After initial maximum GHG production from labile SOM components (labile C pool) mineralization rates slow down since the remaining SOM is more recalcitrant (stable C pool). The current study investigates if this stabile C pool may be mobilized by fresh organic matter from recent vegetation (“priming effect”). Therefore, permafrost samples (14C ages 0.1 - 17 ka BP) from the Siberian tundra were spiked with a 13C-labeled sedge (Carex aquatilis) after the samples were pre-incubated for 4 years. The amount of C released from permafrost SOM was calculated from the δ13C-values of produced GHG using a mixing model. Under aerobic conditions, all samples showed an accelerated mineralization of SOM after the addition of C. aquatilis (positive priming). After 4 months, which is about one vegetation period, the measured CO2 production exceeded the estimated CO2 release without labile plant material by 60 ± 28%. Under anaerobic conditions, priming was more pronounced increasing CO2 production by 100 ± 67% and CH4 production by 33 ± 32%. The CO2/CH4 ratio increased from 0.9 before priming to 1.3 after priming. The total mineralization of SOM over 4 months was significantly higher under aerobic (14.2 ± 6.1 µmol CO2-C gdw-1) than under anaerobic conditions (5.8 ± 2.1 µmol CO2-C+CH4-C gdw-1). However, if considering the higher global warming potential of CH4, the anaerobic release of C expressed as CO2 equivalents (28.2 ± 11.5 µmol CO2-C equiv. gdw-1) was twice the aerobic release.",

            "abstract": "With the current changes observed in the Arctic, an increase in occurrence of rain-on-snow (ROS) events has been reported in the Arctic (land) over the past few decades. Several studies have established that strong linkages between surface temperatures and passive microwaves do exist, but the contribution of snow properties under winter extreme events such as rain-on-snow events (ROS) and associated ice layer formation need to be better understood that both have a significant impact on ecosystem processes. In particular, ice layer formation is known to affect the survival of ungulates by blocking their access to food. Given the current pronounced warming in northern regions, more frequent ROS can be expected. However, one of the main challenges in the study of ROS in northern regions is the lack of meteorological information and in-situ measurements. The retrieval of ROS occurrence in the Arctic using satellite remote sensing tools thus represents the most viable approach.\nHere, we present here results from 1) ROS occurrence formation in the Peary caribou habitat using an empirically developed ROS algorithm by our group based on the gradient ratio, 2) ice layer formation across the same area using a semi-empirical detection approach based on the polarization ratio spanning between 1978 and 2013. A detection threshold was adjusted given the platform used (SMMR, SSM/I and AMSR-E), and initial results suggest high-occurrence years as: 1981-1982, 1992-1993; 1994-1995; 1999-2000; 2001-2002; 2002-2003; 2003-2004; 2006-2007; 2007-2008.

Despite the model reasonably predicting the ground variation of the diurnal field for days away from quiet time (especially outside the period the CM4 data covers and the lack of active data in the original model dataset) as our results shows, it also reveals the inability of the external field description included in the model to sufficiently explain the rapid variations seen for days away from quiet time.\nIn trying to explain the behaviour of the rapid variations seen in our data for days away from quiet time, we investigate the use of the RC index as a better tool for describing the external field variations (instead of Dst). Our results showed that the residuals of the X component of our data include a strong component in rapid variations related to large scale external field variations arising from magnetospheric ring current. The comparison between the X component residuals of our observatory station data and that of the RC index showed good correlation and coherence, which is seen in the high cross-correlation coefficients between the X component of our observatory data residuals and the RC index globally. This shows the rapid variation signals for days away from quiet time to be large scale, and the RC index a better representation of rapid variations globally, for days away from quiet time.",

            "abstract": "Piton de la Fournaise, the youngest volcano of La Réunion Island, is renowned for being frequently active. Whereas the current activity is mainly located within the “Enclos Fouqué” caldera, ~100 strombolian cones lie on the volcano’s flanks, thought to date from ~300 years to a few thousand years. Our study focuses on these “adventive cones”, by studying bulk-rock major and trace element compositions, mineral phase compositions and olivine-hosted melt inclusions. The Piton de la Fournaise lavas (younger than ~450 ka) have been subdivided into three compositional groups (see attached figure, and Lénat et al. 2012). Almost all recent and historical lavas belong to two of these groups: “cotectic basalts” and “olivine-rich basalts”, marked by a constant CaO/Al2O3 ratio of ~0.8, and MgO content ranging from 5 to 30 wt % reflecting different degrees of olivine accumulation. The third group, called here “mid-alkaline basalts”, corresponds to compositions commonly encountered for the “adventive cones”. It mainly consists of magnesian basalts at 7.55 - 10.24 wt% MgO and CaO/Al2O3 values down to 0.55. At constant MgO content, this group shows higher alkali content and a relative deficiency in Ca compared to the historic basalts. The “adventive cones” lavas usually contain magnesian olivines (Fo > 86). Such crystals are not at the equilibrium with their host lava, raising thus the question of the recycling processes. According to Bureau et al. (1998; 1999), magnesian olivines come from deep storage levels. The specific geochemistry of the “adventive cones” lavas is attributed either to a high-pressure fractionation of a clinopyroxene-rich assemblage (Albarède et al. 1997), or to an assimilation process involving wehrlite-gabbro cumulates (e.g. Salaün et al. 2010). Our new data show that the source of these magmas is chemically homogeneous to that of current magmas. However, their ascent clearly bypasses the current lava reservoirs, especially the shallow magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "Studies the past decade have fundamentally changed our perspective on the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic configuration of Alaska. New concepts include: 1) A link exists between Mesozoic collisional zones, Cenozoic strike-slip fault systems, and active deformation that is related to lithospheric heterogeneities that remain over geologic timescales. The location of the active Denali fault and high topography, for example, is within a Mesozoic collisional zone. Rheological differences between juxtaposed crustal blocks and crustal thickening in this zone have had a significant influence on deformation and exhumation in south-central Alaska. In general, the original configuration of the collisional zone appears to set the boundary conditions for long-term and active deformation. 2) Subduction of a spreading ridge has significantly modified the convergent margin of southern Alaska. Paleocene-Eocene ridge subduction resulted in surface uplift, unconformity development and changes in deposystems in the forearc region, and magmatism that extended from the paleotrench to the retroarc region. 3) Oligocene to Recent shallow subduction of an oceanic plateau has markedly reconfigured the upper plate of the southern Alaska convergent margin. This ongoing process has prompted growth of some of the largest mountain ranges on Earth, exhumation of the forearc and backarc regions above the subducted slab, development of a regional gap in arc magmatism above the subducted slab as well as slab-edge magmatism, and displacement on the Denali fault system.\nIn the light of these new tectonic concepts for Alaska, we will discuss targets of opportunity for future integrated geologic and geophysical studies. These targets include regional strike-slip fault systems, the newly recognized Bering plate, and the role of spreading ridge and oceanic plateau subduction on the location and pace of exhumation, sedimentary basin development, and magmatism in the upper plate.",

The glacier is thinning by about 10 vertical meters per year when integrated over 45 km from the grounding zone to the terminus. Most of this mass loss is caused by ocean melting, but only a single vertical ocean profile taken in 2002 exists. The fjord was mostly free of sea ice in August when we visited in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2012 and noticed a small warming trend of bottom waters. During a 2-day survey of Petermann Fjord and adjacent Nares Strait in 2012 we documented a large intrusion of warmer Atlantic waters spilling over the 400 m deep sill and sinking to more than 800 m depth. These waters fill the deep basin of the fjord and move towards the grounding zone of glacier at 550 m below the sea surface.\nIn August 2015 the Swedish icebreaker I/B Oden is scheduled to enter Nares Strait and Petermann Fjord to support field work on land, on water, and on the floating glacier. We here report preliminary results from both ocean surveys and ice shelf moorings. The moored observations from under the ice shelf extend synoptic survey data from Oden. The ice shelf moorings are designed to resolve tidal to interannual variations of water properties under the floating glacier. More specifically, we plan to install a total 13 discrete sensors to measure ocean temperature, salinity, and pressure at five locations distributed both along and across the floating glacier. Hot water drilling provides the holes through the 200 to 500 m thick glacier ice to collect sediment cores, take a profile of temperature and salinity, and deploy two to five cabled sensors per mooring.\nIf successful, data from these cabled instruments will be distributed via surface Iridium connections and posted on the web in near real time. We will discuss successes and failures of this ambitious and high risk program that was facilitated by a bottom-up collaboration of British, Swedish, and US investigators and their respective funding agencies all working on very short and tense schedules.\nFigure: Sketch of mooring placement on a map (left panel) with 2014 flight tracks and glacier profiles (right panel) obtained from laser altimeter data along the tracks.",

We build and compare volumetric models from logs in two wells in the Barnett shale to those from lab measurements on core samples. Well 1 (location 1) has both a deviated and a horizontal part within the Lower Barnett while logs of Well 2 (location 2, 3 miles of location 1) are from its vertical/deviated part.\n Well 1 (deviated): Well 1 is a horizontal well logged in the producing Lower Barnett. Parts of the well less than 90 degrees in inclination are considered deviated. Effects of Calcite, Montmorillonite (Mont.), Illite and Quartz fractional volumes in addition to TOC and Kerogen weight fractions were investigated. Kerogen and TOC correlate negatively with Quartz (not co-locational in the model) and positively with porosity (Fig. 1). Water saturation correlates positively with Mont. and negatively with Kerogen and TOC.\nWell 1 (horizontal): Kerogen or TOC and Quartz anti-correlate. Porosity seems to decrease with Quartz but increase with Kerogen or TOC (Fig. 2). Water saturation decreases with Kerogen and increases with Mont.\nWell 2: For this well, there are no water saturation, Kerogen, TOC or resistivity measurements. Porosity here correlates positively with clay and negatively with Calcite. We used Schmoker’s method to calculate TOC from density logs. TOC correlates positively with porosity and clay content (Fig. 3 and 4).\nDiscussion: Organic matter seems to be a source of porosity in both locations in accordance with previous literature (Loucks et al., 2009; Curtis et al., 2010). Pores in location 1 are not water-filled, which we deduced from the negative correlation with water saturation. A model of rock from location 1 is in Fig. 5. In location 2, the calculated TOC correlates positively with porosity, as in the volumetric model in Fig. 6. Key positive correlations are clay-porosity and clay-TOC/Kerogen, in agreement with the findings of Sone and Zoback (2013a,b). An interesting result is the comparability between models created from well logs and models from direct lab measurements on rock samples. This provides confidence in using well logs for understanding generalized rock composition and linking macrostructure and microstructure.",

            "abstract": "The Lesser Antilles subduction zone is relatively seismically quiet, hasn’t produced M8+ earthquake since the 19th century and recent geodetic studies indicate that it is presently weakly coupled. However, the islands of the forearc are being uplifted since at least 330 ka, at rates of several tenths of m/ka, due to subduction processes. In order to understand the long-term deformation of the Caribbean margin in this subduction context, we aimed at characterizing and quantifying the along-dip and along-strike pattern of the deformation. Through carbonate platform morphology and stratigraphy studies and modeling, offshore the volcanic arc islands of Les Saintes and Martinique, we show that these reef platforms are composed of multi-superimposed sea-level highstand deposits separated by subaerial exposure surfaces formed during sea-level low stands. This stratigraphy is typical of drowning carbonate platforms and we estimated the subsidence rate of these platforms to be of few tenths of m/ka. By summarizing the previous studies, we picture the vertical deformation pattern along and across the Lesser Antilles arc for the MIS5 highstand deposit. We discuss the different potential processes capable of driving this deformation, such as crustal faulting, volcanism and subducting ridges that have only local effects on the deformation pattern. Finally, we examine the implications of our results for the megathrust. Long-term deformations in the Lesser Antilles, but also seismic cycle-induced deformations, challenge our understanding of the megathrust seismic behavior and indicate that the state of coupling of the megathrust is most probably transient over time in order to sustain these deformation.

            "abstract": "During disasters, effectively engaging the vast expertise of the academic community can help responders make timely and critical decisions. A barrier to such engagement, however, is the cultural gap between reward systems in academia and in the disaster response community. Responders often are focused on ending the emergency quickly with minimal damage. Academic scientists often need to produce peer reviewed publications to justify their use of time and money. Each community is used to speaking to different audiences, and delivering answers on their own time scales. One approach to bridge this divide is to foster a cohesive community of interdisciplinary disaster scientists: researchers who focus on crises that severely and negatively disrupt the environment or threaten human health, and are able to apply scientific methods in a timely manner to understand how to prevent, mitigate, respond to, or recover from such events.\nOnce organized, a disaster science community could develop its own unique culture. It is well known in the disaster response community that all the preparation that takes place before an event ever occurs is what truly makes the difference in reducing response time, improving coordination, and ultimately reducing impacts. In the same vein, disaster scientists would benefit from consistently interacting with the response community. The advantage of building a community for all disasters, rather than for just one type, is that it will help researchers maintain momentum between emergencies, which may be decades or more apart. Every disaster poses similar challenges: Knowing when to speak to the press and what to say; how to get rapid, actionable peer review; how to keep proprietary industry information confidential; how to develop “no regrets” actions; and how to communicate with decision makers and the public. During the Deepwater Horizonspill, I personally worked with members of the academic research community who cared not whether they got a peer reviewed publication out of their efforts: the spill was a crisis, and they felt it their duty to respond to the limits of their ability. And I worked with first responders who craved good scientific information for making decisions. By creating a community for disaster science, we might encourage and better reward such selfless service.",

The first of the pair of reports discusses the opportunities and challenges in carbon capture and long-term, safe sequestration. The second report discusses several approaches to reflecting sunlight to cool Earth, including the risks, time scales, costs, and socio-economic, and political considerations. The primary conclusion from these pair of reports is that mitigation and adaptation are still our best choices in terms of cost and low risk for reducing harmful effects from climate change: there is no \"silver bullet.\" Given that the polar regions of the planet are the most sensitive to climate change, the reports also touched on the potential for regional climate intervention.

            "abstract": "The discharge of anthropogenic nitrate (e.g., from partially treated sewage, return flows from agricultural irrigation, and runoff from animal feeding operations) to streams can negatively impact both human and ecosystem health. Managing these many point and non-point sources to achieve some specific end-point—for example, reducing the annual mass of nitrate exported from a watershed—can be a challenge, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas. Adding to this complexity is the fact that streams are not inert: they too can add or remove nitrate through assimilation (e.g., by stream-associated plants and animals) and microbially-mediated biogeochemical reactions that occur in streambed sediments (e.g., respiration, ammonification, nitrification, denitrification). By coupling a previously published correlation for in-stream processing of nitrate [Mulholland et al., Nature, 2008, 452, 202-205] with a stream network model of the Jacksons Creek watershed (Victoria, Australia) I demonstrate that managing anthropogenic sources of stream nitrate without consideration of in-stream processing can result in a number of non-intuitive “surprises”; for example, wastewater effluent discharges that increase nitrate loading but decrease in-stream nitrate concentrations can reduce the mass of nitrate exported from a watershed.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have been developed to model the ecophysiological characteristics of plant functional types in terrestrial ecosystems. They have frequently been used to answer questions pertaining to processes such as disturbance, plant succession, and community composition under historical and future climate scenarios. While DVMs have proved useful in these types of applications, it has often been questioned if additional detail, such as including plant dynamics at the species-level and/or including species-specific traits would make these models more accurate and/or broadly applicable. A sub-question associated with this issue is, ‘How many species, or what degree of functional diversity, should we incorporate to sustain ecosystem function in modeled ecosystems?’ Here, we focus on how the inclusion of additional plant species and trait information may strengthen dynamic vegetation modeling in applications pertaining to: (1) forage for caribou in northern Alaska, (2) above- and belowground carbon storage in the boreal forest and lake margin wetlands of interior Alaska, and (3) arctic tundra and boreal forest leaf phenology. While the inclusion of additional information generally proved valuable in these three applications, this additional detail depends on field data that may not always be available and may also result in increased computational complexity. Therefore, it is important to assess these possible limitations against the perceived need for additional plant species and trait information in the development and application of dynamic vegetation models.",

            "abstract": "Saturn has an intense and broad eastward equatorial jet at cloud level whose variability and meridional and vertical structure are complex and actively debated. Due to its 27º rotation axis tilt and orbital eccentricity, Saturn is under a strong seasonal insolation cycle, enhanced at equator by the ring shadowing periods. These factors make it a good natural laboratory to test models of equatorial jet generation in giant planets. We report on a bright equatorial storm observed in 2015 that moved rapidly but steadily at a high speed of 450 ms-1, not reported since Voyagers times (Sanchez-Lavega et al., Icarus 147, 405-420, 2000). Imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 showed detailed storm morphology at red wavelengths (689, 750 and 937 nm) confirming its high speed. Other equatorial clouds moved with velocities matching the Cassini ISS profile (García-Melendo et al., Icarus, 215, 62-74, 2011), while the storm matches the Voyager 1 and 2 profile. We interpret this result as the simultaneous detection of the wind profile at two separated altitude levels within the cloud layer. In addition, the HST methane band and ultraviolet images, allowed retrieving winds at a third altitude level of motion, in the haze layer above the cloud deck. Combining the current wind data with previous dates allowed us to construct a vertical – meridional section of the structure of Saturn’s equatorial jet at cloud level. We discuss the implications of these results on the long-term stability of Saturn’s equatorial jet.",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift System (EARS) is the archetypal active continental rift. The rift branches cut through the elevated Ethiopian and Kenyan domes and are accompanied by a >40 Myr volcanic record. This record is often used to understand changing mantle dynamics, but this approach is complicated by the diversity of spatio-temporally constrained, geochemically unique volcanic provinces. Various sources have been invoked to explain the geochemical variability across the EARS (e.g. mantle plume(s), both enriched and depleted mantle, metasomatized or pyroxenitic lithosphere, continental crust). Mantle contributions are often assessed assuming adiabatic melting of mostly peridotitic material due to extension or an upwelling thermal plume. However, metasomatized lithospheric mantle does not behave like fertile or depleted peridotite mantle, so this model must be modified. Metasomatic lithologies (e.g. pyroxenite) are unstable compared to neighboring peridotite and can founder into the underlying asthenosphere via ductile dripping. As such a drip descends, the easily fusible metasomatized lithospheric mantle heats conductively and melts at increasing T and P; the subsequent volcanic products in turn record this drip magmatism. We re-evaluated existing data of major mafic volcanic episodes throughout the EARS to investigate potential evidence for lithospheric drip foundering that may be an essential part of the rifting process. The data demonstrate clearly that lithospheric drip melting played an important role in pre-flood basalt volcanism in Turkana (>35 Ma), high-Ti “mantle plume-derived” flood basalts and picrites (HT2) from NW Ethiopia (~30 Ma), Miocene shield volcanism on the E Ethiopian Plateau and in Turkana (22-26 Ma), and Quaternary volcanism in Virunga (Western Rift) and Chyulu Hills (Eastern Rift). In contrast, there is no evidence for drip melting in “lithosphere-derived” flood basalts (LT) from NW Ethiopia, Miocene volcanism in S Ethiopia, or Quaternary within-rift lavas in Ethiopia, Turkana or Kivu. The evidence for widespread lithospheric removal across eastern Africa coincides with the timing of dome uplift (e.g. Gani et al., 2007; Wichura et al., 2015) and further demonstrates the controls of lithospheric mantle on volcano-tectonic processes throughout the evolving EARS.",

            "abstract": "Plant water storage (PWS) contributes to whole-plant transpiration (up to 50%), especially in large trees and during severe drought conditions. PWS also can impact water-carbon economy as well as the degree of resistance to drought. A 1-D porous media model is employed to accommodate transient water flow through the plant hydraulic system. This model provides a mechanistic representation of biophysical processes constraining water transport, accounting for plant hydraulic architecture and the nonlinear relation between stomatal aperture and leaf water potential when limited by soil water availability. Water transport within the vascular system from the stem base to the leaf-lamina is modeled using Richards’s equation, parameterized with the hydraulic properties of the plant tissues. For simplicity, the conducting flow in the radial direction is not considered here and the capacitance at the leaf-lamina is assumed to be independent of leaf water potential. The water mass balance in the leaf lamina sets the upper boundary condition for the flow system, which links the leaf-level transpiration to the leaf water potential. Thus, the leaf-level gas exchange can be impacted by soil water availability through the water potential gradient from the leaf lamina to the soil, and vice versa. The root water uptake is modeled by a multi-layered macroscopic scheme to account for possible hydraulic redistribution (HR) in certain conditions. The main findings from the model calculations are that (1) HR can be diminished by the residual water potential gradient from roots to leaves at night due to aboveground capacitance, tree height, nocturnal transpiration or the combination of the three. The degree of reduction depends on the magnitude of residual water potential gradient; (2) nocturnal refilling to PWS elevates the leaf water potential that subsequently delays the onset of drought stress at the leaf; (3) Lifting water into the PWS instead of HR can be an advantageous strategy for overstory species especially when drought progresses in the presence of competing understory species.",

            "abstract": "Diffusive transport is an important mechanism of mass transfer in gas or liquid phases in porous media. The continuous presence of solids in porous media causes the diffusion paths to deviate from straight lines, and this behavior is descried as the tortuosity of porous media. In this contribution, the porosity-tortuosity relations were studied using a random walk particle tracking (RWPT) code for three-dimensional complex porous medium geometries. The RWPT code was massively parallelized and has been tested on Titan (Cray XK7) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and on Mira (IBM Blue Gene/Q) at the Argonne National Laboratory with up to 16,384 cores. The porous medium geometries were synthetically created based on Voronoi tessellations, and include homogeneous fibrous/tubular/granular geometries as well as heterogeneous (vuggy) tubular/granular geometries. Simulation results show that the homogenous granular geometry is the least tortuous, the homogeneous tubular geometry is intermediately tortuous, and the homogeneous fibrous geometry is the most tortuous. For homogeneous granular and tubular geometries, as porosity increases, the difference between the tortuosity of tubular geometry and that of granular geometry decreases. The vuggy porosity increases the tortuosity, due to the fact that mass “particles” trapped in a vug cannot exit the vug except along specific directions where the vug has narrow openings. The size of vugs relative to the size of inter-vug pores also affects tortuosity: the larger the vug size relative to the inter-vug pores, the higher the tortuosity, because in smaller vugs (with the same vuggy porosity and total porosity) the chance is higher for mass “particles” to diffuse into the exiting cylindrical pores. To test the effect of vuggy porosity and tortuosity on permeability, three vuggy geometries were set up with the same vuggy porosity, but different vug sizes. It is found, interestingly, that they have the same dimensionless permeability ks2, where s is the specific surface area of the medium. Although larger vugs increase the tortuosity of the medium, they also reduce the specific surface area and therefore the skin friction. The effects of tortuosity and specific surface area therefore cancelled out.",

            "abstract": "The depth of faulting and its temporal evolution are important for understanding fault physics and seismic hazard. The seismicity cut-off depth (Dseis) and (interseismic) fault locking depth estimated geodetically (Dgeod) give independent constraints on the locked-creeping (LC) transition on faults. How the two are related to each other and to the depth extent Drupt of large earthquake ruptures is still poorly understood.\nWe explore the relation between Dseis, Dgeod and Drupt in fault models governed by rate-and-state friction and enhanced dynamic weakening. We find that: (i) transition from locked zones (e.g., creeping rates < 0.1 Vpl) to zones creeping with near-plate rates (> 0.9 Vpl) occurs over a certain depth range, which can be significant; (ii) Dseis is predominantly affected by the location and amplitude of the stress concentration front (SCF) near the top of the LC transition, while Dgeod depends on the spatial distribution of fault slip rates; (iii) Dseis either stays in place or becomes shallower due to the up-dip migration of the SCF, while Dgeod tends to deepen as the stress shadowing region expands throughout the interseismic period; and (iv) Drupt and Dseis can differ due to deep seismic slip below the seismogenic zone, while the discrepancy between Dgeod and Drupt depends on the extent and amplitude of postseismic slip. Therefore, Dseis and Dgeod reflect different aspects of fault behavior and could diverge, especially in cases of deeper penetration of earthquakes and/or significant afterslip. Assuming Dgeod equal to Dseis could lead to an underestimation of fault slip rates and a discrepancy with geological estimates.\nOur current work is directed towards (a) establishing whether Dgeod could constrain the maximum depth extent of Drupt, as suggested by our simulations so far, and (b) exploring how the presence of the realistic LC transition affects interpretation of the inferred Dgeod and Dseis based on simplified models.",

            "abstract": "Flat slab subduction comprises only ~10% of the present-day subduction systems. We systematically explore flat-slab subduction and over-riding plate deformation due to previously recognized factors (including a weak mantle wedge, a buoyant oceanic plateau/ridge, slab-age, presence of thick cratonic upper plate), as well as additional factors not considered before (transient plate-velocity variations, and the presence of stagnant slabs at the mantle transition zone). We use a visco-elasto-plastic code, SULEC (Buiter & Ellis, 2012), restrict ourselves to 2D models, and ignore phase transformations. We model a 6000 km by 1500 km domain with 1-10 km variable grid spacing using up-to-date laboratory-derived constitutive laws, and explore the effects of: (a) lateral/vertical structure of the crust and lithosphere (e.g., continental lithosphere with/without a craton; oceanic lithosphere with thickness governed by plate cooling, and a harzburgite layer); (b) a true free upper-surface to predict surface topography; and (c) only far-field (boundary) velocities driving plates, with trench-velocity depending on over-riding plate deformation and slab pull.\nAs in previous studies, we find that positive trench-retreat velocity and weak integrated slab-strength (as measured by differential stress) are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for flat-slab subduction. While mantle-wedge suction associated with the presence of a craton does promote flat slab subduction, models without a craton also produce flat-slabs when (a) trench-retreat velocities are large and (b) either the slab is positively (structurally or thermally) buoyant or there is an underlying slab at the mantle transition zone. In our models, the duration of flat slab subduction depends on overall slab buoyancy. Younger oceanic lithosphere, esp. if it contains a plateau/ridge, provides a longer-lasting flat-slab (~ 10 Myr or longer, e.g., central Mexico), while older slabs with oceanic ridge/plateau (e.g., Peru) flatten for only a few Myr except in the presence of dynamic support from the transition zone (previously subducted slabs or a high viscosity contrast). Finally, the age of the subducting plate and its overall buoyancy seem to determine the deformation style within the over-riding plate.",

Some of the most widely used methods for reconstructing terrestrial temperatures are derived from floral characteristics, but these methods often disagree when applied to the same floral assemblages. Because floral assemblages are often preserved in carbonate-bearing lacustrine sediments, new methods like clumped isotope (Δ47) thermometry can provide an independent comparison for resolving discrepancies in paleotemperature estimates while using the same sampled materials. Here we sampled carbonates for clumped isotope (Δ47) analysis in 15 extensively studied Cenozoic paleo-floral assemblages from across the western United States, and used the results in combination with floral estimates to help resolve mean annual temperatures (MAT) for these sites in the past. Applying this paired method allows for the revision of MAT estimates from important floras such as the Florissant (~18°C) and Creede (~9°C) assemblages of the northern Colorado Plateau (Colorado, USA). These revised temperatures, in addition to new traditional stable isotope data (δ18O), suggest a more gradual uplift history for the region, which may have important implications for the overall development of the plateau and for the dynamics of the paleo-Colorado River drainage.",

            "abstract": "During the main phase of storms, the relativistic electron flux in the radiation belt can drop by orders of magnitude on timescales of a few hours. Where do the electrons go? This is one of the most important outstanding questions in radiation belt studies. Radiation belt electrons can be lost either by transport across the magnetopause into interplanetary space or by precipitation into the atmosphere. In this work we first conduct a survey of the MeV electron dropouts using the Van Allen Probes data in conjunction with the low-altitude measurements of precipitating electrons by 6 NOAA/POES satellites. The dropout events are categorized into three types: precipitation-loss dominant, outward radial diffusion dominant, or with contributions from both mechanisms. The survey results suggest the relative importance of precipitation and outward radial diffusion to the fast dropouts of radiation belt electrons, and their extent in L-shell and electron energy. Then, for specific events identified as dominated by precipitation loss, we use the Drift-Diffusion model, which includes the effects of azimuthal drift and pitch angle diffusion, to simulate both the electron dropout observed by Van Allen Probes and the distributions of drift-loss-cone electrons observed by multiple low-earth-orbit satellites (6 POES and the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment). The model quantifies the electron precipitation loss and pitch angle diffusion coefficient, Dxx, with high temporal and spatial resolution. Finally, by comparing the Dxx derived from the model with those estimated from the quasi-linear theory using wave data from Van Allen Probes and other event-specific wave models, we are able to test the validity of quasi-linear theory and seek direct evidence of the wave-particle interactions during the dropouts.",

            "abstract": "Much of the Franciscan subduction complex is made up of mélanges, is poorly exposed, or both, making it difficult to extract structural data and information on its response to subduction and exhumation. The Eastern Belt of the Franciscan, however, contains coherent thrust sheets that contain a detailed record of the regional deformation history. The South Fork Mountain Schist is a 6km thick body of blueschist facies pelitic and mafic schist that forms the easternmost of the coherent thrust sheets, lying adjacent to the Coast Range Fault, which separates the Franciscan from the Great Valley sequence. As such, it has potentially preserved the history of motion along the Coast Range Fault, both when it was a megathrust plate boundary and when it was reactivated as a normal fault.\nThomes Creek, east of Paskenta in the northern California Coast Ranges, runs roughly perpendicular to the strike of the Coast Range Fault and the South Fork Mountain Schist. The excellent exposure in the creek bed is ideal for constructing a structural cross section. At least three episodes of deformation can be identified, which produced overturned and asymmetric folds. The earliest fabric discernible in the field is a strongly differentiated crenulation cleavage, produced mainly by dissolution-precipitation creep, containing syn-kinematic lawsonite and sodic amphibole. This fabric is likely to reflect very high strain associated with the subduction zone megathrust. Foliation dips vary from south east to north east, with east dipping foliation being the most common. The vergence of asymmetric minor folds affecting this foliation is opposite on opposite limbs of larger scale folds, allowing the identification of fold structures on the scale of hundreds of meters amplitude. These phases of folding are likely to represent the history of underplating and exhumation of the schist body.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful means of measuring river depths, but standard algorithms such as Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA) require field measurements to calibrate image-derived estimates. Such reliance upon field-based calibration undermines the advantages of remote sensing. This study introduces an alternative approach based on the probability distribution of depths\nd\nwithin a reach. Provided a quantity\nX\nrelated to\nd\ncan be derived from a remotely sensed data set, image-to-depth quantile transformation (IDQT) infers depths throughout the image by linking the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of\nX\nto that of\nd\n. The algorithm involves determining, for each pixel in the image, the CDF value for that particular value of\nX/\nX\n¯\nand then inferring the depth at that location from the inverse CDF of the scaled depths\nd/\nd\n¯\n, where the overbar denotes a reach mean. For\nX/\nX\n¯\n, an empirical CDF can be derived directly from pixel values or a probability distribution fitted. Similarly, the CDF of\nd/\nd\n¯\ncan be obtained from field data or from a theoretical model of the frequency distribution of\nd\nwithin a reach; gamma distributions have been used for this purpose. In essence, the probability distributions calibrate\nX\nto\nd\nwhile the image provides the spatial distribution of depths. IDQT offers a number of advantages: 1) direct field measurements of\nd\nduring image acquisition are not absolutely necessary; 2) because the\nX\nvs.\\\nd\nrelation need not be linear, negative depth estimates along channel margins and shallow bias in pools are avoided; and 3) because individual pixels are not linked to specific depth measurements, accurate geo-referencing of field and image data sets is not critical. Application of OBRA and IDQT to a gravel-bed river indicated that the new, probabilistic algorithm was as accurate as the standard, regression-based approach and lead to more hydraulically reasonable bathymetric maps.",

            "abstract": "Although the conventional theory of plate tectonics can explain non-rigid behaviour at plate boundaries, it cannot adequately explain the processes involved in deformation and seismicity within plate interiors. Here, we consider that the pre-existing deformation or \"scarring\" within the mantle lithosphere may have a very long lived presence that could incorporate deformation of the plate interior and plate boundary. Mantle lithosphere scars from continent-continent collisions could generate virtual plate boundaries that remain over long timescales, producing \"perennial\" plate tectonics. Local geophysical studies can map the crustal environment well, and global whole mantle tomography models are rapidly improving, yet high-resolution images of the mantle lithosphere are often not available in regions where scarring may be present. Where mantle lithosphere heterogeneities have been observed (usually interpreted simply as subduction scars), the same attention has not been afforded to them as, for example, re-activation of faults within the Earth's crust. In idealized numerical simulations, we compare how relic scarring at varying depths in the lithosphere affects patterns of deformation. High-resolution thermal-mechanical numerical experiments explore continental lithospheric deformation featuring a weakened crust and mantle lithosphere scars. Our models show that deep lithospheric scars can control the tectonic evolution of a region over shallow geological features, indicating the importance of mantle lithosphere heterogeneities. The Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF) in central China is an example of an ancient continental collision zone that undergoes periodic deformation during times of regional compression. We suggest that the ATF may be a locale where a long-lasting mantle lithosphere scar can control the subsequent crustal evolution and deformation, with ancient plate boundaries having a \"perennial\" plate tectonic presence.",

            "abstract": "Early Pliocene deposits in the western Salton Trough preserve a high-fidelity record of sediment dispersal into the marine realm during initiation and early evolution of the Colorado River (CR). Grain-size fractionation, sediment routing, and transport dynamics of the early CR delta are recorded in sediments of the Fish Creek - Vallecito basin, which was located ~100 km south of Yuma along the transform plate boundary at 5 Ma. Early Pliocene delivery of CR sand to the basin took place in two distinct pulses: (1) deposition of sandy turbidites (Wind Caves Mbr of the Latrania Fm) in a restricted submarine canyon at Split Mt Gorge between ~5.3 and 5.1 Ma; and (2) progradation of a thick, widespread, coarsening-up deltaic sequence of marine mudstone, sandstone, and coquinas (Deguynos Fm) between ~4.8 and 4.2 Ma. Estimated flux of CR sediment during Wind Caves deposition was weak (~3-5 Mt/yr) compared to the long-term average (172±64 Mt/yr). The two pulses of CR sand input are separated by the Coyote Clay (CC, ~5.1-4.8 Ma), a regionally correlable, greenish-yellow-weathering marine claystone unit at the base of the Deguynos Fm. CC gradationally overlies Wind Caves turbidites in the area of the paleocanyon. In contrast, in the Coyote Mts 15-23 km to the south and SE, CC rests on coarse-grained locally-derived late Miocene sedimentary rocks, Alverson volcanics, and metamorphic basement rock along a regional unconformity. Identical claystone facies occur in the NW Indio Hills (restores to Yuma at the mouth of the CR at 5 Ma), and Sierra Cucapa in Mexico (~200 km south of Yuma at 5 Ma). Marine localities outside of the Wind Caves paleocanyon experienced slow to negligible sedimentation along a rugged rocky shoreline until abrupt arrival of CR-derived clay. CC accumulated in a sand-starved, pro-delta marine setting (Winker, 1987) over an inferred N-S distance of ~200 km. We therefore reject an alternate hypothesis that CC accumulated on the muddy slope of the prograding CR delta (Cloos, 2014). The CC records a pronounced 200-300 Kyr hiatus in delivery of sand from the CR to the basin at ca. 5 Ma that requires a regional explanation. The hiatus could have been caused by (1) global sea-level rise, (2) accelerated basin subsidence, or (3) tectonic damming and ponding of the lower CR by fault-related bedrock uplift in the Chocolate Mts.",

The 8-year (2007-2014) data of the temperature and IWC are used to extract the 5-day planetary waves (PWs) with zonal wavenumbers ranging from -1 to -3 (eastward propagating mode, E1-E3), 0 (stationary mode, W0), and 1 to 3 (westward propagating mode, W1-W3) in the polar stratosphere and mesosphere. The 5-day PWs in temperature are stronger in the polar winter stratosphere and mesosphere and exhibit substantial inter-hemispheric asymmetry. The date-height distributions of the 5-day waves coincide with those of the eastward jet in each hemisphere. This indicates that the 5-day PWs might be generated from barotropic/baroclinic instability in the polar stratosphere. The relative strengths of 5-day PWs decrease with increasing wavenumbers. The E1 (W1) 5-day PW is stronger than any other mode in the winter stratosphere and lower mesosphere (summer upper mesosphere). SOFIE temperature and IWC data are derived from simultaneous measurements in the same air column and thus provide a good opportunity to study the phase relationship between the 5-day PWs in temperature and IWC. Our analyses show that the phase shifts of W1 5-day PW in temperature relative to that in IWC have a mean of -2.0 h (0.3 h) with a standard deviation of 3.8 h (4.2 h) in the northern (southern) polar region. This indicates that the formation of the W1 5-day PW in PMCs is controlled mainly by the W1 5-day PW in temperature and influenced by other factors and is consistent with previous studies.",

Organic matter (OM) can play an important role in mediating a range of biogeochemical processes controlling diffuse pollution in streams and at their interface with surrounding land in the riparian and hyporheic zones. Thus, a holistic and simultaneous monitoring of N, P and OM fractions can help to improve our understanding of biogeochemical functioning of agricultural streams. In this study we build on intensive in situ monitoring of diffuse pollution in a small agricultural groundwater-fed stream in NW England carried out since 2009. We examine the variation in baseflow macronutrient and organic matter concentrations determined by automatic in situ (wet chemistry analyser, UV-Vis and fluorescence sensors) and automated grab sampling without instantaneous analysis using autosamplers. We evaluate and compare the performance of the automatic sampling techniques and their ability to capture typically low baseflow concentrations of highly reactive forms of nutrients and organic matter: total reactive phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen and tryptophan-like fluorescence which is an autochthonous fraction of OM. In particular, we examine the temperature effects on in situ automatic nutrient and organic matter determinations and autosampler storage effects for hourly samples retrieved daily for laboratory analyses. Understanding transformations and measurement variability in reactive forms of nutrients and organic matter associated with in situ analysis is of great importance for establishing robust monitoring protocols and creating future monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "The NW Bohemia/Vogtland region is characterized by currently ongoing geodynamic processes within the intracontinental lithospheric mantle. Among others, this activity results in the occurrence of mid-crustal earthquake swarms as well as CO2 degassing zones, called mofettes. These two natural phenomena are related to each other since it is considered that fluid flow and fluid-induced effective stress trigger earthquake swarms. At the Earth’s surface they appear spatially separated, but their connection could be explained by the existence of pathways within the crust that allow efficient and permanent fluid transport. However, neither structure nor position of such pathways has so far been imaged.\nWith this background we applied the Matched Field Processing (MFP) analysis within the NW Bohemia/Vogtland region to locate mofettes and investigate their characteristics. Considering the CO2 degassing process as high frequency noise source, we chose two different test sites: the Dolní Částkov Borehole, which is an artificial mofette that we used to validate the method’s functionality, and the South Hartoušov Mofette, a natural CO2 degassing field. On both sites, we measured seismic noise in continuous mode over several hours (7-9 hours) with a sampling frequency of 250 samples per second in multiple campaigns using an array of approximately 30 randomly distributed stations. Each array covered an area of about 60 x 60 m2 and consisted of vertical geophones (4.5 Hz) connected to Reftek Texans.\nFor the MFP computation the phase velocity of the study area is required, which we obtained from active seismic experiments with hammer blows as source. For Dolní Částkov the phase velocity varies between 200-420 m/s; and in South Hartoušov between 100-280 m/s, both in a frequency interval of 10-60 Hz.\nWith the MFP analysis at the artificial mofette in Dolní Částkov we could relocate the noise source successfully and hence, the method’s functionality was confirmed. In the South Hartoušov mofette field, we detected one dominant noise source, probably a fluid pathway, as well as small MFP maxima at the surface that can be related to dry mofettes.",

This parameterization has been implemented into NCAR CCSM4 to quantify the impacts of reflection and shading of shortwave radiation on climate simulation. The sensitivity experiment is carried out using CCSM4 with prescribed sea surface temperature of Year 2000. The results show that the 3-D radiation-topography interaction could enhance monsoon precipitation along the Himalayas due to the additional shortwave radiative heating at the southern slope of the Himalayas, which also causes strengthened and eastward-extended South Asian High. However, the precipitation is reduced over the Bay of Bengal, probably associated with the weakened Somali Jet. In winter, the additional radiative heating in the Himalayas increases the snowmelt rates, leading to decreases in snow depth and snow cover over the southern Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Using the Spinning Enhanced Visual and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on-board Meteosat’s second generation satellite (MSG), mineral dust emissions from the Middle East were observed at a high temporal and spatial resolution between the years 2006 and 2013. This research provides a subjective derivation of mineral dust source locations in the Middle East using the thermal infrared Dust RGB product. Focusing on the brightness temperature difference around 10.8 µm channel and their spectral contrast with clear sky conditions, the Dust RGB product has been recognised as a major asset in detecting dust. While the product has already been used to map dust emissions in Sahara and south Africa, this research is the first to map dust emissions in the Middle East using SEVIRI, one of the dustiest regions in the world second only to the Sahara Desert. For every dust storm activation within the Middle East, the point of first emission is derived from visual inspection of each 15 minute image, these points were then recorded in a dust source climatology (DSC) database, along with time and direction of dust movement. To take account of potential errors inherent in this subjective detection method, a degree of confidence is associated with each data point with relevance to time of day (which has a strong effect on ability to detect dust in these products) and weather conditions, in particular presence of clouds. These results are compared with an automated retrieval using Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements form the Moderate Resolution Image Spectrometer (MODIS); which, due to its sun-synchronous orbit allows a measurement of dust in the atmosphere once a day. Differences in the spatial distribution of SEVIRI dust sources and MODIS inferred dust source regions can be explained by inherent transport bias in the latter’s low sampling rate and prevailing wind conditions. This database will provide an important tool in further understanding dust emission processes in the region, laying the foundations for future studies relating to climatic conditions, especially droughts, and changes in land cover.",

            "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REEs) have been used as powerful tracers in the study of hot fluid-rock reaction in hydrothermal system. However, the behavior of the REEs during interaction of hydrothermal solution with rocks remains to be clarified more quantitatively. The Okinawa Trough (OT), located in the East Asian continental margin, is characterized by thick terrigenous sediment and ubiquitous volcanic-hydrothermal activities. In this study, the sediments collected during IODP Expedition 331 to the mid-OT were determined for mineralogical and REEs as well as Nd isotopic compositions, aiming to investigate the geochemical behavior of REEs during hydrothermal processes. All samples were separated into bulk and clay-size (˂ 2 μm) fractions and pretreated by 1N HCl to remove carbonate and other unstable components. The hydrothermal sediments in the mid-OT is dominated by Mg-rich chlorite based on the XRD analysis, especially the clay-size fraction comprising pure chlorite. The clay-size samples bear different mineralogical and geochemical compositions between the upper and lower parts in this hydrothermal area. All hydrothermal samples are relatively enriched in HREEs in the residues. The upper clays have higher values of δEu and (La/Yb)N as well as LREEs concentration than the lower part, while the bulk samples have weak REE differentiation. In the 1N HCl leachates, the concentrations of REEs in the bulk samples are higher than in the clays in the lower part but LREEs are obviously enriched in the upper clays. We infer that the grain size may be an important factor controlling the behavior of REEs in the mid-OT hydrothermal system. Both bulk and clay samples show negative Eu anomalies relative to chondrite, similar as the detrital sediments and volcanic rocks. This study confirms the hypothesis that HREEs patterns are constant throughout the system compatible with higher LREEs mobility as chlorine ion complexes in acidic solutions (Mills and Elderfield 1995; Douville et al. 1999). The Nd isotopic compositions (143Nd/144Nd and ɛNd) reveal the origin of hydrothermal fluids with the values close to hosted rocks. Our study also suggests variable REEs compositions of hydrothermal deposits between the sediment-covered OT and sediment-starved mid-Ocean Ridge, diagnostic of their different geological settings and origins.",

            "abstract": "The most important oceanic source of atmospheric CO2 is the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), where carbon fixation by siliceous phytoplankton is limited nowadays by low silicic acid and iron availability. Several studies propose that the biological carbon pump in the EEP operated more efficiently under glacial conditions due to relaxed nutrient limitation, which has been explained by enhanced Southern Ocean nutrient delivery into the low latitudes. Recent studies, however, suggest a greater glacial “trapping” of nutrients in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean. Thus, the reason for a relaxed nutrient limitation in the EEP remains enigmatic. Here we reconstruct the mid-depth ventilation history of the subarctic Pacific by using the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of epibenthic foraminifera Cibicides lobatulus from western Bering Sea core SO201-2-101KL (58°52.52’N, 170°41.45’E; 630 m water depth). We compare the reconstructed intermediate water characteristics of the subarctic Pacific to thermocline water masses upwelled in the EEP derived from δ13C of deep-dwelling planktic foraminifera Globorotaloides hexagonus at ODP Site 1240 (00°01.31’N, 82°27.76’W; 2921 m water depth) to trace glacial changes in thermocline nutrient availability and export productivity in the EEP. We found that foraminiferal δ13C proxy records from the subarctic Pacific and EEP show concomitant changes in nutrient- and ventilation dynamics under full glacial conditions. We propose that these changes are linked to Glacial North Pacific Intermediate Water. Enhanced injection of relatively nutrient-replete GNPIW into low-latitude thermocline waters coincides with times of relaxed nutrient limitation in the glacial EEP. We conclude that our results might help to explain a stimulated biological carbon pump in the EEP, which may have contributed to the glacial atmospheric CO2 drawdown.",

The aim of this work was to use recently developed D:L-amino acid racemization model for studying the turnover times of microbial biomass and microbial necromass in a ~12,000 years old Greenland shelf marine sediment samples. Sediments were analyzed for total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA), the bacterial endospore marker dipicolinic acid (DPA), and amino acid enantiomers of aspartic acid. The percentage amino acid carbon content (%TAAC) and the percentage amino acid nitrogen content (%TAAN) were used for determining the degradation state of the organic matter. Endospores quantified using DPA quantification method were found to be as abundant as vegetative cells. The microbial necromass turnover times were thousand years, and biomass turnover times were in the range of tens to hundred years. Studies with deeper sediment cores will further improve our understanding of the energetic limits of life in the deep biosphere.",

            "abstract": "Into the seafloor, a radical decline in nutrient and energy availability poses strong metabolic demands to any residing life. However, a sedimentary microbial ecosystem seems to maintain itself close to what we understand to be the energetic limit of life. Since a complex sediment matrix is interfering with the analysis of whole cells and sub-cellular compounds such as cell wall and membrane molecules, little is known about the physiological properties of cells in the deep biosphere. Here we focus on the size and carbon content of cells from a 90-m sediment drill core retrieved in October 2013 at Landsort Deep, Baltic Sea, in 437 meters water depth. To determine their shape and volume, cells were separated from the sediment matrix by multi-layer density centrifugation and visualized via fluorescence microscopy (FM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED). Total cell-carbon was calculated from amino acid-carbon, which was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography after cells had additionally been purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Cell-carbon turnover times were estimated using an amino acid racemization model that is based on the built-in molecular clock of aspartic acid, which due to racemization alternates between the D- and L-isomeric configurations over timescales of thousands of years at low in-situ temperatures (≈4˚C). We find that the majority of microbial cells in the sediment have coccoid or rod-shaped morphology, and that absolute values for cell volume are strongly dependent on the method used, spanning three orders of magnitude from approximately 0.001 to 1 µm3 for both coccoid and rod-shaped cells. From the surface to the deepest sample measured (≈60 mbsf), cell volume decreases by an order of magnitude, and carbon content is in the lower range (<20 fg C cell-1) of what has been reported in the literature as conversion factors. Cell-carbon is turned over approximately every 50-600 years, and total carbon oxidation rates decrease from ≈3400 to <60 nmol cm-3 yr-1 with depth, as inferred from amino acid racemization modeling. Given the large extent of marine sediments on Earth, our data will shed light on the energetic limits of life on our planet and will be important for estimating global biomass budgets.",

Detailed knowledge of sources of dust, atmospheric pathways, timing and geography of deposition is of crucial importance. This paper focuses on two aspects of desert dust over Central Asia: (i) seasonal and spatial patterns of aerosol optical depth (AOD) of desert dust and (ii) location and seasonal trends in activity of dust sources. Seasonal and spatial distribution of AOD is investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue AOD product, acquired over a period of 12 years from January 2003 to December 2014 at 10 km resolution. More detailed maps of dust sources are produced from higher resolution (1km) MODIS dust enhancement products (DEP) which have been modified by the use of additional bands and change in parameterization. The combined use of AOD and DEP enabled us to identify large scale dust emitting areas (through the use of AOD data) and within these areas, identify smaller-scale eroding points (using DEP) thus significantly improving the knowledge of both dust source location and dust entrainment mechanisms including rapid desertification (e.g. Aral Sea) and post-fire wind erosion (e.g. Lake Balkhash basin). Different seasonal patterns of dust emissions were observed in northern, western and southern deserts around the Tian Shan Mountains and their relation to climatological processes in these regions are explored.",

            "abstract": "Many mitigation approaches have been proposed to ameliorate the deleterious aspects of urbalization on climate, with special focus on the notorious urban heat island (UHI) effect. Of these approaches, high reflectance roof (cool roof) and pavement (cool pavement) and green roof or greenery are most commonly used and widely studied. However, the debate regarding the better implementation of cool and green technology is still ongoing. In this study, numerical sensitivity tests are carried out to evaluate the mitigation effect of the cool and green implementations at the city scale. The effects of roof-level and street-level implementations are compared in the context of a tropical urban environment.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater resources are particularly important for the inhabitants of Klela Basin due to the absence of surface water especially during dry season (from November to May). Groundwater is the only permanent water resources. Therefore, a good knowledge of water balance may help for integrated water resources management. The current study was investigated on modeling of groundwater resources to establish water balance in order to evaluate the sources and sinks of groundwater system. The sandstone of Sikasso of the study area (3,680 Km2) was modeled using PMWIN model. The model grid was discretized into 239 columns, 256 rows making total grid cell number of 57,834, with a grid dimension of 300 m * 300 m taking into account of aquifer extension and hydrogeological data availability. Digital Elevation Modem (DEM) from Hydroshed was used to interpolate hydraulic head which was entered to the model as starting hydraulic head. The borehole logs data were used to estimate aquifer thickness. The model was calibrated, in steady-state and transient simulations, by trial and error`s estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients (hydraulic conductivity and specific yield) and the results were optimized using Parameter ESTimation (PEST) code in PMWIN. The results show that most of the water (99.9%) entering to the aquifer system is coming from infiltration local precipitation in the Basin. The stream leakage entering to groundwater was negligible (only 0.1%). However, the maximum water leaving the aquifer is coming from storage and stream leakage 67% and 33% respectively\nKeywords: groundwater flow modeling, PMWIN, Klela Basin, DEM, water balance, climate variability.",

            "abstract": "The Keck Geology Consortium, with support from the National Science Foundation (REU Program) and ExxonMobil, is a collaborative effort by 18 colleges to improve geoscience education through high-quality research experiences. Since its inception in 1987 more than 1350 undergraduate students and 145 faculty have been involved in 189 yearlong research projects. This non-traditional REU model offers exceptional opportunities for students to address research questions at a deep level, to learn and utilize sophisticated analytical methods, and to engage in authentic collaborative research that culminates in an undergraduate research symposium and published abstracts volume. The large numbers of student and faculty participants in Keck projects also affords a unique opportunity to study the impacts of program design on undergraduate research experiences in the geosciences.\nStudents who participate in Keck projects generally report significant gains in personal and professional dimensions, as well as in clarification of educational and career goals. Survey data from student participants, project directors, and campus advisors identify mentoring as one of the most critical and challenging elements of successful undergraduate research experiences. Additional challenges arise from the distributed nature of Keck projects (i.e., participants, project directors, advisors, and other collaborators are at different institutions) and across the span of yearlong projects. In an endeavor to improve student learning about the nature and process of science, and to make mentoring practices more intentional, the Consortium has developed workshops and materials to support both project directors and campus research advisors (e.g., best practices for mentoring, teaching ethical professional conduct, benchmarks for progress, activities to support students during research process). The Consortium continues to evolve its practices to better support students from underrepresented groups.",

            "abstract": "While vegetation productivity is known to be strongly correlated to climate, there is a need for an improved understanding of the underlying processes of vegetation carbon turnover and their importance at a global scale. This shortcoming has been due to the lack of spatially extensive information on vegetation carbon stocks, which we recently have been able to overcome by a biomass dataset covering northern boreal and temperate forests originating from radar remote sensing. Based on state-of-the-art products on biomass and NPP, we are for the first time able to study the relation between carbon turnover rate and a set of climate indices in northern boreal and temperate forests. The implementation of climate-related mortality processes, for instance drought, fire, frost or insect effects, is often lacking or insufficient in current global vegetation models. In contrast to our observation-based findings, investigated models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP), including HYBRID4, JeDi, JULES, LPJml, ORCHIDEE, SDGVM, and VISIT, are able to reproduce spatial climate – turnover rate relationships only to a limited extent. While most of the models compare relatively well to observation-based NPP, simulated vegetation carbon stocks are severely biased compared to our biomass dataset. Current limitations lead to considerable uncertainties in the estimated vegetation carbon turnover, contributing substantially to the forest feedback to climate change. Our results are the basis for improving mortality concepts in global vegetation models and estimating their impact on the land carbon balance.",

            "abstract": "Changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the high Arctic have been reliably documented, with widespread “greening” (increase in NDVI), specifically along the northern rim of Eurasia and Alaska. Whereas in West Siberia south of 65N, widespread “browning” (decrease in NDVI) has been noted, although the causes remain largely unclear. In this study we report results of statistical analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in NDVI around 28 major urban areas in the arctic and subarctic Western Siberia. Exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves has led to rapid industrialization and urban development in the region. This development has significant impact on the environment and particularly in the vegetation cover in and around the urbanized areas. The analysis is based on 15 years (2000-2014) of high-resolution (250 m) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired for summer months (June through August) over the entire arctic and subarctic Western Siberian region. The analysis shows that the NDVI background trends are generally in agreement with the trends reported in previous coarse-resolution NDVI studies. Our study reveals greening over the arctic (tundra and tundra-forest) part of the region. Simultaneously, the southern (boreal taiga forest) part is browning, with the more densely vegetation areas or areas with highest NDVI, particularly along Ob River showing strong negative trend.\nThe unexpected and interesting finding of the study is statistically robust indication of the accelerated increase of NDVI (“greening”) in the older urban areas. Many Siberian cities become greener even against the decrease in the NDVI background. Moreover, interannual variations of urban NDVI are not coherent with the NDVI background variability. We also find that in tundra zones, NDVI values are higher in a 5-10 km buffer zone around the city edge than in rural areas (40 km distance from the city edge), and in taiga in a 5-10 km buffer zone NDVI value are lower compare with rural zone. We speculate that the observed “greening” or “browning” around urban areas could be caused by the vegetation cover response to the anthropogenic urban heat island (UHI) effect. The general regional trend is amplified in very close proximity to the urban areas, possibly due to UHI effect.",

            "abstract": "Continental-scale aboveground biomass maps are increasingly available, but their estimates vary widely, particularly at high resolution. A comprehensive understanding of map discrepancies is required to improve their effectiveness in carbon accounting and local decision-making. To this end, we compare four continental-scale maps with a recent high-resolution lidar-derived biomass map over Maryland, USA. We conduct detailed comparisons at pixel-, county-, and state-level. Spatial patterns of biomass are broadly consistent in all maps, but there are large differences at fine scales (RMSD 48.5 Mg·ha-1–92.7 Mg·ha-1).\nDiscrepancies reduce with aggregation and the agreement among products improves at the county level. However, continental scale maps exhibit residual negative biases in mean (33.0 Mg·ha-1–54.6 Mg·ha-1) and total biomass (3.5–5.8 Tg) when compared to the high-resolution lidar biomass map. Three of the four continental scale maps reach near-perfect agreement at ~4 km and onward but do not converge with the high-resolution biomass map even at county scale. At the State level, these maps underestimate biomass by 30–80 Tg in forested and 40–50 Tg in non-forested areas.\nLocal discrepancies in continental scale biomass maps are caused by factors including data inputs, modeling approaches, forest / non-forest definitions and time lags. There is a net underestimation over high biomass forests and non-forested areas that could impact carbon accounting at all levels. Local, high-resolution lidar-derived biomass maps provide a valuable bottom-up reference to improve the analysis and interpretation of large-scale maps produced in carbon monitoring systems.",

The distributed model of radionuclide transport through watershed in exchangeable and nonexchangeable forms in solute and with sediments was developed and validated for small Chernobyl watersheds in 90th within EU SPARTACUS project (van der Perk et al., 1996). New tendency is coupling of radionuclide transport models and the widely validated hydrological distributed models. To develop radionuclide transport model DHSVM-R the open source Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model –DHSVM\nhttp://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/DHSVM\nwas modified and extended. The main changes provided in the hydrological and sediment transport modules of DHSVM are as follows: Morel-Seytoux infiltration model is added; four-directions schematization for the model's cells flows (D4) is replaced by D8 approach; the finite-difference schemes for solution of kinematic wave equations for overland water flow, stream net flow, and sediment transport are replaced by new computationally efficient scheme. New radionuclide transport module, coupled with hydrological and sediment transport modules, continues SPARTACUS’s approach, - it describes radionuclide wash-off from watershed and transport via stream network in soluble phase and on suspended sediments. The hydrological module of DHSVM-R was calibrated and validated for the watersheds of Ukrainian Carpathian mountains and for the subwatersheds of Niida river flowing 137Cs in solute and with suspended sediments to Pacific Ocean at 30 km north of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. The modules of radionuclide and sediment transport were calibrated and validated versus experimental data for USLE experimental plots in Fukushima Prefecture and versus monitoring data collected in Niida watershed. The role of sediment transport in radionuclide wash-off from mountain and lowland watersheds is analyzed in comparison of modeling results for Chernobyl and Fukushima watersheds.",

Assessment of a blended general education science class at James Madison University used a mixed-method causal-comparative design: in Spring 2014, two classes with identical content and similar groups of non-science majors were taught by the same instructor in either blended or full face-to-face formats.\nThe learning experience of 160 students in the two classes was compared based on course and exam grades, classroom observation, and student survey results. Student acquisition of content in both classes was measured with pre-post tests using published concept inventories, and surveys, quizzes, and grade reports in the Blackboard learning management system were additionally used for data collection. Exams were identical between the two sections, and exam questions were validated in advance by a faculty member who teaches other sections of the same course. A course experience questionnaire was administered to measure students’ personal experiences in both classes, addressing dimensions of good teaching, clear goals and standards, generic skills, appropriate assessment and workload, and emphasis on independence. Using a STEM classroom observation checklist, two researchers conducted in-class observations for four 75-minute face-to-face meetings with similar content focus in both classes, which allowed assessment of student engagement and participation.\nWe will present details of the course design and research plan, as well as assessment results from both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

            "abstract": "Meteorites store information about the magnetic fields present in the solar system. However, most meteorites have experienced pressure/shock, which will influence the magnetic properties of the remanence carrying minerals. Here, we quantify the effect that relatively low pressure has on paleointensity recording with relevance to meteorites that have no petrographic evidence for shock. Thellier-type experiments were carried out on 40 samples containing thermally stable titanomagnetite similar to that found in some achondrites. Pressure cycling was performed under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic conditions. We also tested the effect of pressure cycling when the maximum compression axis was imposed parallel and perpendicular to the magnetization direction.\nThe initial zero pressure experiment correctly reproduced the laboratory field imparted on the samples. Paleointensity values decrease 10%/GPa under hydrostatic conditions with no observable directional dependence between the direction of the magnetization with the maximum compression axis. Non-hydrostatic pressures have a significantly greater effect - paleointensity decreases 20%/GPa on average, with only a slight difference when pressure is imposed parallel to the magnetization direction, whereas the pressure demagnetization effect is more substantial. Interestingly, the data become more linear (higher quality factors) as pressure increases. We explain this phenomenon through a numerical model that shows the mean blocking temperatures become lower with increasing pressure. This reduces the difference between mean blocking and unblocking, which eliminates the sagging (curvature) seen in Arai plots.\nConsidering that samples from meteorites classified as unshocked may have experienced pressures up to 5 GPa, paleointensity estimates derived from meteorites should be considered as minimum values.",

New challenges call for the changes in the GAW station requirements and data managements, for new approaches to collaboration with the contributing networks and better involvement of the modelling community. The programme structure is evolving to streamline better to user requirements with the move from precipitation chemistry to total deposition and from near-real-time data delivery to applications (modeling) requiring such data delivery. The updated concept of GAW will include more cross-cutting applications. A new category of local station is introduced to help with the verification of some applications including those related to urban areas and the impacts of urban complexes regionally and globally.\nThe evolution of the GAW Programme towards user driven cross-cutting applications provides a new opportunity to the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in partnership with other science - based institutions to increase their relevance to society.",

            "abstract": "Changes in precipitation can drive river aggradation or incision through their influence on both hillslope processes, which supply sediment to the channel, and sediment transport capacity, which moves sediment downstream. Whether a particular change in precipitation intensity and/or duration will result in aggradation or incision is difficult to predict due to these competing effects. In particular, fluvial response to climate change is sensitive to (1) thresholds and nonlinearities involved in sediment production and sediment transport, (2) how different modes of sediment production affect the grain size of the sediment provided to the channel, and (3) impacts of drainage basin geometry on sediment storage time and locations of rapid sediment production and/or transport. A better mechanistic understanding of the relationship between rainfall and river bed elevation changes will help us to understand modern river channel response to climate change and decipher the causes for fluvial terrace formation. Here we couple a hydrologic model, the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), with a model of sediment transport through a fluvial network, sedFlow, to predict patterns of bed elevation change. We first perform schematic example simulations on an idealized synthetic landscape with a single river channel to show how simple fluvial systems can respond to changes in rainfall. We then expand these numerical tests to full fluvial networks, in which the segments of the tributary network propagate signals of aggradation and incision, leading to a more complex response that embodies the interference between magnitudes and time-scales of sediment transfer in the tributary links. We showcase the possible complexity of the fluvial response with an example from the Quebrada del Toro of NW Argentina, which is currently experiencing rapid and spatially-variable aggradation and incision, possibly in response to an increase in extreme rainfall events in the east-central Andes.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale ice-sheet dynamics pivot on the deformation and transport of subglacial sediment through changes in the basal sliding velocities of glaciers. Such unconsolidated, water-saturated glacigenic sediment, or till, is found to accumulate into sedimentary wedges, or till-deltas, in grounding zones separating floating ice shelves from grounded ice streams. In addition to affecting glacial slip, such sedimentation may serve to stabilise ice sheets against grounding-line retreat in response to rising sea levels. We present a fluid-mechanical explanation of the formation of these wedges in terms of the jump in hydrostatic loading and unloading of till across the grounding zone, and we compare our findings with geophysical data of sedimentary wedge formation at the modern-day grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica. We develop a theoretical model of wedge formation in which we treat both ice and till as viscous fluids spreading under gravity into an inviscid ocean and find that a similar wedge of underlying fluid accumulates around the grounding line in our series of fluid-mechanical laboratory experiments. The experiments were performed in a confined channel geometry. We extend our theory to unconfined geometries in which till deformation is resisted dominantly by vertical shear stresses and the flow of the overlying ice is resisted dominantly either by vertical shear stresses between the ice and till or by extensional stresses characteristic of floating ice shelves and shelfy streams. The former is relevant to less-lubricated, grounded ice sheets whereas the latter is relevant to well-lubricated ice streams, sliding over soft, deformable till of low viscosity and appreciable thickness. We formulate a local condition relating wedge slopes in each of the three scenarios and find a reasonable agreement with geophysical data.",

Also, they can have substantial impacts on ecosystem and human society (agriculture, health, and economy) of the affected regions. According to future projections of climate, extreme weather and climate events in Korea are expected to occure more frequently with stronger intensity over the 21st century. For the better long range forecast, it is also fundamentally ruquired to develop a supporting system in terms of extreme weather and climate events including forequency and trend. In this context, the KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration) has recently initiated a development of the extreme climate monintoring and early warning system for long range forecast, which consists of three sub-system components; (1) Real-time climate monitoring system, (2) Ensemble prediction system, and (3) Mechanism analysis and display system for climate extremes. As a first step, a pilot system has been designed focusing on temperature extremes such heat waves and cold snaps using daily, monthly and seasonal observations and model prediction output on the global, regional and national levels. In parallel, the skills of the KMA long range prediction system are being evaluated comprehensively for weather and climate extremes, for which varous case studies are conducted to better understand the observed variations of extrem climates and responsible mechanisms and also to assess predictability of the ensemble prediction system for extremes. Details in the KMA extreme climate monitoring and early warning system will be intorduced and some preliminary results will be discussed for heat/cold waves in Korea.",

The continental rise in this region is characterised by large sediment mounds that are shaped by westward flowing bottom currents and that resemble contouritic drifts existing offshore from the Antarctic Peninsula. Similar to the Antarctic Peninsula drifts, marine sediment cores from the poorly studied sediment mounds in the Amundsen Sea have the potential to provide reliable records of dynamical ice-sheet behaviour in West Antarctica and palaeoceanographic changes in the Southern Ocean during the Late Quaternary that can be reconstructed from their terrestrial, biogenic and authigenic components.\nHere we use multi-proxy data from three sediment cores recovered from two of the Amundsen Sea mounds to present the first high-resolution study of environmental changes on this part of the West Antarctic continental margin over the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Late Quaternary. Age constraints for the records are derived from biostratigraphy, AMS 14C dates and lithostratigraphy. We focus on the investigation of processes for drift formation, thereby using grain size and sortable silt data to reconstruct changes in bottom current speed and to identify episodes of current winnowing. Data on geochemical and mineralogical sediment composition and physical properties are used to infer both changes in terrigenous sediment supply in response to the advance and retreat of the WAIS across the Amundsen Sea shelf and changes in biological productivity that are mainly controlled by the duration of annual sea-ice coverage. We compare our data sets from the Amundsen Sea mounds to those from the well-studied Antarctic Peninsula drifts, thereby highlighting similarities and discrepancies in depositional processes and climatically-driven environmental changes.",

This study is based on an interdisciplinary approach, coupling “hard” geosciences together with “soft” social sciences with the aim to study the human impact on coastal aquifers in a context of overexploitation to improve the existing water management tools.\nBy revisiting the geological and hydrogeological conceptual models, field campaigns of groundwater and surface water sampling and analysis, and of interviews of different actors on the theme of water supply and management in Recife Metropolitan Region, the main results can be summarized as follows: (1) The recharge of the deep strategic confined aquifers is very limited resulting in water level decrease (up to -90m in 25y) due to overexploitation. (2) Groundwater residence time in these deep aquifers is over 10,000 years. (3) The natural upward flux of these confined aquifers is observed inland, but is reversed in the heavily populated areas along the coast leading to mixing with modern groundwater coming from the shallow aquifers. (4) Groundwater salinization is inherited from the Pleistocene marine transgression, only partly diluted by the recharge through the mangroves during the subsequent regression phase. Today, leakage from surficial aquifers induces local salinization. (5) Local climatic scenarios predict a reduction of rainfall volume of 20% together with an increase of sea level (18-59cm by 2100). (5) The Public authorities tend to deny the difficulties that people, especially those in precarious situation, are confronted with regarding water, especially in times of drought.\nThe COQUEIRAL research project is financially supported by ANR (ANR-11-CEPL-012); FACEPE (APQ-0077-3.07/11); FAPESP (2011/50553-0",

            "abstract": "Since the 1960s, changes in the production of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) have been invoked as a way to influence climate changes in the southern hemisphere, to synchronize the changes in both hemispheres or to trigger an early climate response in the southern hemisphere. While not the first to document the role of NADW and changes in heat transport in hemispheric linkages, Tom Crowley’s 1992 paper “North Atlantic Deep Water Cools the Southern Hemisphere” was an elegant and influential contribution outlining how changes in NADW production may have caused the early southern hemisphere response seen on orbital time scales by Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton (1976) as well as other researchers studying climate variability in marine sediments and polar ice cores.\nOur understanding of climate change and ocean circulation has improved greatly since the early 1990s. Modern observations have increased our understanding of processes governing deep water production, mixing and circulation. A dedicated community effort to better reconstruct past changes in ocean circulation has resulted in: 1) longer and more highly-resolved time series of deep water production on orbital time scales; 2) reconstructions of the bathymetric and geographic distribution of nutrients that are affected by circulation and water mass geometry; 3) the development of new ways to determine rates of ocean overturning, especially in the Atlantic; and 4) the development of highly-resolved records of ocean circulation that document variability on centennial and millennial time scales. In this presentation we aim to synthesize the current state of understanding of deep water production and climate change on these longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Fire is an integral component of boreal forests, and exerts strong control over ecosystem structure and function. The frequency and spatial extent of fire controls the age-class distribution of forests on the landscape. In addition, recent evidence from North American boreal forests has show that fire severity influences post-fire succession via impacts on seedling recruitment that manifest in mature ecosystems dominated by either deciduous or coniferous tree species. The effects of fire on ecosystem structure have important climate feedback implications; changes in forest density or leaf habit can influence surface net radiation by altering the snow-masking effects of vegetation.\nAlthough Siberian larch forests occupy a more than 2.8 million km2 of the boreal biome, and are the most prevalent forests in Russia, the influence of fire severity on succession and associated surface energy dynamics are less well understood in comparison to North American boreal forests. There is evidence suggesting that increased fire severity may lead to higher density of post-fire regrowth, but the influence of stand density on surface energy dynamics remains poorly quantified. Here, we quantify the effects of stand density on albedo across the Kolyma River basin using satellite-derived albedo and fire history in conjunction with maps and field observations of ecosystem structure. During snow-free periods albedo varies little with stand density. During periods of snow cover we find consistent negative correlations between multiple metrics of canopy cover and albedo. Albedo decreased with fire recovery over the forty-year fire record for the study area. However, the range of albedo observed within individual fire scars was similar to the magnitude of albedo recovery during the study period. This result indicates the importance of variability in post-fire regrowth within individual fire scars, potentially associated with fire severity, for understanding fire effects on surface energy dynamics in Siberian larch forests. In contrast to North American boreal forests, the effects of increasing fire severity on post-fire succession will decrease albedo in Siberian larch forests, acting as a positive feedback to climate.",

            "abstract": "Normal mode method is widely used in seismology. Although some possibilities of applying normal mode to tsunami researches are already pointed out, the potential power of this method still remains.\nOne advantage of normal mode method is that, once the mode solution is obtained and stored in the computer, we can synthesize tsunami waveforms as superposition of normal modes (Satake and Shimazaki, 1987). Although this theory is scientifically sound and there are some simple numerical tests, it has never been applied to a real case, due to computational difficulty. Recently, Wu and Satake (2014) developed a faster method to calculate normal mode based on Loomis (1975) method, and then obtained high resolution normal mode solution of Japan Sea, which contains 4000 modes (down to period of about 10 min). This makes it possible to verify the theory using real earthquake source parameter.\nWith the source parameter of the Mw 7.7 1983 Japan Sea earthquake, we succeeded to synthesize tsunami waveforms by normal mode method for the first time. Comparisons with computed waveform based on finite different method (FDM) show good fit, thus proved the goodness of this idea. Unlike FDM, the calculation time does not depend on the duration for computation.\nAnother merit of normal mode method is that the weight of excited tsunami due to an earthquake source may give us some direct information about the feature of tsunami generated by that source.\nIn this study, we also calculated the excitation weight of 60 potential submarine faults in Japan Sea proposed by MLIT (2014). From these obtained weights, we can clearly see, for example, that when the source is located at shallower part or with larger magnitude, the generated weight will usually be larger.",

            "abstract": "The expected increase in extreme climatic events will cause significant constraints on grassland systems and, as a result, farmers must adapt grassland management. Identifying potential interactive effects of factors such as altitude and management, with different water availability scenarios is therefore a major challenge to anticipate the performance of mountain grasslands.\nUsing rain shelters across grassland systems in the Swiss Jura, we simulated the effects of severe droughts in spring and summer periods, at different altitudes, and compared realistic management types such as grazing by sheep, and intensive and extensive mowing. When comparing grazing and mowing management under an extreme drought event at a similar altitude, minor short-term changes of species composition, and almost no persistent effects were observed. However, significant changes were observed in plant functional traits, reflecting a strong decline in plant growth during the drought, and a partial recovery two months later. Forage yields, and its nutritive value, thus declined during the drought period, and both were still affected in the following months, but had recovered in the following spring. Negative drought effects were stronger in the grazing management, although recovery was slightly improved in this management. Concerning soil biogeochemistry, we compared microbial biomass C and N, as well as the activity of extracellular enzymes at peak drought, and during the rewet phase. Both indices remained comparable to control treatments under drought. During the rewet phase, some enzymes were stimulated in the grazed-control, but microbial biomass remained comparable. These systems showed considerable resistance to extreme drought, with only minor short term impacts due to management. However, cascading effects from the aboveground to belowground function may be observed if such events increase in frequency and these processes are expected to be different at the various altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Many of the milestones of human development can be traced back to people assembled in urban settings where economies of scale, competition and social interaction stimulated innovation. Considering that more than half the global pollution now lives in cities and towns and that most of the growth in the global pollution in the remainder of this century will continue to take place in the urban environment, the question could be asked whether humankind will continue to capitalize on the traditional benefits of city life to find solutions for growing environmental challenges?\nIn the past cities developed organically. They evolved through trial and error into livable environments. Things have now changed. The global population is larger, urbanization is rapid, pressure on Earth’s limited resources is constraining and we are faced with a changing climate. If cities are now allowed to develop in a haphazard manner, the fight for survival in the city will overshadow its entrepreneurial spirit. It is for this reason that the 11th Sustainable Development Goal will focus on: ‘Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’.\nThere is now a window of opportunity for weather, climate, water and environmental scientists to contribute towards a more sustainable urban future by ensuring that science based services form an integrated part of urban planning, development and management. WMO recognizes that rapid urbanization will require new types of new and enhanced services. Such integrated urban weather, environment and climate services will assist cities to deal better with hazards such as storm surge, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in a changing climate. From a research perspective the World Climate Research Programme, the World Weather Research Programme and the Global Atmosphere Watch Programme all have a unique contribution to make in this regard.",

            "abstract": "The weather layers of Jupiter and Saturn receive both solar radiation and heat from the deep interior. Currently, numerical models fall into two broad categories: Deep, dry and convecting interior models that lack a stably stratified troposphere above, or thin shells that represent only a troposphere, with parameterized heating from the lower boundary. Here we present the results from a new coupled model that allows resolved deep convective plumes to interact with a stable \"weather layer\". We demonstrate the relative importance of a stable tropospheric lapse rate and the magnitude of bottom heating on the strength and depth of the jets. Studies of this kind will benefit understanding of Jupiter's dynamics, in particular the depth of the cloud-level jets, in advance of Juno's 2016 arrival. Moreover, the difference between Saturn and Jupiter is explored using a parameter sweep of tropospheric stability, which acts as a proxy for tropospheric water abundance. We provide corresponding odd and high harmonic gravity fields, which will be a measurable quantity by Juno and Cassini.",

            "abstract": "The current global warming seems to have direct consequences on ice-sheet mass loss. Reproducing the responsible mechanisms and forecasting the potential ice-sheets contribution to 21st century sea level rise is one of the major challenges in ice-sheet and ice flow modelling. Such short term projections are very sensitive to model initial state which is usually build from field observations. However, some parameters are not observable on the field, such as the basal drag at the interface between the ice-sheet and the bedrock. Data assimilation methods are widely used to constrain this parameter, using ice surface velocities. However, other parameters remain poorly known, especially the bedrock elevation which is only known along fight tracks often distant from several tens of kilometres from each other. These remaining uncertainties lead to ice flux divergence anomalies affecting the free surface evolution and consequently the model projections.\nIn this study, we developed two different assimilation algorithms to better constrain both basal drag and bedrock elevation parameters in the Wilkes Land region, East Antarctica. These two algorithms have been implemented in Elmer/Ice and tested beforehand in a twin experiment showing a clear improvement of both parameters knowledge. The application of these algorithms to Wilkes Land reduces the uncertainty on basal conditions in this region showing more accuracy through below outlet glaciers when compared to usually used DEM of bedrock. Reconstruction of both bedrock elevation and basal drag significantly decreases ice flux divergence anomalies and allows to better constrain future contribution to sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Rapid urbanization in East Asia in past three decades is considered as a remarkable process that featured with expansion of urban clusters and tightened linkages within and among clusters. Such process could lead to much larger scale climate effects, and could even contribute to sub-regional and regional climate change. In large area of urban clusters with significant expansion of built-up in relatively short period, local urban heat islands could contribute to sub-regional climate forcing. Here we use visible/near infrared and thermal infrared satellite data to estimate multiple scale structure of urban clusters, and to assess effects of urban heat islands at local and regional scales in East Asia. Our estimates of urban extent were greater than previously reported in most global datasets. Strong spatial connection and internal expansion were found in major urban clusters in past 30 years, and was accelerated in past 10 years. Many city clusters were merging into each other, with gradual blurring boundaries and disappearing of gaps among member cities. Cities and towns were more connected with roads and commercial corridors, while wildland and urban greens became more isolated as patches among built-up areas. We would argue that in many cases in this region, urban clusters are no longer “islands”, they are now “seas” in term of climate related urban canopy. Urban greens such as parks and plantation were long recognized for their cooling effects that buffer the urban heat island effect, however, such cooling effects tend to be weakened as their patches became smaller and isolated, and over dominated by urban surfaces. There were significant positive relations between urban fraction and urban heat island effects as demonstrated by VNIR and TIR data from multiple satellites. Those new estimates are expected to effectively improve climate simulation for better understanding the impacts of inter-connected urban clusters on air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and boundary layer height at various scales.\nFurther reading: http://green.tea.ac.cn",

            "abstract": "The GOCE gravity field is globally homogeneous at the resolution of about 80km or better allowing for the first time to identify tectonic structures at continental scale. The large scale structures are presumably controlled by the rheology of the underlying crust down to the base of the lithosphere. Seismic tomography identifies the presence of the deep lithosphere roots by increased velocity. The joint analysis of the tomography results and the GOCE gravity reveals that at global scale the two data have some common patterns. The correlations are enhanced by applying geodynamic plate reconstructions to the GOCE gravity field and to the tomography models which places today’s observed fields at the Gondwana pre-breakup position. There are several examples for which it is found that the deep lithospheric roots, as those found below cratons, control the position of the positive gravity values outboard of the deep roots. This could be explained by the deep lithospheric roots focusing asthenospheric upwelling outboard of the root protecting the overlying craton from magmatic intrusions. Over several of the deep roots the gravity is systematically negative, which could be due to a compositional effect, with deep roots of increased velocity having reduced density. The study is carried out globally, with focus on the African and South American continents.\nThe background for the study can be found in the following publications where the techniques which have been used are described:\nBraitenberg, C., Mariani, P. and De Min, A.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric stability has substantial effects on the flows and heat/mass transport processes. While extensive studies have been conducted for neutral and unstable stabilities, rather limited studies have been devoted to stable stratification. Major technical reason is the demanding spatio-temporal resolution required to solve the small scales in stratified turbulent flows.\nInstead of continuous density variation, we use the single-layer hydraulics model (analogous to shallow water equations for global dynamics), to simulate the stratified flows and turbulence structure over hypothetical urban areas. An array of identical ribs in cross flows is used to model an idealized urban surface and the aerodynamic resistance is controlled by the separation among the ribs. Two immiscible fluids (water and air) with a large density difference (three order of magnitude) are used to simulate the stratification. The key assumption is that the density in the (lower) single layer is uniform. As a result, the stratification is measured by the Froude number Fr (= U/(gH)1/2; where U is the flow speed, g the gravitational acceleration and H the single-layer depth).\nOne of the characteristics of single-layer hydraulics model is hydraulic jump which occurs when the flows are slowing down from Fr > 1 (high-speed flows over smoother surfaces) to Fr < 1 (lower-speed flows over rougher surfaces). It is noteworthy that kinetic energy does not conserve across hydraulic jump that, unavoidably, cascades to turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). We thus hypotheses that the elevated TKE could modify the street-level ventilation mechanism in the stratified flows across an abrupt change in surface roughness entering urban areas.\nLarge-eddy simulation and laboratory-scale water channel experiments are sought to improve our understanding of the occurrence of hydraulic jump and the associated street-level ventilation mechanism in the stratified flows over urban areas. Preliminary results, by comparing the dynamics at Fr = 2.4 and Fr = 2.8, demonstrate the notable changes in ventilation performance in the first several rows of ribs of urban areas. Substantial changes in the mean and fluctuating velocities are observed that contribute to the different street-level ventilation mechanism. Detailed results will be reported in the upcoming AGU fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical parameter for modeling vegetation’s water, carbon and energy exchange with the atmosphere. Several global LAI datasets have been generated from satellite observations. However, they are limited in temporal coverage and representation of canopy structure. In this presentation, we generate a long time series (1982-2014) of global LAI products and separately estimate global forest overstory and understory LAIs by fusing AVHRR, MODIS and MISR data.\nA long-term consistent LAI was generated from AVHRR and MODIS data by establishing an AVHRR Simple Ratio (SR)-MODIS LAI relationship pixel by pixel. Firstly, A MODIS LAI series was derived from MODIS data based on the GLOBCARBON LAI algorithm. Then, the pixel-based relationships between AVHRR SR and MODIS LAI were constructed using these two datasets for the overlapping period. This relationship was applied to historical AVHRR data to derive LAI back to 1981. Since the MODIS LAI is used to constrain AVHRR retrieval, it ensures that the LAI from these two sensors are consistent. Then, the global forest overstory and understory LAIs were estimated separately by fusing MISR and MODIS observations. Monthly forest understory LAI was retrieved from the forest understory reflectivity estimated using MISR data at a spatial resolution of 1 km (Jiao et al., 2014, JGR). The forest overstory LAI was estimated from the MODIS land surface reflectance, after correcting for the background contribution using monthly mean forest understory reflectivities.\nThe comparison during the overlapped period show that the LAIs from the two different sensors are good consistency, with LAI differences are within 0.6 over 99.0% vegetated pixels. Forest understory vegetation is mainly distributed in the boreal forests zones at northern latitudes (40°N to 70°N). Higher understory LAI values are found in needleleaf forests than in broadleaf forests. The results are also compared with other products and field measurements.",

            "abstract": "People have recognized that the human activities lead to the degradation of the environment, and constructed wetland is one of the well-known technologies for water treatment. In constructed wetland, complicated processes should be considered such as redox reactions, acid-base reactions, adsorption-desorption between water and sediment and biochemical reactions associated with plant and microorganism. In this study, most of inorganic components were analyzed and principal component analysis (PCA) was followed for depicting the controlling biochemical reaction in the constructed wetland. The results could be a guide to operate the constructed wetland.\nThe constructed wetland in this study is located in Taoyuan County, north Taiwan. It’s a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland composed of ten cells. The water in wetland was pumped from Nankan River, which collects wastewater from Hwaya technology park, Linkou, Guishan and Nankan industrial zone. The water of inflow and outflow from each cell were collected for analyzing inorganic components with ICP-MS and IC. In general, the results show that water quality had dramatically changed in the first three cells and became stable in the following seven cells.\nIn this study, PCA extracted two major factors (PCs), which can respectively explain 52.76%（PC1）and 28.32%（PC2）of variance of water quality data. PC1 separates samples of the first three cells from those of the other following cells. It is believed that there was another pollution source involved in the 4th cell because PC1 is characterized by high loadings of most of trace heavy metals. On the other hand, the hydrochemistry of water mainly evolve along PC2 axis. PC2 is composed of Fe, Mn, NH4, dissolved oxygen, pH, etc with high loadings. These chemical components are predominately controlled by redox reactions. Moreover, the deep water from the 4th cell contains high concentrations of many heavy metals, especially Cu and Ga. This confirms the previous derivation based on PCA. The rare earth elements (REEs) were also measured in this study. After normalized to North American shale, the REEs shows an uncommon pattern with Eu and Gd positive anomalies and Tm negative anomaly, which probably result from industrial contamination. However, more studies would be needed to prove it.",

Contemporary Science is responsible for not coping with challenging changes of Exposures and their Vulnerability inflicted by growing population, its concentration, etc., which result in a steady increase of Losses from Natural Hazards. Scientists owe to Society for lack of knowledge, education, and communication. In fact, Contemporary Science can do a better job in disclosing Natural Hazards, assessing Risks, and delivering such knowledge in advance catastrophic events.\nWe continue applying the general concept of seismic risk analysis in a number of seismic regions worldwide by constructing regional seismic hazard maps based on the Unified Scaling Law for Earthquakes (USLE), i.e. log N(M,L) = A – B•(M-6) + C•log L, where N(M,L) is the expected annual number of earthquakes of a certain magnitude M within an seismically prone area of linear dimension L. The parameters A, B, and C of USLE are used to estimate, first, the expected maximum magnitude in a time interval at a seismically prone cell of a uniform grid that cover the region of interest, and then the corresponding expected ground shaking parameters including macro-seismic intensity. After a rigorous testing against the available seismic evidences in the past (e.g., the historically reported macro-seismic intensity), such a seismic hazard map is used to generate maps of specific earthquake risks (e.g., those based on the density of exposed population).

            "abstract": "The global numerical weather prediction model routinely operated at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is typically updated about two times a year to make use of the most recent improvements in the numerical scheme, the physical model or the data assimilation procedures for steadily improving daily weather forecasting. Even though such changes frequently affect the long-term stability of meteorologic quantities, data from the ECMWF deterministic model is frequently preferred over alternative atmospheric re-analyses due to both the availability of the data in near real-time and the substantially higher spatial resolution.\nHowever, global surface pressure time-series, which are crucial for the interpretation of geodetic observables, such as Earth rotation, surface deformation, and the Earth's gravity field, are in particular affected by changes in the surface orography of the model associated with every major improvement in horizontal resolution.\nHere, we attempt to harmonize surface pressure time-series from the operational ECMWF model by projecting them onto a common reference topography under consideration of the time-variable atmospheric density structure. The effectiveness of the method will be discussed globally for two major ECMWF upgrades in 2006 and 2010. We will in particular discuss the impact of the method on planned improvements of the GRACE Atmosphere and Ocean De-Aliasing Product AOD1B, and indicate further application opportunities in the context of the Global Geophysical Fluid Center of the International Earth Rotation and ",

            "abstract": "Monitoring plays a pivotal role in determining sustainable strategy for efficient overall management of the water resource. Though periodic monitoring provides some information, only long-term monitoring can provide data sufficient in quantity and quality to determine trends and develop predictive models. These can support informed decisions about sustainable and efficient use of water resources in New Zealand. However the development of such strategies is underpinned by our understanding and our ability to measure all inputs in headwaters catchments, where most of the precipitation is falling.\nHistorically due to the harsh environment New Zealand has had little to no formal high elevation monitoring stations for all climate and snow related parameters outside of ski field climate and snow stations. This leads to sparse and incomplete archived datasets. Due to the importance of these catchments to the New Zealand economy (eg irrigation, hydro-electricity generation, tourism) NIWA has developed a climate-snow and ice monitoring network (SIN) since 2006. This network extends existing monitoring by electricity generator and ski stations and it is used by a number of stakeholders. In 2014 the network comprises 13 stations located at elevation above 700masl.\nAs part of the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), NIWA is carrying out an intercomparison of precipitation data over the period 2013-2015 at Mueller Hut. The site was commissioned on 11 July 2013, set up on the 17th September 2013 and comprises two Geonor weighing bucket raingauges, one shielded and the other un-shielded, in association with a conventional tipping bucket raingauge and conventional climate and snow measurements (temperature, wind, solar radiation, relative humidity, snow depth and snow pillow).\nThe presentation aims to outline the state of the current monitoring network in New Zealand, as well as the challenge and opportunities for measurement of precipitation in alpine environment.",

            "abstract": "Weather and climate systems have been identified as chaotic and complex systems and have been extensively studied as such for decades exhibiting occasional large extremes, sudden changes, difficulty in forecasting and all the characteristics and behaviour patterns of chaotic systems including temporal and spatial scaling regimes. Urban traffic systems are also well recognised to exhibit such properties.\nHowever, centralised infrastructure such as water and energy are generally viewed as simple, centralised linear input/output engineering network systems which change slowly over time in an incremental, controlled fashion. Such systems can be overwhelmed by extreme events, causing system failure, often for extended periods of time. System failures and partial failures will become more frequent as the system reaches capacity as population and demand increases. As the risk of failure or partial failure increases and the capability to enable distributed capture and dissemination of resources improves, these systems will shift towards decentralisation. The decentralised segments of the systems will become increasingly dependent on weather (a chaotic system) but will be less subject to centralised system failure and could be buffered by the centralised segment when isolated failures occur. As decentralisation develops, the systems will become increasingly complex, potentially chaotic in nature and exhibit unexpected behaviours as well as self-organisation. Both criticality and resilience will also change and, it is likely that, should resilience reduce, the systems may become adaptive to compensate, potentially increasing resilience.\nInteresting questions include \"does decentralisation of infrastructure force complexity and/or chaos?\" and \"how will shifting from centralised to decentralised inputs change resilience and criticality of the system?\" We aim to examine these questions in the contexts of urban waste and potable water systems as well as with domestic solar panel installation in New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "We present interferormetric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis of human-induced ground deformation in the Raton Basin of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico, including displacements from a wastewater injection-induced earthquake. Geodetic observations of both seismic and aseismic surface displacements provide an additional tool to further constrain spatially and temporally variable deformation within these basins. Using Envisat observations, we image co-seismic surface displacements of the 2011 Trinidad earthquake and find that the earthquake slipped within the crystalline basement underlying basin sedimentary rocks and in the vicinity of high-volume wastewater injection wells. The spatial and temporal separation between the earthquake and the wastewater wells suggests a pore pressure migration triggering mechanism is present. The finite slip distributions further highlight the location and orientation of previously unmapped, seismogenic faults. Lastly, the precise earthquake location afforded by InSAR observations provides a well-located earthquake source that can be used to calibrate other regional earthquakes locations.\nAdditionally, we derive InSAR time series observations from ALOS imagery acquired from 2007-2011. These results highlight ongoing regions of surface subsidence within the basin, presumably caused by extraction of coal-bed methane and water that is later reinjected. While it is not clear if there is a causative relationship between regions of co-located surface subsidence and recorded earthquakes, the time series permits us to exclude several other hypotheses for the causes of increased seismicity in the Raton Basin, including volcanic activity related to the Rio Grande Rift. Furthermore, the InSAR time series analysis provides a calibration source for hydrological models that assess subsurface stress changes from the removal and injection of fluids. Forthcoming work will provide a detailed time series of surface deformation occurring prior to and following the onset of methane withdrawal and wastewater injection in the Raton Basin.",

            "abstract": "Semiarid and arid landscapes in Namibia and the South African Republic (RAS) are sensitive to changes in the vegetation that covers and protects the surface. Climatic changes or anthropogenic influences such as farming, grazing and ploughing can degrade the landscape if the natural stability of the landscape and its capacity potential is exceeded. This will directly cause sediment mobilisation and deposition. We intend to examine the connections between earth-surface processes on slopes such as sheet wash, colluvial sediment transport, and eolian movements and their links to the fluvial system via three major geomorphic forms: slopes, fans, and terraces. This novel approach will be undertaken at three study sites in Namibia and RSA In their combination the geomorphic forms have the potential of being high-resolution geoarchives of surface changes ranging from the local to the regional scale. The source and depositional environments of the sediments will be characterised and a chronology of the erosion and deposition within these three geomorphic systems will be established using absolute dating techniques. Thus, activity and stability phases will be worked out mainly for the last three centuries up to a maximum of ~ 1000 years. This offers the possibility to compare the time scales with low human impact to those with intensive human impact (farming/grazing) on the landscape together with known climatic variation and analyze major forcings of the formation of slopes-fans-terraces-systems. Our results will provide answers on how much ecosystem services are and have been influenced either by climate or land use changes in the example regions, to better enable the decision and policy makers to select better managerial options and development plans. – The project “GeoArchives” is funded within the “SPACES” program (Science Partnerships for the Assessment of Complex Earth System Processes) by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF.

            "abstract": "Detailed observations of horizontal winds in the Polar Regions are essential to understand chemical transport, atmospheric dynamics, waves and tides, and improve knowledge of polar and global climate systems. New measurement techniques for the altitude range 20‑70 km are needed to address the current sparse wind observations for the upper stratosphere and mesosphere that limits our understanding of vertical wave propagation and its impact on planetary‑scale circulation. We demonstrate the feasibility of remote sensing stratospheric and mesospheric zonal and meridional winds using ground‑based passive millimetre wave spectroradiometry. Vertical profiles of horizontal winds are retrieved from simulations of line‑of‑sight Doppler‑shifted atmospheric emission lines above Halley station (75°37’S, 26°14’W), Antarctica. Using the 231.28 GHz ozone line, or the pair of ozone lines at 249.79 GHz and 249.96 GHz, and a radiometer system temperature of 1400 K we estimate that daily mean wind profiles over the altitude range 25‑75 km could be observed with a measurement uncertainty of 4‑8 ms-1 and vertical resolution of 10‑15 km. Under optimal observing conditions at Halley the temporal resolution is predicted to improve to 1‑3 hrs, allowing studies of planetary and large‑scale gravity waves. Combining observations of the 231.28 GHz ozone line and the 230.54 GHz carbon monoxide line extends the altitude coverage to ~95 km. The effects of clear‑sky seasonal mean winter/summer conditions, zenith angle of the received atmospheric emission, and spectrometer frequency resolution on the altitude coverage, measurement uncertainty, and height and time resolution of the retrieved wind profiles have been determined.",

            "abstract": "The deformation style beneath seismogenic zones is still debated, mostly concerning the ductile deformation (e.g. localized in a narrow shear zone or broadly distributed). Furthermore, the lower crust rheology remained not fully constrained because of the limited amount of outcrops and the difficulty to reproduce experimental study on polyphase rocks. Fluid-rock interactions appear to be the prevailing parameter controlling this rheology, mainly on high pore-fluid pressure conditions. We investigate in this study the role of high pore-fluid pressure and micro-cracking mechanism on the deformation localization. As a novelty, our approach describes the evolution of porosity within ductile shear zones. We develop a one-dimensional numerical model of grain size evolution coupled with a viscous rheology, where the deformation rate is a combination of grain size sensitive diffusion creep and dislocation creep. We use the Mohr-Coulomb criterion τ=μσ to determine when micro-cracking, and subsequent precipitation, occur. Using the Darcy’s law we compute a pore-fluid pressure depending on the porosity and the fluid flow. Our results indicate that the evolution of porosity could increase the effective pore-fluid pressure. Consequently, the yield strength decreases leading to the activation of the micro-cracking mechanism. The positive feedback between micro-cracking and precipitation enables pore-fluid pressure to reach a near-lithostatic value (λ≈1). The combination of spatially heterogeneous micro-cracking and near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressure induces a strain localization within the brittle-ductile transition of feldspathic lower crust. Such strain localization, including high pore-fluid pressure conditions and low strength, is well-known as a weakening mechanism making deep Earth’s crust a favorable environment to trigger tremors and low-frequency earthquakes.",

West Africa and specifically Ghana are no exception to this reality.\nNorthern Ghana is characterized by a semi-arid climate, with prolonged dry season (7 months of very few rainfall) leading to the drying up of many rivers and streams. In addition, rainfall is highly variable in space and time. Therefore, surface water is unreliable and insufficient to meet the water demands for socio-economic development in this area. As a result, the area is heavily dependent on groundwater for domestic water supply as well as for dry season irrigation of vegetables (cash crops).\nHowever, aquifers in northern Ghana are dominantly the hard rock type (Crystalline basement rock). This aquifer has no primary porosity and may not be able to sustain the increasing demand on the resource. Further, climate change may worsen the situation as recharge is dependent on rainfall in northern Ghana. Therefore, it is important to understand exactly how climate change will impact on recharge to the groundwater for sustainable development and management of the resource.\nPrevious groundwater studies in Northern Ghana barely analyzed the combined impacts of Climate change on the recharge to the groundwater. This research is aimed at determining the current relationship between groundwater recharge and rainfall and to use the relationships to determine the impacts of changes in climate on the groundwater recharge. The results will inform plans and strategies for sustainably managing groundwater resources in Ghana and the Volta basin.",

The rupture is found to be smooth in terms of coseismic slip and even more in terms of rupture velocity, as both inversion results and a complementing back projection analysis show that the main slip patch broke unilaterally at a steady velocity of 3.1-3.3km/s. This feature likely contributes to the moderate peak ground acceleration (0.2g) observed in Kathmandu. The rupture runs at ≈15km depth along the base of the coupled portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust, and does not break the area ranging from Kathmandu to the front. This limitation of length and width of the rupture is proposed to be of structural origin, as its cause cannot be readily identified in the pre-earthquake interseismic coupling distribution.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary succession of the anoxic, deep Black Sea Basin is an ideal location for organic matter preservation and microbial methane generation. In the depth range of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) methane gas forms methane hydrates and presumably large accumulations of gas hydrate exist in porous sediments, such as those encountered on the Danube deep-sea fan. High-resolution P-Cable 3D seismic data reveals the character and distribution of up to four stacked bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) within the channel-levee systems of the Danube deep-sea fan. These anomalous BSRs were first described by Popescu et al. (2006). The geological processes that lead to multiple BSRs are still poorly understood. The theoretical base of the GHSZ calculated from regional temperature gradients and salinity data is in agreement with the shallowest BSR in the area. We have tested two hypotheses that may explain the formation of the lower BSRs. The first hypothesis is that the lower BSRs are formed by overpressure compartments. Large amounts of free gas below the BSRs are trapped in the pore space increasing the pressure above hydrostatic condition up to a level where gas hydrates are stable again. The second hypothesis is that the lower BSRs are linked to the growth of the Danube fan. Sediment deposits from the outer levee of the youngest channel cover the area hosting multiple BSRs. The youngest channel developed during the last sea level lowstand that is correlated with the Neo-Euxinian that started 23,000 yrs. BP. We propose that the rapid sediment loading during sea level lowstands is a key factor for the preservation of paleo-BSRs in the study area.\n",

            "abstract": "We present the development and first deployment of a new instrument for the measurement of OH, HO2 and RO2 radicals in the upper troposphere aboard the German research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and LOng range). The instrument is based on the well-established laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique (Holland et al., 2003; Fuchs et al., 2008). It has two separate measurement cells, one for the direct detection of OH (OH channel) and one for alternating measurements of HO2 and RO2 radicals (ROx channel) after chemical conversion to OH by the reaction with NO.\nFor its deployment on HALO, a Gulfstream-V aircraft, a special air inlet for the OH channel was developed and built at Forschungszentrum Jülich. It is based on the shrouded-inlet design by Eisele et al. (1995) and allows for a controlled reduction of the air flow velocity prior to sampling as well as the performance of inflight calibrations. There is no special inlet system for the ROx channel. It samples directly from the fast airflow along the aircraft. In contrast to our ground based instrument, longer inlet tubes are required to bring the ambient air into the detection cells inside the aircraft. The inflight calibration unit of the OH inlet allows for monitoring relative changes of the OH detection sensitivity with height. Ambient water vapor is photolysed at 185 nm upstream of the inlet nozzle to produce an additional OH signal which can be evaluated by using measurements of water vapor mixing ratio, lamp intensity, and airflow velocity. Due to the very small water vapor mixing ratios in the UTLS region this technique is limited to altitudes up to 11 km.\nWe will give an overview of the technical concept and instrumental setup for the application on HALO. We will show results from laboratory characterization measurements concerning the radical detection sensitivities and first results from flights performed during the OMO-Asia campaign in summer 2015.\nLiterature:\nHolland et al., J.

As a direct consequence of the increased statistics, we observe several cases of more TGFs produced by the same thunderstorm system. Among the 179 TGFs detected in the period 23/03/2015 - 23/06/2015 we identify 15 pairs of consecutive TGFs occurring <2 min one from each other and coming from a <300 km geographic region. Moreover, we find 5 pairs of events coming from the same region and separated in time by an entire orbital period, which correspond to TGFs detected as the satellite passes over the same still active geographic area during its subsequent orbit. We take advantage of data acquired by the geostationary meteorological satellites to establish whether these pairs are produced by the same thunderstorm system and to characterize the related meteorological scenario, providing a further confirmation that a single thunderstorm is capable of producing multiple TGFs.",

            "abstract": "Climate model diagnostic analysis is a computationally- and data-intensive task because it involves multiple numerical model outputs and satellite observation data that can both be high resolution. We have built an online tool that facilitates this process. The tool is called Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer (CMDA). It employs the web service technology and provides a web-based user interface. The benefits of these choices include: (1) No installation of any software other than a browser, hence it is platform compatable; (2) Co-location of computation and big data on the server side, and small results and plots to be downloaded on the client side, hence high data efficiency; (3) multi-threaded implementation to achieve parallel performance on multi-core servers; and (4) cloud deployment so each user has a dedicated virtual machine.\nIn this presentation, we will focus on the computer science aspects of this tool, namely the architectural design, the infrastructure of the web services, the implementation of the web-based user interface, the mechanism of provenance collection, the approach to virtualization, and the Amazon Cloud deployment. As an example, We will describe our methodology to transform an existing science application code into a web service using a Python wrapper interface and Python web service frameworks (i.e., Flask, Gunicorn, and Tornado). Another example is the use of Docker, a light-weight virtualization container, to distribute and deploy CMDA onto an Amazon EC2 instance.\nOur tool of CMDA has been successfully used in the 2014 Summer School hosted by the JPL Center for Climate Science. Students had positive feedbacks in general and we will report their comments. An enhanced version of CMDA with several new features, some requested by the 2014 students, will be used in the 2015 Summer School soon.",

            "abstract": "Chronology studies for the Cenozoic sedimentary strata based on the magnetostratigraphy cannot afford the unique chronological sequences in the absence of absolute ages from biostratigraphy or volcanic ash chronology. In situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides provide a powerful tool for the sediment dating based on the time-dependent concentration ratio of two nuclides, which are produced in the same mineral but with different half-lives. Thereinto, 10Be–26Al is the most widely used nuclide pairs, of which the available dating range spans the Plio-Pleistocene. But the coupling of 10Be with the stable nuclide 21Ne would significantly improve the burial dating range up to the middle Miocene, which is promising in revolutionizing the chronology study for the Late Cenozoic terrestrial sedimentary sequences. We have applied 10Be–21Ne pair for dating the middle Miocene sediments of the Hongliu Valley in southern Ningxia basin. Two major features of the sediments are involved in our study: (1) sediments originated from the steady erosion of the source area, and (2) the burial depth of our sample after deposition is time dependent due to the gradual accumulation of sediments into basin. The post-burial nuclide production is estimated to be less than 3%, including the contribution by muon interactions, of the total nuclide concentrations measured in our sample. Our 10Be–21Ne analysis demonstrates the age of the burial sample is 12.4(+0.6/-0.4) Ma, and the erosion rate at the source area is 0.26±0.01 cm ka-1. The sample’s burial age is consistent with the age constraint set by the Hongliugou Formation (16.7–5.4 Ma) which we collected the sample in. Vertebrate fossils of Platybelodon tongxinensis with an age between 12 and 15 Ma exhumated along with our sample further verifies the reliability of our dating results for the middle Miocene sediments.This study has shown the improved age range of cosmogenic-nuclide burial dating method by incorporating the stable nuclide 21Ne, and has established the feasibility of 10Be–21Ne pair in chronology studies for the Cenozoic sedimentary strata.",

            "abstract": "Since Dauphiné twins in quartz have been identified as a stress-related intracrystalline microstructure, several electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies revealed that Dauphiné twins are present in naturally deformed quartz-bearing rocks in a wide range of tectono-metamorphic conditions. EBSD studies on experimentally stressed quartzite showed that crystals with particular crystallographic orientations contain many Dauphiné twin boundaries, while neighboring crystals with different orientations are largely free of twin boundaries. To understand the relationship between stress direction and orientation of Dauphiné twinned quartz crystals, a detailed EBSD study was performed on experimentally stressed quartzite samples and compared with an undeformed reference sample.\nWe stressed 4 cylindrical samples in triaxial compression in a Paterson type gas deformation apparatus at GFZ Potsdam. Experimental conditions were 300MPa confining pressure, 500°C temperature and axial stresses of 145MPa, 250MPa and 460MPa for about 30 hours, resulting in a minor strain <0.04%. EBSD scans were obtained with a Zeiss Evo scanning electron microscope and TSL software at UC Berkeley.\nThe EBSD maps show that Dauphiné twinning is present in the starting material as well as in experimentally stressed samples. Pole figures of the bulk orientation of the reference sample compared with stressed samples show a significant difference regarding the distribution for the r and z directions. The reference sample shows an indistinct maximum for r and z, whereas the stressed samples show a maximum for r poles and a minimum for z poles in the axial stress direction.\nEBSD scans of the reference and stressed samples were further analyzed manually to identify the orientations of single grains, which are free of twin boundaries and those, which contain twin boundaries. This analysis aims to quantify the relationship of crystal orientation and stress magnitude to initiate mechanical twinning.",

            "abstract": "Satellite gravity measurements by GRACE and GOCE have successfully revealed mass transport and the resultant surface loading of the solid Earth due to continental water, atmosphere, oceans and ice sheets. Mass redistributions caused by megathrust earthquakes have also been detected and physical models to explain the gravity variations have been constructed. In this presentation, we show that, in the following two aspects, satellite gravity data can be used for seismological studies, when its spatial resolution becomes higher. A first is the use of observed postseismic gravity change as a sensor to determine the viscosity distribution in a shallower portion of the asthenosphere. For this purpose, a new method for estimating postseismic viscoelastic relaxation of a spherical Earth model is developed. With a spectral finite-element approach, self-gravitation, compressibility and 3D viscosity distributions can be treated in a more natural manner than with the existing methods. As an example, it will be shown that mantle flow caused by a lateral heterogeneity in viscosity due to a slab can be detected. A second is the use of observed non-tidal ocean bottom pressure (OBP) to investigate long-term variations in seismicity. Recent studies revealed that solid and ocean tides modulate the occurrence rate of deep non-volcanic tremors on the plate interface through a non-linear fault friction law. Tremors slightly accelerate the plate subduction speed below the seismogenic zone, by which shallow earthquakes are more likely to be triggered. It will be shown that non-tidal slow variations in OBP as low as 100 Pa, originating from the PDO and the Kuroshio Current, can also perturb seismicity in the Tokai area in Japan when combined with the tidal effects. In this calculation, an ocean model of the Japan Meteorological Agency is used. It is expected that higher-resolution satellite gravity data reduce leakage effects from land hydrology to more accurately evaluate OBPs in plate boundary zones in the world. This implies that satellite gravity missions potentially play an important role for investigating climatic triggering of earthquakes.",

After the accident, the atmospheric deposition and direct release of 137Cs from F1NPP were also employed for input condition. Five ensemble calculations of 137Cs activities in seawater were conducted under different initial conditions, but had identical forcing. The net input of 16 PBq of 137Cs from F1NPP, which was employed in this study, corresponded to 26% of the total amount (61 PBq) of 137Cs that was estimated in the North Pacific before the F1NPP accident in 2011. Before the accident in 2011, the 137Cs on surface ranged from 0.75 to 1.7 Bq m-3. The direct comparison between simulated and observed 134Cs activities in the surface layer represented that the root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient were 5.6 Bq m–3 and 0.86, respectively, suggesting the model result were consistent with the observations. The main body of high 137Cs activity water from F1NPP was transported to south of the Subarctic Front around 42°N via the Oyashio Coastal Current, the Oyashio intrusion, and the Kuroshio bifurcation and then to the western North Pacific.

            "abstract": "If their interaction with the atmosphere is understood, and their changes are documented or reconstructed, glaciers in the tropics can provide information about regional climate, its dynamics, and its evolution over decadal and centennial time scales. The glaciers on Mount Kenya capture a climate signal from the mid troposphere at about 5 km a.s.l., where our knowledge of climate change is scarce and controversial.\nWe use in-situ meteorological and glaciological observations to optimize and validate a physically-based, process-orientated energy and mass balance model to quantify the exchange processes between the glacier surface and the atmosphere above and to explore the sensitivity of energy and mass exchanges to changing climatic conditions. Currently the glacier loses mass due to the imbalance between insufficient accumulation and enhanced melt, because radiative energy gains cannot be compensated by turbulent energy sinks. Exchanging model input data with synthetic climate scenarios, which were sampled from the meteorological measurements and account for coupled climatic variable perturbations, reveal that the current mass balance is most sensitive to changes in atmospheric moisture (via its impact on solid precipitation, cloudiness and surface albedo). Scenarios with lower air temperatures are drier and associated with lower accumulation and increased net radiation due to reduced cloudiness and albedo.\nIf the scenarios currently producing positive mass balances are applied to Lewis Glacier's late 19th century maximum extent (L19), negative mass balances are the result, meaning that the conditions required to sustain the glacier in its L19 extent are not reflected in today’s observations. Alternatively, a balanced mass budget for the L19 extent can be explained by changing model parameters that imply a distinctly different coupling between the glacier’s local surface-air layer and its surrounding boundary layer. This result underlines the difficulty of deriving paleoclimates for larger glacier extents on the basis of modern measurements of small glaciers.",

By taking the ratio of amplitudes measured at two close-by locations, and by averaging over many recordings, we are able to isolate the receiver-side contribution from the effects of structures at the source and along the propagation path. The technique is applied to Rayleigh-wave data measured in the 35-375s period-range, allowing us to construct amplification maps sensitive down to ~250 km depth. We assess the eliability of the method by performing various tests based on synthetic data. Since surface-wave amplification depth kernels demonstrate a strong sensitivity to shear velocity and attenuation, we invert for these parameters. To that purpose, we invert the observed amplification dispersion curves to generate best-fitting radial profiles using a neighbourhood algorithm approach. We employ this set of techniques to several regions of geological interest, and interpret the results in terms of local mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Thin carbon foils play a critical role in the time-of-flight (TOF) and charge conversion subsystems used in many of the plasma sensors developed for space. These instruments take advantage of properties of the particle-foil interaction: charge conversion of neutral atoms and/or secondary electron emission. This interaction also creates several adverse effects for the projectile exiting the foil, such as angular scattering and energy straggling, that usually act to reduce the sensitivity and overall performance of an instrument. The magnitude of these effects varies with the incident angle, energy, and mass of the incoming projectile and the foil thickness. The thinnest foils flown typically have a nominal thickness (as specified by the manufacturer) of ~0.5 – 1 µg cm-2. In this presentation, we will summarize several studies that have quantified the properties of ions exiting the thin carbon foil and discuss recent work on graphene foils, a promising new technology that may be capable of mitigating the undesirable effects associated with these interactions.",

            "abstract": "It is believed that magma genesis of OIB is largely influenced by recycled oceanic crust component involved in the mantle plume (e.g., Hauri et al., 1996; Takahashi & Nakajima., 2002; Sobolev et al., 2007). Mallik & Dasgupta (2012) reported that the wall-rock reaction in MORB-eclogite and peridotite layered experiments produced a spectrum of tholeiitic to alkalic melts. However, the proper eclogite source composition is still under dispute. In order to figure out the geochemistry of recycled component as well as their melting process, we conducted a series of high-P, high-T experiments. Melting experiments (1~10hrs) were performed under 2.9GPa with Boyd-England type piston-cylinder (1460~1540°C for dry experiments, 1400~1500°C for hydrous experiments) and 5GPa with Kawai-type multi-anvil (1550~1650°C for dry experiments, 1350~1550°C for hydrous experiments), at the Magma Factory, Tokyo Tech. Spinel lherzolite KLB-1 (Takahashi 1986) was employed as peridotite component. Two basalts were used as recycled component: Fe-enriched Columbia River basalt (CRB72-180, Takahashi et al., 1998) and N-type MORB (NAM-7, Yasuda et al., 1994).\nIn dry experiments below peridotite dry solidus, melt compositions ranged from basaltic andesite to tholeiite. Opx reaction band generated between basalt and peridotite layer hindered chemical reaction. On the other hand, alkali basalt was formed in hydrous run products because H2O promoted melting process in both layers. Compared with melts formed by N-MORB-peridotite runs, those layered experiments with CRB are enriched in FeO, TiO2, K2O and light REE at given MgO. In other words, melts produced by CRB-peridotite layered experiments are close to alkali basalts in OIB and tholeiite in Hawaii, while those by layered experiments with N-MORB are poor in above elements. Thus we propose that Fe-rich Archean or Proterozoic tholeiite (BVSP 1980) would be a possible candidate for recycled component in OIB source.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is increasingly open to human activity due to rapid Arctic warming, associated with decreased sea ice extent and snow cover. While pollution from in-Arctic sources is currently low, oil and gas extraction and marine traffic could become a significant future source of short-lived pollutants (aerosols, ozone) in the Arctic. It is currently unclear if these local sources might become significant compared to the long-range transport of anthropogenic pollution from the midlatitudes, which is currently the main source of Arctic pollution.\nHere, we investigate the current (2012) and future (2050) impact of emissions from shipping and oil and gas extraction on Arctic aerosols and ozone, in relation to emissions from long-range transport. These impacts are determined by performing 6-month long, quasi-hemispheric simulations over the Arctic region with the WRF-Chem model. Our regional simulations include up-to-date representations of cloud/aerosol interactions and secondary organic aerosol formation developed recently for WRF-Chem. In order to determine the impact of Arctic shipping and oil and gas extraction, we use recent emission inventories by Winther et al., 2014 for local shipping and ECLIPSEv5 for oil and gas flaring. Both inventories suggest that current and future emissions from these sources are higher than previous estimates. Simulations are evaluated using measurements at Arctic surface sites and aircraft campaigns (ACCESS, YAK) in 2012. Model results are then used to assess the impact of Arctic shipping and oil and gas flaring on modeled surface aerosol and ozone concentrations, direct aerosol and ozone radiative effects, indirect aerosol radiative effects, and aerosol deposition. Results are used to determine if these local emissions are expected to have a significant influence on these quantities at the local or the regional scale, compared to emissions transported from the midlatitudes and to other emission sources, including boreal fires.",

These contributions come from a variety of sources, the most important being associated to the crossing effects of nutational terms and to the departures of the Earth rheology with respect to a perfect elastic model.\nTo compute them we work out this problem in a unified way within the Hamiltonian framework developed in Getino and Ferrándiz (2001). It allows a consistent treatment of these effects, since all the perturbations are derived from the same tide generating expansion and the crossing effects are rigorously obtained through Hori’s canonical perturbation method.\nThese analytical expressions are constructed by considering a two layer Earth model made up of an anelastic mantle and a fluid core, perturbed by the gravitational action of the Moon and the Sun. We discuss the origin and the magnitude of the different terms and determine their influence in the value of the Earth’s dynamical ellipticity, as well as the related indirect effects on the nutation series.",

            "abstract": "The breakup of Gondwana created the Somali and the Mozambique basins, two of the oldest ocean basins on earth. The relative movements between Africa and Antarctica-India-Madagascar created a sheared margin along the present day coastline of northern Mozambique and Tanzania. The N-S oriented offshore Davie Ridge is believed to have formed during these shear movements. Whether the Davie Ridge is of continental origin or has been formed by magmatic processes during the continental drift is unknown, because deep seismic sounding data are missing to describe the crustal fabric. Previous geophysical studies in this area are rare. From the 1970s and 1980s mainly seismic reflection data were acquired by French institutions across the ridge. Few dredge samples provided first evidence for a continental origin of the southern Davie Ridge.\nIn 2014, four east-west-orientated seismic refraction profiles as well as gravity and magnetic field data were collected across the Davie Ridge. Here, we present two P-wave velocity models across the Mozambican margin. The profiles are situated in the northern part (11.5° S) of the Davie Ridge and the transition (13° S) to the southern part where the topography vanishes. Each profile consists of 20 OBS/OBH systems with a spacing of about 9.5 km.\nAlong both profiles the total thickness of the sediments is about 5 km. The sediments show unusual high seismic velocities of 4.0-4.6 km/s below 3 to 4 km depth. In the northern profile, east of the Kerimbas Basin the crust is about 6 km thick with velocities from 5.5 to 6.6 km/s, which is most likely of oceanic origin. Towards the Mozambican coast the crust thickens to 15 km. The data indicate that the transition from stretched continental to oceanic crust is below the Kerimbas Basin. The southern profile shows a thinned crust (4 km) close to the shelf break. In the East, the crustal thickness is similar to the northern profile with slightly higher velocities up to 6.8 km/s.",

            "abstract": "The 'convective invigoration' hypothesis posits that aerosol affects precipitating clouds by delaying the onset of precipitation until the cloud has grown above the freezing level, making more efficient ice-phase precipitation processes available and leading to more intense precipitation than would have been produced by the same cloud in a less polluted atmosphere. In the IPCC AR5, evidence for a systematic aerosol effect on precipitation intensity (i.e., not limited to individual storms) is described as 'limited and ambiguous'.\nWe use a combined dataset of spaceborne radar (CloudSat) and lidar (CALIPSO) retrievals of precipitation and cloud thermodynamic phase to derive a climatology of rain occurrence from liquid-phase cloud ('warm rain') and ice-phase cloud ('cold rain'). The cloud-top phase of precipitating cloud serves as a proxy for rain intensity, with warm clouds preferentially producing drizzle and cold clouds preferentially producing more intense rain. This proxy is useful over land, where CloudSat does not retrieve precipitation intensity. In conjunction with aerosol data, the cloud-top phase can also be used to test convective invigoration; according to the hypothesis, increasing aerosols should lead to an increase in the cold-rain fraction.\nWe find that warm rain is extremely rare over the extratropical continents (1.5% of rain occurrences). Warm rain is rarer in the most polluted tercile of observations (measured by reanalysis dry AOD) over wide areas of land and ocean outside the tropics, consistent with expectations under the convective invigoration hypothesis. (In the tropics, the effect is reversed, presumably due to wet scavenging.) Extrapolating the observed relationship between warm-rain fraction and reanalysis dry AOD to preindustrial conditions shows a large anthropogenic aerosol influence on precipitation over the extratropical continents. We propose this as evidence supporting the convective invigoration hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The Nemuro Group in the northeasternmost part of Japan represents forearc basin deposits of the Proto-Kuril arc that consist of Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene sedimentary rocks with andesitic volcaniclastics and alkaline lavas. Their occurrence in this setting is unusual because such alkaline lavas and intrusions are not commonly found in forearc environments. Here, we report new petrological and geological data to discuss the nature of magmatic process involved in their petrogenesis. Pillow and massive lava flows represent subaqueous volcanic activity, and the occurrence of inter-pillow sedimentary units indicates their eruption on unconsolidated sediments of the lower Nemuro Group. Sill intrusions with layered structures and thicknesses ranging from 10 to 130 m are also common widely distributed in the Nemuro Group. Major and trace element chemistry and mineralogical data distinguish the analyzed samples as K-rich alkaline rocks with low TiO2 or Nb contents, analogous to island arc-like tholeiites. These K-rich alkaline rocks can be classified into two groups of shoshonites: shoshonites containing olivine phenocrysts and intruding into the lower Nemuro Group (Group 1), and shoshonites with no olivine and making up the middle part of the Nemuro Group (Group 2). Group 1 shoshonites have higher MgO, Cr and Ni contents than those of Group 2. The bulk-rock composition of Group 2, which has lower MgO contents, shows higher SiO2 than that of Group 1. Such compositional differences possibly represent fractional crystallization of magmas between Groups 1 and 2. Based on the limited available data, we conclude that these alkaline rocks intruding into the Nemuro Group represent arc-shoshonites, and that the Group 1 magmas underwent fractional crystallization to produce the Group 2 magmas.",

However, the ages of the magmatism have not been well constrained. We measured in situ U-Pb zircon ages using LA-ICP-MS technique. Two welded tuffs at the western part of the structure gave 171.3 ± 2.6 (95% confidence level hereafter) Ma (n=18) and 173.4 ± 4.6 Ma (n=3). Four granitic rocks within the structure gave 170.5 ± 5.2 Ma (n=8), 171.3 ± 2.6 Ma (n=18), 172.3 ± 1.9 Ma (n=19) and 172.3 ± 3.7 Ma (n=10). The age data indicate coeval volcanism and plutonism of early Middle Jurassic, supporting the caldera interpretation.\nThe early Middle Jurassic granitic plutons are widespread in South Korea and form NE-SW or NNE-SSW belts. Only those in the Bupyeong structure are associated with volcanic rocks, indicating that they are shallow level intrusions, while others are deeper level ones. This observation is well supported by aluminum-in-hornblende geobarometric data of previous works, in that granites near the Bupyeong structure have lower emplacement pressure (<4 kb), compared with those in other areas (5-8 kb). In summary, the Bupyeong structure may have formed outside of main orogenic zone during the Daebo (Jurassic) orogeny.",

To date, those calls have found little substantial traction, and politicians and the general public are instead engaged in a debate about the causes and effects of climate change that bears little resemblance to the state of scientific knowledge. Uncertainty plays a pivotal role in that public debate, and arguments against mitigation are frequently couched in terms of uncertainty. We show that the rhetorical uses of scientific uncertainty in public debate by some actors (often with vested interests or political agendas) contrast with the mathematical result that greater uncertainty about the extent of warming is virtually always associated with an increased risk: The expected damage costs increase as a function of uncertainty about future warming. We suggest ways in which the actual implications of scientific uncertainty can be better communicated and how scientific uncertainty should be understood as an impetus, rather than a barrier, for climate mitigation.",

Meanwhile, low CaO and Sr contents and remarkable negative Eu anomaly indicates fractionation crystallization of plagioclase.\nZircon U–Pb dating yieldes a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 131.7 ± 2.2Ma and 130.6 ± 1.2Ma for the Machebu granite, 134.4 ± 2.1 Ma for the Shenzhongwu granite and 131.9 ± 1.2 Ma for the Daixi granite. εHf(t) values of zirons in these plutons gradually increase from south to north from -14.5 ~ -3.5 for the Machebu granite to -1.5 ~ -0.2 for the Shenzhongwu granite and to 5.1 ~ 8.6 for the Daixi granite, suggesting the important role of juvenile material in the magma source from south to north. Combination of variable zirocn εHf(t) values and TDM2(Hf) ages (1861 - 577 Ma), whole rock εNd (t) (-4.3 ~ -0.5) and the estimated high temperatures (795 - 844 °C) suggests that these granites could have been formed by partial melting of Proterozoic metamorphic basement triggered by asthenosphere upwelling-related basaltic underplating.\nCombining our data with the literature data, we suggest that the A-type granites along the zonal distribution from the northern Zhejiang Province maybe corresponding to subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during 130-135Ma.",

The monsoons are changing under the global changes, and then impact the vegetation growth. However, the vegetation phenology in this area are difficult to describe, where the “V”-shaped seasonal growth trajectories of tropical monsoon forests are totally different from the normal seasonal trajectories such as the boreal forests.\nIn this paper, a “V”-shaped curve is proposed to simulate the “V”-shaped seasonal trajectory. Current extractions of the onset of greenness are not suitable for “V”-shaped seasonal trajectory, which are seriously affected by the gaps in the rapid growth stage due to the heavy rain. For its insensitivity to the gaps or noise, the whole “V”-shaped curve was used to determine the phenology of tropical monsoon forest, and the lowest point in “V”-shaped curve was regarded as the phenology. The extracted phenology was showed to be correlated with the precipitation, and the validations with ground observations demonstrated that this new methodology has the ability to extract the phenology of tropical monsoon forest correctly. These phenology maps of tropical monsoon forest assist to understand the impact of climate changes in the monsoon regions.",

            "abstract": "With unprecedented speed and extent, the future climate change can be expected to severely impact terrestrial ecosystems due to more frequent extreme events, such as droughts or heat waves. What will be the impacts of these extreme events on ecosystem functioning and structure? How far will net primary production be reduced by such events? What will be the impact on plant mortality? Could such events trigger changes in the abundance of plant species, thus leading to biome shifts?\nIn this contribution, we propose to use ISI-MIP2 model historical simulations from the biome sector to analyse the response of ecosystems to droughts or heat waves, trying to understand the differences between several vegetation models (e.g. CARAIB, HYBRID, LPJ). The analysis will focus on Europe. It will compare and assess the model responses for a series of well-marked drought or heat wave events in the simulated historical period, such as those that occurred in 1976, 2003 or 2010. This analysis will be performed in terms of several important environmental variables, like soil water and hydric stress, runoff, PFT abundance, net primary productivity and biomass, fire frequency, turnover of soil organic matter, etc. Whenever possible, the response of the model will be compared to available data for the most recent well-marked events. Examples of data to be used are eddy covariance, satellite data (including leaf area and fire occurrence) or tree rings.",

However, GCM outputs are too coarse to apply at a small basin scale. GCM outputs provide only daily precipitation data that are inadequate to analyze a small or medium basin because only few or several hours are used to determine the peak flows after it rains. Therefore, in the current study, we downscale the outputs to hourly time scale over South Korea for climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and illustrate the spatiotemporal distribution of downscaled hourly precipitation. Furthermore, the hydrological application of downscaled scenarios is conducted for its hydrological responses employing a distributed rainfall-runoff model, Vflo.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant that was funded by the Korean Government (MEST) (2015R1A1A1A05001007).",

In this study we report on ultra-low (1 mHz to ~10 Hz) and very-low (10 Hz to ~ 4 kHz) frequency wave activity measured by the four satellites during several crossings of the dusk equatorial magnetopause. Since the Larmor radius of magnetosheath protons is of the order of 50 km, this inter-satellite distance allows us to investigate in detail the physics of the magnetopause at proton scales including current structures related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as well as other energy transfer processes. From wave polarization analysis, we characterize the different types of emissions and discuss different mechanisms of heating and acceleration of particles. In particular, we focus on the electron heating by kinetic Alfvén waves and lower hybrid waves and the electron acceleration by oblique whistler mode waves, which have been suggested as possible mechanisms from previous Cluster and THEMIS measurements.",

            "abstract": "With climate change being one of the most severe challenges to rural Africa in the 21st century, West Africa is facing an urgent need to develop effective adaptation and mitigation measures to protect its constantly growing population. WASCAL (West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) is a large-scale research-focused program designed to enhance the resilience of human and environmental systems to climate change and increased variability. An integral part of its climate services is the provisioning of a new set of high resolution, ensemble-based regional climate change scenarios for the region of West Africa.\nIn this contribution, we present the overall concept of the WASCAL regional climate projections and provide information on the dissemination of the data. We discuss the model performance over the validation period for two of the three regional climate models employed, the Weather Research & Forecasting Tool (WRF) and the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling Model COSMO in Climate Mode (COSMO-CLM), and give details about a novel precipitation database used to verify the models. Particular attention is paid to the representation of the dynamics of the West African Summer Monsoon and to the added value of our high resolution models over existing data sets. We further present results on the climate change signal obtained from the WRF model runs for the periods 2020-2050 and 2070-2100 and compare them to current state-of-the-art projections from the CORDEX project.\nAs an example, the figure shows the different climate change signals obtained for the total annual rainfall with respect to the 1980-2010 mean (WRF-E: WASCAL 12km high-resolution run MPI-ESM + WRFV3.5.1, CORDEX-E: 50km medium-resolution run MPI-ESM + RCA4, CORDEX-G: 50km medium-resolution run GFDL-ESM + RCA4).",

            "abstract": "What is the impact of the segmentation on the propagation and therefore size of major earthquakes in continental domains such as the Himalayan arc? During the last decades, several studies suggested crustal structures vary laterally along the Himalayan arc. However, the lack of paleoseismological data in key areas, such as Bhutan and the major NE-SW Yadong cross structure, hampered progress in that line of research. Here, we address this issue using paleoseismological investigations and Bayesian stratigraphic modeling from two trenches in central Bhutan. Our trench results reveal that Bhutan has been struck by at least two great earthquakes that ruptured the Main Frontal Thrust in 1713 and in medieval times. The total cumulative vertical slip reaches at least 10 m. Combined to previously published works carried out in Central Nepal, Sikkim and Assam our study supports the potential occurrence of either i) a giant earthquake between AD 1107 and AD 1141 with a surface rupture extending from central Nepal to Assam or ii) a sequence of great earthquakes along the Himalayan arc between AD 1025 and AD 1547. Following several studies on the relation between segmentation and rupture area of great subduction earthquakes, we propose to interpret our results in terms of segmentation of the Himalayan arc. Indeed, the Yadong cross structure acts as a barrier to the propagation of the rupture for great earthquakes (e.g. the AD 1713 earthquake). Conversely, giant earthquakes such as the medieval event could cross this structure and rupture more than one segment. In the case of a unique medieval earthquake along the Himalayan arc, the 800-km-length-rupture can produce an event with a magnitude in the range of 8.7-9.1.",

            "abstract": "The scaling of ductile rheology within the lithospheric crust can be examined as the progressive aggregation of point and line defect motion and interaction that culminates in the cooperative behavior of grain boundaries and like interfaces. Even though the role of interfaces in mediating defect motion, and in turn macroscopic ductility, is well recognized, many details of interface structure and function remain unresolved. As a contribution to the latter, grain boundary phenomena studied by transmission electron microscopy are described from different pressure-temperature conditions (greenschist to granulite grade) in concert with the macroscopic deformation response. In generally, the interfaces have important differences from classic models based on metals and simple non-metals. The combination of crystal-chemical complexity and compositional heterogeneity of crustal materials is reflected in grain boundary features that include classic coincident-boundary types, grain boundary ledges, finite width interfaces, grain boundary cavitation, dislocation-diffusion metamorphic effects and intra-/ intercrystalline defect interactions. The need to establish the range of interface phenomena is seen in the fact that grain boundary activity is the primary factor in grain-size sensitive (GSS) flow where grain size is in effect an easily observable proxy for the fractional grain boundary area (volume) of the material.",

This error is examined through simulation of diffuse and direct irradiance arriving at a detector with a cosine-response foreoptic. Emphasis is placed on assessing total error over the solar shortwave spectrum from 250nm to 4500nm, as well as supporting investigation over other relevant shortwave spectral ranges. The total measurement error introduced by sensor tilt is dominated by the direct component. For a typical high latitude albedo measurement with a solar zenith angle of 60◦, a sensor tilted by 1, 3, and 5◦ can respectively introduce up to 2.6, 7.7, and 12.8% error into the measured irradiance and similar errors in the derived albedo. Depending on the daily range of solar azimuth and zenith angles, significant measurement error can persist also in integrated daily irradiance and albedo.",

            "abstract": "PickUp Ions (PUIs) are typically characterized by (1) their almost exclusively single charge state, (2) a highly non-thermal and anisotropic Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) [Drews et al., 2015], and (3) an extended source population of neutral atoms somewhere between the observer and the Sun. The origin of pickup ions ranges from sources only several solar radii away from the Sun, the so-called inner-source of pickup ions, up to a distance of several hundreds of astronomical units, the local interstellar medium. Their continuous production inside the heliosphere and complex interactions with the magnetized solar wind plasma leads to the development of non-thermal, anisotropic features of both the solar wind and pickup ion velocity distribution functions.\nIn this study, we present observations of the VDF of He+, C+, N+, O+ and Ne+ pickup ions with PLASTIC on STEREO A. We have found a PUI flux increase during perpendicular configurations of the local magnetic field that is generally linked to the existence of a so-called torus-distribution [Drews et al., 2015] which is attributed to the production of PUIs close to the observer. A comparison of the PUI VDF between radial and perpendicular configurations of the local magnetic field vector is used to quantify the anisotropy of the PUI VDF and thereby enables us to estimate the mean free path for pitch-angle scattering of He, C, N, O and Ne pickup ions without the necessity of an over-simplified heliospheric model to describe the PUI phase space transport. Our results show a clear signature of a C+ torus signature at 1 AU as well as significant differences between the anisotropies of the He+ and O+ VDF. We will discuss our results in the light of recent studies about the nature of the inner-source of PUIs [Berger et al., 2015] and observations of the 2D VDF of He+[Drews et al., 2015].\nFigure Caption: Velocity space diagrams of a pickup ion torus distribution as a (vx-vy)-projection (top left panel) and in the vz = 0 km/s plane (top right) are shown for magnetic configuration in which B is almost perpendicular. The bottom two panels show the torus distribution under the influence of pitch-angle scattering (right) and adiabatic cooling (left). To illustrate the torus character of the distribution the (vx-vy)-plane is slightly tilted in this diagram.",

            "abstract": "Multipurpose water resource systems are usually operated on a tradeoff of the operating objectives, which - under steady state climatic and socio-economic boundary conditions – is supposed to ensure a fair and/or efficient balance among the conflicting interests. Extreme variability in the system’s drivers might affect operators’ risk aversion and force a change in the tradeoff. Properly accounting for these shifts is key to any rigorous retrospective assessment of operators’ behavior and the associated system’s performance. In this study, we explore how the selection of different optimal tradeoffs among the operating objectives is linked to the variations of the boundary conditions, such as, for example, drifting rainfall season or remarkable changes in crop and energy prices. We argue that tradeoff selection is driven by recent, extreme variations in system performance: underperforming on one of the operating objective target value should push the tradeoff toward the disadvantaged objective.\nTo test this assumption, we developed a rational procedure to simulate the operators’ tradeoff selection process. We map the selection onto a multi lateral negotiation process, where different multiple, virtual agents optimize different operating objectives. The agents periodically negotiate a compromise on the operating policy. The agent’s rigidity in each negotiation round is determined by the recent system performances according to the specific objective it represents. The negotiation follows a set-based egocentric monotonic concession protocol: at each negotiation step an agent incrementally adds some options to the set of its acceptable compromises and (possibly) accepts lower and lower satisfying policies until an agreement is achieved. We apply this reiterated negotiation framework on the regulated Lake Como, Italy, simulating the lake dam operation and its recurrent updates over the last 50 years. The operation aims to balance shoreline flood prevention and irrigation deficit control in the downstream irrigated areas. The results of our simulated negotiations are able to accurately capture the operator’s risk aversion changes as driven by extreme wet and dry situations, and to well reproduce the observational release data.",

            "abstract": "Combating metal pollution in surface water is a major environmental, public health and economic issue. Knowledge of the behavior of metals, such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) in sediments and dissolved load, is a key factor to improve the management of rivers. Recent advances in mass spectrometry related to the development of MC-ICPMS allow to analyze the isotopic composition of these elements, and previous studies show the effectiveness of isotopic analyses to determine the anthropogenic sources of pollution in environment. The goal of this study is to use the Cu-Zn-Pb multi-isotopic signature to track the pollutions in surface water, and to understand the complex processes causing the metals mobilization and transport in environment. More particularly we investigate the mechanisms of distribution between the dissolved load and particulate load, known to play an important role in the transport of metals through river systems. As case study, we chose a small watershed, poorly urbanized in the Loire river basin. Its spring is in a pristine area, while it is only impacted some kilometers further by the releases rich in metals coming from a hospital water treatment plant. First a sampling of these liquid effluents as well as dissolved load and sediment from upstream to downstream was realized and their concentrations and isotopic data were determined. Then to simulate a lot of potential natural and anthropogenic modifications of environmental conditions, we made sequential extraction protocol using various reagents on the sediments. Isotopic analyzes were performed also on the various extracting solutions. Isotopic ratios were measured using a Neptune MC-ICPMS at the BRGM, after a protocol of purification for Zn and Cu. The results showed that, these isotopic systematics reveal important informations about the mechanists of mobilization and transport of metals through river systems. However experiments performed under laboratory conditions will be necessary to complete this study.",

            "abstract": "For buoyant LNAPLs (Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids), fluctuating water table conditions significantly influence capillary-held mass above and below the water table and the quantity of mobile free product floating on the water table. Risks posed by such a dynamic LNAPL source zone vary over time as water tables oscillate from say tidal influences, seasonality or other anthropogenic influences. Whist LNAPL dynamics are evident at field scale, measurements of say LNAPL thickness variation in a well are not very revealing of the actual source zone dynamic nature and point to the importance of lab visualization and modelling studies. We report on the recently completed lab phase of our study in which 2-D sand tanks have been used to visualize hydrocarbon LNAPL redistribution under transient water table conditions, particularly cyclic oscillations. We have developed a fully automated system to: i) Program cyclic water table fluctuations via Raspberry PiTM based electronics; ii) Dynamically monitor the saturation distributions of all fluids (red-dyed-LNAPL, blue-dyed-water and air phase by difference) using high temporal frequency and spatial resolution multi-spectral photography; and iii) Efficiently interpret the imaged data produced via multi-spectral image analysis. Such automated data acquisition and processing has permitted the LNAPL release and its redistribution under oscillating water table conditions to be shown in vivid short video formats of original images and contoured fluid saturations. We present a series of these videos secured under a variety of sand-tank scenarios that aim to understand the controlling influences of fluctuation amplitude and frequency, the influence of lower permeability heterogeneities, and the significance of LNAPL release timing relative to water table position. Our preliminary interpretations of these data will be presented alongside our discussion of the implications for characterization and remediation of LNAPL contaminated sites.\nKeywords: Multi-phase flow, LNAPL, water table, sand tank, visualization, multi-spectral photography",

This emission line is observed during the different orbit phases of MAVEN : disk observations at apoapsis, limb scans at periapsis and coronal scans during the outbound orbit leg. The atomic oxygen density which is an important parameter to understand the heating, composition, dynamics of the Martian upper atmosphere and the temperature at 200 km are retrieved from an automatic inversion algorithm. A set of observations performed by IUVS during the first months of the mission are analyzed to study the variabiity of the atomic oxygen in the Martian upper atmosphere. The derived oxygen density and the temperature at the exobase are in the predicted range (107  - 108 cm-3; 200 – 300K) by the current thermospheric models of Mars. The derived parameters are very sensitive to the absolute calibration of the instrument which is the main source of uncertainty on the results presented.",

            "abstract": "Superconducting gravimeters have been deployed at numerous observatories around the world especially for geodetic and geophysical purposes. Thanks to their high sensitivity to mass transport of any form and a sufficient temporal resolution, these instruments are increasingly used in hydrological studies including inter-comparisons with global hydrological models and GRACE products. However, the contribution of the local zone significantly exceeds the remaining regional and global effects that are essential for such inter-comparisons. Nevertheless, intense large scale hydrological phenomena propagate into local variations and, therefore, are observable by gravimeters hundreds of kilometres apart.\nIn this study, we analyse time series of a selected group of superconducting gravimeters in Europe with a focus on common features related to large scale hydrological variations. The common signals are inferred using combination of various global hydrological models, in-situ hydro-meteorological observations and gravity time series corrected for non-hydrological effects. A special emphasis is put on extreme non-periodic variations. In this regard, we investigate the benefits of superconducting gravimeters in terms of their use for deriving drought and floods indices, over traditional hydrological observation techniques and global models that are utilized for individual hydrological compartments rather than total water storage variations. In addition, we discuss the detectability of identified large scale hydrological variations by GRACE.",

            "abstract": "Political economy and institutional changes regarding land use play crucial role in shaping land cover worldwide. Among such events was the Soviet Virgin Lands Campaign, when 45.2 million ha of virgin steppes were ploughed up from 1954 to 1963 in northern Eurasia. We took opportunity to evaluate carbon (C) costs of this Campaign, particularly with the account of massive cropland abandonment in the former Campaign area after demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. Within cropland mask produced with remotely sensed data, we spatially disaggregated historical annual sown area statistics at the provincial level for Russia and Kazakhstan based on cropland suitability assessment. We also adjusted our cropland allocation model with the use of 1:3,000,000 map depicting cropland expansion in Northern Kazakhstan. We used C bookkeeping approach to assess C dynamics based on soil stratification and C field measurements. The Campaign resulted in huge C losses from soils, which accounted for 611±47 Mt C in Russia and 241±11 Mt C in Kazakhstan for upper 0-50 cm soil layer during the first 20 years of cultivation. Such C losses could be compared with C losses due to plowing up the prairies in the mid-1930s in USA. Despite the huge C losses from soils during the Campaign, the total C budget in soils of both countries at national level was positive after 1991 due to sequestered C on abandoned lands, albeit the patterns of C loss during the Campaign and C sink in post-Soviet period differed. The C sink from 1991 to 2010 on abandoned croplands in Russia (45.5Mha) comprised 976±108Mt C and Kazakhstan (12.9Mha) comprised 240±34Mt C. However, already ongoing recultivation of abandoned cropland in Kazakhstan and already planned such activities in Russia, can release stored C on abandoned lands. Our study highlights the importance of environmental evaluation of such governmental programs and their alternatives, particularly, since such programs are not rare events in modern land-use history.",

            "abstract": "Flexural rigidity estimates across a wide range of subduction zones reveal that oceanic plates rapidly weaken as they bend and pass through the outer-rise region into the trench. Inherently, the magnitude of weakening reflects the forces acting on the plate, which drive deformation through plastic yielding and brittle faulting. These forces include those acting to drive (slab pull) or resist (bending, plate coupling) subduction, which vary significantly through long-term (millions of years) changes in slab structure and dynamics. The forces also vary on seismic time-scales as indicated by changes in outer-rise seismicity characteristics before and after great earthquakes in many regions. As the rheology of the downgoing-overriding plate interface plays a first-order role in governing great earthquake seismicity, a quantifiable relationship may exist between large-scale slab weakening and the strength of the subduction interface.\nHere, we assess this relationship using high-resolution, thermal-mechanical models of the Tonga subduction zone. Rather than developing subduction through time-dependent processes, these models use a cross-sectional slice (2-D) through the Tonga subduction zone as an initial condition in order to approximate the modern forces driving and resisting subduction. Consequently, deformation patterns develop over short (< 0.1 Myr) time-scales, allowing a direct comparison to measurements of flexural rigidity. We define a rheologically distinct, 1 km thick zone between the downgoing and overriding plate. The properties of this zone are varied to examine a range of interface strengths, including fixed (Von Mises), pressure (Mohr-Coulomb) and velocity-dependent rheologies. We then quantify the relationship between variations in subduction interface strength on these time-scales and the corresponding changes in the flexural rigidity of the subducting plate.",

            "abstract": "Mercury’s surface is markedly darker than is predicted from its major element composition. The major spectral unit lowest in reflectance, known as low-reflectance material (LRM), is typically seen in material excavated by impact craters. This observation has been taken as evidence that Mercury’s darkening phase is endogenous. The MESSENGER Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) acquired spatially resolved measurements of three distinct LRM deposits during the low-altitude campaign that was conducted near the end of MESSENGER’s orbital mission. The GRNS data reveal increases in thermal neutron count rates that are spatially correlated with the LRM deposits. The only element consistent with the neutron measurements and with the spectral reflectance of LRM at visible to near-infrared wavelengths is graphitic carbon, at an abundance that is 1–3 wt% higher than in surrounding non-LRM material. We infer that C is the primary darkening agent on Mercury, and that the LRM sampled C-bearing material within the crust. This interpretation supports the hypothesis that a graphite floatation crust formed on Mercury from an early global magma ocean, and we propose that its impact-gardened remains persist beneath the volcanic plains units that comprise the planet’s present upper crust. The distribution of LRM on Mercury’s surface requires numerous, discontinuous LRM source regions, as would be expected for the remains of the primordial crust given the disruptive effects of the late heavy bombardment and eons of intrusive magmatism.",

            "abstract": "Human activities can alter the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from lands to streams and rivers, which can lead to widespread environmental and ecological consequences. DOM is known to act as a master variable regulating important biogeochemical processes, such as protecting aquatic biota from UV, influencing states and transports of ecotoxins and trace metal pollutants, and serving as basal substrate and energy sources for heterotrophic food webs. Therefore, effective management decisions should include DOM monitoring and characterizations, while relevant data to inform how to monitor and regulate watershed exports of DOM, remain surprisingly scarce. In particular, it is still unclear whether human activities change DOM in systematic fashions that the changes can be unambiguously stated and quantitatively defined. We synthesized previous findings on anthropogenic alterations in the amount, source, and qualityof DOM in streams and rivers across geographic regions. While highlighting difficulties in unambiguously linking human activities and freshwater DOM characteristics, we observed that human activities can lead to opposite changes in DOM characteristics, depending on hydrological variation and watershed size. This synthesis represents the first step towards establishing a framework to predict and manage terrestrially derived DOM in human impacted streams and rivers.",

            "abstract": "This study explores when, where and how the spatial variations of gross primary productivity (GPP) and water table depth (WTD) are linked at the global scale. Latest observation-based global datasets, at a relatively high resolution of ~10 km (5 arc-minutes), are used to analyse spatial partial correlations between GPP and WTD. Results indicate that strength, direction, and spatial distribution of the partial correlation change with climate, vegetation cover, and seasonal availability of precipitation and radiation. Shallower water table depth is associated with larger GPP (negative correlation) in 14.3-23.9% of the global land area in different seasons. Such negative correlations between GPP and WTD seem to prevail in arid to temperate climatic regions with crop, shrub, or Savanna vegetation covers. These regions often have WTD shallower than 15-20 m. Positive correlations, on the other hand, mostly occur in relatively humid forested regions, suggesting that large water uptake by tree roots decreases groundwater recharge and thus draws the water table down. Gradients of primarily positive to primarily negative correlations are arranged along decreasing tree cover, and increasing coverage of plants with C4-photosynthesis. This possibly indicates that the water use efficiency of ecosystems may also play a critical role in determining productivity-groundwater relationships.",

            "abstract": "Benefiting by the multicomponent seismic acquisition and processing techniques, the applications of converted waves in petroleum exploration is thus highlighted. A converted (C-) wave is initiated by a downward traveling P-wave that is converted on reflection to upcoming S-waves. Ascribing to its origins, C-wave takes the behaviors of P- and S-wave and becomes as one of the popular seismic attributes in the studies of a fractured reservoir. Making use of the scaled physical model, we aim on inspecting the azimuthal Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) of C-wave in a reservoir of vertically aligned fractures. In order to facilitate the objective of this study, reflection experiments were carried out on the orthogonal plane of a Horizontal Transversely Isotropic (HTI) model which is created to simulate a fractured reservoir. In laboratory manipulation, acoustic energy is triggered by a P-type transducer and the reflected energy is received an S-type transducer to detect the reflected energy, i.e. C-waves, originating by mode conversion. From fracture strike to facture normal, end-on shooting reflections were acquired from seven different directions. The angular interval in between the successive observation is 15 degrees. While viewing into the reflection profiles, events of P-, C1- and C2-waves can be readily identified. In the acquired profiles, the P-wave AVO is clearly observed and the phenomenon of C-wave splitting is revealed by the separation of traveltime-distance curves of C1- and C2-waves. However, it is aware of that the C-wave amplitudes are not simply varied or attenuated with offset in each observation. The complicated behaviors of C-wave AVO could be caused by the amount of energy, which is incident angle dependent, in reflected S-waves. Hence, our results indicate that the azimuthal C-wave AVO might not be a reliable seismic signature which can be used to delineate the fracture orientation of a fractured reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructed changes in seawater calcium and magnesium concentration ([Ca2+], [Mg2+]) predictably affect the ocean’s acid/base and carbon chemistry. Yet inaccurate formulations of chemical equilibrium “constants” are currently in use to account for these changes. Here we develop an efficient implementation of the MIAMI Ionic Interaction Model (Millero and Pierrot, 1998) to predict all chemical equilibrium constants required for carbon chemistry calculations under variable [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] (Hain et al., 2015). We investigate the impact of [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] on the relationships among the ocean’s pH, CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), saturation state of CaCO3 (Ω), and buffer capacity. Increasing [Ca2+] and/or [Mg2+] enhances “ion pairing,” which increases seawater buffering by increasing the concentration ratio of total to “free” (uncomplexed) carbonate ion. An increase in [Ca2+], however, also causes a decline in carbonate ion to maintain a given Ω, thereby overwhelming the ion pairing effect and decreasing seawater buffering. Given the reconstructions of Eocene [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] ([Ca2+]~20mM; [Mg2+]~30 mM), Eocene seawater would have required essentially the same DIC as today to simultaneously explain a similar-to-modern Ω and the estimated Eocene atmospheric CO2 of ~1000 ppm. During the Cretaceous, at ~4 times modern [Ca2+], ocean buffering would have been at a minimum. Overall, during times of high seawater [Ca2+], CaCO3 saturation, pH, and atmospheric CO2 were more susceptible to perturbations of the global carbon cycle. For example, given both\nEocene and Cretaceous seawater [Ca2+] and [Mg2+], a doubling of atmospheric CO2 would require less carbon addition to the ocean/atmosphere system than under modern seawater composition. Moreover, increase in seawater buffering since the Cretaceous may have been a driver of evolution by raising energetic demands of biologically controlled calcification and CO2 concentration mechanisms that aid photosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "Increased reactive nitrogen (N) deposition is traditionally expected to increase net primary production (NPP), but continued retention of N deposition may saturate the ecosystem capacity to store N and cause some dark side effects on ecosystems, like soil acidification and the limitation of other nutrient. However, those dark side effects of nitrogen deposition have not been well quantified based on experimental evidences.\nWe synthesized nitrogen deposition experiments in the world and conducted three meta-analysis studies. By compiling a dataset from 44 studies with at least three levels of N addition treatment, we found an universal saturation response of NPP to N addition gradient in terrestrial ecosystems. The N saturation threshold for NPP was at the N addition rates of 4-5 g m-2 yr-1 on average across all the ecosystems. However, ecosystem types and environmental factors largely impacted the saturation response patterns and the N thresholds. By synthesizing 106 studies that monitored soil pH and base cations under N enrichment, we quantified global soil acidification caused by N addition. On average, N addition significantly reduced soil pH by 0.26, but the magnitude varied with ecosystem types, N addition rate, N fertilization forms, and experimental durations. Environmental factors such as initial soil pH, soil carbon and nitrogen content, precipitation, and temperature all influenced the N responses of soil pH. Global soils are now at a buffering transition from base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) to non-base cations (Mn2+ and Al3+). This calls our attention to care about the limitation of base cations and the toxic impact of non-base cations for terrestrial ecosystems with N deposition. By comparing the phosphorus limitation on biomass productions between the ambient and elevated N conditions, we found a stronger P limitation induced by N enrichment.\nOverall, the results indicate that the beneficial effect of N deposition on ecosystem productivity will reduce quickly and the dark side effects should be cautious with continuous N enrichment.",

The hydrophones in the Pacific ocean have recorded earthquakes along the EPR from May 1996 to April 2002. Our investigation focused on four transform faults: Wilkes, Siqueiros, Gofar and Clipperton. Our analysis revealed that all of the four transform faults are associated with numerous foreshocks or/and aftershocks of mainshocks with magnitude M ~ 5 or greater. And the seismicity on the fault present segmented state on the fault or on the hook between transform fault and the ridge. First we fit the aftershocks time durations of more than 100 mainshocks with magnitude M > 4.5. Results of the analyses revealed the following: (1) The aftershock duration ta of the investigated mainshocks ranges from about 5.5 days to about 3.1 years。The seismicity rate immediately following a mainshock event, R0, varies from about 10 to 511, corresponding to average error of 10.7 % and the maximum error of 33.3 %, respectively. In addition, we calculate the rate between background seismicity, r, at each fault segment. Results revealed that the logarithm of R0/r correlate with logarithm time duration of aftershocks but with almost no relation to the mainshock magnitude. We also calculated the energy accumulation of earthquakes on each segment of the transform faults. The cumulated energy differed from each other: Earthquake energy released in the last 6 years (from 1996 to 2002) are valuated at from 1.7×1019 N∙m/km on the Siqueiros Transform Fault, to 2.2×1017 N∙m/km on the Clipperton. Segments on each fault are calculated to have similar energy release. Together these investigations helped to advance our understanding of the earthquake mechanism and geodynamics of fast-slipping oceanic transform faults.",

            "abstract": "Major events of vegetation changes and soil erosion occurred in Central Africa during the last few millennia, at a time when the first farmers settled in the rainforest. The palaeoclimatic context in which these environmental changes took place still remains poorly constrained. Improving our knowledge on the drivers of past hydrological variability in Central Africa is important to further evaluate the relative role of climate versus humans in shaping late Holocene African landscapes. In this study, we have used neodymium (Nd) isotopes in a marine sediment core to reconstruct the composition of the sediment load exported from the Congo Basin during the Holocene. Core KZR23 was recovered at 2200 m water depth from within the Congo submarine canyon and is characterized by high sedimentation rates (about 2m/kyr), thereby allowing reconstruction of past river sediment discharge at an unprecedented high temporal resolution. A suite of river particulate samples collected from the main tributaries within the Congo watershed was analyzed in order to tag each major sub‐basin with the characteristic geochemical and Nd isotopic signatures of its source region. In parallel, an annual series of suspended particles sampled on a monthly basis at the Congo River ORE‐HYBAM station (Brazzaville) was also analyzed to characterize the seasonality of sediment provenance in relation with present hydrological cycle. Using Nd isotopes as tracers for sediment provenance together and other proxy data for past erosion, vegetation and rainfall patterns (i.e. bulk sediment radiocarbon data, pollens, biomarkers, compound‐specific isotope analyses), we will provide a more comprehensive picture of past hydrological variability in the Congo Basin for the Holocene period.",

            "abstract": "Stochastic slip modelling based on general scaling features with uniform slip probability over the fault plane is commonly employed in tsunami and seismic hazard. However, dynamic rupture effects driven by specific fault geometry and frictional conditions can potentially control the slip probability. Unfortunately dynamic simulations can be computationally intensive, preventing their extensive use for hazard analysis. The aim of this study is to produce a stochastic model that incorporates slip features observed in dynamic simulations.\nTaking a Tohoku-like fault as a case study, numerous 2d spectral element dynamic simulations are performed using a variety of pre-stress distributions. Comparing the slip distributions generated from these simulations to traditional stochastic slip models we find that the stochastic models generally under represent slip near the free surface. This is an important feature in tsunami hazard with very large slip at shallow depth observed for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. To incorporate dynamic features in the stochastic modeling we generate a depth dependent “transfer function” based on comparisons between the dynamic and stochastic models. Assuming that the differences between stochastic and dynamic slip distributions are predominantly depth dependent and not along strike, the transfer function is then applied to stochastic source models over a 3d geometry of the Tohoku fault. Comparing maximum tsunami wave height along the Japanese coast using a traditional stochastic model and one modified by the transfer function we find that the inclusion of the transfer function leads to the occurrence of more extreme events.\nApplying this function to the traditional stochastic slip distribution as a depth-dependent PDF for the slip may allow for an approximated but efficient incorporation of regionally specific dynamic features in a modified source model, to be used specifically when a significant number of slip scenarios need to be produced, e.g. for probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis (PTHA).\nThis research is funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe).",

It is well known that magnetic reconnection plays important role in space plasma phenomena such as substorm in earth magnetoshere. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach has been used for studies of that phenomenon, in which some traditional models for a resistivity with the assumption of dependence of current or magnetic field, or with no physical reason are adopted for MHD simulations of magnetic reconnection. Moritaka and Horiuchi (2008) obtained the anomalous resistivity model based on the wave-particle interaction by using two dimensional (2D) particle in cell (PIC) simulation. We carry out substorm simulation using a global MHD code with the effective resistivity model evaluated in their study. We notice that “time dependence of a coefficient” is taken into account when applying this model to the investigation in MHD framework. In this work, we compare two kind of effective resistivity models, the one based on the wave particle interaction and the other based on steady collisionless driven reconnection (Horiuchi and Den, et al. 2013) by reproducing substom phenomena with 3D global MHD simulations.",

            "abstract": "We applied Strontium stable isotope ratio, 87Sr/86Sr, to detect the hydrological pathways of the bedrock groundwater and considered the relationship between their contribution and the spatial scales in 4 experimental watersheds. 87Sr/86Sr value in water will be higher when the water contact with more weathered material. This characteristics is suitable to consider the pathways within the bedrock.\nThe bedrock material in Kiryu Experimental Watershed (KEW, 5.99ha) and Fudoji Experimental Watershed (FEW, 2.34 ha) is granite. The bedrock seepages from the outcrop along the mainstream were observed at KEW. On the other hand, the bedrock spring was observed at FEW. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the bedrock spring was larger than those of the bedrock seepages, and this fact means the pathways for the bedrock spring are more weathered than those for the bedrock seepages. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the bedrock seepages were larger than the values of stream waters observed in the subcatchments of KEW, and the value in streamwater increased from up- to downstream within KEW. Thus, the bedrock seepages may contribute to the stream. Based on the isotope mass balance and the observation of discharge rate, we estimated the 87Sr/86Sr of the unknown component which contribute to the stream. The estimates were similar to the values of bedrock seepages, but different from the value of the bedrock spring. Moreover, at the wide-area watersheds of KEW (236ha) and FEW (427ha), the 87Sr/86Sr of waters flowing in each mainstream were less affected by the contribution of tributaries and were relatively stable around the values of the estimated 87Sr/86Sr. Therefore, the contributions of the bedrock seepages are especially important for the spatial scaling at granite mountains.\nAt the other two watersheds, Hiruzen Experimental Forest (HEF, 117ha, tuff breccia bedrock) and Hodaka Hirudani Experimental Basin (85.1ha, complicated by volcanic- and sedimentary rocks), the contribution of groundwater increased at the downstream, however, the 87Sr/86Sr values were not converged. These facts suggest the existence of deeper pathways within the bedrock in these two sites compared to the sites with granite. Strontium isotope is a useful tool to show the pathways within the bedrock, and to consider the scaling problems of the runoff generation processes.",

            "abstract": "The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta lies at the junction between the Indian Plate, Eurasian Plate, and Burma Platelet. In eastern Bangladesh, the delta is colliding with the Indo-Burman Foldbelt, the northward continuation of the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone. Crustal structure related to subduction of the thick sediment of the delta, which has prograded 300-400 km past the edge of the Indian craton, remains enigmatic. The large impedance contrast between the sediments of the delta and the underlying basement produces phase conversions for a number of regional earthquakes. We investigate these conversions using data collected between February 2007 and December 2014 from three deployments of a portable array of seismographs, supplemented by several permanent seismic stations. Using measured arrival time differences between S-to-P (sP) converted phases and direct S wave arrivals from regional earthquakes, we calculate basement depths at multiple locations across the delta. Results reveal thickening of sediments across the Indian continental margin hinge zone to 15-16 km with greater depths where flexural loading from the foldbelt and Shillong Massif have downbent the crust. Some additional conversions occur within the sediment column, possibly off the megathrust detachment in places. These calculated sediment thicknesses also inform models of crustal structure used in regional moment tensor inversions.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a rich source of data for the monitoring of spatial and temporal dynamics of geo-physical processes. However, single-sensor systems are constrained by their inherent characteristics in the spatial and temporal domains due to the limitation of the technology. To obtain images high in both spatial and temporal resolutions, a number of image fusion algorithms, such as STARFM and ESTARFM, have recently been developed. However, ESTARFM assumes a single rate of change over the entire time period while STARFM assumes a linear trend of change over two points in time. Such assumption of land-cover changes over a study period is in general unrealistic. Furthermore, existing methods have not taken into consideration the correlation information contained in the time-series of a phenomenon under study, which is instrumental to the fusion process. Therefore, to capitalize on information available in a fusion process, I propose to develop a Bayesian data fusion (BDF) approach to the fusion of remotely sensed data as an estimation problem where the fused image is to be estimated by employing a first order observation model, and then by combining the correlation and the change-tendency information in the time-series images in the form of joint distribution, and also by including the prior information of the desired image. On the basis of a general formulation, we have tested it with both simulated data and actual Landsat/ MODIS acquisitions in this study. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method out-performs STARFM and ESTARFM, especially for heterogeneous landscapes. It produced surface reflectances with the highest correlations to the reference Landsat images.",

            "abstract": "Irazú and Turrialba are active arc volcanoes located at the southeastern terminus of the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA). These volcanoes have been considered in literature as “twin volcanoes” or as a linked volcanic system. Effectively their proximity may lead to the assumption that they share a common plumbing system, but geochemical data on rocks and fluids reveal a more complicated framework. In this study, we analyzed the rock chemistry of a selected suite of eruptive products emitted in the last 50ka from Irazú volcano, including products from the 1963-1965 eruption. We also analyzed He-Ne-Ar isotopes in fluid inclusions hosted in olivines and pyroxenes hand-picked from these products, and we compared our results with those available for Irazú and the neighboring Turrialba.\nRock samples from Irazú are basalts to andesites with MgO content ranging between 3 and 8 wt%, with a variability that follows typical trends of fractional crystallization. The pattern of trace elements is subduction-related with an OIB-like component, testified by an unusual enrichment (e.g., K, REE; e.g., Benjamin et al., 2007 and references therein), associated with the subduction of the Galapagos seamounts. In addition, Turrialba volcano shows the presence of andesites with adakite-like affinity (Di Piazza et al., 2015) which is not observed in rocks from Irazú . The 3He/4He ratio measured in olivine crystals from Irazú varies from 7.1 to 7.5 Ra, overlapping the measurements performed in surface gases (7.2 Ra; Fischer et al., 2002). This range is also comprised in the measurements carried out in gases and rocks from Turrialba (7.0-8.1 Ra; Di Piazza et al., 2015), which showed the presence of a MORB- and OIB-like component at the mantle source. Based on these evidences, we propose that the mantle beneath Irazú reflects an intermediate composition respect to the extreme components recognized at Turrialba. Irazú shows more typical arc-like geochemical signatures, whereas Turrialba is located behind the main volcanic front.",

            "abstract": "Detection methods are usually developed to observe earthquakes, and are not relevant to observe long event with emergent signals (e. g. event with long source duration). We present a new method to detect and localize seismic events without prior information about their source. This method explores the consistency and characteristic behavior of teleseismic body waves recorded by a large-scale seismic network. We show that the use of a seismic network as an antenna is a powerful tool to analyze sources without the need to pick phases arrivals. This allows the characterization of low amplitude events that compose the noise.\nThe procedure consists of three steps. First, for every tested source location we perform a time-slowness analysis and compute the Tau-p transform from the dataset. For waves emitted by teleseismic sources, the amplitude of this transform has a very characteristic behavior with maxima corresponding to different seismic phases arrivals. Relative location of these maxima on the time-slowness plane strongly depends on the distance to the earthquake. In a second step, we convolve the Tau-P amplitude with a time-slowness filter whose maxima are computed based on prediction of global travel-time calculator (Buland and Chapman, 1983) in order to explore this dependence. As a third step we gather the results obtained with different sources to get a space/time likelihood function for the occurrence of a seismic event. This process is performed at different frequency bands to observe possible variations in time.\nWe apply this method to continuous vertical-component seismograms of USArray. We highlight non earthquake events that occurred during 2010. We then compare our results with datasets of stations closer to the events and a numerical model for ocean low frequency noise. We identify several low frequency microseisms occurring all along the year.",

The main results are shown as follows: The haze frequency over Suzhou is 30.9% with the frequency of 18% for the slight haze, 7.8% for the light haze, 3.1% for the moderate haze and 2.0% for the heavy haze. The haze frequency shows an obvious diurnal variation with a peak (valley) value at the local solar time around 08:00~09:00 am (14:00~16:00pm).The haze happens much more frequent in nighttime than in daytime. The atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) associated with haze also shows a clear diurnal variation. The mean ABLH over Suzhou during the period of haze is more (less) than 1000m (500m) in daytime (nighttime). Meanwhile, the ABLH during the period of haze is higher in summer than in winter. In addition, the mean ABLH during the period without (with) haze is around 700m (500m) in winter. The diurnal variation of the ABLH during the period of moderate to heavy haze in winter ranges from 350m to 500m, which is less than the winter mean ABLH by 50~150m.\nKEY WORDS: Micro-Pulse Lidar; haze frequency; moderate and heavy haze；atmospheric boundary layer height",

In seismology, this technique has recently been introduced to improve common detection algorithms, like STA/LTA ratio or cross-correlation methods. Mainly used for the monitoring of volcanic activity, this study is one of the first applications to seismic signals induced by geomorphologic processes. With an array of eight broadband seismometers deployed around the steep Illgraben catchment (Switzerland) with high-level erosion, we studied a sequence of landslides triggered over a period of several days in winter. A preliminary manual classification led us to identify three main seismic signal classes that were used as a start for the HMM automated detection and classification: (1) rockslide signal, including a failure source and the debris mobilization along the slope, (2) rockfall signal from the remobilization of debris along the unstable slope, and (3) single cracking signal from the affected cliff observed before the rockslide events. Besides the ability to classify the whole dataset automatically, the HMM approach reflects the origin and the interactions of the three signal classes, which helps us to understand this geomorphic crisis and the possible triggering mechanisms for slope processes. The temporal distribution of crack events (duration > 5s, frequency band [2-8] Hz) follows an inverse Omori law, leading to the catastrophic behaviour of the failure mechanisms and the interest for warning purposes in rockslide risk assessment. Thanks to a dense seismic array and independent weather observations in the landslide area, this dataset also provides information about the triggering mechanisms, which exhibit a tight link between rainfall and freezing level fluctuations.",

However, adjustments to flood return levels made assuming fixed increases of sea level are also inaccurate when applied to sea level that is rising over time at an uncertain rate. To accommodate both the temporal dynamics of SLR and their uncertainty, we develop an Average Annual Design Life Level (AADLL) metric and associated SLR allowances [1,2]. The AADLL is the flood level corresponding to a time-integrated annual expected probability of occurrence (AEP) under uncertainty over the lifetime of an asset; AADLL allowances are the adjustment from 2000 levels that maintain current risk. Given non-stationary and uncertain SLR, AADLL flood levels and allowances provide estimates of flood protection heights and offsets for different planning horizons and different levels of confidence in SLR projections in coastal areas. Allowances are a function primarily of local SLR and are nearly independent of AEP. Here we employ probabilistic SLR projections [3] to illustrate the calculation of AADLL flood levels and allowances with a representative set of long-duration tide gauges along U.S. coastlines.

            "abstract": "Measuring glacier mass balance is important as it directly reflects the climatic forcing on the glacier surface. Today, repeated comparison of digital elevation models (DEMs) is a popular and widely used approach to derive surface elevation, volume and mass changes for a large number of glaciers. In high-mountain environments, airborne laser scanning (ALS) techniques currently provide the most accurate and highest resolution DEMs on the catchment scale, allowing the computation of glacier changes on an annual or even semi-annual basis. For monitoring individual glaciers though, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is easier and more cost-efficiently applied on the seasonal timescale compared to ALS. Since most recently, the application of the latest generation of ultra-long-range near infrared TLS systems allows the acquisition of surface elevation information over snow and ice of unprecedented quality and over larger zones than with previous near infrared TLS devices.\nAlthough very small glaciers represent the majority in number in most mountain ranges on Earth, their response to climatic changes is still not fully understood and field measurements are sparse. Therefore, a programme was set up in 2012 to monitor both the seasonal and annual surface mass balance of six very small glaciers across the Swiss Alps using the direct glaciological method. As often nearly the entire surface is visible from one single location, TLS is a highly promising technique to generate repeated high-resolution DEMs as well as to derive seasonal geodetic mass balances of very small ice masses.\nIn this study, we present seasonal surface elevation, volume and geodetic mass changes for five very small glaciers in Switzerland (Glacier de Prapio, Glacier du Sex Rouge, St. Annafirn, Schwarzbachfirn and Pizolgletscher) derived from the comparison of seasonally repeated high-resolution DEMs acquired since autumn 2013 with the new ultra-long-range TLS device Riegl VZ-6000. We show the different processing steps necessary to derive geodetic glacier changes from the raw data (the TLS point clouds), comment on the accuracy of our results and compare them to very dense in-situ measurements, and thus investigate the potential of our approach to circumvent laborious and time consuming glaciological mass balance measurements of very small glaciers.",

            "abstract": "The timing and magnitude of Spring snowmelt events impact riverine flooding and inform reservoir operations. While the melt water volume is a primary concern, the timing of the snowmelt is also important. Melt timing determination is challenging because snowpack ripening observations are seldom available. Diurnal Amplitude Variation (DAV) is a method that uses remotely sensed passive microwave observations to determine snowpack ripening and snowmelt onset. Previous studies have successfully used the DAV method in northern latitudes. This study evaluates the ability of the DAV approach to be used to determine melt onset dates in mid-latitudes. The analysis is conducted for 675 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the United States. The Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – EOS (AMSR-E) products are used to calculate the DAV signal at each location. Methods for determining the melt onset date at each station are presented and applied to all pixels in the United States. Preliminary results will also be presented which characterize the DAV derived melt onset timing for the United States using the long-term SSM/I record.",

            "abstract": "Despite its small size, the Earth's inner core plays an important role in the Earth's dynamics. Because it is slowly growing, its structure – and the variation thereof with depth – may reveal important clues about the history of the core, its convection and the resulting geodynamo. Learning more about this structure has been a prime effort in the past decades, leading to discoveries about anisotropy, hemispheres and heterogeneity in the inner core in general. In terms of detailed structure, mainly seismic body waves have contributed to these advances. However, at depths between ~100–200 km, the seismic structure is relatively poorly known. This is a result of the PKP core phase triplication and the existence of strong precursors to PKP phases, whose simultaneous arrival hinders the measurement of inner core waves PKIKP at epicentral distances between roughly 143–148°. As a consequence, the interpretation of deeper structure also remains difficult. To overcome these issues, we stack seismograms in slowness and time, separating PKP and PKIKP phases which arrive simultaneously, but with different slowness. We apply this method to study the inner core's Western hemisphere between South and Central America using paths travelling in the quasi-polar direction between epicentral distances of 140–150°. This enables us to measure PKiKP-PKIKP differential travel times up to greater epicentral distance than has previously been done. The resulting differential travel time residuals increase with epicentral distance, indicating a marked increase in seismic velocity with depth compared to reference model AK135 for the studied polar paths. Assuming a homogeneous outer core, these findings can be explained by either (i) inner core heterogeneity due to an increase in isotropic velocity, or (ii) increase in anisotropy over the studied depth range. Our current data set cannot distinguish between the two hypotheses, but in light of previous work we prefer the latter interpretation.",

            "abstract": "We derived the three dimensional P wave velocity model for the uppermost 14 km of crust in the southern Korea peninsula using travel-time data from local earthquakes which are recorded by two nation-wide seismic networks operated by Korea Meteorological Administration and Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources. Earthquakes in the study occurred between 2001 and 2014. 19,935 P wave arrivals from 747 earthquakes observed by 184 seismic stations are selected for the 3-D tomographic inversion. In order to secure best possible data for tomography inversion, we applied a strict criteria during the selection of earthquakes and travel-times. The study area is parameterized by 10km×10km×4km grid for velocity inversion and 1km×1km×1km grid for travel time calculations. Checkerboard resolution test are used to demonstrate the ray coverage and the resolution for the given station-event configurations. The results indicate P-wave velocity model at shallow depths less than 2 km are not properly resolved mainly due to the insufficient ray coverage. The model at deeper depths greater than 14 km also suffered by lack of ray coverage. Thus, we limit our interpretations of the preliminary P wave velocity model to areas that are illuminated by enough rays. P wave velocity model indicates there are significant lateral velocity variations across the southern Korea peninsula. Most distinguished feature in the velocity model is the higher velocity anomaly beneath the southeastern Korea peninsula. The anomaly regions is distinguished by well-defined tectonic boundary. At 8 km depth, lower velocity anomaly is observed in Gyeonggi massif and high-mountain regions in the southern Korea peninsula. The 3-D velocity model is compared with geophysical and geological observations.",

            "abstract": "Due to the extensive urbanization in the Po Plain in northern Italy, rivers need to be managed to alleviate flooding problems while maintaining an appropriate aquifer recharge under an increasing percentage of impermeable surfaces.\nDuring the PO PLain Experiment field campaign in July 2015 (POPLEX 2015), both active and under-construction infiltration basins have been surveyed and analyzed to identify appropriate satellite observations that can be integrated to ground based monitoring techniques. A key strategy is to have continuous data time series on water presence and level within the basin, for which ground based monitoring can be costly and difficult to be obtained consistently.\nOne of the major and old infiltration basin in the central Po Plain has been considered as pilot area. The basin is active from 2003 with ground based monitoring available since 2009 and supporting the development of a calibrated unsaturated-saturated two-dimensional numerical model simulating the infiltration dynamics through the basin.\nA procedure to use satellite data to detect surface water change is under development based on satellite radar backscatter data with an appropriate incidence angle and polarization combination. An advantage of satellite radar is that it can observe surface water regardless of cloud cover, which can be persistent during rainy seasons. Then, the surface water change is correlated to the reservoir water stage to determine water storage in the basin together with integrated ground data and to give quantitative estimates of variations in the local water cycle.\nWe evaluated the evolution of the infiltration rate, to obtain useful insights about the general recharge behavior of basins that can be used for informed design and maintenance. Results clearly show when the basin becomes progressively clogged by biofilms that can reduce the infiltration capacity of the basin by as much as 50 times compared to when it properly works under clean conditions.",

A global understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol optical properties is necessary for assessment of it. Oceans cover about 70% of the Earth’s surface and produce a large quantity of natural aerosols.\nThe new shipborne aureolemeter was developed to improve the sun-tracking performance for accurate measurements of not only direct but circumsolar radiation, even on a vessel weltering. Sun position is determined by a real-time image processing system with a CCD camera. A round shape is extracted from the captured image. The position of the center of gravity of the round shape is used as the sun position. The accuracy of the sun paosition determination is finer than 0.01˚. The radiometer is tracked the sun under a feedback control with the derived sun position. For a sky radiance distribution measurement, the control target position on the CCD camera image is shifted a pixel corresponding to a measuring scattering angle. In the case of a scattering angle larger than 7˚, the radiometer’s tracking is conducted under feedforward control on the basis of the angle of roll and pitch monitored with a gyroscope. To decide the solid angle of the radiometer, the radiance around the sun was measured in the angle range between the sun and sensor directions from -1.5˚ to +1.5˚ with 0.1˚ resolution. The instrument constants were determined from a Langley plot method. Now, we are conducting a comparison observation between the developed shipborne aureolemeter and an existing sky radiometer.",

This sealing layer surrounds the canisters and experiences an initial drying due to the heat produced by HLRW and a successive re-saturation with fluid from the host rock. These complex thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes interact and were investigated in laboratory column experiments using MX-80 clay pellets as well as a mixture of 35% sand and 65% bentonite.\nThe aim of this study is to both understand the individual processes taking place in the buffer materials and to identify the key physical parameters that determine the material behavior under heating and hydrating conditions. For this end, detailed and process-oriented numerical modelling was applied to the experiments, simulating heat transport, multiphase flow and mechanical effects from swelling.\nFor both columns, the same set of parameters was assigned to the experimental set-up (i.e. insulation, heater and hydration system), while the parameters of the buffer material were adapted during model calibration. A good fit between model results and data was achieved for temperature, relative humidity, water intake and swelling pressure, thus explaining the material behavior. The key variables identified by the model are the permeability and relative permeability, the water retention curve and the thermal conductivity of the buffer material. The different hydraulic and thermal behavior of the two buffer materials observed in the laboratory observations was well reproduced by the numerical model.",

Prior to this designation, the lake was a water supply reservoir for the adjacent and now abandoned Green Valley Coal Mine (Operating from 1948-1963). The Green Valley Coal Mine property continues to produce excess acidity despite reclamation efforts. The former mine property and the lake are connected by a channel that discharges acidic drainage directly into Green Valley Lake. To evaluate temporal variability in metal and phosphorus (P) geochemistry, two short cores were collected in spring 2014 (38cm) and spring 2015 (39cm). Metal concentrations were determined by a hand-held X-ray fluorescence analyzer after the samples had been dried and crushed. Approximately 20% of these metal concentrations will be verified by ICP-OES following extraction in 50% aqua regia. Detailed P geochemistry was determined using a sequential extraction technique (SEDEX).\nThe sediments in Green Valley Lake are characterized by heavy metal concentrations that are elevated above typical background levels. These metals tend to be concentrated near the sediment water interface, often 3-5 times greater than the average concentration for the rest of the core, which suggests that they are diagenetically mobile and possibly diffusing out of the sediments under dysoxic to anoxic conditions and returning to the sediments under oxic conditions. Total sedimentary P averages 57 umol/g, but oscillates between 20 - 110 umol/g. The most dramatic shift in the detailed P geochemistry is the significant reduction of mineral P at 15 cm and the increasing importance of oxide-associated and adsorbed P upcore. Diatom assemblages suggest that the lake has become increasingly more eutrophic over time. As nutrient loads continue to increase, the oxygen depleted zone may expand impacting fish populations and changing water geochemistry significantly, in particular, mobilizing heavy metals.",

The data were recorded by stations from three previous temporary seismic arrays deployed on the islands during 1993-1995, 2001-2002, and 2009-2010. Receiver functions were calculated with an iterative deconvolution in the time domain. We used an H-k stacking method to get preliminary Moho depth estimates under the island arcs, after assuming constant seismic average crustal P velocity. We also determined the shear wave velocity structure beneath each station from a 1-D combined inversion of receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curves from ambient noise cross correlation at 8s – 20s and teleseismic surface waves at 20s-90s. The joint inversion models reveal that the Moho beneath the main islands of the Fiji plateau is 26-31 km deep, whereas the crust under the outer islands - including the Lau Ridge - is generally thinner, with Moho depths of 21-23.5 km. The thinnest crust (16 km) is found beneath Moala Island located between the Fiji Platform and the Lau Ridge. Crustal thickness beneath several Tonga islands is about 18-20 km. A relatively high velocity lithosphere (Vs of 4.4 – 4.5 km/s) extends to only about 60 km depth beneath the outer Fiji Islands and Lau Ridge, but to depths of 90 km underneath the main islands of the Fiji Plateau. The much thicker crust and lithosphere of the Fiji plateau relative to the Lau Ridge and Tonga Arc reflects its much longer geological history of arc crust building, going back to the early Miocene.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the CO2 budget in glass inclusions containing a shrinkage bubble has become an important topic with the development of methodology based on microthermometry and micro-Raman measurements [1]. It is possible to determine CO2 in the shrinkage bubble and to calculate the bulk inclusion+bubble CO2 content, but should the methodology be refined for natural glass inclusion samples in a volcanic arc context ? We attempt to use the method for quantifying the major gas output (CO2, H2O, S, Cl) and understanding the evolution of gas mixture from melt and vapor at San Cristóbal volcano in the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) by taking into account for the first time volatile contents of < 15 - 35 µm glass inclusions by using high spatial resolution/sensitivity NanoSIMS 50L ion microprobe. The presented approach focus on 16 - 527 ppm CO2 content in uncorrected glass inclusions with the presence of a shrinkage bubble and the added CO2 content could range between 550 - 1630 ppm. H2O in the bubble (1-X µm) was quantified with a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 micro-Raman spectrometer instrument by developing a curve spectrum correction method to isolate and put into evidence the Raman-Water-Liquid band from the glass-water band background, and by estimating their mass and volume with 1 µm imagery precision. Inside the glass inclusions, NanoSIMS multi-elements intensity imagery allowed to visualize the region where the intersected bubble is found and it should be avoided when programming NanoSIMS spots on the inclusion surface. Carbonates peaks were also detected along the vapor bubble walls by Raman and may be associated with unstable C-phases with a variety of low-°T minerals detected by SEM [2]. The presence of such low °T mineral phases must represent important low °T superficial and hydrothermal effects and may alter the CO2 budget estimation of primary melts at San Cristóbal.\n[1] Moore et al., 2015, Am.

            "abstract": "The last half century has witnessed considerable glacier melt that has led to the formation of large glacial lakes. These glacial lakes typically form behind terminal moraines comprising loose boulders, debris, and soil, which are susceptible to fail and cause a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). These lakes also act as a heat sink that accelerates glacier melt and in many cases is accompanied by rapid areal expansion. As these glacial lakes continue to grow, their hazard also increases due to the increase in potential flood volume and the lakes’ proximity to triggering events such as avalanches and landslides. Despite the large threat these lakes may pose to downstream communities, there are few detailed studies that combine satellite imagery with hydraulic models to present a holistic understanding of the GLOF hazard. The aim of this work is to assess the GLOF hazard of glacial lakes in Nepal using a holistic approach based on a combination of satellite imagery and hydraulic models. Imja Lake will be the primary focus of the modeling efforts, but the methods will be developed in a manner that is transferable to other potentially dangerous glacial lakes in Nepal.",

            "abstract": "Diffusive flux of methane to the atmosphere from freshwater lakes is thought to be better understood than the more stochastic ebullitive (bubble) flux. Simple models describing the flux are largely driven by wind speed and surface water concentrations. Rooted in 3 seasons of direct open water chamber measurements at Inre Harrsjön, a small and shallow lake located in the subarctic region of Sweden, we present a comparison between measured exchanges and those calculated from several piston velocity models ran at varying temporal resolutions, as well as a method to increase precision in modeled results.\nOn a majority of days the calculated piston velocities, per day, exceeded lake average depth. Under such conditions it is unlikely that the surface concentration can remain fixed. The result is that high piston velocities will effectively alter the gas content of the shallow lake, unless the sediment-to-lake flux matches the lake-to-atmosphere flux. Initial model runs using fixed surface concentrations confirmed this with seasonal averages of up to four times the up-scaled chamber measurements.\nIn an attempt to compensate for the lake’s inability to keep up with predicted fluxes, the fixed lake surface concentration was abandoned for variable wind-dependent lake surface concentrations. By inverting the gas exchange equation a required, or ideal, lake surface concentration - the concentration required by the models to match the measured fluxes at a given wind speed - could be obtained for dates where both wind and chamber measurements were available. These ideal concentrations were plotted as function of wind.\nLinear and exponential functions describing the wind-dependent surface concentrations were used in subsequent runs, completely replacing the static concentration approach. We found that incorporation of variable wind-driven lake surface concentration into the models greatly improved the accuracy of seasonal diffusive flux estimates, reducing the apparent error to as low as 1%. We suggest that this method may be useful in other similar lakes to obtain a better estimate of seasonal diffusive methane fluxes.",

            "abstract": "CryoSat was a planned as a 3 year mission with clear mission objectives to allow the assessment rates of change of thickness in the land and marine ice fields with reduced uncertainties with relation to other non-dedicated missions. Although CryoSat suffered a launch failure in Oct 2005, the mission was recovered with a launch in April 2010 of CryoSat-2. The nominal mission has now been completed, all mission requirements have been fulfilled and CryoSat has been shown to be most successful as a dedicated polar ice sheet measurement system demonstrated by nearly 200 peer reviewed publications within the first four years of launch. Following the completion of the nominal mission in Oct 2013 the platform was shown to be in good health and with a scientific backing provided by the ESA Earth Science Advisory Committee (ESAC) the mission has been extended until Feb 2017 by the ESA Programme Board for Earth Observation. Though not designed to provide data for science and operational services beyond its original mission requirements, a number of services have been developed for exploitation and these are expected to increase over the next few years. Services cover a number of aspects of land and marine ice fields in addition to complementary activities covering glacial monitoring, inland water in addition to coastal and open ocean surface topography science that CryoSat has demonstrated world leading advances with. This paper will present the overall concept for a potential low-cost follow-on to the CryoSat mission with the objective to provide both continuity of the existing CryoSat based data sets, i.e., longer term science and operational services that cannot be provided by the existing Copernicus complement of satellites. This is, in part, due to the high inclination (92°) drifting orbit and state of the art Synthetic Aperture Interferometer Radar Altimeter (SIRAL). In addition, further improvements in performance are expected by use of the instrument timing and digital hardware developments used in the Sentinel-6/Jason-CS Poseidon-4 design. It is expected that the mission will also provide data for global ocean services complementary to those of the other Sentinel 3 and 6 missions. With the current planning the development of the potential is expected to commence during 2016 launch in the 2021 time frame.",

Using the Finnish Meteorological Institute's hybrid-Vlasov model Vlasiator (http://vlasiator.fmi.fi), which couples kinetic ions through Vlasov's equation with charge-neutralizing fluid electrons, the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction is modeled self-consistently in two spatial and three velocity dimensions. Recent polar plane simulations with southward IMF cover both the dayside and nightside reconnection sites, in a volume ranging from about 40 Earth radii (RE) upstream in the solar wind to about one hundred RE tailward.\nDayside reconnection at the magnetopause results in the formation of the two-dimensional equivalents of flux transfer events. These magnetic islands are accelerated and move from the subsolar region towards the cusps and beyond. In doing so, they generate fast-mode waves which propagate throughout the magnetosheath and can lead to significant perturbations in the bow shock shape and position. We investigate such simulated events and their signatures in the magnetosheath, at the bow shock and in the foreshock. We also analyze observational data to find similar signatures in spacecraft measurements.",

In this context, a global vulnerability assessment methodology is currently being developed in France to bring adequate tools for local territories to manage flood risk. This study addresses the question of the quantification, the qualification and the choice of these vulnerability indicators for a given territory. This work aims to propose a classification of nearly 40 of these indicators in terms of their relative impacts on the risk level estimated on two territories:\nChalon-sur-Saône (Saône river)\nGaronne estuary (Garonne and Dordogne rivers, and Atlantic ocean)\nThrough these cases study, 3 different spatial scales have been compared: the Prés-Saint-Jean district inside Chalon (0.6 km²), the city of Ambès (28.8 km²) and Chalon with its suburbs (72.2 km²).\nA principal component analysis (PCA) was applied and indicated a threshold in terms of urban impacts between the different flood scenarios. On Chalon, the PCA discriminates 2 groups of flood and highlighted a threshold between T20 and T50. A partial least-square regression (PLS) was computed to make predictions on vulnerability indicators values modelled on new flood scenarios. Their results were is useful to identify the most relevant vulnerability indicators as a function of their flood exposure. These statistical analysis aims to highlight the relationship between a variable of exposure level (hydrologic impact: water levels and flow velocity) with spatialized vulnerability indicators in a 100 m grid (e.g., population, job, etc.). Finally, to get a hierarchy of variables depending on their impact on the risk level, an ANOVA was computed. The selection of variables was performed with a stepwise selection to assess contributions of each dependant variable on the F-statistic as they are added to or removed from the model.",

            "abstract": "The interior of East Antarctica is often regarded as a coherent Archean craton surrounded by Paleo to Neoproterozoic orogenic belts. Here we use recent aerogeophysical, satellite magnetic, satellite gravity and passive seismic results in central East Antarctica to challenge this view.\nFirstly, anomalously thick crust (compared to most other cratons) has been imaged in East Antarctica by both passive seismic and gravity modelling with values up to 60 km (Ferraccioli et al., 2011, Nature; An et al., 2015, JGR). The thick crust underlies both the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and an elevated region between Lake Vostok and Dronning Maud Land, referred to as the East Antarctic Mountain Ranges plateau (An et al., 2015).\nSecond, satellite magnetic data reveal that the Gamburtev Province lies in between the Ruker/Princess Elizabeth Land, Vostok, Nimrod/South Pole and Recovery provinces. The Nimrod/ South Pole province is a Paleo to Meso Proterozoic igneous province formed along the edges of the Archean/Paleoproterozoic Mawson continent (e.g. Goodge and Fanning, 2010 JGR). Our aerogeophysical and sediment provenance data interpretations suggest that the Gamburtsev Province represents a distinct Grenvillian-age orogenic belt.\nA stalled orogen with thick crust (i.e. an orogen where widespread orogenic collapse and root delamination has not occurred)- is preserved in the interior of East Antarctica resembling e.g. the Paleoproterozoic Trans Hudson Orogen and segments of Grenvillian orogens in Laurentia. The stalled orogen may relate to widespread accretionary and collisional events within Rodinia. However, passive seismic interpretations (An et al., 2015) favour linking crustal thickening to the Pan-African age assembly of Greater India, East Antarctica and Australia within Gondwana (e.g. Aitken et al., 2014 GRL).\nFurther aerogeophysical observations over Princess Elizabeth Land are timely to enable more robust correlations with geological observations and to help dating the proposed orogenic events further in the interior. Additionally, future plans to drill the bedrock in the Gamburtsev Mountains and South Pole regions may provide a new glimpse into the subglacial geology of the composite East Antarctic Craton.",

Nevertheless, precise and regular vertical profile measurements are currently still missing from the observing system. To address this need, an original and innovative atmospheric sampling system called AirCore has been developed at NOAA (Karion et al. 2010). This new system allows balloon measurements of GHG vertical profiles from the surface up to 30 km.\nNew versions of this instrument have been developed at LMD: a high-resolution version “AirCore-HR” that differs from other AirCores by its high vertical resolution and two “light” versions (lower resolution) aiming to be flown under meteorological balloon. LMD AirCores were flown on multi-instrument gondolas along with other independent instruments measuring CO2 and CH4 in-situ during the Strato Science balloon campaigns operated by the French space agency CNES in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency in Timmins (Ontario, Canada) in August 2014 and 2015.\nFirst, we will present comparisons of the vertical profiles retrieved with various AirCores (LMD and Frankfurt University) to illustrate repeatability and impact of the vertical resolution as well as comparisons with independent in-situ measurements from other instruments (laser diode based Pico-SDLA). Second, we will illustrate the usefulness of AirCore measurements in the upper troposphere and stratosphere for validating and interpreting vertical profiles from atmospheric transport models as well as observations of total and partial column of methane and carbon dioxide from several current and future spaceborne missions such as: ACE-FTS, IASI and GOSAT.",

These models have sharpened up mantle images and unveiled relatively small scale structures that were blurred out in previous generation models. Fingerlike structures have been found at the base of the oceanic asthenosphere, and vertically oriented broad low velocity plume conduits extend throughout the lower mantle beneath those major hotspots that are located within the perimeter of the deep mantle large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). While providing new insights into our understanding of mantle dynamics, the detailed morphology of these features, requires further efforts to obtain higher resolution images.\nThe focus of our ongoing effort is to develop advanced tomographic methods to image remote regions of the Earth at fine scales. We have developed an approach in which distant sources (located outside of the target region) are replaced by an equivalent set of local sources located at the border of the computational domain (Masson et al., 2014). A limited number of global simulations in a reference 3D earth model is then required. These simulations are computed prior to the regional inversion, while iterations of the model need to be performed only within the region of interest, potentially allowing us to include shorter periods at limited additional computational cost.\nUntil now, the application was limited to a distribution of receivers inside the target region. This is particularly suitable for studies of upper mantle structure in regions with dense arrays (e.g. see our companion presentation Clouzet et al., this Fall AGU). Here we present our latest development that now can include teleseismic data recorded outside the imaged region. This allows us to perform regional waveform tomography in the situation where neither earthquakes nor seismological stations are present within the region of interest, such as would be desireable for the study of a region in the deep mantle. We present benchmark tests showing how the uncertainties in the reference 3D model employed outside of the target region affects the quality of the regional tomographic images obtained.",

            "abstract": "River classification and the derived knowledge about river systems have been relying until recently on discontinuous field campaigns and visual interpretation of aerial images. For this reason, building a regional vision on river systems based on a systematic and coherent set of hydromorphological indicators was, and still is, a research challenge. Remote sensing data, since some years, offer notable opportunities to shift this paradigm offering an unprecedented amount of spatially distributed data over large scales, such as regional. Here, we have implemented a river characterization framework based on color infrared orthophotos at 40 cm and a LIDAR derived DTM at 5 m acquired simultaneously in 2009-2010 for all Piedmont Region Italy (25400 kmq). 1500 km of river systems have been characterized in terms typology, geometry and topography of hydromorphological features. The framework delineates the valley bottom of each river course, and maps by a semi-automated procedure water channels, unvegetated and vegetated sediment bars, islands, and riparian corridors. Using a range of statistical techniques the river systems have been segmented and classified with an objective, quantitative, and then repeatable approach. Such regional database enhances our ability to address a number of research and management challenges, such as: i) quantify shape and topography of channel forms for different river functional types, and investigate their relationships with potential drivers like hydrology, geology, land use and historical contingency; ii) localize most degraded and better functioning river stretches so to prioritize finer scale monitoring and set quantifiable restoration targets; iii) provide indication for future RS acquisition campaigns so to start monitoring river processes at the regional scale. The Piedmont Region in Italy is here used as a laboratory of concrete examples and analyses to discuss our current ability to answer to these challenges in river science.",

            "abstract": "Previous landslide prediction studies have focused on the assessment of location of landslides. Besides location, landslide geometric features (i.e., size and shape) are important factors that influence the distribution and dynamics of landslides. Statistical methods have been used to determine the frequency-size or frequency-volume relationships of landslides, through examining landslide inventories. However, the question of what sets their size and shape is unanswered. In this study, a landslide geometry generating algorithm (LsGA) is developed for quantifying landslide geometric features, including area, perimeter, upper length, lower length, average length and average width, with incorporating an existing landslide inventory and digital elevation model (DEM). The Kaoping watershed in Southern Taiwan is selected as the study area, and the landslide inventory prepared after Typhoon Morakot (August 2009) were applied for LsGA analysis. Landslide geometric features generated by LsGA were then used to correlate to geo-environmental factors, such as slope, contributing area and topographic index (TI), in a logistic regression model. Preliminary findings are: (1) smaller landslides are generally longer than larger landslides, (2) the upper length of small landslides is relatively wider than large landslides, (3) small landslides are more likely to be observed over gentle slopes (<30 deg), and (4) small landslides are more likely to be observed over lower part of slopes (high TI value, near channels). Other results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Plant species adapted to arctic environments are expected to go extinct at their southern margins due to climate warming whereas they may find suitable habitats on arctic islands if they are able to disperse there. Analyses of species distribution and phylogenetic data indicate both that the frequency of dispersal events is higher in the arctic than in other regions, and that the dispersal routes often follow the routes of sea surface currents. Thus, it has been hypothesised that sea ice has played a central role in Holocene colonisation of arctic islands. Here we compile data on the first Holocene occurrence of species in East Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Svalbard. We then combine these records with interpretations of dispersal routes inferred from genetic data and data on geographical distributions, reconstructions of Holocene sea ice extent, and records of driftwood to evaluate the potential role sea ice has played in past colonisation events.",

            "abstract": "Air Pollution simulation models must address the increasing complexity arising from new model applications that treat multi-pollutant interactions across varying space and time scales. Setting and attaining lower ambient air quality standards requires an improved understanding and quantification of source attribution amongst the multiple anthropogenic and natural sources, on time scales ranging from episodic to annual and spatial scales ranging from urban to continental. Changing emission patterns over the developing regions of the world are likely to exacerbate the impacts of long-range pollutant transport on background pollutant levels, which may then impact the attainment of local air quality standards. Thus, strategies for reduction of pollution levels of surface air over a region are complicated not only by the interplay of local emissions sources and several complex physical, chemical, dynamical processes in the atmosphere, but also hemispheric background levels of pollutants. Additionally, as short-lived climate forcers, aerosols and ozone exert regionally heterogeneous radiative forcing and influence regional climate trends. EPA’s coupled WRF-CMAQ modeling system is applied over a domain encompassing the northern hemisphere for the period spanning 1990-2010. This period has witnessed significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions in North America and Europe as a result of implementation of control measures and dramatic increases across Asia associated with economic and population growth, resulting in contrasting trends in air pollutant distributions and transport patterns across the northern hemisphere. Model results (trends in pollutant concentrations, optical and radiative characteristics) across the northern hemisphere are analyzed in conjunction with surface, aloft and remote sensing measurements to contrast the differing trends in air pollution and aerosol-radiation interactions in these regions over the past two decades. Given the future LEO (TropOMI) and GEO (Sentinel-4, GEMS, and TEMPO) atmospheric chemistry satellite observing capabilities, the results from these model applications will be discussed in the context of how the new satellite observations could help constrain and reduce uncertainties in the models.

            "abstract": "We investigate the dayside-nightside coupling of the magnetospheric dynamics in a global kinetic simulation displaying the entire magnetosphere. We use the newly developed Vlasiator (http://vlasiator.fmi.fi), which is the world’s first global hybrid-Vlasov simulation modelling the ions as distribution functions, while electrons are treated as a charge-neutralising fluid. Here, we run Vlasiator in the 5-dimensional (5D) setup, where the ordinary space is presented in the 2D noon-midnight meridional plane, embedding in each grid cell the 3D velocity space. This approach combines the improved physical solution with fine resolution, allowing to investigate kinetic processes as a consequence of the global magnetospheric evolution. The simulation is during steady southward interplanetary magnetic field. We observe dayside reconnection and the resulting 2D representations of flux transfer events (FTE). FTE’s move tailwards and distort the magnetopause, while the largest of them even modify the plasma sheet location. In the nightside, the plasma sheet shows bead-like density enhancements moving slowly earthward. The tailward side of the dipolar field stretches. Strong reconnection initiates first in the near-Earth region, forming a tailward-moving magnetic island that cannibalises other islands forming further down the tail, increasing the island's volume and complexity. After this, several reconnection lines are formed again in the near-Earth region, resulting in several magnetic islands. At first, none of the earthward moving islands reach the closed field region because just tailward of the dipolar region exists a relatively stable X-line, which is strong enough to push most of the magnetic islands tailward. However, finally one of the tailward X-lines is strong enough to overcome the X-line nearest to Earth, forming a strong surge into the dipolar field region as there is nothing anymore to hold back the propagation of the structure. We investigate this substorm process holistically as a result of dayside-nightside coupling. In particular, we concentrate on the role of the FTE’s in the tail magnetospheric dynamics. They are observed to drive strong waves in the lobes that may affect the plasma sheet beading and the resulting substorm process.",

            "abstract": "In the Earth’s middle to lower crust, strain is frequently localized along ductile shear zones, which commonly nucleate at structural and material heterogeneities. To investigate shear zone nucleation and development due to heterogeneities, we performed constant strain-rate (CSR) and constant stress (CS) simple shear (torsion) deformation experiments on Carrara marble samples containing weak (limestone) inclusions. The experiments were conducted in a Paterson-type gas deformation apparatus at 900 °C temperature and 400 MPa confining pressure and maximum bulk shear strains of 3. Peak shear stress was about 20 MPa for all the samples, followed by smooth weakening and steady state behavior. The strain is predominantly localized in the host marble within the process zone in front of the inclusion, defined by a zone of intense grain size reduction due to dynamic recrystallization. In CS tests a narrow shear zone developed in front of the inclusion, whereas in CSR experiments the deformation is more heterogeneously distributed, up to g=3.. In the later, secondary foliations oblique to the process zone and alternating thin, high-strain layers are common. In samples deformed at the same shear strain (g=1), the average recrystallized grain size in the process zone is similar for CS and CSR conditions. Crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) measurements shows that different grain sizes have slightly different CPO patterns. CPO strength varies for different grain sizes, with a CPO strength peak between 40-50 µm, decreasing progressively within smaller grain size, but with secondary peaks for different coarse-grained sizes. Our observations suggest that the initial formation and transient deformation of shear zones is strongly affected by loading conditions.",

The Xiaomei laterite sediments on the terraces of Youjiang River, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southern China, was dominated by the intermittently uplift of the Tibetan Plateau for the mechanism during the Quaternary times. Compared to the loess-paleosol deposits in Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), the upper continental crust (UCC) and the post-Archean Australian average shale (PAAS), the sediments show notable depletion of the relative mobile compositions like CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, Sr, Ba and the accumulation of TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3(t), Zr, but similar with other laterite sediments (the Xuancheng and Jiujiang laterite profiles) in the middle to lower reaches of Yangtze River, southern China. The relatively uniform La/Th ratio, U/Pb vs. Th/Pb ratio and chondrite-normalized REE distribution pattern of Xiaomei samples are similar with the loess-paleosol deposits and UCC values, which suggesting the sediments have experienced well-mixing prior to deposition and intense superficial weathering. The low εNd(t) values and uniform 147Sm/144Nd ratios with the 87Sr/86Sr vs. Rb/Sr ratios show the notable differences with loess-paleosol deposits and the recycling function of the old fluvial sediments which are similar with the Pearl River sediments. The stable zircon age distribution pattern with three age groups of 240-300Ma, 420-480Ma and 900-1000Ma for Xiaomei laterite samples are different with the loess-paleosol deposits and its source regions. The zircons are mainly derived from a source of the Upper Permian to Middle Triassic clastic rocks in Youjiang Basin, superordinate tectonic unit of Bose Basin, and their potential source areas like the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (Emeishan LIP) and the southeastern area of south China Craton (SCC). For the basis of these data, we suggest that that the aeolian dusts may have not started to accumulate in southern China during these times, and the laterite sediments in southern China may dominate by the proximal supplementation.",

            "abstract": "An evaluation of precipitation and clouds in a cloud system resolving model is an important issue using observations such as ground observations and satellite data. Data from the CALIPSO (Winker et al. 2003) and CloudSat (Stephens et al. 2002) satellites are available for analyzing the vertical structures of precipitating and non-precipitating clouds. Especially, the CALIPSO has a 532 nm cross polarization channel, which is used to calculate depolarization ratio. This parameter is useful for identifying particle types such as liquid, 2D, and 3D ice particles (Yoshida et al. 2010). We developed the depolarization ratio simulator based on the empirical formula in the Joint simulator (Hashino et al. 2013) using CALIPSO data. For liquid hydrometeors, the depolarization is given as a function of nadir angle (time of operation), temperature (above or sub freezing temperature), total attenuated backscattering, extinction between two consecutive layers, and order of liquid layers. For solid hydrometeors, the depolarization is given as a function of nadir angle, temperature, and total attenuated backscattering. The order of liquid layers is calculated by employing a simplified lidar mask. In this study, we will evaluate thermodynamics phases of clouds in the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM, Satoh et al. 2008) using Joint simulator. Especially, we will investigate the super-cooled clouds and effects of microphysical processes on cloud fractions of the super-cooled clouds in NICAM.",

            "abstract": "Magma ascent and emplacement in compressional tectonic settings remain poorly understood. Geophysical studies show that volcanic plumbing systems in compressional environments are vertically partitioned into a deep level subject to regional compression and a shallow level subject to local extension. Such vertical partitioning has also been documented for the plumbing systems of mud volcanoes, implying common, yet unresolved, underlying processes. In order to better constrain the mechanisms governing this depth partitioning of magma emplacement mechanisms, we studied the structure and evolution of the Cerro Negro Intrusive Complex (CNIC) emplaced in the Chos Malal Fold-and-Thrust Belt (CMFTB) in the foothills of the Neuquén Andes, northern Neuquén Province, Argentina. The CNIC consists of sills and N-S-striking dikes, which crosscut the sills. The most prominent structures in the study area are N-S-trending folds, and both E and W verging thrusts. We provide new U-Pb ages of 11.63 ± 0.20 Ma and 11.58 ± 0.18 Ma for sills and 11.55 ± 0.06 Ma for a dike, which show that the CNIC was emplaced in a short period of time. Our ages and field observations demonstrate that the emplacement of the CNIC was coeval with the tectonic shortening and associated development of the CMFTB. This implies that the dikes were emplaced perpendicular to the main shortening direction. The systematic location of the dikes at the anticlinal hinges suggest that their emplacement was controlled by local, shallow stresses related to outer-arc stretching at the anticlinal hinge. We conclude that folding-related outer-arc stretching is one mechanism responsible for the vertical partitioning of igneous plumbing systems in compressional tectonic settings.",

            "abstract": "The Cloud and Aerosol Experiment at Åre (CAEsAR 2014) campaign took place from June to October 2014 at Mt. Åreskutan, Sweden, a remote mountain site in Northern Sweden. The campaign was designed to study the physical and chemical properties of clouds and aerosols under orographic forcing. A unique and comprehensive set-up allowed an in-situ characterization of both constituents at a mountain top station at 1200 m a.s.l. including instruments to measure cloud droplet size distribution, meteorological parameters, cloud residual properties (using a counterflow virtual impactor inlet), cloud water composition and various aerosol chemical and microphysical properties (e.g. size, optical and hygroscopic properties). At the same time, a remote sensing site was installed below the mountain site at 420 m a.s.l. in the immediate vicinity (< 3 km horizontally), with vertical profiling from an aerosol lidar, winds and turbulence from a scanning Doppler lidar, a Sun photometer measuring aerosol columnar optical properties, and a precipitation sampler taking rain water for chemical analysis. In addition, regular radiosoundings were performed from the valley.\nHere, we present the results of this intensive campaign which includes approx. 900 hours of in-cloud sampling. Various unique cloud features were frequently observed such as dynamically-driven droplet growth, bimodal droplet distributions, and the activation of particles down to approx. 20 nm in dry particle diameter. During the campaign, a forest fire smoke plume was transported over the site with measureable impacts on the cloud properties. This data will be used to constrain cloud and aerosol models, as well as to validate satellite retrievals. A first comparison to VIIRS and MODIS satellite retrievals will also be shown.",

In simulations with steady solar wind conditions we observe waves with the characteristics of mirror modes form behind the terrestrial bow shock and advect to the magnetopause. These compressional waves have anticorrelated magnetic field and density causing large beta variations and thus could cause variation in the properties of reconnection. At the magnetopause boundary there is strong evidence for magnetic reconnection including the formation of two-dimensional equivalents of flux transfer events (FTE). There are large variations in the temporal and spatial properties of the FTEs indicating a possible connection to the variations in the magnetosheath inflow region.

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that triggering processes for landslides and turbidity currents at offshore river deltas include hyperpycnal flows, tidal effects, elevated bed shear stresses, and earthquakes, but these hypotheses are poorly tested in a quantified manner. As rivers and offshore turbidity currents are probably the two most volumetrically important sediment transport processes on Earth, it is important to understand how they are linked. In this study, a suite of statistical tests is applied to quantify significance of triggers, based on an unprecedented record of failures and flows. The submarine delta at Squamish, British Columbia provides an exceptional natural laboratory where 106 turbidity currents were monitored over 147 days during 2011. This unique dataset provides sufficient number of observations for statistical analysis of event timing, frequency and triggers. Elevated periods of river discharge are shown to be a significant control on when the turbidity current system ‘switches on’. The combined effects of river discharge and tidal elevation, interpreted to cause elevated bed shear stresses on the delta lip, are the most significant controls on flow timing. Of these two factors, river discharge is the dominant control on flow recurrence, as the seasonal discharge maximum correlates with more frequent flows. Each 1 m3/s increase in river discharge explains a 1% increase in offshore sediment flow likelihood, once a critical threshold is reached. The largest peaks in river discharge do not create hyperpycnal flows, but instead result in delta lip failures. Delta lip failures may also occur during periods of lower sediment input, which is related to the pore pressure regime and preconditioning of the slope by sediment accumulation.\nTwo types of events are documented at Squamish, which include landslides that create turbidity currents, and more enigmatic turbidity currents with no obvious initiation point. Initial results, from the first multi-platform monitoring of turbidity currents in 2015, show one such enigmatic event and we summarise the differences between the two event types. This study provides new insights into the dynamics and frequency of submarine deltas which has wide implications for hazard assessment and understanding deep-sea sediment transport.",

            "abstract": "With the evolution of ecosystem management and the actual climate change we are facing, there is a need to improve our knowledge of carbon (C) balance and more specifically of C allocation in the plants. In our study, we quantified the seasonal variation of gross primary production (GPP, obtained through eddy covariance measurements) and biomass production (BP, the C fixed into the biomass obtained thanks to inventory campaign) for a 60-year-old even-aged beech stand located in North East of France. We also assessed the seasonal evolution of the BP efficiency (BPE=BP/GPP; Vicca et al., 2012) and its potential determining factors for our site.\nFor 2014, we found a net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -549 gC m-2, corresponding to a C sequestration. This value breaks down between 1089 gC m-2 for the respiration of the ecosystem and -1639 gC m-2 for the GPP. On the same year, our stand built up 461.6 gC m-2 of tree biomass (leaves, trunk, branches, fine roots), leading to an annual BPE of 0.28, which is within the range of value found on other similar sites. There was a large temporal variation of C allocation to the different parts of the tree biomass during the growth season. Our results show that the growth first happened in the trunk and branches -with a peak value of 74.5 gC m-2 month-1 in May - whereas the fine roots biomass production started later (end of July) and reached a maximum at the end of the growth season (28.49 gC m-2 month-1 for September). The BPE varied also during the year from 0.13 in April to 0.31 in August, where the BP was the same than in July but the cumulated GPP was already decreasing.\nThe seasonal variation may be mainly explained by climatic variations, whereas the shift between woody above-ground biomass and fine roots biomass could be explained by the phenology (linked to physiological mechanisms).",

            "abstract": "Seismic observations of the Earth’s core reveal a complex structure: radial and lateral heterogeneities in seismic anisotropy and attenuation in the solid inner core, but also discrepancies between observed P-wave velocity and homogeneous PREM model in the deep liquid outer core. In this work, we focus on the 200km anomalous layer at the bottom of the outer core that exhibits seismic velocities lower than the PREM model. It has been interpreted as a layer depleted in light elements, whereas the usual model considers that light elements are expelled at the surface of the inner core by freezing of the outer core alloy. Recent models of core formation argued for an early stratified liquid core, and the stratified layers at the top and bottom of the outer core would be a vestige of this primordial stratification. However, freezing of the inner core at the inner core boundary releases light elements that provide buoyancy fluxes that would mix the stratified liquid above with small scale buoyant plumes.\nTo model the F-layer, we consider that the freezing of the iron alloy and the release of light elements have to occur in the bulk of the layer. Iron snow forms and settles in the layer, buffering the thermal and chemical profile to the liquidus. We show that this dynamics can both sustain and stabilize the stratified layer in the liquid outer core while simultaneously matching the seismic observations. However, the expected layer is stable only for a given set of parameters, in particular when a high thermal diffusivity (>100 W/m/K) is employed.\nIf freezing of the iron alloy of the outer core occurs in the bulk of the layer, several assumptions for both the outer and inner core has to be discussed: the F-layer acts as a boundary layer for both composition and temperature, and modifies the quantity of light elements expelled into the outer core as well as the composition that freezes to form the inner core.",

Recent research (Blaken and Black, 2004) showed that gc could be well parameterized by a linear function of An/ (D0* X0c), where An represents net assimilation, D0 is leaf level saturation deficit, and X0c is CO2 mole fraction. In this study, we tried to use the same idea for estimating gcfor a humid grassland. The study site was located in County Cork, southwest Ireland (51o59’’N 8o46’’W), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was the dominant grass species in this area. An eddy covariance system was used to measure the latent heat flux above this humid grassland. The measured gc was calculated by rearranging Penman-Monteith equation combined with the measured latent heat flux. Our data showed that the gc decreased as the vapor pressure deficit and temperature increased. And it increased as the net radiation increased. Therefore, we found out that the best parameterization of gc was a linear function of the product of the vapor deficit, temperature, and net radiation. Also, we used the gc which was estimated by this linear function to predict the latent heat flux by Penman-Monteith equation and compared the predictions with those where the gc was chosen to be a fixed value. Our analysis showed that this simple linear function for gc can improve the latent heat flux predictions (R square increased from 0.48 to 0.66).",

            "abstract": "Aviation emissions affect the atmosphere and climate through a number of mechanisms. One important mechanism is the change in ozone budged resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other precursor gases. Significant spatial heterogeneity exists in the aviation-induced ozone changes and consequent climate impact, which may have important implications for the design and evaluation of mitigation strategies for the sector. However, further studies are needed to increase the knowledge of regional impacts.\nThis study investigates spatial variability – from emissions to temperature response – of aviation ozone perturbations. Using the AEDT year 2006 and 2050 aviation emission inventory in the chemistry-transport model OsloCTM3, we quantify the radiative forcing (RF) due to regional aviation NOx emissions. In addition to the information provided by RF, there is an increasing need to also quantify the temperature impacts. In order to examine the sensitivity of regional temperature response to aviation-induced ozone perturbations, we perform simulations with the Community Earth System model (CESM). Results are compared to estimates of temperature response calculated using the Regional Temperature change Potential (RTP) metric with aviation RF results from the Aviation Climate Change Research Initiative (ACCRI). Furthermore, we focus in particular on the vertical sensitivity in the ozone forcing-response relationship, especially at higher latitudes where the short-wave component of the ozone RF becomes more important than globally. This also allows for an investigation of potential differences between the temperature response sensitivity to ozone changes caused by aviation emissions and by lower-altitude emissions from other sectors.",

Since in general analytical solutions to these complex problems are lacking, careful testing and investigations of the effect and usefulness of these models is needed.\nWe extend our existing numerical mantle convection code that can track fluid flow in 3D spherical geometry and tracks both bulk chemical components (basal fraction) and different trace elements. The chemical components fractionate upon melting when and where the solidus is crossed. Now, the chemical information will effect the flow of the fluid in the following ways: The bulk composition will link to density and the (radioactive) trace element abundance to heat production.\nResults will be reported of the effect of different density structures; either starting with a primordial dense layer at the base of the mantle, having all density variation originate from melting (basalt production), or a combination between these two end-member scenarios. In particular we will focus on the connection between large scale bulk chemical structures in the (deep) mantle and the evolution of the distribution of noble gasses (He and Ar). The distribution of noble gasses depend upon 1) assumptions on the initial distributions in the mantle, 2) the mantle flow, 3) radioactive production and, 4) outgassing to the atmosphere upon melting close to the surface.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. It is also naturally emitted by a number of processes, including microbial activity in wetlands, permafrost degradation and wildfires. Our current understanding of the extent and amplitude of its natural sources, as well as the large scale driving factors, remain highly uncertain (Kirschke et al., Nature Geosci., 2013). Furthermore, high latitude regions are large natural sources of CH4 in the atmosphere. Observing boreal/Arctic CH4 variability and understanding its main driving processes using atmospheric measurements and transport model is the task of this work. YAK-AEROSIB atmospheric airborne campaigns (flights in the tropospheric layer up to 9 km connecting the two cities of Novosibirsk and Yakutsk) and continuous measurements at Fonovaya Observatory (60 km west of Tomsk - 56° 25'07\"N, 84° 04'27\"E) have been performed in order to provide observational data on the composition of Siberian air. The study is focused on 2012, during which a strong heat wave impacted Siberia, leading to the highest mean daily temperature values on record since the beginning of the 20th century. This abnormal drought has led to numerous large forest fires. A chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE), combined with datasets for anthropogenic (EDGAR) emissions and models for wetlands (ORCHIDEE) and wildfires (APIFLAME), is used to determine contributions of CH4 sources in the region. Recent results concerning CH4 fluxes and its atmospheric variability in the Siberian territory derived from a modeled-based analysis will be shown and discussed.\nThis work was funded by CNRS (France), the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CEA (France), Presidium of RAS (Program No. 4), Brunch of Geology, Geophysics and Mining Sciences of RAS (Program No. 5), Interdisciplinary integration projects of Siberian Branch of RAS (No. 35, No. 70, No. 131), Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grants No 14-05-00526, 14-05-00590).\nKirschke, S. et al. : Three decades of global methane sources and sinks.

            "abstract": "The east Australian and Tasman Sea region is home to a unique example of intraplate volcanism: three long-lived, sub-parallel volcanic chains spaced only about 500$\\,km$ apart. Here we present new $^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar results from the centre chain, the Tasmantid Seamounts, and show that the chain is strongly age-progressive, with an excellent correspondence to the age of the continental East Australian Volcanic Chain to the west and to the more limited ages available for the Lord Howe Seamount Chain to the east. Results from the Louisiade Plateau at the northern end of the Tasmantid chain suggest that it is composed of basalts of the correct age to be a large igneous province formed by the impact of the Tasmantid plume head reaching the lithosphere. This record of relative movement between the plate and the magma source over the last 55$\\,Ma$ shows two clear deflections from the overall linear trend, one at 26--23$\\,Ma$, also observed in the continental chain and linked with the Ontong-Java Plateau jamming the South Melanesian subduction zone, and another at 50--43$\\,Ma$, beyond the end of the continental record and contemporaneous with the Hawaiian-Emperor bend.\nHow does such a unique trio of volcanic chains form? The clear age progression, long lifespan, and tie to the Louisiade Plateau are classic indicators of deep-seated plumes, but it is difficult to explain how three separate plumes could remain stable for over 30$\\,Ma$ when separated by little more than the radii of the plume conduits. Here we examine alternative possible explanations for this volcanic pattern, including small plumes rising from a single deep-seated plume pooling at the 660$\\,km$ discontinuity, a single plume splitting around a subducting slab fragment, and small-scale convection triggered by topography on the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.",

            "abstract": "Metamorphic phase changes have a strong impact on the physical and mechanical properties of rocks including buoyancy (body forces) and rheology (interface forces). As such, they exert important dynamic control on tectonic processes. It is generally assumed that phase changes are mainly controlled by pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions. Yet, in reality, whatever the PT conditions are, phase changes cannot take place without an adequate amount of the main reactants. Petrologic studies point out that water, as a limiting reactant, is responsible for the lack of retrograde metamorphic reactions observed in exhumed tectonic units outside of shear zones. Present day geodynamic models neglects the limiting influence of water content. As a result, no high-grade metamorphic rocks actually make there way to the surface of the models, since they are all retro-morphed to low-grade state during their exhumation.\nIn order to study the impact of fluid content on the structure of metamorphic core complexes, we have coupled a geodynamic thermo-mechanical code Flamar with a fluid-transport and water-limited thermodynamic phase transition algorithm. We have introduced a new parameterisation of Darcy flow that is able to capture source/sink and transport aspects of fluid transport at the scale of the whole crust with a minimum of complexity. Within this model, phase transitions are controlled by pressure temperature and the local amount of free fluid that comes from both external (meteoric) and local (dehydration) sources. The new implementation is tested with an application metamorphic core complexes.\nThe numerical experiments suggest a strong positive feedback between the asymmetry of the tectonic structures and the depth of penetration of meteoric fluids. In particular, bending-stress distribution in asymmetric detachment zones drives the penetration of meteoric fluids to greater depths. The model results show that while the development of an asymmetric weak midcrustal shear zone is triggered by metamorphic reactions limited by water content a strong dependence on the inherited chemical composition exist and symmetric or asymmetric exhumation pattern can naturally emerge from the chemical composition.",

            "abstract": "The Eagle Ford Formation is composed of highly laminated, organic rich shales and marls interbedded with volcanic ash. Discrete ash beds are easy to identify in outcrop as recessed layers between more resistant rock. In the finely laminated shales, the ash cannot be identified visually, which fosters the questions of whether ash is present in these shales and how that can be determined. The ash is thought to come from volcanic activity in western North America during the Cenomanian and Turonian, depositing in the Western Interior Seaway in what is now South Texas. Samples of known ash-rich beds from the Eagle Ford were analyzed using micro-XRF and thin section petrography in conjunction with ICP-MS laser ablation to determine the geochemical composition of the samples. The high CaCO3 content of the marls diluted the ash in each sample so elemental data were used to separate the two components. The amount of Ca in the ash from the total measured Ca was unknown. Carbonate takes Sr but not Al, therefore the y-intercept of a Ca/Al vs. Sr/Al graph gave the concentration of Ca in the non-carbonate components. This method was used for every cation to gather a generalized overall composition of the present day ash. The ash was found to have been altered to clays, resulting in a substantial loss of Si and thereby making the original composition of the ash indeterminable. However, certain elements like Ti and Zr are not as significantly affected by weathering. Using an empirical relationship between Ti/Zr and SiO2 in magmatic rocks from the Cretaceous Peninsular Ranges batholith, the likely source of ash, our measured Ti/Zr was used to determine the original SiO2 percentage in the ash, giving a range of 60-75 wt%. This was also checked by a Ti/Al regression analysis from the same Peninsular Ranges data, which gave a range of 67-72 wt% SiO2. These results suggest that the ash came from andesitic to rhyolitic eruptions. The discrepancy in Ti/Al and Ti/Zr calculated SiO2 suggests that there may be an excess in Al associated with a detrital component. The detrital component can be separated from the ash by calculating the amount of Al in a rock with the SiO2 given from our Ti /Zr data and then subtracting that from the Al of the present day ash. This allows us to evaluate whether ash and indicators of biological productivity are correlated.",

            "abstract": "According to the agreement of Cooperation on seismic zoning between Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration and Research Center of Astronomy and Geophysics, Mongolian Academy of Science, the data of geotectonics, active faults, seismicity and geophysical field were collected and analyzed, then field investigation proceeded for Bolnay Faults, Ar Hutul Faults and Gobi Altay Faults, and a uniform earthquake catalogue of Mongolia and North China were established for the seismic hazard study in Sino-Mongolia arc areas. Furthermore the active faults and epicenters were mapped and 2 seismic belts and their 54 potential seismic sources are determined. Based on the data and results above mentioned the seismicity parameters for the two seismic belts and their potential sources were studied. Finally, the seismic zoning with different probability in Sino-Mongolia arc areas was carried out using China probabilistic hazard analysis method.\nBy analyzing the data and results, we draw the following main conclusions. Firstly, the origin of tectonic stress field in the study areas is the collision and pressure of the India Plate to Eurasian Plate, passing from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This is the reason why the seismicity is higher in the west than in the east, and all of earthquakes with magnitude 8 or greater occurred in the west. Secondly, the determination of the 2 arc seismic belts, Altay seismic belt and Bolnay-Baikal seismic belt, are reasonable in terms of their geotectonic location, geodynamic origin and seismicity characteristics. Finally, there are some differences between our results and the Mongolia Intensity Zoning map published in 1985 in terms of shape of seismic zoning map, especially in the areas near Ulaanbaatar. We argue that our relsults are reasonable if we take into account the data use of recent study of active faults and their parameters, so it can be used as a reference for seismic design.",

            "abstract": "The source of Earth's volatiles, particularly hydrogen, provides crucial information about the planet's formation and evolving oxidation state. Estimates for the H concentrations of the bulk Earth vary by several orders of magnitude. Hydrogen may have been incorporated directly from the solar nebula, during heterogeneous accretion of hydrous planetesimals, or during late accretion of volatile-rich bodies. The D/H ratio of terrestrial water matches the volatile rich CI chondrites, suggesting late accretion of chondritic-like material material as am importance source for volatiles. However, these correlations ignore the H isotope fractionation that likely occurred during early volatile loss to space. Such loss would raise both the f(O2) and the D/H ratio of the upper mantle.\nAny H present during the accretionary stages of Earth should have undergone extreme isotope fractionation. During planetary accretion and following the Giant Impact, the mantle must have been at an f(O2) of IW or below. Under such reducing conditions, the f(H2)/f(H2O) ratio at 1 bar is 3-10, depending on temperature. Virtually all early post-nebular processing would have raised the dD value of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). Examples of these processes include: H2 degassing from an hydrous melt; incorporation of iron hydride into the core; oxidation of atmospheric H2 gas; loss of H2 to space during early hydrodynamic escape via EUV radiation. In addition to raising the D/H ratio, loss of H2 gas to space will have the effect of oxidizing the crust, and presumably upper mantle. A loss of 1/4 ocean-equivalent water as H2 is sufficient to raise the f(O2) to the present day FMQ buffer. In contrast, addition of water from late accretion will have no appreciable effect on f(O2) unless it is followed by significant H2 loss to space, which would, in turn, raise the dD value significantly above that of carbonaceous chondrites. Given these strong fractionation effects, it is possible that the initial D/H ratio of Earth was far lower than today and nebular water needs to be considered as an possible H component.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary record of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (North America) is characterized by periods of enhanced organic carbon burial known as Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs). Compared to more typical OAEs, the last Cretaceous OAE, the Coniacian-Santonian OAE 3 (~86 Ma), is enigmatic and its driving mechanism less understood. While OAE 3 was geographically limited to restricted basins and shallow seaways, it also had a longer duration (~3 myrs) of organic carbon burial than earlier OAEs., Constraining paleoredox conditions during organic carbon burial events, such as OAEs, is important for understanding the relationship between ocean anoxia and carbon burial.\nIron proxies (FeHR/FeT, Fepy/FeHR, and FeT/Al) provide an important tool in the reconstruction of paleoredox conditions through geologic time. Here we present sequential Fe and pyrite Fe measurements from the Niobrara Formation recovered in the USGS #1 Portland core from Cañon City Basin, Colorado. The new results indicate that Fe redox proxies from the Portland core are not always in agreement with other redox proxies. Pyrite Fe measurements indicate a single stepwise change in seaway oxygen limitation, whereas other paleoredox proxies (Mo, Re, U, bioturbation indices) indicate fluctuating redox conditions and a variable degree of euxinia throughout the record. Interpretation of pyrite Fe values may be complicated by the development of a highly reactive Fe limitation. Another commonly used redox proxy, FeT/Al, indicates oxic conditions when other redox proxies suggest anoxia and vice versa. Interpretation FeT/Al may be complicated by a number of factors, including sequestration of Fe in diagenetic carbonate phases, variable supply of external Fe, atypical basin geometry, and the development of shallow marine euxinia. Taken together, these observations clearly support the importance of using a multi proxy approach to accurately reconstruct oceanic redox history.",

(2000). Intrusive rocks studied in 8 boreholes are subduction-related mainly I-type granitoids within the Pripechora-Ilych-Chikshino fault zone, an assumed Neoproterozoic suture (Olovyanishnikov et al., 1995, Kostiuchenko, 1994). Older granites and plagiogranites in the 1-Prilukskaya borehole (595 ± 14 Ma) and 1-Nizhnyaya Omra borehole (602 ± 2 Ma) also have geochemical characteristics of subduction-related rocks. Their origin is probably related to the long-term development of active margin magmatism within the Arctida paleocontinent. The most ancient of the granitoids studied are sub-alkaline A-type granites from the 50-West Hilchuyu borehole (625 ± 25 Ma) and granosyenites and granodiorites of the 2-Veyak borehole (607 ± 6 Ma). Their within plate geochemical characteristics (high alkalinity, relatively high content of HREE, HFSE, and crustal ISr = 0.70622 (2-Veyak borehole) indicate that granite melts were generated in thick continental crust and indirectly support the hypothesis of existence of Pre-Neoproterozoic blocks of continental crust in the basement of the NE part of the Pechora Basin. These granites were formed prior to the proposed Timanide collision or accretion. They are comparable to 613-617 Ma syenites and subalkaline granites which intruded the NE passive margin of Baltica and are exposed at the surface in the Northern Timan (Larionov et al., 2004). This magmatic stage marks Late Neoproterozoic rifting on the NE edge of Baltica during which rifting apart of continental crustal blocks could have occurred. As suggested by geophysical data, one of these, the Khoreyver microcontinent (Olovyanishnikov et al., 1995) currently lies at a depth of more than 4 km beneath the Pechora Basin. At the end of Vendian to the beginning of Cambrian time, these terranes, which could represent part of the active margin of Arctida, might have been incorporated into the NE (modern coordinates) sector of the fold-thrust Timanide Orogen during tectonic shortening.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of planetary bodies can provide valuable, and often unique, information on their interior structure. For instance, surface tidal deformation indicates how a body responds to the gravitational tidal forcing, and can thus give an indication of how the internal structure and temperature varies with depth. In addition, the orientation and spin rate of a planetary body are affected by its interior mass distribution and thermal evolution. In this contribution, we describe recent work to constrain the tidal deformation of the Moon and spin state and orientation of Mercury using altimetric crossovers measured by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and MESSENGER Laser Altimeter (MLA). Altimetric crossovers are ideal for detecting the desired small surface changes, as they avoid the problem of aliasing topographic changes due to small-scale, unpredictable and uncorrelated, geologic relief. On the Moon, the tidal surface deformation is small (amplitude ~10 cm), but, using the highest quality LOLA crossovers, Mazarico et al. (2014) made the first measurement of the radial Love number h2 from an orbiting spacecraft. In a follow-up to that work, we are incorporating more crossovers to improve the temporal sampling of the tidal signal, thus enabling analysis of the spatial variation of the tidal amplitude, as might be expected given the thicker and cooler far side crust and the potential presence of a partial melt region below the PKT. Due to tidal torques from the Sun, Mercury experiences longitudinal librations about its 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with an amplitude of ~450 m at the equator. This amplitude is significantly larger than the geolocation uncertainty of the MLA altimetry (~10/100 m in radial/horizontal), and could, thus, be detectable from crossovers alone. However, given the sparse coverage near the equator, where the libration amplitude is largest, it may be necessary to incorporate into the analysis stereo-derived DEMs from the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS).",

            "abstract": "Verlorenvlei is a coastal lake in the Winter Rainfall Zone of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Up to now several attempts have been made to recover sediment cores from this lake. However, no continuous high-resolution record covering large parts of the Holocene has been available so far. Within the project RAIN (Regional Archives for Integrated iNvestigations) it was possible to recover a 14.2 m paired parallel core from the central part of Verlorenvlei. Investigations on recent surface sediment distributions (elemental composition and grain sizes) indicate that this sediment core is very well suited for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Using a set of 23 radiocarbon ages, a chronology for the past 9,000 cal BP was established which suggests continuous sedimentation over this period.\nPreliminary lithological and geochemical investigations show that this record can be used for sea level reconstructions as the lake was periodically inundated by the ocean during the past 9,000 cal BP. This is recorded in distinctly elevated Ca and Sr contents as well as the occurrence of marine indicator species (snail and mussel shells) in parts of the sediment core. Thin, pale grey layers of fine sediment occurring at various sediment depths seem to reflect event related deposits. In terms of lithology, geochemical and magnetic composition, the upper 50 cm clearly differ from the rest of the record and indicate increased sediment supply from the catchment, which is likely linked to anthropogenic farming activities.\nIn conclusion, the newly recovered sediment record from Verlorenvlei offers excellent potential for a detailed, high-resolution reconstruction of sea level changes, climate variations and anthropogenic impact during the past 9,000 cal BP in an area in which natural archives are very scarce or poorly dated.",

            "abstract": "Most of paleogeographic reconstructions of Proterozoic supercontinents Rodinia and Nuna consider a long-lived connection between Baltica and Amazonia/West Africa between 1.8 and 1.0 Ga. This connection implies a common Paleo-to-Mesoproterozoic accretionary margin of south-western Baltica and Amazonia. We tested the validity of this hypothesis by the time-space analysis of the crustal growth of major tectonic domains in these cratons and their possible relationships. We analysed a subduction polarity, gaps in juvenile crustal growth, “stitching” magmatism and sedimentary basins as well as SLIP and LIP events. In doing so, we found several mismatches between respective domains of these cratons: (a) their chronologies and “barcodes” of magmatism are mostly non-correlative; (b) their subduction directions were different, e. g. at 2.0-1.90, 1.80-1.75, and 1.0 Ga; (c) accretionary crustal growth of Baltica was semi-continuous during 500 m. y. (2.0 to1.5 Ga), while in Amazonia production of juvenile crust occurred in relatively short, 100-200 m.y. periods (2.0-1.9 and 1.55-1.35 Ga) with 100-150 m. y. gaps; (d) subduction stopped in Baltica between 1.45 and 1.2 Ga but continued in Amazonia at the same time; (e) some parts of Amazonian provinces could be incorporated microcontinents like Rio Negro(?) and Paragua; (f) Baltica escaped the 1.89-1.87 Ga SLIP and 1.8-1.75 Ga LIP events, which broadly disturbed Amazonia. Several apparently coeval periods of crustal growth and tectonism in Amazonia and Baltica (1.8-1.75, 1.59-1.52, 1.50-1.40, 1.1-0.95Ga) we interpret as indicators of global plate reorganization and continent rotations. Careful analysis of available Mesoproterozoic paleomagnetic data from Baltica and Amazonia also does not support a long-lived integrity of these cratons.",

We have created a revised cloud detection algorithm to apply to LP measurements that takes advantage of the spectral dependence of the vertical gradient in radiance between two wavelengths in the visible and near-IR spectral regions. We find that this approach provides better discrimination between clouds and aerosols than results obtained using a single wavelength. Statistical analysis of observed LP cloud height values shows good agreement with coincident CALIPSO cloud height measurements. The 1 km vertical sampling of the LP cloud height product allows filtering to evaluate the fraction of cirrus clouds present at tropical latitudes. We find an overall morphology similar to other satellite high cloud data sets (e.g. CALIPSO, MLS, MODIS, AIRS).

            "abstract": "Solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photons are responsible for ionizing the terrestrial atmosphere and create the ionosphere. During solar flares, a fast increase in the electron density at different altitude regions takes place due to the abrupt enhance of the X-ray and EUV fluxes reaching Earth. With these changes in the ionosphere, radio communication and navigation can be drastically affected. The magnitudes of these Space Weather events can be related to the X-ray peak brightness and duration, which drive the intensity of the ionosphere response when the associated electromagnetic wave hit the sunlit side of the Earth's atmosphere. Other aspects defining these changes in a particular region are the local time, the solar zenith angle, and the position of the flare in the solar disc for each event. In order to improve the understand of radio signal degradation and loss in the Brazilian sector due to solar abrupt electromagnetic emissions, total electron content (TEC) data obtained by a GPS network formed by tents of dual-frequency receivers spread all over Brazilian territory were analyzed. It was observed different ionospheric local changes during several X-ray events identified by GOES satellite regarding the 0.1-0.8 nm range, and some case studies were ponder for a more detailed analysis of these effects. Considering the results, we have made an estimation of the ionospheric disturbances range for a particular event with great chance to affect space based communications in the equatorial and low-latitude regions.",

            "abstract": "The dominant physical and ecophysiological state variables regulating the terrestrial latent heat flux (λE) are the aerodynamic conductance exerted by the boundary layer (gB) and the stomatal conductance (gS) exerted by the vegetation, and the Penman-Monteith (PM) model is a physically based method to directly quantify λE. However, the large scale application of the PM model suffers from the unavailability of any physical approach that explains the behaviour of gB and gSwithin the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum.\nHere, we present a novel method to directly estimate gB and gS, and quantify their control on canopy scale transpiration (λET) and evaporation (λEE) using a Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) approach. STIC is driven with radiometric surface temperature (TR), air temperature (TA), relative humidity (RH), net radiation (RN), and ground heat flux (G). It physically integrates TR into the PM formulation to directly retrieve gB and gS and the conductances are physically constrained by near surface wetness, atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (DA) and radiative fluxes. Measurements from six ecohydrologically contrasting sites of the LBA (Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer in Amazonia) eddy covariance network were used for estimating the conductances and quantifying their control on λET and λEE.\nThe predicted λE from STIC based gB and gS retrievals revealed substantial correlation (R2 from 0.92 to 0.98), and mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD) of 14% to 20% with the observed fluxes. The ‘decoupling coefficient’ (Ω) indicated critical canopy control on λET and λEE for Tropical Moist Forest (TMF), Tropical Dry Forest (TDF) and pasture (PAS). On the contrary, for the Tropical Rain Forest (TRF) site, a non-significant relationship was found between Ω and λET (λEE) (p = 0.20 – 0.42), indicating no canopy control on λET (λEE) for this particular plant functional type. However, significant canopy control for the TRF was found in the drought year of 2005. Equilibrium transpiration dominated in TRF, with RN mainly controlling λET, whereas a significant proportion of λET was imposed due to substantial canopy-atmosphere coupling in the dry sites. These findings may have significant implications for ecohydrological interactions under land use change in the Amazon Basin.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the present surface composition of Europa provides critical information about its potential habitability. From Earth we currently have very few tools at our disposal to measure Europa’s composition. Two notable exceptions are Keck NIR spectroscopy (cf Brown and Hand 2013) and Hubble Space Telescope UV spectroscopy (cf Cunningham et al. 2015). In March 2015 we obtained 5 orbits of deep UV spectroscopy of Europa using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph covering wavelength range 1170–1760 Å. The purpose of the observations was to detect trace species in Europa’s exosphere, which is generated by charged particle sputtering of Europa’s water ice surface. The composition of the exosphere therefore provides an indirect measurement of surface composition. Furthermore, if active plumes are present, the composition of the exosphere may also reflect the composition of Europa’s subsurface water reservoir. Of particular interest in the observed wavelength range are multiplets of atomic chlorine, because chlorine is predicted to be a major constituent of Europa’s ocean (Kargel et al. 2000), and Na and K chlorides are expected to be major constituents of the icy shell (Zolotov and Shock 2001; Zolotov and Kargel 2009). The present situation at Europa is analogous to that at Io in the late 1990s, when chlorine ions were first detected in the plasma near Io (Kuppers and Schneider 2000), motivating searches for atomic chlorine and chlorine-bearing species that were subsequently detected in Io’s atmosphere (Lellouch et al. 2003, Feaga et al. 2004). Galileo plasma measurements have detected chlorine ions near Europa (Volwerk et al. 2001), which has motivated the present search for chlorine in Europa’s exosphere. We will present the new COS spectra of Europa and discuss the implications of the trace species that have been detected in these data.",

            "abstract": "The mantle sections of ophiolites offer a means of studying the composition and structure of the oceanic mantle. In particular, the relations between different lithologies can be established in the field, permitting an assessment of the relative timing of processes such as melt extraction and melt-rock reaction. The Shetland Ophiolite Complex (SOC) contains a well-preserved mantle section that is dominated by harzburgite (≥70 vol.%), with dominantly chondritic present-day 187Os/188Os compositions1. Melt extraction and melt-rock reaction is evident in the form of dunite and chromitite layers and lenses, with thicknesses ranging from millimetres-to-metres. These lithologies are characteristic of supra-subduction zone processing and are considered to relate to closure of the Iapetus Ocean at ~492 Ma1. However, evidence of much earlier melt extraction has been suggested for some SOC harzburgites, which have relatively unradiogenic 187Os/188Os compositions that yield TRD model ages as old as ~1.4 Ga1.\nIn order to assess the scales at which such compositional heterogeneities are preserved in the mantle, a small (45 m2) area of the SOC mantle section was selected for detailed lithological mapping and sampling. A selection of harzburgites (n=8), dunites (n=6) and pyroxenites (n=2) from this area has been analysed for their Os isotope and highly-siderophile element (HSE) compositions. Six of the harzburgites and four of the dunites have relative HSE abundances and gOs values that are approximately chondritic, with gOs ranging only from -0.6 to +2.7 (n=10). Two dunites have more radiogenic gOs (up to +7.5), that is correlated with enhanced concentrations of accessory base-metal sulphides, suggesting formation via melt percolation and melt-rock reaction. The two remaining harzburgites have less radiogenic gOs (-3.5 and -4), yielding Mesoproterozoic TRD ages. The new data indicate that a comparable range of Os isotope compositions to that previously measured across the entire SOC mantle section is present in the mapped area, i.e., at the m2 scale, revealing the modest scale of isotopic and chemical heterogeneity in the oceanic mantle.\n1O’Driscoll B, Day JMD, Walker RJ, Daly JS, McDonough WF, Piccoli PM (2012).

            "abstract": "When an interplanetary shock arrives at the magnetosphere, the particles trapped in the inner magnetosphere are promptly redistributed. Observations have shown that the response of the particles to the shock is not simple, and is dependent on energy, pitch angle, mass and location. The purpose of this study is to provide a unified view of the impact of the interplanetary shock on the trapped particles in the inner magnetosphere by using a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation, a bounce-averaged drift advection simulation, and test particle simulation. When the solar wind speed is abruptly increased, a strong electric field propagates tailward; negative Ey comes first, followed by positive Ey. The electric field is strong enough to transport particles with energy from eV to MeV inward and outward. The differential flux can increase and decrease, depending on initial distribution of it. Particles with relatively low energy (<several tens of keV) experience inward and outward motion because the drift period of the particles is much longer than the time scale of the pulse of the electric and magnetic fields. Particles with relatively high energy (>100 keV) also experience the inward motion, but they drift rapidly, so that they do not experience the outward motion effectively. This results in multiple energy-time dispersions in an energy-time spectrum of the PSD, which is known as ‘drift echo.’ As the wave front propagates tailward, particles are accelerated at off-equator. When the velocity of particles parallel to the magnetic field is close to that of the wave front, the particles are efficiently accelerated. This can result in multiple energy-time dispersions associated with ‘bounce echo.' The bounce echo tends to appear in ions with energy less than tens of keV. The wave front also modifies gyrophase of particles. Because the travelling time of the particles depending on energy and length between an observer and an acceleration point, the PSD, or flux appears to vary periodically in the energy direction because of 'gyro echo' or gyrophase bunching. We discuss the variation of the PSD, or flux of the particles depending on energy, pitch angle, mass as well as position.",

            "abstract": "The mixing of magmas is a common phenomenon in explosive eruptions. Concentration variance is a useful metric of this process and its decay (CVD) with time is an inevitable consequence during the progress of magma mixing. In order to calibrate this petrological/volcanological clock we have performed a time-series of high temperature experiments of magma mixing. The results of these experiments demonstrate that compositional variance decays exponentially with time. With this calibration the CVD rate (CVD-R) becomes a new geochronometer for the time lapse from initiation of mixing to eruption.\nThe resultant novel technique is fully independent of the typically unknown advective history of mixing – a notorious uncertainty which plagues the application of many diffusional analyses of magmatic history.\nUsing the calibrated CVD-R technique we have obtained mingling-to-eruption times for three explosive volcanic eruptions from Campi Flegrei (Italy) in the range of tens of minutes. These in turn imply ascent velocities of 5-8 meters per second. We anticipate the routine application of the CVD-R geochronometer to the eruptive products of active volcanoes in future in order to constrain typical “mixing to eruption” time lapses such that monitoring activities can be targeted at relevant timescales and signals during volcanic unrest.",

            "abstract": "A theoretical and experimental analysis of non-Newtonian gravity-driven flow in porous media with spatially variable properties is presented. The motivation for our study is the rheological complexity exhibited by several environmental contaminants (wastewater sludge, oil pollutants, waste produced by the minerals and coal industries) and remediation agents (suspensions employed to enhance the efficiency of in-situ remediation).\nNatural porous media are inherently heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity influences the extent and shape of the porous domain invaded by the contaminant or remediation agent. To grasp the combined effect of rheology and spatial heterogeneity, we consider: a) the release of a thin current of non-Newtonian power-law fluid into a 2-D, semi-infinite and saturated porous medium above a horizontal bed; b) perfectly stratified media, with permeability and porosity varying along the direction transverse (vertical) or parallel (horizontal) to the flow direction. This continuous variation of spatial properties is described by two additional parameters.\nIn order to represent several possible spreading scenarios, we consider: i) instantaneous injection with constant mass; ii) continuous injection with time-variable mass; iii) instantaneous release of a mound of fluid, which can drain freely out of the formation at the origin (dipole flow).\nUnder these assumptions, scalings for current length and thickness are derived in self similar form. An analysis of the conditions on model parameters required to avoid an unphysical or asymptotically invalid result is presented.\nTheoretical results are validated against multiple sets of experiments, conducted for different combinations of spreading scenarios and types of stratification. Two basic setups are employed for the experiments: I) direct flow simulation in an artificial porous medium constructed superimposing layers of glass beads of different diameter; II) a Hele-Shaw (HS) analogue made of two parallel plates set at an angle. The HS analogy is extended to power-law fluid flow in porous media with variable properties parallel or transverse to the flow direction.\nComparison with experimental results show that the proposed models capture the propagation of the current front and the current profile at intermediate and late time.",

These polar volatile deposits are also scientifically interesting, having the potential to reveal important information about the delivery of water to the Earth-Moon system. In order to address NASA’s SKGs, the Lunar Flashlight mission was selected as a secondary payload on the first test flight (EM1) of the Space Launch System (SLS), currently scheduled for 2018. Recent reflectance data from LRO instruments suggest volatiles may be present on the surface, though the detection is not yet definitive. The goal of Lunar Flashlight is to determine the presence or absence of exposed water ice and map its concentration at the 1-2 kilometer scale within the PSRs. After being ejected in cislunar space by SLS, Lunar Flashlight maneuvers into a low-energy transfer to lunar orbit and then an elliptical polar orbit, spiraling down to a perilune of 10-30 km above the south pole for data collection. Lunar Flashlight will illuminate permanently shadowed regions, measuring surface albedo with point spectrometer at 1.1, 1.5 1.9, and 2.0 mm. Water ice will be distinguished from dry regolith in two ways: 1) spatial variations in absolute reflectance (water ice is much brighter in the continuum channels), and 2) reflectance ratios between absorption and continuum channels. Derived reflectance and water ice band depths will be mapped onto the lunar surface in order to distinguish the composition of the PSRs from that of the sunlit terrain, and to compare with lunar datasets such as LRO and Moon Mineralogy Mapper. Lunar Flashlight enables a low-cost path to science and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) by identifying ice deposits (if there are any), which would be a game-changing result for expanded human exploration.",

            "abstract": "The structure and productivity of open ocean consumers has undergone major changes over the past 85 million years. Here, we present the first long-term detailed records of pelagic fish and sharks utilizing the record of ichthyoliths (teeth and dermal scales) from the deep Pacific Ocean. While the North and South Pacific Oceans show similar patterns throughout the 85 million year history, the North Pacific ichthyolith accumulation is significantly higher than the South Pacific, suggesting that the basin has been a more productive region for tens of millions of years. Fish and sharks were not abundant in the Pacific gyres until ~75 million years ago (Ma) suggesting that neither group was quantitatively important in oligotrophic pelagic food webs prior to the latest Cretaceous. Relative to ray-finned fish, sharks were common in the ancient ocean. Most ichthyolith assemblages have >50% shark dermal scales (denticles), but denticle abundance has been declining in both absolute and relative abundance since the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction. The accumulation rate of ichthyoliths of both sharks and ray-finned fish was highest in the Early Eocene, during the peak of the Cenozoic ‘greenhouse’ climate where production of shark dermal denticles and fish teeth increased almost five times over Paleocene production rates. Ichthyolith fluxes fell with cooler climates in the later Eocene and Oligocene, but fish production is almost always higher than in the Cretaceous and Paleocene reflecting the expanded ecological roles and importance of pelagic fish in marine ecosystems. Shark denticle production fell to less than half that of the Cretaceous by 20 Ma when it dropped abruptly to near-zero levels. Currently denticles make up <2% of the ichthyolith assemblages when present at all. Ecologically, pelagic sharks appear to be falling as major pelagic consumers over the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, and particularly over the past 20 Ma, perhaps reflecting demographic changes in shark and fish communities, or the rise of resource competition from marine mammals and pelagic seabirds.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions often prohibit humans from approaching active craters. Meanwhile, it is important, especially at the initial stage of an eruption, to perform visual surveillance, geophysical/chemical measurements and material sampling in the vicinity of the craters. Besides scientific purposes, information from such surveys is helpful for the local government in deciding the response to volcanic unrest. We started airborne surveys using an unmanned helicopter on a trial basis in cooperation with the Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. As a part of the project, we repeated aeromagnetic surveys over Mt. Tarumae (1,041m), one of the active volcanoes in northern Japan in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nOwing to its high accuracy of positioning control in the autonomous flight with the aid of GPS navigation and the fairly small magnetic field gradient in the air, temporal changes up to 30 nT were successfully detected through a direct comparison between separate surveys. The field changes in the air were mostly consistent with those on the ground surface, which suggested remagnetization due to cooling beneath the summit lava dome.\nThrough our three-year experiments, the unmanned helicopter was proved to be useful for aeromagnetic monitoring. Although the system still has some limitations in terms of maximum flight altitude and operational range from the base station, we emphasize the following three advantages of this technique. (1) Operation without exposing human to volcanic hazards. (2) Straightforward data processing procedure to obtain temporal magnetic field changes, which is especially important in an emergency response such as an ongoing unrest. (3) Great reduction of the cost to maintain ground-based monitoring stations for many years.\nAcknowledgments: We express sincere thanks to Muroran and Sapporo Development and Construction Departments of the HRDB for the cooperation in the field experiments using their unmanned helicopter.",

Lack of reliable, longterm soil moisture datasets in developing countries like India, is a bottleneck for soil moisture analysis and prediction. Recognizing the need of continuous, automated in-situ soil moisture observations, three in-situ soil moisture test-beds have been established in an agricultural watershed of the Eastern India. Test-beds have been specifically designed to capture the root zone soil moisture dynamic at different crop fields under both surplus and water deficit conditions in low, medium and up-lands of the study region. Both volumetric and tensiometric method based sensors, Campbell Scientific soil water content reflectometer (CS650) and matric potential sensor (CS229) are installed at depths of 5, 15, 30, 60 and 100 cm below the surface. GPRS communication modems were installed at each station for remote communication from the data loggers (Campbell Scientific, CR1000) for automatic data collection. To achieve a better understanding of the spatial variation of the soil moisture on watershed scale, the strategic ground-based surface measurements were made in diverse landscape using portable impedance probe. The primary aim of spatial and temporal scale soil moisture measurement is to validate current remote sensing products of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). In order to improve validation procedure, the soil texture and soil hydraulic parameters are also estimated across the spatial scales to develop dynamic relationship between these parameters. Herein, the strategies for the site selection, calibration of the soil moisture sensors, ground-based soil moisture monitoring, hydraulic properties estimation at spatial scale and the quality assurance techniques applied to the observations are provided.",

This detailed geodetic imaging of earthquake rupture enhances our understanding of earthquake physics and induced ground shaking, the Gorkha earthquake is the first example of a large continental megathrust rupture beneath a high-rate (5 Hz) GPS network. Coupled with new ALOS-2 InSAR data collected in ScanSAR mode which covers the entire mainshock in a single pass we obtain an unprecedented view of the event purely with space geodesy. We produce source time functions for all the event subfaults and find the earthquake ruptures predominantly as a slip pulse of ~20 km width, with slow slip onset, peak sliding velocity of ~1 m/s and ~6 s duration. It propagated toward Kathmandu basin at ~3 km/s over ~140 km. We will discuss in detail the inversion technique and efforts to validate the results which show the slip distribution and smooth onset of slip to be a robust feature of the inversion. The smooth slip onset, indicating a large ~5 m slip-weakening distance, caused moderate ground shaking at high >1Hz frequencies (~16% g) and limited damage to regular dwellings. With high-rate GPS data in and around Kathmandu and a strong motion sensor we also analyze ground motions within the city and find whole basin resonance at 4-5 s period, consistent with the slip pulse characteristics, which caused collapse of tall structures, including cultural artifacts.",

The ONC Tsunami project is a Smart Ocean Systems™ project that addresses the need for a near-field tsunami detection system for the coastal areas of British Columbia. Recent studies indicate that there is a 40-80% probability over the next 50 for a significant tsunami impacting the British Columbia (BC) coast with runups higher than 1.5 m. The NEPTUNE cabled ocean observatory, operated by ONC off of the west coast of British Columbia, could be used to detect near-field tsunami events with existing instrumentation, including seismometers and bottom pressure recorders. As part of this project, new tsunami simulations are underway for the BC coast. Tsunami propagation is being simulated with the FUNWAVE-TVD model, for a suite of new source models representing Cascadia megathrust rupture scenarios. Simulations are performed by one-way coupling in a series of nested model grids (from the source to the BC coast), whose bathymetry was developed based on digital elevation maps (DEMs) of the area, to estimate both tsunami arrival time and coastal runup/inundation for different locations. Besides inundation, maps of additional parameters such as maximum current are being developed, that will aid in tsunami hazard assessment and risk mitigation, as well as developing evacuation plans. We will present initial results of this work for the Port Alberni inlet, in particular Ucluelet, based on new source models developed using the best available data. We will also present a model validation using measurements of the 2011 transpacific Tohoku-oki tsunami recorded in coastal BC by several instruments from various US and Canadian agencies.",

The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) fleet of four spacecraft was launched into its Phase-1 equatorial orbit of 12 Re apogee specifically to investigate these regions at the Earth’s magnetopause. In addition to a comprehensive suite of particle measurements, MMS makes very high time resolution 3D electric and magnetic field measurements of high accuracy using flux-gate, search coil, 3-axis double probe, and electron drift sensors. In September 2015, the MMS fleet will begin to encounter the dusk-side magnetopause in its initial configuration of approximately 160 km separation, allowing investigation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of important electrodynamics during reconnection. Using these field and particle measurements, we present first observations of 3D magnetic and electric fields (including their parallel component), and inferred current sheets, during active magnetopause crossings using the highest time resolution data available on MMS.",

            "abstract": "Modelling Antarctic marine ice sheet instability (MISI) - the potential for sustained grounding line retreat along downsloping bedrock - is very challenging because high resolution at the grounding line is required for reliable simulation. Assessing modelling uncertainties is even more difficult, because such models are very computationally expensive, restricting the number of simulations that can be performed. Quantifying uncertainty in future Antarctic instability has therefore so far been limited.\nThere are several ways to tackle this problem, including:\nSimulating a small domain, to reduce expense and allow the use of ensemble methods;\nParameterising response of the grounding line to the onset of MISI, for the same reasons;\nEmulating the simulator with a statistical model, to explore the impacts of uncertainties more thoroughly;\nSubstituting physical models with expert-elicited statistical distributions.\nMethods 2-4 require rigorous testing against observations and high resolution models to have confidence in their results. We use all four to examine the dependence of MISI in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) on uncertain model inputs, including bedrock topography, ice viscosity, basal friction, model structure (sliding law and treatment of grounding line migration) and MISI triggers (including basal melting and risk of ice shelf collapse). We compare simulations from a 3000 member ensemble with GRISLI (methods 2, 4) with a 284 member ensemble from BISICLES (method 1) and also use emulation (method 3).\nResults from the two ensembles show similarities, despite very different model structures and ensemble designs. Basal friction and topography have a large effect on the extent of grounding line retreat, and the sliding law strongly modifies sea level contributions through changes in the rate and extent of grounding line retreat and the rate of ice thinning. Over 50 years, MISI in the ASE gives up to 1.1 mm/year (95% quantile) SLE in GRISLI (calibrated with ASE mass losses in a Bayesian framework), and up to 1.2 mm/year SLE (95% quantile) in the 270 completed BISICLES simulations (no calibration).\nWe will show preliminary results emulating the models, calibrating with observations, and comparing them to assess structural uncertainty. We use these to improve MISI projections for the whole continent.",

In a recent study we demonstrated the effect of surface roughness on droplet flow in unsaturated wide aperture fractures, however, its effect on other prevailing flow modes is still an open question. The objective of this work is to investigate the formation of complex flow modes on fracture surfaces employing an efficient three-dimensional parallelized SPH model. The model is able to simulate highly intermittent, gravity-driven free-surface flows under dynamic wetting conditions. The effect of surface tension is included via efficient pairwise interaction forces. We validate the model using various analytical and semi-analytical relationships for droplet and complex flow dynamics. To investigate the effect of surface roughness on flow dynamics we construct surfaces with a self-affine fractal geometry and roughness characterized by the Hurst exponent. We demonstrate the effect of surface roughness (on macroscopic scales this can be understood as a tortuosity) on the steady-state distribution of flow modes. Furthermore we show the influence of a wide range of natural wetting conditions (defined by static contact angles) on the final distribution of surface coverage, which is of high importance for matrix-fracture interaction processes.",

            "abstract": "The study of the sensitivity of the hydrological cycle to episodes of global warmth in the geologic past is receiving increased attention, but knowledge of the occurrence of hydrological extremes remains limited. A range of geomorphological, microfossil and biomarker proxies indicate significant hydrological change accompanied the PETM hyperthermal at ~55.8 Ma, many of which have been interpreted to reflect changes to Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) or runoff. Recently, changes in the occurrence of intense, episodic precipitation has been suggested at some sites, but it is currently unknown whether such regions were particularly susceptible to extremes, or whether proxies from other regions require further interpretation. In this work, we seek to understand whether a numerical climate model is capable of simulating changes in the frequency and global distribution of intense precipitation events by analysing GCM-simulated hourly precipitation rates. Our Eocene simulations are performed at x2 and x4 preindustrial CO2 using a coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM, HadCM3L. Climatological differences between high- and low-CO2 may be considered analogous to the PETM. We find that changes in storm characteristics and extremes are highly regionalised. In particular, our simulations support that extreme events occurred with a reduced return period at the PETM in tropical regions of Africa and South America, whilst in the mid-latitudes the importance of extremes varies significantly between sites in close proximity. We also identify regions where changes in extreme behaviour are decoupled from those of MAP, which may represent important proxy acquisition targets. Given that tropical precipitation distributions are highly sensitive to GCM parameterisation scheme and given biases in the representation of sub-daily precipitation within HadCM3L, there is a clear need for further modelling work to fully characterise the Eocene hydrological cycle. However, our results indicate that the interpretation of existing proxies must consider the influences of both changes in mean annual precipitation rate, but also the occurrence of intense, high impact events.",

            "abstract": "This research goal is to develop and demonstrate the means by which roadside drainage ditches and filter strips can be assigned the appropriate volume reduction credits by infiltration. These vegetated surfaces convey stormwater, infiltrate runoff, and filter and/or settle solids, and are often placed along roads and other impermeable surfaces.\nInfiltration rates are typically calculated by assuming that water flows as sheet flow over the slope. However, for most intensities water flow occurs in narrow and shallow micro-channels and concentrates in depressions. This channelization reduces the fraction of the soil surface covered with the water coming from the road. The non-uniform distribution of water along a hillslope directly affects infiltration.\nFirst, laboratory and field experiments have been conducted to characterize the spatial pattern of flow for stormwater runoff entering onto the surface of a sloped surface in a drainage ditch. In the laboratory experiments different micro-topographies were tested over bare sandy loam soil: a smooth surface, and three and five parallel rills. All the surfaces experienced erosion; the initially smooth surface developed a system of channels over time that increased runoff generation. On average, the initially smooth surfaces infiltrated 10% more volume than the initially rilled surfaces. The field experiments were performed in the side slope of established roadside drainage ditches. Three rates of runoff from a road surface into the swale slope were tested, representing runoff from 1, 2, and 10-year storm events. The average percentage of input runoff water infiltrated in the 32 experiments was 67%, with a 21% standard deviation. Multiple measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity were conducted to account for its spatial variability.\nSecond, a rate-based coupled infiltration and overland model has been designed that calculates stormwater infiltration efficiency of swales. The Green-Ampt-Mein-Larson assumptions were implemented to calculate infiltration along with a kinematic wave model for overland flow that accounts for short-circuiting of flow. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis on the parameters implemented in the model has been performed. Finally, the field experiments results have been used to quantify the validity of the coupled model.",

Are they dense piles of (possibly primordial) material separated from mantle circulation, or large-scale thermal features which are part of global mantle convection? Or some combination of the two?\nWe use our numerical 3D spherical mantle convection code to perform simulations of the Earths mantle dynamical evolution. We drive the surface velocity of the model according to 200 Ma plate motion reconstructions, to arrive at Earth-like structures in the mantle at present day. Variations in bulk chemistry will be tracked in two ways: 1) by starting the calculations with a (primordial) dense layer at the base of the mantle, and 2) by tracking basalt fraction which is fractionated upon melting close to the surface. The resulting distribution of chemical heterogeneity and temperature will be converted to seismic velocities. This will be done with a thermodynamical database (Stixrude & Lithgow-Bertelloni, GJI, 2005, 2011), allowing us to compare the model with previous observations of triplications and waveform complexity near the margins of the LLSVPs. These observations have been taken as proof that strong chemical variations are present; our simulations can be used to show whether this is true, or if purely thermal convection can also cause these features. We simulate finite-frequency, 3D seismograms at ~5 s period and compare these with previous studies.",

Therefore HONO concentrations have strong implications for the formation of ozone (O3) and peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) in the early hours of the morning.\nGiven the diurnal variation of HONO concentration, measurements from space borne ultraviolet spectrometers have been unsuccessful.

            "abstract": "The importance of the tide gauge at Churchill, Manitoba, cannot be overstated. It is the only permanently operating tide gauge in the central Canadian Arctic, and it sits on a prime spot for monitoring the mantle’s rebound from the Laurentide ice loss. Yet interpretation of the sea-level time series at Churchill has long been problematic, going back even to early work by Gutenberg in the 1940s. The long-term relative sea-level rates are inconsistent: approximately -4, -19, -5 ± 1 mm/y for the periods 1940-1970, 1970-1990, 1990-2014 respectively. Annual mean high water (MHW) and mean low water (MLW) reflect these trends until around 1990, after which MLW leveled off and is now nearly unchanging. Slightly later, around 2000, the semidiurnal tides became very anomalous, with falling amplitudes and slightly increasing phase lags. The amplitude of M2 was approximately 154 cm before 2000; it dropped to about 146 cm by 2010 and reached an all-time low of 142 cm in 2014. Satellite altimeter estimates of the tide in this region, although challenging because of seasonal ice cover, show no comparable M2 changes, so the tidal changes must be localized to the near vicinity of the gauge (or to the gauge itself if caused by a malfunction). On the other hand, altimetry confirms the post-1992 Churchill measurements of mean sea level, thanks to the long time series of land motion measurements obtained at GPS station CHUR, which gives a vertical uplift of 10.1 mm/y. Combining satellite altimeter data with the Churchill tide-gauge data gives an implied vertical crustal rate of about 9.0 ± 0.8 mm/y, in reasonable agreement with the GPS. In summary, we have still anomalous MSL measurements at the Churchill gauge for the intermediate 1970-1990 era, and very anomalous tidal measurements since 2000, but we have apparently quite reliable MSL rates since 1990.",

            "abstract": "Seismic observations, using both body wave and normal mode data, provide strong evidence that the Earth's inner core is anisotropic (e.g. Morelli at al, 1986, Woodhouse et al, 1986), finding cylindrical anisotropy with the fast axis aligned with the Earth's rotation axis. More recently, hemispherical anisotropy variations have been found in both body wave and normal mode data, with the west being more strongly anisotropic than the east (e.g. Tanaka & Hamaguchi, 1997, Deuss et al, 2010). However, it has proven difficult to reconcile both data types. Here, we try to reconcile body waves and modes, making a comprehensive model.\nWe find that a top layer with isotropic velocity of about 70km thick fits both the body wave and normal mode data. Hemispherical variations in isotropic velocity, with the west being slow and the east being fast, exist in the top 275 km of the inner core. Strong anisotropy starts below 70km depth, and only exists in a wedge in the western hemisphere, increasing in strength with depth. The location of the anisotropic wedge seems unrelated to the isotropic hemispheres found at the top of the inner core.\nThe isotropic hemispheres are most likely due to variations in solidification rate at the inner core boundary. The deeper anisotropic alignment of crystals is most likely due to a deformation process. Recent work fitting normal mode frequencies suggests that the top layer of the inner core may in fact be radially anisotropic with the fastest velocity perpendicular to the inner core boundary (Lythgoe & Deuss, 2015). Such radial anisotropy would be in line with the model proposed by Yoshida et al (1996) where the inner core grows preferentially near the equator, leading to a flow from the equator to the poles generating both the shallow radial anisotropy and deeper cylindrical anisotropy.",

Baselines are 10000, 8600, and 2400 kilometers for LWA1-URAN2, NDA-LWA1, and URAN2-NDA, respectively. One Io-B and two Io-A emissions were simultaneously observed. Using cross-correlation analysis of obtained spectrograms, it was found that, as a function of lag time in a pair of two stations, Io-B (mainly S-bursts) and Io-A (L-bursts) show different kinds of cross-correlation coefficients, with sharp and broad peaks, respectively. By measuring lag times between LWA1-URAN2, NDA-LWA1, and URAN2-NDA pairs, it can be tested if either flashlight- or beacon-like beaming is emanated from Jupiter. Measurements of beaming width are also analyzed. Most probable beaming scenarios for Io-B and -A events are suggested.",

            "abstract": "The nitrate radical (NO3), one of the most important oxidants in the nocturnal atmosphere, can react rapidly with a variety of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) to form high mass concentrations of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and organic nitrates (ON). Despite its critical importance in aerosol formation, the mechanisms and products from the NO3 oxidation of BVOCs have been largely unexplored, and the fates of their SOA and ON after formation are not well characterized. In this work, we studied the formation of SOA and ON from the NO3 oxidation of α-pinene and β-pinene and investigated for the first time how they evolve during dark and photochemical aging through a series of chamber experiments performed at the Georgia Tech Environmental Chamber (GTEC) facility. The α-pinene and β-pinene SOA are characterized using real-time gas- and particle-phase measurements, which are used to propose mechanisms for SOA and organic nitrate formation and aging. Highly oxygenated gas- and particle-phase ON (containing as many as 9 oxygen atoms) are detected during the NO3 reaction. In addition, the β-pinene SOA and α-pinene SOA exhibited drastically different behavior during photochemical aging. Our results indicate that nighttime ON formed by NO3+monoterpene chemistry can serve as either NOx reservoirs or sinks depending on the monoterpene precursor. Results from this study provide fundamental data for evaluating the contributions of NO3+monoterpene reactions to ambient OA measured in the Southeastern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) are increasingly being advocated as an efficient and environment-friendly “green” phosphorus nanofertilizer attributed to their nanoscale dimension, large reactive surface area, and low leaching potential. However, knowledge of how naturally occurring low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) that are secreted by plant roots mediate the dissolution of HANPs (releasing PO43− ion for plant growth) is nonexistent. Here three most commonly encountered LMWOAs (acetic acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid) at environmentally relevant concentration (1 mM) were evaluated for their effects on HANPs’ dissolution in static batch and dynamic column systems. Particularly, phosphate oxygen isotope fractionation of HANPs during dissolution was examined to disentangle mechanisms controlling the evolution of O-isotopic composition of dissolved PO43− ion. Our results reveal that in batch experiments the dissolution of HANPs was fast but the overall dissolution efficiency of HANPs was limited (≤30%). In contrast, ~100% HANPs were dissolved in columns where LMWOAs were continuously injected. The limited dissolution of HANPs in static batch systems was due primarily to pH buffer effect (pH increased sharply when LMWOA was added in HANPs suspension), whereas in dynamic column systems the HANPs were continuously dissolved by low pH LMWOAs and leached away. Regardless of LMWOA type and experimental system, the isotopically light phosphate (P16O4) was preferentially released during dissolution and the O-isotopic composition of dissolved PO43− ion increased gradually with increasing dissolution due to equilibrium isotope effect between dissolved PO43− ion and HANPs. However, the overall magnitude of O-isotopic fractionation of dissolved PO43− ion was less in batch than in column systems, due to less mass transfer between dissolved PO43− ions and HANPs in batch relative to column experiments. Our findings provide new insights into bioavailability, transformation, and evolution of O-isotopic signatures of phosphate-based nanoparticles in agricultural soils particularly in the rhizosphere where such LMWOAs are ubiquitous.",

            "abstract": "Seismology addresses both fundamental problems in understanding the Earth’s internal wave sources and structures and augmented societal applications, like earthquake and tsunami hazard assessment and risk mitigation; and puts a premium on open-data accessible by the Federated Digital Seismological Networks. The VERCE project, “Virtual Earthquake and seismology Research Community e-science environment in Europe”, has initiated a virtual research environment to support complex orchestrated workflows combining state-of-art wave simulation codes and data analysis tools on distributed computing and data infrastructures (DCIs) along with multiple sources of observational data and new capabilities to combine simulation results with observational data.\nThe VERCE Science Gateway provides a view of all the available resources, supporting collaboration with shared data and methods, with data access controls. The mapping to DCIs handles identity management, authority controls, transformations between representations and controls, and access to resources. The framework for computational science that provides simulation codes, like SPECFEM3D, democratizes their use by getting data from multiple sources, managing Earth models and meshes, distilling them as input data, and capturing results with meta-data. The dispel4py data-intensive framework allows for developing data-analysis applications using Python and the ObsPy library, which can be executed on different DCIs. A set of tools allows coupling with seismology and external data services. Provenance driven tools validate results and show relationships between data to facilitate method improvement.\nLessons learned from VERCE training lead us to conclude that solid-Earth scientists could make significant progress by using VERCE e-science environment. VERCE has already contributed to the European Plate Observation System (EPOS), and is part of the EPOS implementation phase. Its cross-disciplinary capabilities are being extended for the EPOS implantation phase.",

            "abstract": "The Molucca Sea region in eastern Indonesia is a complex tectonic region, where the arc-arc collision between the Sangihe and Halmahera arcs takes place. Two recent largest earthquakes occurred in this area are Mw 7.5, January 2007, and Mw 7.2, November 2014, that occurred 90 km to the north from the 2007 earthquake site. Both earthquakes occurred along the Halmahera thrust, however, the aftershock of the two events occurred in separated parts of the same fault. In this study, we aim to investigate the segmentation of the seismogenic zone in Molucca Sea by using seismological analysis. We employed teleseismic double-difference relocation using P- and S-wave arrival times from the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia (BMKG) and the International Seismological Centre (ISC) catalog. We used a 3D velocity model for the Indonesian region. Our relocation result revealed that aftershocks of the two events did not overlap each other. Although they have similar focal mechanisms with NNE-SSW direction, the aftershock patterns were different. While the 2014 event aftershock distribution is consistent with the strike direction inferred from the focal mechanism, the 2007 event aftershocks occurred in NEE-SWW direction. Furthermore we analyzed the spatial variation in b-value for different time ranges. The b-value analysis also showed two separated segments of low b-value anomaly around both events for each time range. We envisage that stress regime directions and geometries of the fault are different for both aftershock clusters. For this reason we analyzed focal mechanism data and found that fault segment around the 2014 event is steeper than that related to the 2007 event. We applied focal mechanism inversion to obtain the direction of stress and fault orientation, and found different stress directions for the two segments. While the northern part segment has maximum stress with SSE direction, the stress in the southern part is rotated in SE direction. We concluded that the central part of Molucca Sea has been segmented as indicated by the difference in the stress direction and fault geometry.",

            "abstract": "The April 25, 2015, Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake is the largest one in the Nepal Himalaya since 1934. Since the foreland part of it is densely populated, these events represent a considerable seismic hazard. The restricted direct observations in time and space in combination with tectonic and rheological complexities, however, pose a difficult problem for both seismic hazard assessment and modeling efforts. In this study we for the first time simulate cycles of spontaneous earthquake-like ruptures on non a-priori defined faults within a generic continental collision zone. We use the Seismo-Thermo-Mechanical (STM) numerical modeling approach, which is based on a continuum, viscoelastoplastic code I2ELVIS and is validated for seismic cycle applications against a laboratory model and natural observations (van Dinther et al., 2013a, b). The 2-D model setup consists of two continental plates separated by an oceanic plate, in which the incipient subduction phase is followed by continent-continent collision. In different collisional stages, we evaluate a non-associative Drucker-Prager plasticity yield criterion with pressure dependent yield strength and a strongly rate-dependent friction formulation. Our results show physically consistent emergence of complex rupture paths, both on- and off-main frontal thrust. Assuming different physical properties of tectonic nappes, we find that ruptures propagate following rheological or tectonic discontinuities. Our findings suggest that the interseismic coupling of the main-thrust affects the seismic cycle of the entire orogenic belt. While thrust-faulting events mainly occur on the main frontal thrust, normal-faulting events spread throughout the orogenic belt as a consequence of gravitational extension. Results from an event detection algorithm shows events in the deeper portions of the orogenic belt, both within the oceanic slab and near the bottom of the wedge where material is squeezed between stiff lithospheric mantle portions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics occurring during the thermo-chemical evolution of igneous bodies is of crucial importance in both petrology and volcanology. This is particularly true in subduction related systems where large amount of magmas start, and sometime end, their differentiation histories at mid and lower crust levels. These magmas play a fundamental role in the evolution of both plutonic and volcanic systems but several key questions are still open about their thermal and chemical evolution: 1) what are the dynamics governing the development of these magmatic systems, 2) what are the timescales of cooling, crystallization and chemical differentiation; 4) how these systems contribute to the evolution of shallower magmatic systems?\nRecent works shed light on the mechanisms acting during the growing of new magmatic bodies and it is now accepted that large crustal igneous bodies result from the accretion and/or amalgamation of smaller ones. What is lacking now is how fluid dynamics of magma bodies can influence the evolution of these igneous systems. In this contribution we focus on the thermo-chemical evolution of a subduction related magmatic system at pressure conditions corresponding to mid-crustal levels (0.7 GPa, 20–25 km). In order to develop a robust model and address the Non-Newtonian behavior of crystal bearing magmas, we link the numerical formulation of the problem to experimental results and rheological modeling. We define quantitatively the thermo-chemical evolution of the system and address the timing required to reach the maximum packing fraction. We will shows that the development of chaotic dynamics significantly speed up the crystallization process decreasing the time needed to reach the maximum packing fraction. Our results have important implications for both the rheological history of the magmatic body and the refilling of shallower magmatic systems.",

            "abstract": "We use the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with a novel explicit source-tagging technique to characterize the transport of BC originating from various geographical regions and sectors to the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (HTP) and the Western North America (WNA). The results show that BC source attribution depends on season and location in the HTP. The largest contribution to annual mean BC burden and surface deposition in the entire HTP region is from biofuel and biomass (BB) emissions in South Asia, followed by fossil fuel (FF) emissions from South Asia, then FF from East Asia. The same roles hold for all the seasonal means except for the summer when East Asia FF becomes more important. The annual mean radiative forcing (0.42 W m-2) due to BC in snow outweighs the BC dimming effect (-0.3 W m-2) at the surface over the HTP. We further evaluate the CAM5 results against the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of BC in snow over the WNA where an epic survey of BC in snow was conducted during the winter of 2013. CAM5 has a significant low bias in predicting BC in snow but only a small low bias in atmospheric BC concentrations. Local sources contribute more to near-surface atmospheric BC and to deposition than distant sources, while the latter are more important in the middle and upper troposphere. FF is the dominant local source type for BC burden and deposition, while for all distant source regions BB contribution is larger than FF. While CAM5 is qualitatively consistent with the PMF analysis with respect to partitioning of BC originating from BB and FF emissions, it significantly underestimates the relative contribution of BB. In addition to a possible low bias in BB emissions used in the simulation, CAM5 is likely missing a significant source of snow darkening from local soil found in the observations.",

            "abstract": "Through a unique collaborative arrangement, the University of Massachusetts (UMass) and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) have together performed a baseline climate change analysis of the California state (State Water Project) and federal (Central Valley Project) water systems. The first step in the baseline analysis was development of an improved basinwide hydrologic model covering a large area of California including all major tributaries to the state and federal water systems. The CalLite modeling system used by DWR for planning purposes allowed simulation of the system of reservoirs, rivers, control points, and deliveries which are then used to create performance metrics that quantify a wide range of system characteristics including water deliveries, water quality, and environmental/ecological factors. A baseline climate stress test was conducted to identify current vulnerabilities to climate change through the linking of the modeling chain with Decision Scaling concepts through the UMass bottom-up climate stress-testing algorithm. This procedure allowed the first comprehensive climate stress analysis of the California state and federal water systems not constrained by observed historical variability and wet-dry year sequences. A forward-looking drought vulnerability and adaptation assessment of the water systems based on this workflow is ongoing and preliminary results will be presented. Presentation of results will include discussion of the collaborative arrangement between DWR and UMass, which is instrumental to both the success of the research and the education of policy makers.",

Specifically, we report a case study of substorm/storm evolution driven by an ICME from ground observations around the oval in relation to geoeffective IP parameters (Kan-Lee electric field, E-KL, and dynamic pressure, Pdyn), geomagnetic indices (AL, SYM-H and PCN) and satellite observations (from DMSP F13 and F14, Geotail, and GOES spacecraft). A sudden enhancement of E-KL at a southward turning of the IMF led to an initial transient phase (PCN-enhancement) followed by a persistent stage of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The persistent phase terminated abruptly at a steep E-KL reduction when the ICME magnetic field turned north after a 3-hour-long interval of enhanced E-KL. The persistent phase consisted of (i) a 45-min-long substorm growth phase (DP2 current) followed by (ii) a classical substorm onset (DP1 current) in the 0100 - 0300 MLT sector, (ii) a 30-min-long expansion phase, maximizing in the same sector, and (iii) a phase lasting for 1.5 hr of 10-15 min-long DP1 events in the 2100 - 2300 and 0400 - 0600 MLT sectors. In the morning sector the expansion phase was characterized by Ps6 pulsations and omega bands. The SYM-H evolution reached the level of a major storm after a 2.5-hour-long interval of E-KL $\\sim$5 mV/m and elevated Pdyn in the substorm expansion phase. Magetosphere - Ionosphere (M - I) coupling during a localized electrojet event at 0500 MLT in the late stage of the substorm expansion is studied by ground - satellite conjunction data (Iceland - Geotail). The DP1 and DP2 components of geomagnetic activity are discussed in relation to M - I current systems and substorm current wedge morphology.",

            "abstract": "Santiago, Chile (33.5 S, 70.5 W, 500 m.a.s.l., population 7 millions) is a large city situated in a basin surrounded by the Andes in the East and smaller mountain ranges to the North, West, and South. It is plagued by abnormally high pollution levels for its size due to climatological and topological features. To date, it is unclear how far the urban pollution plume reaches up the mountain. Here we explore the region’s complex atmospheric circulation and particularly the transport of black carbon (BC) using a state of the art numerical model (WRF-Chem, Weather Research and Forecasting model).\nObservations indicate the presence of multiple layers within the boundary layer, as well as the occurrence of uncoupled layers above the boundary layer. Here we explore mechanisms within our simulation that may explain these features. Our results suggest that they may correspond to residual layers that are produced by recirculation along mountain slopes due to the complex terrain around the city.\nIn late August 2013, a short multi-platform measuring campaign (DIVERSOL) took place in the Santiago basin, providing the first vertical profiles of BC, accompanied by meteorological soundings. We analyze the dispersion of a quasi-passive tracer (carbon monoxide) of black carbon in our simulation to improve our understanding of the governing mixing and transport processes. We also perform sensitivity studies with respect to vertical resolution and turbulence schemes, contrasting our results against DIVERSOL data. Our simulations suggest that pollutants emitted in Santiago could reach the high regions of Andes mountains during the afternoon circulation, thus affecting local glaciers.\nWith an entire year of simulation we find that the stratification of pollutants within the basin displays a seasonal signal, as well as a capacity to reach the Chilean Andes and affect the Andean cryosphere.",

            "abstract": "The upper and lower mantle are delineated by a seismic discontinuity around 660 km depth. This discontinuity is regularly associated with the dissociation of ringwoodite to bridgmanite and periclase, which has a negative Clapeyron slope, and appears to play a role in global mantle dynamics. Here we study the topography of this discontinuity and the one around 410 km, using receiver functions and investigate the effect of subducting and ponding slabs beneath Europe.\nWe collected ~150,000 receiver functions across Europe over a time period from 2000 to 2014. After quality control, we use ~28,000 in a common conversion point stack. Corrections for lateral velocity variations are applied using the P- and S-velocity models in EU60 from Zhu et al. (2015). While northern Europe shows an average mantle transition zone, strong anomalous depressions of 30 km are seen in the topography of the 660 beneath central Europe and around the Mediterranean. There is no (anti-)correlated topographic anomaly on the 410 in these regions.\nThe observed depressions beneath central Europe correlate with elevated seismic velocities above 660 km, and are therefore probably caused by cold subducted slab material. Temperature effects on the ringwoodite-bridgmanite transition alone cannot explain such a depression. Several wt% water deepens the 660 and increases the Clapeyron slope, but other geophysical observations, e.g. elevated Vp/Vs ratio, attenuation and electric conductivity, are not seen in these regions in various studies. Our preferred alternative hypothesis is the suggestion of Yu et al. (2011) that ringwoodite dissociates into akimotoite and periclase at temperatures beneath ~1400 K within the slab The subsequent transition of akimotoite to bridgmanite has a strong negative Clapeyron slope, which explains the deep discontinuity seen here in combination with cold temperatures, as well as providing a mechanism for slabs to pond in the mantle transition zone.

            "abstract": "It is critical to predict contaminant plume in an aquifer under uncertainty, which can help assess environmental risk and design rational management strategies. An accurate prediction of contaminant plume requires the collection of data to help characterize the system. Due to the limitation of financial resources, ones should estimate the expectative value of data collected from each optional monitoring scheme before carried out. Data-worth analysis is believed to be an effective approach to identify the value of the data in some problems, which quantifies the uncertainty reduction assuming that the plausible data has been collected. However, it is difficult to apply the data-worth analysis to a dynamic simulation of contaminant transportation model owning to its requirement of large number of inverse-modeling. In this study, a novel efficient data-worth analysis framework is proposed by developing the Probabilistic Collocation Method based Ensemble Kalman Filter (PCKF). The PCKF constructs polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model to replace the original complex numerical model. Consequently, the inverse modeling can perform on the proxy rather than the original model. An illustrative example, considering the dynamic change of the contaminant concentration, is employed to demonstrate the proposed approach. The Results reveal that schemes with different sampling frequencies, monitoring networks location, prior data content will have significant impact on the uncertainty reduction of the estimation of contaminant plume. Our proposition is validated to provide the reasonable value of data from various schemes.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic data, the spatial and temporal surface expression of complex geophysical processes in the earth, is being acquired today at unprecedented rates and accuracies. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is a satellite remote sensing technique used extensively today for mapping ground deformation with high spatial resolution and sub-centimeter precision over large areas that is particularly useful for volcanic monitoring [Massonnet and Feigl, 1998; Rosen et al., 2000]. Here we apply the advanced Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) InSAR algorithm [Samsonov and d’Oreye, 2012] to several thousand Envisat and RADARSAT-2 images from 1993–2013 and compute time series of ground deformation over the Naples Bay region of Italy. Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei are located in this area in close proximity to the densely populated city of Naples and, as a result, it is one of the most hazardous volcanic areas in the world. We obtain time series of ground deformation at high spatial and temporal resolution that span, for the first time, twenty years. Campi Flegrei underwent continuous subsidence through 1999. Uplift began in 2005, reaching approximately 13 cm by 2013. We model the observed deformation to determine source parameters for subsidence and uplift epochs [Samsonov et al., 2014]. In addition, a typical DInSAR image can contain significant signals from with several different, nonvolcanic sources. For example, we clearly observe decade-long elevation-dependent seasonal oscillations of the vertical displacement component at Vesuvius that are substantially larger than the long-term deformation rate (<0.6 cm/yr). As a result, we employ an eigenpattern decomposition technique known as Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) analysis in order to identify the unique, finite set of correlated deformation patterns associated with volcanic sources at different depths [Tiampo et al., 2004; Tiampo et al., 2012]. Both the inflation and deflation mechanisms at Campi Flegrei involve large, extended sources in a layered hydrothermal system whose location is controlled by the caldera structure and stratigraphy. The temporal resolution of MSBAS approaches that of GPS daily timeseries, with superior precision and spatial resolution, making it an excellent alternative for volcano monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Mineral reaction rims, zoned crystals, and myriad growth or dissolution textures provide evidence for changes in magma pressure, temperature, or composition. Quantifying the magnitudes, timescales and length scales of those variations is a fundamental challenge of volcanology and igneous petrology; experiments provide quantitative insights into how magmas react to changes in pressure and temperature that can be used to address that challenge. We use single-step and dynamic experiments conducted in cold seal pressure vessels to study the responses of dacite and rhyolite magmas to heating and decompression events. During single-step decompression (or heating) experiments, conditions are changed nearly instantaneously from the initial to final state in one step, or several smaller steps, whereas “dynamic experiments” have continuous variation in pressure and/or temperature. These two types of experiments yield useful and complementary information describing crystal nucleation, growth, and reaction rates in response to changing (as opposed to steady state) conditions. Here we discuss isothermal decompression experiments that show substantial path-dependence for runs with equivalent time-averaged decompression rates as slow as 0.27 MPa/h for >500 h. Continuous decompression experiments often contain fewer but larger plagioclase crystals than are present in single-step runs, and those new crystals often show complex growth textures. Our results suggest that even slow changes in storage conditions can disrupt melt structure and greatly retard nucleation provided the changes are steady. We hypothesize that if the decompression path remains steady and continuous (absent a stall on and/or rapid decompression), the magma can remain in a growth-dominated regime even though it is far from equilibrium.",

            "abstract": "Ice discharge from calving glaciers has increased in the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), and this increase plays important roles in the volume change of GrIS and its contribution to sea level rise. Thinning of GrIS calving glaciers has been studied by differencing digital elevation models (DEMs) derived by satellite remote-sensing. Measurement period of such studies is limited by availability of satellite data, and thus surface elevation change of Greenlandic glaciers and ice caps are few for the period before the satellite era. In this study, we measured surface elevation change of marine-terminating Bowdoin and Sun Glaciers and land-terminating Tugto Glacier in northwestern Greenland (77°35′–77°56′N, 68°00′–69°45′W), using aerial photographs acquired in 1985 and recent satellite data. The aerial photographs taken by Danish National Survey were analyzed by the digital photogrammetric technique to derive DEMs with a 25 m grid mesh. We also generated DEMs on August 20, 2007 and September 4, 2010, by analyzing Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), Panchromatic remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) images. Vertical coordinates of DEMs were calibrated by comparing the elevation over a relatively flat (<10°) ice-free terrain. The standard deviation of elevation difference between 1985 and 2007 DEMs was 8.2 m. Mean surface elevation change over the glacier area of 507.49 km2 was −55.1 ± 8.2 m (−2.5 ± 0.4 m a-1) in 1985–2007. Elevation change near the terminus of Bowdoin Glacier increased from −2.5 to −5.5 m a-1 from 1985–2007 to 2007–2010, whereas the rate was similar over the two periods in Tugto Glacier. Our study demonstrated that recent acceleration in the mass loss is more significant in calving glaciers as compared with land-terminating glaciers. This result suggests the importance of ice dynamics and/or ice-ocean interaction in the mass loss of GrIS.",

The urban sprawl was driven mainly by internal (MS or EU) or external migration but also by EU policies (including funds and projects) and by changes in life style (e.g. moving away from cities; second homes). This presentation will aim at showing a number of EU wide analysis on: aging population, depopulation of some of the EU regions; agricultural production and scenarios projections of thereof.\nVarious EU funded projects and programs have analyzed ways how future cities and how EU future land use could developed. Number of those solutions where further investigated with case studies/small scale implementations. However, in recent years the 2012 EU road map to resource efficiency and UN Sustainable Development Goals have called respectively for ‘no net land take by 2050’ and land neutrality. Thus, the process of implementing innovative solutions for land use has started and some of the cities and regions are well ahead in moving towards XXI century society. In order to streamline/share knowledge and steer EU wide discussion on this the European Commission in its road map to resource efficiency announced a Communication on land as a resource. This presentation will attempt to synthesize current discussion on the topic of ‘land as a resource’ and include examples of implemented innovative solutions for aging population, land recycling for urban developments and green spaces within the current EU policy context. Finally, some appreciation of the adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals regarding land and soil from the EU perspective will be given.",

            "abstract": "An outstanding issue in the field of paleoclimate is the inability of models to reproduce the shallower equator-to-pole temperature gradients suggested by proxies for past greenhouse periods. Here, we focus on the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, 72-66 Ma), when estimated CO2 levels were ~400-1000ppm. New clumped isotope temperature data from more than 10 sites spanning 65°S to 48°N are used to reconstruct the Maastrichtian equator-to-pole temperature gradient. This data is compared to CESM model simulations of the Maastrichtian, run using relevant paleogeography and atmospheric CO2 levels of 560 and 1120 ppm. Due to a reduced “proxy toolkit” this far in the past, much of our knowledge of Cretaceous climate comes from the oxygen isotope paleothermometer, which incorporates an assumption about the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater (δ18Osw), a quantity often related to salinity. With the clumped isotope paleothermometer, we can directly calculate δ18Osw. This will be used to test commonly applied assumptions about water composition, and will be compared to modeled ocean salinity. We also discuss basin-to-basin differences and their implications for paleo-circulation patterns.",

            "abstract": "European settlement of the North Island, New Zealand resulted in deforestation of >90% of the landscape followed by conversion to pastureland. The resulting loss of vegetation cover triggered a sharp increase in hillslope erosion as widespread earthflow complexes and gully systems developed on the weak marine sedimentary lithologies in the Waipaoa River basin. However, the rate and volume of hillslope degradation due to land-use change has not been quantified. Using a 1955-2013 decadal sequence of aerial photographs for a ~16 km2 sub-catchment, we mapped the spatial extent of active landslides and then created a ‘turf index’ to relate the amount of ground disruption to average downslope velocity. The sub-catchment is predominately comprised of a weak mélange of highly sheared mudstone and riddled with pervasive earthflows that often span from ridgetop to the channel, dissected by gullies. We separated the landslides into three turf classes based on the spectral signature of the landslide, which relates to the style of ground disruption. Based on the movement of trees and other features, we assigned velocities to each class. The resulting three landslide categories are: 1) little to no disrupted ground that averaged ≤1 m/yr, 2) a mix of disrupted ground and intact blocks that averaged 2-5 m/yr, and 3) no intact blocks or vegetation that averaged ≥5 m/yr. We then calculated the average annual sediment flux based on the corresponding turf index, landslide depth, and length along the channel or gully. Using an average toe depth of 4.4 ± 1.3 m (avg ± sd) determined from field measurements of 37 earthflows, we calculated a sub-catchment averaged erosion rate of up to 23 mm/yr (for 1955). Despite evidence that >99% of the terrain is covered by post-LGM landslides, only 38% is active in 1955 (and that proportion is decreasing through time—seemingly correlated with localized reforestation). Compared with long-term (post-18 ka) erosion rates from this catchment (1.6 mm/yr) and the long-term uplift rate (~1 mm/yr), the recent human influence is profound. Previously, we found an increase in erosion over the past 3400 ky (2.2 mm/yr), however this increase could be entirely due to human influence—showing that a few decades of rapid erosion superimposed on a steady state background erosion rate can skew previously calculated long-term rates.",

Measurements performed in the laboratory on carefully characterized samples can provide reference data that can be used for direct comparison with remote-sensing polarimetric observations. In particular, we want to study the spectral dependence of the polarization and the way it is correlated or not with the surface albedo.\nIn the Laboratory for Outflow Studies of Sublimating Materials (LOSSy) at the University of Bern, we have developed the capability to prepare and analyze optically thick analogues of planetary or cometary surfaces composed of water ice, minerals and carbonaceous compounds. Water-free dust of high porosity can also be produced by sublimation of ice under space-simulated conditions (Pommerol et al., 2015). Here, we present the first results of polarization measurements performed in the LOSSy. A Stokes polarimeter is used to measure the Stokes parameters describing the polarization of the visible light scattered by icy samples illuminated with a randomly polarized light simulating the star light. Additionally, a radio-goniometer, equipped with polarizers, can also measure the phase angle dependence of the linearly polarized scattered light.

Frictional experiments on artificial mylonite gouge were conducted under elevated temperature in the range of 100-600oC and effective normal stress of 100MPa, 200MPa and 300MPa to represent the deep portion conditions of the fault zone. In order to obtain velocity dependence of friction, loading rates were stepped up and down in the range of 0.04μm/s -1.0μm/s.\nIn our experiments, the frictional coefficient of mylonite exhibits systematic increase with increasing temperature. Under 200MPa and 300MPa effective normal stress condition, velocity dependence of mylonite gouge shows a transition from initial velocity-strengthening behavior (Regime 1) to velocity-weakening behavior (Regime 2) at about 300oC and then transitions back to velocity-strengthening behavior (Regime 3) as temperature increases. The velocity dependence of mylonite also shows strong pressure sensitivity. When the effective normal stress is increased to 300MPa, the stable frictional behavior is significantly enhanced with larger (a-b) compared to that under the lower pressure condition. Microstructure in Regime 3 is characterized by pervasive mylonitic foliations, which is attributed to plastic deformation of phyllosilicates combined with thermal activated particle size reduction of hard clasts (quartz and plagioclase). At 300MPa effective normal stress and 400oC, loading rate exerts an obvious influence on the transition of velocity dependence, from velocity strengthening behavior to velocity weakening behavior as loading rate increases from 0.04μm/s to 1.0μm/s.\nIn the framework of rate and state friction constitutive law, the effects of frictional properties of mylonite on faulting mechanics are discussed. From our experimental results of mylonite, unstable slip events may nucleate in mylonite gouge at 100MPa effective normal stress and temperatures of 300-600oC. At higher effective normal stresses of 200MPa and 300MPa, the temperature range for the nucleation of unstable slip events narrows, corresponding to 300-500oC and 300-400oC, respectively.",

In humid regions where variable source area (VSA) hydrology dominates storm runoff, NPS pollution is generated where VSAs coincide with polluting activities. Mapping storm runoff risks could allow for more precise and informed targeting of NPS pollution mitigation practices in agricultural landscapes. Topographic wetness indices (TWI) provide good approximations of relative soil moisture patterns and relative storm runoff risks. Simulation models are typically used in conjunction with TWIs to quantify VSA behavior. In this study we use empirically derived relationships between TWI values, volumetric water content (VWC) and rainfall frequencies to develop runoff probability maps. Rainfall and soil VWC were measured across regionally representative agricultural areas in central New York over three years (2012-2015) to determine the volume of runoff generated from agricultural fields in the area. We assumed the threshold for storm runoff occurs when the combination of antecedent soil water and rainfall are sufficient to saturate the soil. We determined that approximately 50% of the storm runoff volume is generated from 10% of the land area during spring, summer, and autumn seasons, while the risk of storm runoff generation is higher in the spring and autumn seasons than in the summer for the same area of land.",

Conventional soil water measurement methods disturb soil properties and rocky materials generally limit installation of monitoring instruments to shallow depths in mountainous landscapes with snowmelt dominated hydrology. Modifications to existing technology combined with low impact installation methods provide high temporal and spatial resolution of relative soil moisture as well as a temperature profile and water table level. Closely spaced (10cm) electrical resistance pads are combined in a small diameter (2.54 cm) tube with temperature probes each 50cm, a pressure transducer, and a tube to extract groundwater for stable isotope analysis. This vertical probe array (VPA) extends 3.2m and is installed in a small diameter (4 cm) bore using a backpack drill limiting soil disturbance. Two VPAs are installed in the Snowy Range of Wyoming, one in a forested mountainous environment impacted by mortality by insects and disease and the other (limited to resistance pads only) in recently burned sagelands. Each VPA is co-located with meteorological stations. Eddy-covariance, sap flux, electrical resistivity, snowpack survey, and other hillslope eco-hydrology measurements accompany the fully instrumented VPA. Data are sampled and recorded at 5 or 15 minute intervals starting in December 2014. Over the winter both sites exhibit highly variable patterns of relatively dry soils with steady increase in wetness. Abrupt increases in relative wetness occurred with short periods of warming temperatures in Spring. Following a temperature increase in the forested site the relative moisture dramatically increased over a period of several hours at all depths as water level rose 1m within 8 hours. In contrast, following snowmelt relative moisture in the sageland site increased gradually and systematically with depth over a period of two weeks. The sage area also demonstrates sensitivity to rainfall events where the forested hillslope is insensitive to rain inputs. Long term monitoring at high temporal frequency will likely reveal other patterns expected to advance understanding of snowmelt infiltration processes at previously inaccessible depths within the vadose zone.",

            "abstract": "High-silica deposits on Mars have been discovered from orbit (Holden Crater, Mawrth Vallis) and from landed surface missions to both Gusev Crater (Spirit) and Gale Crater (Curiosity). The character of these silica deposits can be used to understand both the depositional environment (i.e. fumarole vs. sinter) and/or diagenetic process. Initial work has shown that, in the case of opaline silica, there are differences in spectral shape that may be related to surface textural features imparted during formation or post-depositional alteration. Due to the increasing importance of understanding microcrystalline deposits on Mars, here, we study the effects of crystal size and surface roughness on thermal infrared emission spectra of micro- and macro-crystalline quartz. The spectra of chert and macro-crystalline quartz have significant differences in both spectral contrast, and in the rounded doublet between ~1000-1250 cm-1, which can shift and appear less rounded in microcrystalline samples. We find that microcrystalline minerals exhibit naturally rough surfaces compared to their macrocrystalline counterparts at the 10 micron scale; and that this roughness causes distinct spectral differences within the Reststrahlen bands. We find that surface roughness, if rough on the scale of the wavelengths where the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient (k) is large, can cause not only decreased spectral contrast, but also substantial changes in spectral shape. The spectral shape differences are small enough that the composition of the material is still recognizable, but large enough such that a roughness effect could be detected. We find that my studying the thermal infrared spectral character of the sample, it may be possible to make general inferences about microcrystallinity, and thus aid in the potential reconstruction of sedimentary rock diagenesis.",

            "abstract": "We used geologic mapping applied to Dawn spacecraft data as a tool to understand the geologic history of the Ac-H-10 Rongo and Ac-H-15 Zadeni quadrangles of dwarf planet Ceres. These regions, Rongo and Zadeni, are located between 22°S-22°N and 288°-360°E and 65-90°S and 0°-360°E, respectively. The Rongo Quadrangle hosts a number of features: 1) the southwest portion is dissected by curvilinear structures likely caused by Yalode basin formation; 2) the central part is marked by dome-like constructs up to 100 km across; 3) a peculiar bright, c.4 km tall, conical structure informally known as the ‘pyramid’; 4) impact craters of various diameters appear moderately to highly degraded or are partially buried; and 5) bright material is primarily exposed in the central portion and often associated with craters. Rongo crater (68 km across) exhibits a central peak and scalloped walls indicative of its degraded appearance. The Zadeni Quadrangle is characterised by impact craters up to 130 km in diameter of which Zadeni crater is the largest. Impact craters across all sizes exhibit fresh to highly degraded morphologies or are partially buried. Many craters developed central peaks. Inter-crater plains are generally hummocky with isolated regions of smooth-textured surfaces. The south pole area (85-90°S) is poorly illuminated and may host a large impact structure. At the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including clear filter and colour images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. In Fall 2015 images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) will be used to refine the mapping, followed by Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) starting in December 2015.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are often unsteady, as evidenced by direct observations of dilute lobes or jets emerging from the fronts of larger currents and by deposits that indicate transient transport and depositional regimes. We used scaled experiments to investigate unsteadiness in dilute PDCs. The experimental currents were run in an 8.5x6.1x2.6 m tank and comprised heated or ambient temperature 20-μm talc powder turbulently suspended in air. Experiments were scaled such that densimetric and thermal Richardson numbers, Froude number, and particle Stokes and settling numbers were dynamically similar to natural dilute PDCs. Although the experiment Reynolds numbers are substantially lower than those of natural PDCs, the experiments are fully turbulent. Experiments were observed with video and high-speed cameras and high-frequency thermocouples. Currents were generated with total eruption durations of 100 s. Unsteadiness in source conditions was produced by interrupting supply for intervals, t, with durations of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 s in the experimental runs at 35 and 70 s. When t<2.5 s, the currents are indistinguishable from currents with steady supply. In runs with t=2.5-5 s, the individual pulses comprising each current are readily apparent near the source, but decay with distance downstream until the currents appear as single (e.g. steady) flows. In experiments with t=10 s, the 3 pulses comprising each run never merge and the currents remain unsteady. Comparison with the integral turbulent timescale, τ, and current velocity, U, show that unsteadiness is persistent when t>3<τ but currents are steady when t<τ. In currents with 3τ>t>τ, unsteadiness decays such that at a distance of ~4Ut, the currents are again steady. Applied to natural dilute PDCs, our results suggest that currents and their resulting deposits, will only show evidence of unsteadiness if they are disrupted for many seconds and those breaks may “heal” over distances of 100s of meters.",

Several previous event studies have used GPS TEC maps to monitor the dynamics of prominent storm-time ionospheric features, such as plumes of storm enhanced density (SED), the tongue of ionization (TOI), and polar cap patches. In this study, we focus on developing a statistical characterization of the storm-time response of GPS TEC in the North American sector. A superposed epoch analysis is carried out using GPS TEC variations collected over North America during 139 geomagnetic storms which occurred between 2001 and 2013. The epoch time used to order the data is the onset of the main phase determined by the Sym-H index. Clear seasonal variations in the TEC storm response are identified, such that summer events tend to be dominated by the negative (decrease) phase while winter events exhibit a stronger initial positive (increase) phase with minimal negative storm effects. We find no discernible difference between spring and fall equinox events with both being equal to the seasonal average. We also find a prominent magnetic declination effect such that stronger positive storm effects are observed in regions of negative declination (i.e. eastern North America).",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow anomalies are common on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Such features are imaged by multiple P-Cable high resolution seismic 2D lines and 3D cubes in the Norwegian Barents Sea. P-Cable is a high resolution 3D seismic system consisting of multiple streamers attached to a cross cable that is towed perpendicular to the vessels steaming direction. The short offset, high frequency source and closely spaced streamers facilitates for excellent vertical and horizontal resolution that provides key information for understanding the sub-surface. Recent data have been broadband processed, and the method has proven to enhance the imaging of the sub-surface significantly. Barents Sea P-Cable surveys have targeted shallow fluid anomalies in the uppermost ca. 500 meters of the sub-surface. New data have been acquired in 2012, 2014 and 2015. The most recent data focus on the southeast part of the Norwegian Barents Sea where P-Cable data give a new insight into the subsurface not provided by conventional seismic data in the region. Geologically, the Barents Sea region is characterized by Paleozoic and Mesozoic siliciclastic successions overlaid in most areas by a thin cover of Cenozoic glacial sediments. Hydrocarbon-rich Jurassic and Triassic sequences are locally situated in the shallow sub-surface as a result of extensive late Cenozoic uplift and erosion. The unloading has been reported to reactivate and create new faults in addition to initiate further migration of fluids in the sub-surface (Chand et al., 2012). The presence of shallow hydrocarbon systems creates an optimal setting for imaging fluid flow anomalies with high resolution 3D seismic data. The Barents Sea P-Cable data image a range of fluid related features such as cross-cutting reflections and bright spots, chimney structures, acoustic masking, pockmarks and mud volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "A cross-disciplinary hydrology course was developed that combined field and classroom based techniques to educate undergraduate level students on issues related to water resources in Florida, USA. Six instructors from separate departments brought a different perspective, research experience, and view on water quality and quantity issues. The course progressed by examining hydrologic processes at different spatio-temporal scales beginning with the geologic scale (the formation of aquifers) and ending with present-day water management and policy concerns. We were challenged to introduce students from various academic backgrounds and levels to the core concepts of hydrology and water chemistry. Additionally, the instructors faced the task of making our research fit together seamlessly, such that one topic would naturally progress to the next topic. We ensured that students’ knowledge progressed enough so they could address complex management issues through critical thinking and application of basic field techniques. It is our objective to share the experiences and challenges in developing an interdisciplinary course that: 1) introduced new research ideas and concepts from six separate fields, 2) enhanced lecture concepts by hands-on, field-based activities, and 3) would keep students from science and non-science backgrounds engaged and challenged but not overwhelmed.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring environmental processes in a glaciated watershed in Svalbard over a 12 year period provides insights into the controls on annually laminated sediment deposition in Linnévatnet, west Spitsbergen. This proglacial lake has a major inflow from nival and glacier meltwater and minor inflows from alluvial fans along the east and west shores of the lake. A synthesis of meteorological, hydrological and limnological measurements coupled with a composite stack of sediment grain size profiles from multiple traps and time lapse photography from 2004 to 2015 provides a detailed and complex record of inlet stream flow events and consequently the timing and amount of sediment deposited annually on the lake floor. Data is presented from temperature loggers, CTD’s and sediment traps spanning a 3 km proximal to distal transect across the central axis of the basin from the main inlet. Process studies and observations reveal that the annual nival melt is generally the high discharge event that delivers the greatest annual sediment flux to the lake (e.g. 2005, 2006, 2008 2009), however in several years (e.g. 2011, 2013), intense late summer and early fall rainfall events occurred when thawed active layer sediments were mobilized and residual sediment in stream channels, produced heavy sediment loads that exceeded the nival melt sediment delivery. Sediment cores recovered adjacent to mooring sites across the basin are annually laminated. The structure of laminae in proximal sediment traps mimics proximal varves seen in thin sections with multiple coarser grained events ( median up to 35 μm) overlain by fine-grained (median ~5 μm) “winter” layers. Annual couplets in distal traps are proportionally thinner and finer grained and their grain size profile records the major events seen in proximal sectors of the lake. Mineralogical and ITRAX scanning XRF analyses of trap sediments shows that late season events also activate sedimentation from alluvial fan sources that otherwise contribute little sediment to the lake floor.",

            "abstract": "Iron-rich geothermal waters pose a special challenge regarding sample stabilization for sulfur and arsenic speciation analysis. Standard stabilization techniques fail to preserve speciation due to precipitating iron oxyhydroxides and thus adsorption of arsenic when flash-freezing a sample or precipitation of orpiment (As2S3)-like phases when adding HNO3. Solid phase extraction has the potential to extract anionic sulfur and arsenic species from solution and consequently separate them from cationic iron. This method was tested by applying synthetic solutions of sulfur and arsenic species onto Bio-Rad AG2-X8 resin and eluting the target species using 0.5 M Na-Salicylate. Complete retention of the initially applied amount on the resin was found for sulfate, thiosulfate, arsenate, monothioarsenate and trithioarsenate with 100.0 %, 99.7 %, 95.1 %, 98.9 %, and 99.8 %, respectively. Arsenite passed the resin without binding (3.0 % retention). All species bound to the resin could be eluted quantitatively and species-conserving with a recovery of 98.4 %, 102.8 %, 95.3 %, 90.5 % and 85.3 % for sulfate, thiosulfate, arsenate, monothioarsenate and trithioarsenate, respectively. Addition of 5 ppm FeCl2 did not reduce method efficiency with 98.7 % retention and 105.1 % recovery for monothioarsenate, while all of the applied iron passed the resin without binding as hypothesized. However, in solutions containing a mixture of arsenite, arsenate, monothioarsenate and trithioarsenate we found arsenite retention up to 59.1 % both in the presence and absence of iron. This effect cannot be fully explained yet and might be attributed to free sulfide in these mixed solutions facilitating arsenite binding via sulfide sorbed onto the resin. The interaction between different species needs to be further investigated. Samples from geothermal features in Yellowstone and mineral springs in the Czech Republic have been collected and results of immediate elution and stability during storage will be presented.",

It affected humans, infrastructure and forests, including the 22-year-old community-managed secondary forest at Manobo near Tacloban on Leyte island. As part of a larger investigation of the impacts of secondary forests on streamflow, gross rainfall (P), throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) were monitored between June 2013 and June 2014 using 2 tipping bucket rainfall gauges, 2 large (200 cm by 30 cm) throughfall gutters connected to tipping buckets, 24 roving throughfall gauges (491 cm2 each) and 12 stemflow collectors. Leaf Area Index (LAI) above each of the throughfall collectors was measured regularly using a Canopy Analyzer. Average throughfall, stemflow, and interception losses (I) were determined for three different periods:(i) pre-Haiyan (reference), (ii) damaged canopy post Haiyan, and (iii) recovered canopy. Before the forest was disturbed, cumulate TF/P, SF/P and I/P ratios and their standard error were 80.79 , 1.00 and 18.21 , respectively. During the period with the damaged canopy, the respective ratios were 90.89, 0.82 and 0.75, while 3 months after the passage of Haiyan the forest canopy had recovered more or less in terms of leaf surface area with cumulate TF/P, SF/P and I/P ratios of 87.86, 0.75,and 11.39, respectively. The respective trends reflected the changes in LAI, which dropped from 5.24 ± 0.79 to 3.80 ± 0.80 right after Haiyan, recuperating to 4.69 ± 0.62 after recovery. These changes in rainfall partitioning after typhoon Haiyan are less pronounced than those reported previously for hurricane-affected forests in the Caribbean and the Pacific, possibly because the Manobo forest was relatively sheltered topographically.",

Retrieval of aerosol extinction coefficient profiles from these measurements is complicated by the need to specify particle size distribution and composition, which may vary along a single orbit, as well as on time scales ranging from hours to months. We have developed a radiance-based product, called the Aerosol Scattering Index (ASI), that allows us to characterize many aspects of stratospheric aerosol behavior directly from LP measurements. ASI data clearly demonstrate seasonal changes in the Junge layer that vary with both altitude and latitude. The ASI data can identify volcanic plumes shortly after an eruption, and track the evolution of these plumes over weeks and months. The LP ASI product shows that polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), although located at 80-85 km during summer months, can affect LP observations and ozone retrievals down to much lower altitudes. Short-lived phenomena such as bolide plumes and rocket exhaust trails are also captured by this product, providing unique information about perturbations in the stratosphere and mesosphere.",

Slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge eruptions are thought to be characterized by cyclic or periodic volcanism separated by periods of tectonic extension. Here we present high-resolution acoustic sidescan data from the North Kolbeinsey Ridge, a shallow slow-spreading ridge where high glacial and steady post-glacial sedimentation rates allow relative flow ages to be determined using backscatter amplitude as a proxy for sediment thickness and hence age. We identify a suite of young lava flows within the axial valley, suggesting that a significant length of the segment was magmatically active at the same time. This suite of flows represents the largest magmatic event in the last 7 kyr but still do not constitute enough volume to maintain the thickness of seismic layer 2A, suggesting that larger volume, periodic magmatic events are required to maintain crustal thickness.",

Besides the obvious environmental and climate implications, studies have shown convincing links between O3 exposure and health. These adverse health outcomes range from impaired lung function and cardiovascular stress to premature death. However, little is known concerning the potential impacts of future mitigation policies on O3 and health. Applying novel modeling strategies, we provide evidence of the impact of mitigation on O3 attributable to both climate change and anthropogenic emissions. We employ the latest emission scenarios for both low and high emissions (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs) and include population projections to estimate excess mortality associated with each source separate from one another. We found that, by the mid-21st century, U.S. O3 could increase by 0.9% per year under a low emission future and by 1.6% under high emission settings. We predict excess mortality from high emission-induced O3 to increase annually by over 1,200 deaths. Conversely, excess deaths from lower emissions may decrease by over 1,600 annually. Taken together, these results indicate that mitigation efforts may significantly offset the effect of climate change on O3-related mortality.",

However, fractionation is also sensitive to cell size, growth rate, and the degree of active C concentration at the site of photosynthesis. The ACTI-CO cell model provides one venue for exploring the implications of these multiple factors for the CO2 value consistent with a given ep determination. Using our recent alkenone ep record from the last 14 Ma, we explore in ACTI-CO mechanisms for using constraints of coccolith size for cell geometry, and coccolith calcification and isotopic fractionation coccoliths to constrain changes in carbon acquisition and the consequences for CO2 estimates.\nIn addition, we present a new ep  reconstruction for the past 13 Ma from the Equatorial Pacific based on diatom-bound organic matter . The isolation of pennate diatoms assures a similar cell geometry for the entire period, so that unlike the alkenone record, ep is not sensitive to temporal changes in cell size. The similar trends in CO2 from the size-corrected alkenone ep record and the diatom record suggest that there is a common global CO2 trend, and that size correction of the alkenone record reliably accounts for cell geometry effects. We employ the ACTI-CO model to evaluate the potential influence of changes in active carbon uptake on the magnitude of CO2 decrease since the Miocene.",

            "abstract": "We present results from temperature measurements made with a ROV temperature lance in sediments deposited on the slopes of abyssal hills and small basins surrounding North Pond. North Pond is a ~8x15 km large sediment basin located on ~7 Ma year old crust west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 23°N. Data were collected with the ROV Jason II during cruise MSM37 on the German RV Maria S. Merian in April 2014. The temperature lance consists of a 60 cm long stainless steel tube (o.d. 12 mm) housing 8 thermistors with a spacing of 80 mm, resulting in an active length of 56 cm. Data are logged with an 8-channel data logger (XR-420-T8, RBR, Ottawa) and transmitted online to the control van of the ROV.\nData reduction and temperature gradient calculation is done according to the HFRED algorithm (Villinger & Davis, 1987). 90 sites in total were visited, 88 gave good data for temperature gradient calculation. Calculated gradients are usually of good to very good quality. The gradients vary between less than 20 to more than 1000 mK/m reflecting the very heterogeneous distribution of geothermal heat flow. The expected conductive lithospheric heat flow for North Pond is ~190 mW/m2 (geothermal gradient of ~190 mK/m with a thermal conductivity of 1 W/Km). The highest temperature gradients are measured in places where temperature ~50 cm below the sediment-water boundary exceeds bottom water temperature by ~0.5 K . These high temperature gradients may reflect local hydrothermal circulation within the pillow lavas, however no focused discharge was detected.\nThe analysis of temperature measurements made with the ROV-mounted CTD shows clearly detectable bottom water temperature anomalies. We infer that they are either caused by hydrothermal discharge through the thin sediment cover or through unsedimented pillow basalts nearby. Hydrothermal circulation in a North-Pond-like environment appears to be diffuse in nature, hence very difficult if not impossible to detect and to quantify.",

            "abstract": "Surprisingly little is known about several important aspects of the architecture of oceanic crust, including controls on lithology, heterogeneity of hydrothermal alteration, and thickness of the lava section and sheeted dike complex and their influences on the seismic structure. Ophiolites provide useful analogs of ancient oceanic crust, with more exposure and access than deep-sea drill holes or submarine fracture zones. We examine the brittle structure of the lava, sheeted dikes, and lava-dike transition zone of the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus) in the Lythrodontas area. The lava zone consists of pillow basalts; the transition zone consists of sheeted basaltic dikes cutting pillow lava through a large interval, and of hyaloclastitic breccia; the sheeted dikes are composed of 1–2 m thick basaltic or dacitic dikes. Detailed sample measurements of P- and S-wave velocity, permeability, porosity, and structures, show that porosity decreases drastically, as does permeability from lava to sheeted dikes. Variation of P-wave velocity mainly depends on the porosity, as well as the shapes of the cracks or pores. To better understand the relationships among P-wave velocity, porosity, and crack shape and aspect ratio, we made laboratory measurements using synchroton X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT images enhance the phase-contrast between primary (igneous) minerals and alteration minerals now filling the pores. Overall, quantitative data of the volume and shape of the pores (at the sample scale) allow us to evaluate the \"empty\" (effective) porosity as well as the paleo-porosity (pores now partially or completely filled with secondary minerals). We also quantify the asperity of crack walls. These measurements allow us to construct 3D structural patterns in the investigated ophiolite, which we use to examine the influence of cracks in the upper oceanic crust on seismic structure.",

By modeling the ultrarelativistic electron pitch angle distribution as ,where is the equatorial pitch angle， we examine the spatiotemporal variations of n value. The results show that， in general， n values increases with the level of geomagnetic activity. In principle the ultrarelativistic electrons respond to geomagnetic storms by becoming peaked at 90° pitch angle with n-values of 2 - 3 as a supportive signature of chorus acceleration outside the plasmasphere. High n-values also exists inside the plasmasphere, being localized adjacent to the plasmapause and energy dependent, which suggests a significant contribution from electronmagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves scattering. During quiet periods, n values generally evolve to become small, i.e., 0–1. The slow and long-term decays of the ultrarelativistic electrons after geomagnetic storms, while prominent, produce energy and L-shell-dependent decay time scales in association with the solar and geomagnetic activity and wave-particle interaction processes. At lower L shells inside the plasmasphere, the decay time scales for electrons at REPT energies are generally larger, varying from tens of days to hundreds of days, which can be mainly attributed to the combined effect of hiss-induced pitch angle scattering and inward radial diffusion. As L shell increases to L~3.5, a narrow region exists (with a width of ~0.5 L), where the observed ultrarelativistic electrons decay fastest, possibly resulting from efficient EMIC wave scattering. As L shell continues to increase, generally becomes larger again, indicating an overall slower loss process by waves at high L shells. Our investigation based upon the function fitting and the estimate of decay time scale offers a convenient and useful means to evaluate the underlying physical processes that play a role in driving the acceleration and loss of ultrarelativistic electrons and to assess their relative contributions.",

To accurately predict the ET, it is decomposed to several intrinsic mode functions and one residue by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and forecasted by a hybrid model combined artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The model is applied in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, a typical region of water resources shortage, and the results show that: (i) the pass rate of prediction obtained by the modified hybrid forecasting model reaches up to 93% in the study area, which shows higher accuracy than applying any one method of them singly. The predicted ET in programming year, 2020, will reach to 3.48 billion m³. (ii) in the study area, to achieve water-saving goal, agricultural water-saving measures should be taken in the future, due to the existing phenomenon of low irrigation water use efficiency and wide planting area of high water-consuming crops. (iii) the water-saving volume in agriculture, industry and domestic in 2020 should be reached to 1.48×108m³, 1.11×108m³and 0.61×108m³, to balance the available water supply and future water consumption, compared with the baseline year, 2011.

In this study, root zone soil moisture was estimated across the Rana watershed in Eastern India, by assimilation of near-surface soil moisture estimate from SMOS satellite into a physically-based Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique coupled with SWAP model was used for assimilating the satellite soil moisture observation at different spatial scales. The universal triangle concept and artificial intelligence techniques were applied to disaggregate the SMOS satellite monitored near-surface soil moisture at a 40 km resolution to finer scale (1 km resolution), using higher spatial resolution of MODIS derived vegetation indices (NDVI) and land surface temperature (Ts). The disaggregated surface soil moisture were compared to ground-based measurements in diverse landscape using portable impedance probe and gravimetric samples. Simulated root zone soil moisture were compared with continuous soil moisture profile measurements at three monitoring stations. In addition, the impact of projected climate change on root zone soil moisture were also evaluated. The climate change projections of rainfall were analyzed for the Rana watershed from statistically downscaled Global Circulation Models (GCMs). The long-term root zone soil moisture dynamics were estimated by including a rainfall generator of likely scenarios. The predicted long term root zone soil moisture status at finer scale can help in developing efficient agricultural water management schemes to increase crop production, which lead to enhance the water use efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The shape of the reflectance spectrum of Pluto recorded with telescopes, 0.3-1.0 μm, shows the planet's yellow-red color (1). Additionally, multi-filter images of Pluto with the MVIC camera on the New Horizons spacecraft report concentrations of the coloring agent(s) in some regions of the surface, and apparent near absence in other regions. Tholins are refractory organic solids of complex structure and high molecular weight, with a wide range of color ranging from yellow and orange to dark red, and through tan to black. They are readily synthesized in the laboratory by energetic processing of mixtures of the ices (N2, CH4, CO) known on Pluto's surface (2), or the same molecules in the gas phase (3). Energy in the form of UV light, electrons, protons, or coronal discharge are all effective to one degree or another in producing various types of tholins; details of the composition and yield vary with experimental conditions. Chemical analysis of ice tholins shows carboxylic acids, urea, and HCN and other nitriles. Aromatic/olefinic, amide, and other functional groups are identified in XANES analysis (4). The ice tholins produce by e- irradiation have a higher concentration of N than UV ice tholins, with N/C ~0.9 (versus ~0.5 for UV tholins) and O/C~0.2. EUV photolysis of Pluto atmosphere analog yields pale yellow solids relatively transparent in the visual, and with aliphatic CH bonds prominent in IR spectra. This material may be responsible for Pluto's hazes (5). Various tholins are the principal coloring agents on Pluto's surface, probably Charon's colored region, and on numerous other outer Solar System bodies (6). Refs: 1. Cruikshank, D.

For each campaign, the precision and accuracy of the remote measurements of atmospheric CO2 differential absorption optical depths from the candidate instruments were evaluated with respect to corresponding CO2 optical depths derived from in situ profiles of atmospheric state variables including atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios, temperature (T), pressure (p), and humidity (q) and radiative transfer calculations using the HITRAN spectroscopic database in combination with recent measurements of spectral line parameters. To enable this evaluation, the DC-8 flights were designed to include multiple overpasses of a comparison location where the aircraft performed a spiral ascent or descent and captured the in situ profiles using a suite of onboard instruments. However large segments of some flights took place far from spiral locations and therefore had no coincident in situ measurements of the atmospheric state (CO2, T, p, q). For these situations meterological analysis data from the Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) GEOS-5 gridded data have been used to assimilate atmospheric state profiles for use in the CO2 optical depth derivation. We use the location of the DC-8 spirals to identify all of the GMAO GEOS-5 gridded profiles that would compare with each spiral and report their differences with respect to the DC-8 in situ profiles. We show how these differences affect the in situ derived CO2 optical depth for the three campaigns and the impacts of these differences on the precision and accuracy evaluations of the remote CO2 measurements.",

Furthermore, the utility of the Δ47 proxy in the mineral dolomite is limited because calibration data for dolomites that formed at any temperature are lacking. Consequently, applications involving diagenetic temperatures have required extrapolations beyond the range of most Δ47-temperature calibrations. Here we compare Δ47 values in dolomite cements to temperatures independently determined using fluid-inclusion microthermometry, and compare this rock-based “calibration” to previously published laboratory-derived calibrations for synthetic carbonates. This combination of approaches yields results that are consistent with the shallow calibration slope that has been reported from some laboratory experiments.",

Traditionally, risk and vulnerability assessments are conducted one infrastructure at a time, considering only direct impacts on built and planned assets. However, extreme events caused by climate change affect local communities in different respects and stress vital interconnected infrastructures in complex ways that cannot be captured with traditional risk assessment methodologies. We employ a combination of high-performance computing, geographical information science, and imaging methods to examine the impacts of climate change on infrastructure for cities in two different climate regions: Chicago, Illinois in the Midwest and Portland, Maine (and Casco Bay area) in the Northeast. In Illinois, we evaluate effects of changes in regional temperature and precipitation, informed by an extreme climate change projection, population growth and migration, water supply, and technological development, on electricity generation and consumption. In Maine, we determine the aggregate effects of sea level rise, changing precipitation patterns, and population shifts on the depth of the freshwater-saltwater interface in coastal aquifers and the implications of these changes for water supply in general. The purpose of these efforts is to develop a multi-model framework for investigating potential climate change impacts on interdependent critical infrastructure assessing both vulnerabilities and alternative adaptive measures.",

            "abstract": "Fault slip can occur not only seismically, or aseismically but also through quasi-dynamic processes such as slow-slip, which represent slow but self-propagating acceleration of slip along fault zones. However, the underlying physics is still poorly understood.\nTo investigate these quasi-dynamic processes, we performed laboratory experiments on simulated fault gouge in the double direct shear configuration, under boundary conditions where the loading system (k) approaches the critical rheologic stiffness of the fault gouge (kc). We varied k and measured acoustic properties for the full spectrum of slip behaviors as a function of the ratio k/kc. When k≈kc, we observe slow-slip events emerging from steady frictional sliding. Stick-slip stress drop varied inversely with k’=k/kc, ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 MPa over the range of k’ from 1.0 to 0.7. The duration of failure events varied from 10-3 to a few seconds and peak slip velocities ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 mm/s. To shed light on the micro-physical mechanisms governing slow-slip we analyzed variations in fault zone elastic properties including P-wave velocity (Vp) and amplitude. Although the first arrival of the P-wave is not always clearly detectable, we are able to find clear, systematic changes in elastic properties by carefully evaluating the P-wave coda. To quantify variations in flight time we cross-correlate different sections of the P-wave coda. We use a simplified ray-propagation scheme to account for the sample geometry and derive an equation to describe the expected flight time of reflected and transmitted waves within the fault zone and loading blocks. We study the peak-to-peak amplitude variation of the P-arrival in order to investigate acoustic transmissivity and its variation during failure. We find that precursory changes in Vp scale inversely with stick-slip failure velocity. Our results provide significant insight into the mechanics of slow stick-slip and transient fault slip.",

            "abstract": "Structural heterogeneity, namely the spatial distribution of soils and sediments (represented by mineral particles), characterizes catchment hydrological behavior. In natural catchments, local geology and the specific geomorphic processes determine the characteristics and spatial distribution of structures. In constructed catchments, structural features are determined primarily by the construction processes and the geological origin of the parent material.\nObjectives are scenarios of 3D catchment structures in form of complete 3D description of soil hydraulic properties generated from the knowledge of the formation processes. The constructed hydrological catchment ‘Hühnerwasser’ (Lower Lusatia, Brandenburg, Germany) was used for the calibration and validation of model results due to its well-known conditions. For the modeling of structural features, a structure generator was used to model i) quasi-deterministic sediment distributions using input data from a geological model of the parent material excavation site; ii) sediment distributions that are conditioned to measurement data from soil sampling; and iii) stochastic component sediment distributions. All three approaches allow a randomization within definable limits. Furthermore, the spoil cone / spoil ridge orientation, internal layering, surface compaction and internal spoil cone compaction were modified. These generated structural models were incorporated in a gridded 3D volume model constructed with the GOCAD software.\nThe impact of structure variation was assessed by hydrological modeling with HYDRUS 2D/3D software. 3D distributions of soil hydraulic properties were estimated based on generated sediment properties using adapted pedotransfer functions. Results were compared with hydrological monitoring data. The impact of structural feature variation on hydrological behavior was analyzed by comparing different simulation scenarios.\nThe established initial sediment distributions provide a basis for the consecutive modeling of feedbacks between surface and subsurface water flow and changes in soil properties, e.g. by using a landscape evolution model. The results should allow conclusions about the effect of different initial structural setups on the further dynamic landscape development at catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, since the launch in 2002, has enabled the monitoring of mass transport in the Earth's system on a monthly basis. In spite of continuous improvements in data processing techniques, an estimation of very low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients remains problematic. GRACE is insensitive to variations in the degree-1 coefficients (∆C11, ∆S11 and ∆C10), which reflect the motion of the geocenter. The variations of C20 coefficients, which characterize changes in the Earth's dynamic oblateness (∆ J2) are corrupted by ocean tide aliases and usually replaced with estimates from other techniques.\nIn this study, the methodology proposed by Swenson et al. (2008) to estimate geocenter motion is updated and extended to co-estimate changes in the Earth's dynamic oblateness. The algorithm uses monthly GRACE gravity solutions (in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients), an ocean bottom pressure model (over the oceans), and a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model (globally). GRACE solutions over coastal areas may suffer from signal leakage due to their limited spectral content and to filtering. We effectively avoid the influence of this effect by introducing a carefully chosen buffer zone. We also take into account self-attraction and loading effects when dealing with water redistribution in the oceans. The estimated annual amplitude of ∆C10 , i.e. the Z component of the geocenter motion, is significantly amplified compared to the original estimations of Swenson et al. (2008) and it is in line with estimates from other techniques, such as the global GPS inversion. The resulting ∆C20 time-series agree remarkably well with a solution based on satellite laser ranging data, which is currently believed to be one of the most accurate sources of information on changes in the Earth's dynamic oblateness.\u0007 Trends in both geocenter position and the Earth's oblateness are estimated as well. The results show a large variability depending on the GIA model adopted.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is emitted from a range of anthropogenic and natural sources, and since the industrial revolution its mean atmospheric concentration has climbed dramatically. CH4 produces a relatively high radiative forcing effect upon the Earth’s climate, and its atmospheric lifetime of approximately 10 years makes it an appealing target for the mitigation of climate change.\nHowever, the spatial and temporal variation of CH4 emissions are not well understood, though in recent years a number of top-down and bottom-up studies have attempted to construct improved emission budgets. However, some top-down studies suffer from poor observational coverage near the Amazon basin, particularly in the planetary boundary layer. Since emissions from this region, coming mainly from wetland and burning sources, are thought to be relatively high, additional observations in this region would greatly help to constrain the geographical distribution of the global CH4 emission budget. To this end, regular flask measurements of CH4 and other trace gases have been taken during flights over four Amazonian sites since 2010, as part of the AMAZONICA project. The GOSAT has been used to retrieve global column-average CH4 concentrations since mid-2009, whilst IASI, on-board Metop-A, has also been measuring atmospheric CH4 concentrations since its launch in 2006.\nWe present an assessment of Amazonian methane emissions for 2010 and 2011 using the TOMCAT Chemical Transport Model and the new variational inverse model, INVICAT. These models are used to attribute methane variations at each Amazon site to a source type and region, to assess the ability of our current CH4 flux estimates to reproduce these observations and to produce improved posterior emission estimates through assimilation of atmospheric observations. This study represents the first use of the INVICAT scheme to constrain emissions of any atmospheric trace gas. Whilst there is generally good agreement between the model and the observations prior to data assimilation, some high-methane events indicated by the observations are not captured by the model. We assimilate observations from the NOAA surface measurement network, from the AMAZONICA aircraft and from the GOSAT and IASI satellites, and find that tropical South American CH4 emissions approach 50 Tg(CH4)/yr.",

            "abstract": "Active volcanoes of all sizes and eruptive styles, emit chlorine and bromine gases observed to deplete ozone. Effusive, basaltic volcanic eruptions, typical in Hawaii and Iceland, extrude large lava flows, depleting ozone and causing global warming. Major explosive volcanoes also deplete ozone with the same emissions, causing winter warming, but in addition eject megatons of water and sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere where they form sulfuric-acid aerosols whose particles grow large enough to reflect and scatter ultraviolet sunlight, causing net global cooling for a few years. The relative amounts of explosive and effusive volcanism are determined by the configuration of tectonic plates moving around Earth’s surface. Detailed studies of climate change throughout geologic history, and since 1965, are not well explained by greenhouse-gas theory, but are explained quite clearly at OzoneDepletionTheory.info.\nOzone concentrations vary substantially by the minute and show close relationships to weather system highs and lows (as pointed out by Dobson in the 1920s), to the height of the tropopause, and to the strength and location of polar vortices and jet streams. Integrating the effects of volcanism on ozone concentrations and the effects of ozone concentrations on synoptic weather patterns should improve weather forecasting. For example, the volcano Bárðarbunga, in central Iceland, extruded 85 km2 of basaltic lava between August 29, 2014, and February 28, 2015, having a profound effect on weather.\nMost surprising, more than a week before the March 4 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, substantial amounts of ozone were released in the vicinity of the volcano precisely when surface deformation showed that magma first began moving up from sills below 4 km depth. Ozone similarly appears to have been emitted 3.5 months before the Pinatubo eruption in 1991. Readily available daily maps of ozone concentrations may allow early warning of an imminent volcanic eruption.",

This reveals that the ice sheet has a complex hydrological system that varies from year to year in response to external forcing and the development of hydrological pathways within and on the surface of the ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the characteristics of seismicity of oceanic transform faults through analyzing hydroacoustic data recorded along the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) and slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), respectively. The investigated region on the EPR is within 15°S-15°N from the Garrett to Clipperton Transform Fault during time period of June 1996 to September 2002. Meanwhile, the investigated region on the MAR is within 15°-37°N from the Fifteen-Twenty to Oceanographer Transform Fault during time period of February 1999 to August 2003. Using space-time correlation analysis, we matched hydroacoustic events with earthquakes from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) solutions for event magnitude greater than 4.8. Our analyses revealed systematic differences in the seismicity characteristics between the EPR and MAR: (1) Along the EPR, more than ninety percent of seismicity occurred within several kilometers from transform faults, a few percent occurred near over-lapping spreading centers, while the rest occurred along the ridge axis. Along the MAR, hydroacoustic seismicity is much more scattered near the ridge axis, transform faults, and non-transform offsets. (2) Near the EPR transform faults, the standard deviation of the separation distance of the hydroacoustic events from the morphologically-determined transform fault axis is s = 5.7 km. In contrast, the separation distance of hydroacoustic events to the transform faults is greater (s = 11.9 km), reflecting possibly more complex acoustic scattering due to complex MAR topography as well as more complex tectonic activity. (3) The mean hydroacoustic magnitude of the investigated EPR events is 3.3 (s = 0.6), while the mean hydroacoustic magnitude of the studied MAR events is 3.0 (s = 0.7). The mean hydroacoustic seismicity rate is 2.1 events per year per km of the EPR transform fault length, comparing to the mean seismicity rate of 0.5 events per year per km of the MAR transform fault length. (4) In both the EPR and MAR, we identified anomalous hydroacoustic seismicity in off-axis regions of unknown plate boundaries. These anomalous off-axis hydroacoustic activities and their implications on mid-ocean tectonics are the focus of our ongoing investigation.",

The impacts of both climate change and human interferences on streamflow further complicate the issue of reservoir inflow variability. This paper presents a case study of a reservoir that has both natural inflow (NI) and controlled inflow (CI), and analyzes how CI, which can be a deterministic item, mitigates the effect of NI variability on reservoir operation. Through a case study of the Biliu River Reservoir in northeastern China, we address the following questions: a) how will the combined NI and CI improve water supply reliability, and b) whether and how much of the reservoir storage can be reduced without lowering water supply reliability with a certain level of CI? It is found that CI complements to NI in terms of water supply reliability through a nonlinear relationship, as shown by an inverse “S” curve; the two “turning points” in the curve specify a range of CI with respect to the stochastic nature of NI and the reservoir operation objectives. For the case study reservoir, if the amount of annual CI increases to about 54% of the NI, the primary reservoir storage capacity can be reduced by 40% while providing the same level of water supply reliability.",

In combination with the diffuse and source-responsive flow equations, a new model for water infiltration that incorporates preferential flow is proposed in this paper. Its performance in estimating soil moisture at the catchment scale was tested with observed water content data from the Elder sub-basin of the South Fork Eel River, located in northern California, USA. The case study shows that the new model can improve the accuracy of soil water content simulation even at the catchment scale. The impacts of preferential flow on rainfall-runoff simulation were tested by the MISDc lumped hydrological model for the Elder River basin. 11 significant floods events, which were defined as having flood peak magnitudes greater than 10 times average discharge during the study period, were employed to assess runoff simulation improvement. The accuracy of the runoff simulation incorporating the preferential flow at the catchment scale improved significantly even though more model parameters were expected through the likelihood ratio test.",

            "abstract": "The land biosphere contributes most to the natural source of the long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), with N2O emissions being dependent on the turnover rate of both the terrestrial nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycle. The C:N stoichiometry of vegetation and soil organic matter links the cycles intimately. Sustained plant productivity increase must be supported by biological N fixation. Intensified N cycling in turn enhances N loss and thereby N2O emissions. The temporal and spatial dynamics of terrestrial N and C cycles and related terrestrial N2O emissions are poorly constrained over the glacial-interglacial transition and the Holocene. Here we reconstruct increased terrestrial N2O emissions since the Last Glacial Maximum based on N2O concentration and isotope measurements on several ice cores and show that this N2O increase can be explained by N cycle modelling – provided N fixation is allowed to respond dynamically to increasing N demand and turnover. The Ice core reconstructions suggest a deglacial increase of 1.1 ± 0.4 Tg N/yr in terrestrial and 0.6 ± 0.4 Tg/yr in oceanic N2O emissions, but relatively constant terrestrial emissions over the Holocene. Transient simulations with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model are shown to represent the climate and CO2 induced changes in terrestrial N2O emission, and suggest a deglacial increase in biological N fixation by 20%, independently of its absolute magnitude. Deciphering the response of biological N fixation during climatic changes is an important factor for our understanding of plant growth and the land carbon sink, alongside anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.",

The rapid growth in high volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) technologies to procure natural gas raises concern for possible fugitive methane leaks. We measure the flux and carbon isotope composition of methane emitted from the soil into the atmosphere at two geologically similar sites in eastern Tennessee (Morgan Co.), one with HVHF ongoing and the other currently undeveloped. Our objective is to quantify potential non-point source emissions of microbial and thermogenic methane, which are principally distinguished by their δ13C signatures.\nUsing cavity ring down spectroscopy (Picarro G2201-i) we collect rapid (~1 Hz) real-time measurements of methane emissions. The Picarro can measure fluxes of CH4 and CO2 at discrete locations by measuring their concentrations within a static and closed chamber that allows the gases to accumulate over time. Additionally, the mobility of the Picarro instrument permits the continuous collection of data, enabling broad spatial coverage. Applying geostatistical techniques to these data can highlight heterogeneities in the emissions of methane. Trends of where, how much, and what type of methane is escaping from the soil in environments with and without HVHF activities illustrate how to compare and contrast points as well as areas to assess the impact of this extensively implemented method of fossil fuel development.",

The result is large gaps in the availability of natural streamflow records from which to infer hydrologic understanding and inform water resources management. From basin-specific to continent-wide scales, many efforts have been undertaken to develop methods to estimate ungaged streamflow. This work applies and contrasts several statistical models of daily streamflow to more than 1,700 reference-quality streamgages across the conterminous United States using a cross-validation methodology. The variability of streamflow simulation performance across the country exhibits a pattern familiar to other continental scale modeling efforts performed for the United States. For portions of the West Coast and the dense, relatively homogeneous and humid regions of the eastern United States models produce reliable estimates of daily streamflow using many different prediction methods. Model performance for the middle portion of the United States, marked by more heterogeneous and arid conditions, and with larger contributing areas and sparser networks of streamgages, is consistently poor. A discussion of the difficulty of statistical interpolation and regionalization in these regions raises additional questions of data availability and quality, hydrologic process representation and dominance, and intrinsic variability.",

            "abstract": "The role of iron as a limiting micro-nutrient for primary production in High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll regions has been highlighted by paleoceanography, artificial fertilisation experiments and observed naturally fertilised systems. Examples of natural fertilisation have suggested that (sub-)mesoscale (1-100 km, days-months) horizontal transport modulates and structures the spatial and temporal extent of iron enrichment, phytoplankton production and biogeography. Here we combine different satellite products (altimetry, ocean color, PHYSAT), in-situ sampling, drifting floats and autonomous profilers to analyse the naturally iron-fertilised phytoplankton bloom of the Kerguelen region (Southern Ocean). Considering the Kerguelen Plateau as the main local source of iron, we compute two Lagrangian diagnostics: the “age” - how long before a water parcel has touched the plateau- and the “origin” - the latitude where a water parcel has left the plateau. First, we verify that these altimetry-defined diagnostics' spatial patterns -computed using geostrophic and Ekman corrected velocity fields- are coherent with the ones structuring the trajectories of more than 100 drifters and that trends in surface Chlorophyll (Chl) present an overall agreement with total column content (yet with ~2-3x differences in dynamic ranges likely due to the varying presence of Chl below the mixed layer). Second, assuming a first-order removal, we fit “age” with iron measurements and we estimate removal rates for bloom and abiotic conditions of respectively 0.058 and 0.041 1/d. Then, we relate “age” and “origin” with locations of high Chl concentrations and diatom-dominance. We find out that locations of high Chl concentration correspond to water parcels that have recently left the plateau. Furthermore, general additive models reveal that recently enriched waters are more likely to present a diatom dominance. However, the expected exponential fit varies within the geographic domain suggesting that other mechanisms may affect diatom dominance. These findings suggest that, in spite of their simple definitions, “age” and “origin” can be used to locate hotspots of primary production, study diatom-dominance biogeography and guide adaptive sampling stategies for biogeochemical fieldwork.",

            "abstract": "The role of anthropogenic aerosols in shaping 20th century SSTs through alteration of surface solar radiation (SSR) is still subject to debate.\nIdentifying and quantifying the relationship between aerosol-induced changes in SSR and the corresponding SST response is difficult due to the masking effect of numerous feedback mechanisms and general variability of the atmosphere-ocean system. We therefore analysed potential anthropogenic aerosol effects on SST with a cascade of experiments of increasing complexity: From atmosphere-only over mixed-layer ocean (MLO) experiments, to fully coupled transient ocean-atmosphere simulations, with and without greenhouse gases and / or aerosols, using the general circulation model ECHAM with explicit aerosol representation.\nWe find anthropogenic aerosols to be crucial to obtain realistic SSR and SST patterns, although co-location of changes in individual variables (aerosol optical depth, SSR, SST) is weak. The effect of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the MLO simulations is essentially additive on global and regional scales, an assumption frequently made in the literature. With atmosphere-only simulations we identified regions most prone to anthropogenic aerosol dimming throughout the 20th century using a strict criterion. From MLO equilibria representative of different decades throughout the 20th century, we identified ocean regions, whose SSTs are most sensitive to changing anthropogenic aerosol emissions. The surface temperature response patterns in our MLO simulations are more sensitive towards the choice of prescribed deep-ocean heat flux if anthropogenic aerosols were included as compared to greenhouse gas only simulations. This implies that ocean dynamics might mask some of the response and cautions against the use of just one set of deep-ocean heat fluxes in MLO studies.\nOur results corroborate not only the relevance of anthropogenic aerosols for SST responses, but also highlight the complexity and non-locality of the processes involved.",

Dissimilatory iron reduction, or the extracellular reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), is an integral biogeochemical process at these sites. Most of what is known about microbial Fe(III) reduction, however, has been established for mesophiles rather than the hyperthermophiles that are ubiquitous in hot environments. Our study examines the rates and constraints of Fe(III) bioreduction by hyperthermophilic archaea in order to address the types of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides that are favored for growth of hyperthermophiles, the rates of growth and Fe(II) production for these organisms, and the mineralogy of Fe(III) bioreduction and possible variations with electron acceptor.\nWe synthesized a range of nanophase Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides (2-line-ferrihydrite, 6-line-ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite, hematite, goethite, maghemite and akaganéite) and examined cell growth and Fe(II) production rates of Pyrodictium sp. Su06 and Pyrobaculum islandicum on the different Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides at 90°C and 95°C, respectively. Two different aggregate sizes of 2-line ferrihydrite and one of 6-line ferrihydrite were used to understand the effect of mineral aggregate size and shape on bioreduction. Direct cell counts and ferrozine assays were used to monitor cell growth and Fe(II) production respectively. Transformed mineral products were characterized using Mössbauer and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopies. Preliminary results suggest that Pyrodictium sp. Su06 can only utilize 2-line ferrihydrite, producing up to 35 mM Fe(II) for smaller aggregates, and 10 mM Fe(II) for larger aggregates. P. islandicum on the other hand, can reduce 2-line-ferrihydrite, goethite, and lepidocrocite, producing up to 8 mM Fe(II) with ferrihydrite, 7 mM with lepidocrocite, and 2 mM with goethite as an electron acceptor. Initial results from Mössbauer and ATR spectra combined suggest that nanophase magnetite is formed through the bioreduction of ferrihydrite. Our work provides new insights into characterizing hyperthermophile microbe-mineral interactions and the potential biosignatures that result.",

            "abstract": "Multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles across North Pacific oceanic Plate off Alaska Peninsula reveal the internal structure of a mature oceanic crust (48-56Ma) formed at fast to intermediate spreading rates. MCS data exhibit a prominent shallow subbasement events interpreted as being the base of the layer 2A. This is the first time that those events are imaged on MCS profiles from a >10Myr oceanic crust. This new result suggests that layer 2A might persist over time as a relatively low seismic velocity layer. MCS data across fast-spreading oceanic crust formed during plate reorganization contain abundant bright reflections, mostly confined to the lower crust above a highly reflective Moho transition zone. The lower crustal events dip predominantly toward the paleo-ridge axis at ∼10–30°. Dipping events in the lower crust are absent on profiles acquired across the intermediate-spreading oceanic crust emplaced after plate re-organization, where a Moho reflection is weak or absent. Our preferred interpretation is that the dipping reflections arise from shear zones that form near the spreading center. The reflection amplitude strength of these events can be explained by a combination of solidified melt that was segregated within the shear structures, mylonitization of the shear zones, and crystal alignment. Formation of secondary shear zones with this geometry requires that the upper mantle moves away from the ridge faster than the crust in response to an active asthenospheric upwelling. The other possible interpretation is that dipping events are caused by magmatic layering associated with accretion from an axial magma chamber. Considering that the lower crustal dipping events have only been imaged in regions that have experienced plate re-organizations, we speculate that locally enhanced mantle flow associated with these settings may lead to differential motion between the crust and the uppermost mantle, and therefore to shearing in the ductile lower crust.",

Ion foreshock instabilities are now understood to\ndrive all or nearly all TCVs; they generate localized changes in dynamic pressure at the dayside\nmagnetospheric boundary, resulting in transient magnetic field variations that generate field-aligned\ncurrents that propagate to the high latitude ionosphere and also compressional waves that produce\nsignatures at geosynchronous orbit and lower latitudes on the ground. In this work we extend earlier\nmultistation event studies by means of a statistical study comparing isolated TCV events observed\nbetween 2010 and 2014 by the MACCS array (Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies) in Arctic\nCanada, GOES-13, and several low-latitude INTERMAGNET magnetic observatories, all in the same\nlongitude sector. We found essentially no correlation between the amplitude of TCV events and the\namplitude of magnetic field compressions (ΔB) at GOES-13 and low-latitude ground stations. Comparing\nTCV amplitudes to time derivatives (dB/dt) at geosynchronous orbit and low latitudes, as suggested by\npublished approximate theoretical analyses, resulted in modest correlations. Consistent with earlier\nstudies, the low latitude response was strongest at stations under or very near the equatorial electrojet. \nWe also analyzed a set of sudden impulse (SI) events with bipolar high-latitude signatures; the\ngeostationary and low latitude compressions associated with them were relatively higher than those for\nTCVs.",

            "abstract": "Plasma impact onto Mercury’s surface can be an important contributor to Mercury’s exosphere through the process of ion sputtering. Under some circumstances, this process can produce a substantial fraction of the exosphere. When the impacting plasma originates from the magnetosphere itself, this sputtering process can conversely be considered as a sink for the plasma of the Mercury magnetosphere, providing evidence for the processes at work in that system. One such process is reconnection in Mercury's magnetotail, which can accelerate ions and electrons from the central plasma sheet toward the nightside of the planet. By analogy with processes at Earth, it is hypothesized that as these flows approach the planet, much of the plasma is diverted from impact onto the surface by the increasingly strong planetary magnetic field closer to the planet. The remainder of the plasma is expected to follow nearly dipolar field lines, impacting the nightside surface and potentially contributing to field-aligned currents.\nWe present the first direct evidence that this process is operating at Mercury. We examine ion precipitation events on Mercury’s nightside with the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) on the MESSENGER spacecraft, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015. We characterize the energy distributions of these events and their extent in latitude and local time. We use these observations to predict the precipitating proton flux from altitudes as low as 11 km. We use this information to bound the region of Mercury’s surface that remains protected from plasma bombardment by the planetary dipole magnetic field, and to explore the implications of this information for magnetospheric convection and exosphere generation at Mercury.",

            "abstract": "Granulite facies rocks may record strain that provides a record of compressional and/or extensional crustal events in hot orogenic cores and the roots of magmatic arcs. Although the precise timing of these events is important for constructing tectonic histories, it is often difficult to determine due to uncertain relationships between isotopic signatures, mineral growth, and textural features that record strain. In addition, there may be large uncertainties in isotope data due to intracrystalline diffusion and multiple crystallization events. L-S tectonites in lower crustal rocks from Fiordland, NZ record the early stages of extensional collapse of thickened magmatic arc crust. The precise age of these fabrics is important for constraining the timing of extension that led to opening of the Tasman Sea. High temperature granulite facies L-S fabrics in garnet reaction zones (GRZ) border syn- to post-deformational leucosomes. U-Pb zircon, Lu-Hf garnet, and Sm-Nd garnet ages, and trace elements in these phases indicate the complexity of assigning precise and useful ages. Zircon have soccer ball morphology with patchy and sector zoned CL. Zircon dates for igneous host and adjacent GRZ range over ca. 17 Ma. 236U-208Pb LA-ICP-MS are 108-125 Ma, N=124 (host & GRZ); however, chemical abrasion (CA) shifts GRZ dates ca. 2 Ma older. 236U-208Pb SHRIMP-RG dates cluster in 2 groups: 118.5±0.8 Ma, N=23 and 111.0±0.8 Ma, N=6. CA single crystal TIMS dates also fall into 2 groups: 117.6±0.1 Ma, N=4 and 116.6±0.2 Ma N=4. Garnet isochron ages determined from coarse garnet selvages adjacent to leucosomes range from 112.8±2.2 (147Sm-143Nd, 10 pts.) to 114.8±3.5 (177Lu-176Hf, 6 pts.) Ma. Zircon dates from all methods show ranges (>10 Ma) and 2 distinct populations. Host and GRZ zircon cannot be readily distinguished by age, lack younger rims, but have distinct Th/U trends and Eu/Eu* vs. Hf ratios. Difference in zircon trace element composition indicates either early leucosome emplacement or xenocrystic zircon in leucosomes. We conclude that the small number of oldest zircon grains are inherited, older zircon age populations (CA LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP-RG and TIMS) are near identical ca. 118 Ma and date intrusion, and that the youngest zircon and indistinguishable garnet ages (113-116 Ma) date syn-deformational granulite facies metamorphism.",

            "abstract": "Gyeongju is located in the central eastern part of South Korea. There are various directional columnar joint sets in Tertiary trachytic basalt formation along the shore. In particular, rare radiating columnar joints occur in this area. Columnar joints are parallel, prismatic columns that are formed as a result of contraction during the rapid cooling of lava flow, forming a three dimensional fracture network. In general, the radius and direction of the rock column represent the cooling rate and surface respectively. Radiating direction of columns here indicates that dome- or lobe-shaped lava was cooled from its surface to the core during the viscous lava flow. The fact that the trachytic textures of plagioclase laths are indistinct suggests that the radiating columnar joints are equivalent to the frontal end of the lava lobes. This area is currently has a shore trail course, which is being developed into a picturesque educational park. There are corresponding information boards on the trail near each type of columnar joints to explain not only the forming process and geological mechanisms but the importance of nature conservation to visitors, especially students. A variety of educational materials and educational programs linked to regular school curriculum are also being developed.",

            "abstract": "New ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) G15 model for the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) is presented. It is based on the modular filter based approach developed by Graizer and Kalkan (2007, 2009) for active tectonic environment in the Western US (WUS). The G15 model is based on the NGA-East database for the horizontal peak ground acceleration and 5%-damped pseudo spectral acceleration RotD50 component (Goulet et al., 2014). In contrast to active tectonic environment the database for the CEUS is not sufficient for creating purely empirical GMPE covering the range of magnitudes and distances required for seismic hazard assessments. Recordings in NGA-East database are sparse and cover mostly range of M<6.0 with limited amount of near-fault recordings. The functional forms of the G15 GMPEs are derived from filters—each filter represents a particular physical phenomenon affecting the seismic wave radiation from the source. Main changes in the functional forms for the CEUS relative to the WUS model (Graizer and Kalkan, 2015) are a shift of maximum frequency of the acceleration response spectrum toward higher frequencies and an increase in the response spectrum amplitudes at high frequencies. Developed site correction is based on multiple runs of representative VS30 profiles through SHAKE-type equivalent-linear programs using time histories and random vibration theory approaches. Site amplification functions are calculated for different VS30 relative to hard rock definition used in nuclear industry (Vs=2800 m/s). The number of model predictors is limited to a few measurable parameters: moment magnitude M, closest distance to fault rupture plane R, average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m of the geological profile VS30, and anelastic attenuation factor Q0. Incorporating anelastic attenuation Q0 as an input parameter allows adjustments based on the regional crustal properties. The model covers the range of magnitudes 4.0<M<8.5, distances of 0<R<1000 km, S-wave velocities of 450<VS30<2800 m/s and frequencies of 0.1<f<100 Hz. Comparison are made of the G15 model with existing CEUS GMPEs including the new NGA-East model. In general, the G15 model produces results lower than the median EPRI 2013 model at high frequencies (f>10 Hz) and is within the range of other models for frequencies lower than 2.5 Hz",

We observed ionospheric disturbances caused by the lower atmospheric resonance excited by two recent Plinian volcanic eruptions. In the case of the 2014 eruption of the Kelud volcano, Indonesia (Nakashima et al., submitted), the lower atmospheric resonance excited by the continuing eruption caused long-lasting harmonic oscillations not only in the ionosphere but also in the solid earth. This year, we add the new case of the 2015 eruption of the Calbuco volcano, Chile. Two large eruptions occurred at the Calbuco volcano over the days 22- 23 April 2015. The first sub-Plinian eruption started at ~16:04 UT, Apr. 22, and continued for about 1.5 hours. The second one started at ~4:00 UT, Apr. 23, and lasted for 6 hours. We detected continuous oscillations of ionospheric TEC corresponding to the two eruptions using GPS and GLONASS data from stations of the Argentine GNSS Array: RAMSAC. The waves propagated with a speed of ~1.0 km/s from the volcano. The frequency spectra of the TEC variation in the first eruption on Apr. 22 showed clear peaks at 3.7 and 4.4 mHz, the lower atmospheric resonance frequencies. The perturbation also showed overtone peaks and a 10 mHz pulse-like signal at the onset of the continuous oscillation. The results suggest that a Vulcanian explosion occurred prior to the Plinian eruption. On the other hand, the second eruption on Apr. 23 showed only a weaker peak at 4.4 mHz without overtones, suggesting that the second eruption was weaker but lasted longer than the first one. We are going to present detailed records of the 2015 Calbuco case, and compare it with past cases of ionospheric disturbances by volcanic eruptions, e.g. the 2014 Kelud volcano eruption.",

            "abstract": "Fluid had been considered as a possible factor in triggering earthquakes, but, the evidence in elucidating the behavior and mechanism is still unresolved. Our previous studies in attenuation, noted as 1/ Qs, for the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake suggest that the fracture zone associated with fault zone could be considered as a fluid reservoir, which possibly yield to some observations/detections of phenomena associated with pre-, co- or post-seismic of a larger earthquake. The sudden changes in attenuation co-seismically with decay following a diffusion process indicated possible high pore-fluid saturation within fractured fault zone from fully to partial saturation. We suspect this process might yield the migration of fluid flow, and thus, related to the occurrence of some aftershocks. Aftershock sequence following a mainshock was often considered to be related to regional tectonic stress and stress triggering of a mainshock. For stress triggering, it refers to the seismicity in the stress increase regime with some lapse time (>one month) for the static stress triggering. In this study, we tried to deviate the possible fluid associated aftershocks by focusing on the stress decrease regime and 1-3-month aftershock sequence to understand their possible association. The migration of fluid flow increases the pore-pressure, which reduce the normal stress, and, thus, yield the co-seismic negative Coulomb’s stress regime to become positive to trigger these fluid flow associated aftershocks. For the study of the Chi-Chi earthquake sequence, from the elapse time versus distance of the seismicity in this regime suggest a fluid flow of about 220m/day. We investigate the possible passage of fluid flow in the regime and understand its transient behavior associated with the fault zone damage and healing process.",

Large-scale variations in the neutral density compare well with thermospheric models. But the most significant variations are seen during periods of magnetic activity when even very modest storms produce enhancements in the thermospheric temperature and density that are seen at the equator. Increases in the neutral density are consistent with increases in the neutral atmosphere scale height associated with a global increase in the neutral temperature apparently produced by high latitude energy inputs that influence low latitudes through a disturbance that propagates rapidly to low latitudes. Variations in the neutral density are also seen during quiet times.

            "abstract": "From the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2010, an unprecedented drought swept across southwest China (SW) and led to a severe shortage in drinking water and a huge loss to regional economy. Monitoring and predicting the severe drought with several months in advance is of critical importance for such hydrological disaster assessment, preparation and mitigation. In this study, we attempted to carry out a model-based hydrological monitoring and seasonal forecasting framework, and assessed its skill in capturing the evolution of the SW drought in 2009-2010. Using the satellite-based meteorological forcings and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, the drought conditions were assessed in a near-real-time manner based on a 62-year (1952-2013) retrospective simulation, wherein the satellite data was adjusted by a gauge-based forcing to remove systematic biases. Bias-corrected seasonal forecasting outputs from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) was tentatively applied for a seasonal hydrologic prediction and its predictive skill was overall evaluated relative to a traditional Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) method with lead time varying from 1 to 6 months. The results show that the climate model-driven hydrologic predictability is generally limited to 1-month lead time and exhibits negligible skill improvement relative to ESP during this drought event, suggesting the initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) play a dominant role in forecasting performance. The research highlights the value of the framework in providing accurate IHCs in a real-time manner which will greatly benefit drought early-warning.",

However, our fundamental understanding of the coupled flow dynamics of CO2 and water in complex geologic media still remains limited, especially at the pore scale. Recently, studies have been carried out in 2D homogeneous models with the micro-PIV technique, yielding very interesting observations of pore-scale flow transport. The primary aim of this work is to leverage this experimental protocol to quantify the pore-scale flow of water and liquid/supercritical CO2 in 2D heterogeneous porous micromodels under reservoir-relevant conditions. The goal is to capture the dynamics of this multi-phase flow in a porous matrix that mimics the heterogeneity of natural rock. Fluorescent microscopy and the micro-PIV technique are employed to simultaneously measure the spatially-resolved instantaneous velocity field in the water and quantify the instantaneous spatial configuration of both phases. The results for heterogeneous micromodels will be presented and compared with those for homogeneous micromodels, yielding valuable insight into flow processes at the pore scale in natural rock.",

            "abstract": "Si, O, and S are major candidates for light elements in the planetary core. In the early stage of the planetary formation, the core formation started by percolation of the metallic liquid though silicate matrix because Fe-S-O and Fe-S-Si eutectic temperatures are significantly lower than the solidus of the silicates. Therefore, in the early stage of accretion of the planets, the eutectic liquid with S enrichment was formed and separated into the core by percolation. The major light element in the core at this stage will be sulfur. The internal pressure and temperature increased with the growth of the planets, and the metal component depleted in S was molten. The metallic melt contained both Si and O at high pressure in the deep magma ocean in the later stage. Thus, the core contains S, Si, and O in this stage of core formation.\nPartitioning experiments between solid and liquid metals indicate that S is partitioned into the liquid metal, whereas O is weakly into the liquid. Partitioning of Si changes with the metallic iron phases, i.e., fcc iron-alloy coexisting with the metallic liquid below 30 GPa is depleted in Si. Whereas hcp-Fe alloy above 30 GPa coexisting with the liquid favors Si. This contrast of Si partitioning provides remarkable difference in compositions of the solid inner core and liquid outer core among different terrestrial planets.\nOur melting experiments of the Fe-S-Si and Fe-O-S systems at high pressure indicate the core-adiabats in small planets, Mercury and Mars, are greater than the slope of the solidus and liquidus curves of these systems. Thus, in these planets, the core crystallized at the top of the liquid core and ‘snowing core’ formation occurred during crystallization. The solid inner core is depleted in both Si and S whereas the liquid outer core is relatively enriched in Si and S in these planets. On the other hand, the core adiabats in large planets, Earth and Venus, are smaller than the solidus and liquidus curves of the systems. The inner core of these planets crystallized at the center of the core and it has the relatively Si rich inner core and the S enriched outer core. Based on melting and solid-liquid partitioning, the equation of state, and sound velocity of iron-light element alloys, we examined the plausible distribution of light elements in the liquid outer and solid inner cores of the terrestrial planets.",

            "abstract": "The seasonal cycle of Arctic Ocean temperature is weak due to the insulating and light scattering effects of sea ice cover and the moderating influence of the seasonal storage and release of heat through ice melting and freezing. The retreat of sea ice and other changes in recent decades is already warming surface air temperatures in winter. We our analysis of future change with an examination of the dominant processes in the seasonal response of the Arctic Ocean and sea ice to surface forcing as they appear in historical simulations of 14 CMIP5 climate models. In both models and observations the seasonal heat budget is dominated by a local balance between net surface heating and storage in the heat content of the ocean and in melting/freezing of sea ice. Observations suggest ocean heat storage is more important than sea ice melt, while in most models sea ice melt dominates. The dominant balance in the seasonal freshwater budget is the exchange of freshwater between the liquid ocean and sea ice. At its peak this rate of exchange exceeds 2Sv. The appearance of sea ice and also ocean stratification in both the heat and freshwater budgets provides two links between the budgets and two mechanisms for feedback. Our analysis of the seasonal cycle in the coming centuries suggests that the loss of sea ice will dramatically increase the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature in the Arctic Ocean. Depending on the rate of growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases the seasonal range in Arctic sea surface temperature may exceed 10°C by year 2300, greatly increasing the stratification of the summer mixed layer.",

Our results demonstrate that sediment and the basaltic crust harbor microbial communities that are phylogenetically connected, but the eveness is characteristic of the environment. We will discuss the microbial community transitions that occur horizontally along fluid flow pathways and vertically across the sediment basement interface, as well as the possible implications regarding the controls of microbial community composition along deep sediment-basement interfaces in hydrothermal systems.

            "abstract": "The GABLS4 intercomparison, launched in summer 2014, aims to study the interaction between the boundary layer and the surface in strong stability and during the diurnal transition focussing on the decrease of the turbulence. For this, the observation site of Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau was chosen mainly for two reasons: the availability of the in-situ measurements from a 45-m tower and a homogeneous surface with a low conductivity such as snow on a flat topography. The intercomparison will consist of 3 inter-comparisons : Single Column Model (SCM), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and land-snow model (LSM). It is organized in two steps. The first one is dedicated to the LSM and the SCM with an interactive surface (snow) scheme. Then, in the second one, the observed surface temperature will be prescribed in the SCM and in the LES models. The first GABLS4 workshop was organized in May 2015 in Toulouse (France). 12 groups with LSM/SCM and 7 for LES/DNS sent already the simulations. After a brief description of the setup, the main results for the SCM intercomparison with observations and some preliminary results from the LES will be presented. The setup and more details are available on the GABLS4 Web page (\nhttp://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/aladin/meshtml/GABLS4/GABLS4.html\n).",

Moreover, the eastern hemisphere of the inner core is characterized by isotropic P-wave velocity and strong attenuation whereas the western hemisphere exibits lower P-wave velocity, less overall attenuation and anisotropy both in velocity and attenuation. While the hemispherical pattern of velocity and attenuation can be explained by variable grain size, anisotropy calls for the existence of preferential orientations in the material.\nWe have investigated the role of grain elongation and flattening on the propagation of elastic waves in two-phase materials and single-mineral-cubic aggregates with overall transverse isotropic symmetry. Based on the Dyson equation, explicit expressions of attenuation and phase velocity for q-P, q-SV and q-SH waves have been derived. Attenuation and velocity strongly vary with the frequency, the direction of propagation and the grain shape. We find that the fast/slow direction of propagation is not systematically aligned with the direction of low/high attenuation. The hemispherical pattern of seismic properties in the uppermost inner core can be explained by lateral variations in texture with radially elongated grains in the Western hemisphere and equi-axed grains in the Eastern hemisphere. This texture remains compatible with an eastward translation of the inner core.",

            "abstract": "A certain amount of water is considered to be transported into the deep mantle through subduction in the forms of hydrous minerals. Although the major constituent minerals can host significant amounts of water in the upper mantle, bridgmantite (Brm) and ferropericlase (fPc) can incorporate only a limited amount of water. Therefore, if water is transported into the lower mantle through subduction, it must be hosted by dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMSs) such as phase D.\nHowever, it is not clear whether the DHMSs can exist in the lower mantle. Brm contains significant amounts of Fe3+ (Fe3+/ΣFe > 0.1) even in coexistence with metallic iron. The amounts of Fe3+ increase with increasing Al2O3 content in Brm, and the Fe3+/ΣFe ratio exceeds 0.5 in the lower-mantle Brm. Since the Fe3+/ΣFe ratios are only 0.01-0.03 and 0.10-0.14 in the upper-mantle peridotite and MORB, respectively, formation of Brm would take oxygen out of other minerals. Hence, we expect breakdown of DHMS by reduction of OH into H2 through the Brm formation.\nTo test this hypothesis, we conducted the following experiments. The starting material consisted of an assemblage of a pre-synthesized phase D together with an natural olivine single crystal or a pyroxene aggregate with bulk composition of pyrolite minus fPc (Pyr-fPc) synthesized at an PO2 ≈ IW, T = 1100 K and ambient pressure. The two-phase samples were pressurized to 28 GPa and heated to 1100 K for 1 hour. First SEM observation of recovered samples shows that a 2-µm thick SiO2-rich fine-grained layer has formed on the boundary between phase D and Pyr-fPc Brm indicating the breakdown of phase D, while no evidence of breakdown of phase D was observed in the experiments with the olivine single crystal.\nThe present result suggests that, although water can be transported into the top of the lower mantle in a form of phase D through subduction, phase D will decompose by reduction at the depth to 720 km. The produced H2 should be re-incorporated into the upper mantle. Thus, water cannot be transported through subduction to the majority of the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "In the North Atlantic Ocean today, the North Atlantic Current (NAC) transports warm salty water to high northern latitudes, with key feedbacks on global climate. The mean latitudinal position of the NAC dictates whether the mid-latitude North Atlantic is dominated by warm, nutrient-poor subtropical surface waters (as it is during Late Pleistocene interglacials) or cold, nutrient-rich Arctic surface waters (as it is during Late Pleistocene glacials). The origin of this glacial-interglacial pattern in North Atlantic productivity is hypothesised to be linked to the onset of southward deflections of the NAC into the mid latitude North Atlantic after 2.7 Ma, during the late Pliocene intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation (iNHG). Yet, changes in wind-driven Ekman divergence and the upwelling of nutrient-rich thermocline waters are also hypothesised to influence surface water productivity in this region from this time. To shed new light on the origin of these large-amplitude productivity cycles, we present new suborbital-resolution records of surface and thermocline water properties from IODP Site U1313 (41°N), a benchmark mid-latitude drillsite at which this transition in productivity is recorded, during iNHG (MIS G11 to 95, ~2.82-2.41 Ma). We reconstruct surface and thermocline temperatures using Mg/Ca ratios of the tests of two species of planktic Foraminifera with distinct depth habitats, Globigerinoides ruber (surface mixed layer) and Globorotalia crassaformis (500-800 m water depth), and upper water column stratification using co-registered thermocline-surface water δ18O and δ13C gradients. With these new data and other published proxy records from Site U1313, we compare competing hypotheses to explain drivers of the large export productivity changes previously documented at this site during iNHG.",

            "abstract": "A water vapor column retrieval for use during the Arctic Winter is presented. The retrieval, known as PLDC15, uses data from several passive microwave satellite instruments which measure brightness temperatures near the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line in conjunction with a priori information. Comparisons to a ground truth in Barrow, Alaska, the G-Band Vapor Radiometer (GVR), gives a standard deviation of 0.39 kg m-2 and a bias of 0.07 kg m-2 for water vapor column less than 6 kg m-2. This error is smaller when compared to other microwave techniques and comparable to re-analyses datasets while having a higher spatial resolution (< 40 km) with significantly more structure (See attached figure for water vapour column comparison of a) PLDC15 retrieval and b) Arctic System Reanalysis dataset). Pan-Arctic maps of water vapor column are produced many times daily using the large number of datasets from passive microwave instruments that are available.\nThe PLDC15 retrieval is used for several purposes. A comparison to Arctic Radiosonde measurements of water vapor column is shown to assess the Radiosondes capability of measuring water vapor at various locations in the Arctic in terms of standard deviation and bias. Using the high resolution maps of water vapor column, estimates of water vapor contribution from ice leads can be obtained, particularly in 2013 and 2015 at which time there was a considerable number of leads.\nThe PLDC15 retrieval can further be used to improve re-analysis data sets, for numerical weather prediction models, and water vapor budgets of the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Predicting how nutrient fluxes that cross ecosystem boundaries will respond to future climate change is one of the greatest challenges for ecology in the 21st century. In southwestern (SW) Alaska, Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and nitrogen (N)-fixation by alder (Alnus spp.) provide key nutrient subsidies to freshwater systems. The importance of alder-derived nutrients (ADN) to aquatic systems will increase as alder cover expands under climate warming and salmon harvesting reduces marine-derived nutrients. We investigate broad-scale spatial and temporal drivers of ADN and stream N:P in 26 streams in SW Alaska. Alder cover and watershed features were measured using satellite images and topographic maps in ArcGIS. Stream water samples were collected in each spring and summer from 2010-2013 and analyzed for dissolved N and total phosphorus (TP). We obtained annual growing season length (AGSL) and sum of growing degree days (GDD) data from weather stations. Elevation was inversely related to alder cover, stream N, and N:P (ρ=-0.802, -0.65, and -0.71 resp., p<0.01, n=208). Alder cover had the largest influence on stream N (mean β estimate=0.402, 90% CIs). Stream N increased with alder cover, under longer AGSL, and lower GDD (interaction effect sizes between alder and stream N=0.196 and -0.185 resp., 90% CIs), suggesting that long growing seasons with minimal heat accumulation during the spring and fall increased ADN export. Higher P was associated with lower temperatures, possibly reflecting reduced P demand under low rates of metabolic activity. Structural equation modeling revealed significant causal relationships among elevation, alder cover, and stream N:P across multiple years (r2=0.94, X2=742.8, df=9, p<0.01). All paths in the model were significant (p<0.01) except between stream N:P and weather (p=0.165). These results demonstrate that spatial variation in alder cover associated with elevation is a stronger regulator of ADN fluxes and stream N:P than temporal variation in growing season conditions. Therefore, the aquatic productivity of streams at low elevations that receive large amounts of ADN will be most resilient to climate change.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of high-velocity rotary shear apparatus, several experimental studies have been conducted in the last decades improving our understanding of fault friction at seismic slip rates (0.1 < Vs < 10 m/s). Here, we present the results of a series of tests conducted on Westerly granite with the Slow to HIgh Velocity Apparatus (SHIVA - INGV Rome), coupled with a high frequency acoustic monitoring (4 MHz sampling rate). Experiments were conducted under normal stress (σn) ranging from 5 to 20 MPa and at Vs between 3 mm/s and 3 m/s. Additional experiments were conducted in the presence of pore fluid at equivalent effective normal stress.\nIn dry conditions, two friction drops are observed: the first drop at Vs > 0.1 m/s is explained by flash heating mechanism while the second drop is due to the formation and growth of a continuous melt layer on the fault surface. In wet conditions, only the second drop of friction is observed. Average values of the fracture energy are independent of normal stress and sliding velocity. However, measurements of elastic wave velocities travelling through the fault strongly suggest that higher damage is induced for 0.1< Vs <0.3 m/s for equivalent final displacement. This observation is also supported by acoustic emission (AEs) recordings. Indeed, most the AEs are recorded after the initiation of the second friction drop, that is, once the fault surface temperature is high, suggesting they may be due to thermal cracking induced by heat diffusion. In addition, the presence of pore fluid pressure (water) delayed the appearance of AEs, supporting the link between AEs and the production and diffusion of heat.\nUsing the thermo-elastic crack model, we demonstrate that damage can indeed be induced by heat diffusion. Our theoretical results predict accurately the amount of sample wear, supporting the idea that gouge production and gouge comminution is in fact largely controlled by thermal cracking. Finally, we show that this new fracture energy term is non-negligible in the energy balance so that thermal cracking induced during seismic slip, in dry conditions, could play a key role both in the evolution of the physical properties of the slip zone and the high frequency radiation.",

SMD created the Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) to offer students the opportunity to design, build, and fly instruments on NASA’s unique suborbital research platforms. This paper explores the projects, the impact, and the lessons learned of USIP.\nUSIP required undergraduate teams to design, build, and fly a scientific instrument in 18 months or less. Students were required to form collaborative multidisciplinary teams to design, develop and build their instrument. Teams quickly learned that success required skills often overlooked in an academic environment. Teams quickly learned to share technical information in a clear and concise manner that could be understood by other disciplines. The aggressive schedule required team members to hold each other accountable for progress while maintaining team unity. Unanticipated problems and technical issues led students to a deeper understanding of the need for schedule and cost reserves. Students exited the program with a far deeper understanding of project management and team dynamics. Through the process of designing and building an instrument that will enable new research transforms students from textbook learners to developers of new knowledge.\nThe initial USIP project funded 10 undergraduate teams that flew a broad range of scientific instruments on scientific balloons, sounding rockets, commercial rockets and aircraft. Students were required to prepare for and conduct the major reviews that are an integral part of systems development. Each project conducted a Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review and Mission Readiness review for NASA officials and flight platform providers. By preparing and presenting their designs to technical experts, the students developed a deeper understanding of the technical and programmatic project pieces that were necessary for success.\nA student survey was conducted to assess the impact of USIP. Over 90% of students reported a significant improvement in their technical and project management skills. Perhaps more importantly, 88% of students reported that they have a far better appreciation for the value of multi-disciplinary teams.",

            "abstract": "Understanding plot-scale Cs-137 wash-off is indispensable for predicting Cs-137 fate. However, there are only a few numbers of long-term observations and hence lack of information on temporal trends of Cs-137 wash-off leaves uncertainties on the predictions. This study shows approximately three years’ observation results of plot-scale Cs-137 wash-off from various land uses after the accident of Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant. Erosion plots (22.3 m × 5.0 m) were established in 2011 and 2013 on two uncultivated farmlands (FL-A1, FL-B1), two cultivated farmlands (FL-A2, FL-B2), three grasslands (GL-A, GL-B, GL-C) and one Japanese cedar forest (JCdF) in Kawamata town. Eroded sediments as well as the data of rainfall and vegetation cover were collected almost every two weeks. At the end of observations, we took soil samples from three to nine points on each plot with scraper plates (30 cm ×15 cm) to obtain Cs-137 depth distributions. Collected sediment and soil samples were dried, weighed and measured with HPGe type gamma detectors. We calculated βeff, ‘effective’ relaxation depth (g/m2), based on Cs-137 depth distributions. Annual soil loss ranged from 0.04 to 75 t/ha/year and the largest was from FL-A2 followed by FL-B2, FL-A1, FL-B1, GL-A, GL-B, JCdF and then GL-C. Sediment amount weighted mean values of Cs-137 concentration normalized by initial deposition density ranged from 0.0062 to 0.084 ((Bq/kg)/(Bq/m2)) and the largest was from JCdF followed by FL-B1, FL-A1, GL-A, FL-A2, FL-B2, GL-B, and then GL-C. Decreasing trends of Cs-137 concentration were found on FL-A1 and FL-B1, whereas no trend was found on other plots due to constant values on FL-A2 and FL-B2 and due to variable values on GL-C, GL-B, GL-C and JCdF. Depth distributions of Cs-137 on FL-A1 and FL-B1 showed exponential distributions with low inventories on their upslope points and deeper penetrations with high inventories on their downslope points. Mean values of βeff ranged from 2.1 to 24.5 g/cm2 and positively correlated with annual soil loss on uncultivated farmlands and grasslands. These results indicate that active soil erosion on uncultivated slopes results in decreasing trends of Cs-137 concentration of sediments and possibly enhances decreases of radiological dose by removing surface soil of high Cs-137 content and mixing them with subsoil.",

            "abstract": "Continental ice sheets can erode vast areas and carry unsorted sediment great distances before being deposited en masse. The resulting glacial diamictites can provide important information on the integrated geologic history of continents. Detrital mineral analysis, such as U-Pb geochronological and Hf isotope geochemical characterization of zircon, is one way of interrogating this sedimentary archive, and here we apply this approach to glacial diamictites of Mesoarchean and Neoproterozoic age in southern Africa and Paleoproterozoic age in North America.\nSeveral major magmatic events between 3.3 and 2.9 Ga, most notably at 3.08 Ga are recorded in detrital zircons from several of the Mesoarchean diamictites. Hf isotopes in these zircons are almost exclusively superchondritic, indicating that these are major juvenile crust forming events. In contrast, Neoproterozoic Namibian diamictites are almost devoid of Archean zircons and record a major 1.9 Ga population with subchondritic epsilon Hf, consistent with the reworking of Neoarchean (2.5-2.7 Ga) crust. Paleoproterozoic diamictites from North America (Ontario and Wyoming) are all dominated by a common age peak at 2.7 Ga with a narrow superchondritic Hf isotopic range, consistent with a major crustal growth event at this time in North America.\nMajor globally recognized crust forming events that occurred at 2.7 Ga and orogenic events that occurred at 1.9 Ga are recorded by these diamictites. Lack of pre-Mesoarchean U-Pb ages and the superchondritic epsilon Hf of the Neoarchean and Mesoarchean detrital zircons are suggestive of minimal emergent continental crust prior to ~3.6 Ga or reflect significant preservation and/or recycling issues for the early Earth that are not well understood.",

            "abstract": "Dimethyl sulfide plays a major role in the global sulfur cycle, meaning that it is important to the formation of sulfate aerosol and thus to cloud condensation nuclei populations and cloud formation. The summertime Arctic atmosphere sometimes resides in a cloud condensation nuclei limited regime, making it very susceptible to changes in their number. Despite the interest generated by this situation, dimethyl sulfide has only rarely been measured in the summertime Arctic. This work presents the first high time resolution (10 Hz) DMS mixing ratio measurements for the Eastern Canadian Archipelago and Baffin Bay in summer performed on an icebreaker cruise as one component of the Network on Climate and Aerosols: Addressing Key Uncertainties in Remote Canadian Environments (NETCARE). Measured mixing ratios ranged from below the detection limit of 4 pptv to 1155 pptv with a median value of 186 pptv. We used transfer velocity parameterizations from the literature to generate the first flux estimates for this region in summer, which ranged from 0.02-12 μmol m-2 d-1. DMS has a lifetime against OH oxidation of 1-2 days, allowing both local sources and transport to play roles in its atmospheric mixing ratio. Through air mass trajectory analysis using FLEXPART-WRF and chemical transport modeling using GEOS-Chem, we have identified the relative contributions of local sources (Lancaster Sound and Baffin Bay) as well as transport from further afield (the Hudson Bay System and the Beaufort Sea) and find that the local sources dominate. GEOS-Chem is able to reproduce the major features of the measured time series, but is biased low overall (median 72 pptv). We discuss non-marine sources that could account for this low bias and estimate the possible contributions to DMS mixing ratios from lakes, biomass burning, melt ponds and coastal tundra. Our results show that local marine sources of DMS dominate the summer Arctic atmosphere, but that non-local and possibly non-marine contributions have a detectable influence.",

The occurrence of several rare M > 5 earthquakes in the central and eastern US, coincident with the passage of the USArray Transportable Array through this region and the deployment of the SPREE array over the MRS, provides unprecedented raypath coverage of stable North America. We fit regional S and Rayleigh wavetrains using the method of partitioned waveform inversion (PWI) (Nolet, 1990) to provide constraints on 1D path-average structure between each station-event pair. In a joint inversion for 3D structure, we combine these new constraints with waveform constraints from the NA07 tomographic model (Bedle and van der Lee, 2009) and Moho depth constraints from active-source and receiver function studies. The dense station coverage and abundance of relatively short (10-15 degrees) path lengths through high-Q stable lithosphere in our new waveform-fitting dataset permit us to fit the fundamental and higher modes and to fit up to frequencies of 0.1 Hz for some stations and events. This resolves finely-layered structure in the lithosphere, including a transitional layer between crust and mantle that is present below much of the stable continent and most pronounced in the northeastern US.",

Despite its simplicity and limitations, the model has proved useful for a large number of applications such as topographic evolution, knickpoint migration, palaeotopography reconstruction, and the determination of uplift patterns and rates. However, the unknown parameters K, m and n are often fixed arbitrarily or are based on assumptions about the physics of the erosion processes that are not always valid, which considerably alters the use and interpretation of the model.\nIn this study, we compile published 10Be basin-wide erosion rates (N= 1423) in order to assess the m/n ratio (or concavity index), the slope exponent n and erodibility coefficient K using the integral method of channel profile analysis. These three parameters are calculated for 67 areas and allow for a global scale analysis in terms of climatic, tectonic and environmental settings. Our results suggest that (i) many sites are too noisy or do not have enough data to predict n and K with a satisfying level of confidence; (ii) the slope exponent is predominantly greater than one, meaning that the relationship between erosion rate and the channel gradient is non-linear, supporting the idea that incision is a threshold controlled process. Furthermore, a multi-regression analysis and the calculation of n and K using a reference concavity index m/n = 0.45 demonstrates that (iii) many intuitive or previously demonstrated local-scale trends, such as the correlation between erosion rate and climate, do not appear at a global scale.",

            "abstract": "Plant photosynthetic rates increase and stomatal apertures decrease in response to elevated atmospheric CO[2] (eCO2), increasing both plant carbon (C) availability and water use efficiency. These physiological responses to eCO2 are well characterised and understood, however the ecological effects of these responses as they cascade through a suite of plant and ecosystem processes are complex and subject to multiple interactions and feedbacks. Therefore the response of the terrestrial carbon sink to increasing atmospheric CO[2] remains the largest uncertainty in global C cycle modelling to date, and is a huge contributor to uncertainty in climate change projections.\nPhase 2 of the FACE Model-Data Synthesis (FACE-MDS) project synthesises ecosystem observations from five long-term Free-Air CO[2] Enrichment (FACE) experiments and one open top chamber (OTC) experiment to evaluate the assumptions of a suite of terrestrial ecosystem models. The experiments are: The evergreen needleleaf Duke Forest FACE (NC), the deciduous broadleaf Oak Ridge FACE (TN), the prairie heating and FACE (WY), and the Nevada desert FACE, and the evergreen scrub oak OTC (FL).\nAn assumption centered approach is being used to analyse: the interaction between eCO2 and water limitation on plant productivity; the interaction between eCO2 and temperature on plant productivity; whether increased rates of soil decomposition observed in many eCO2 experiments can account for model deficiencies in N uptake shown during Phase 1 of the FACE-MDS; and tracing carbon through the ecosystem to identify the exact cause of changes in ecosystem C storage.",

            "abstract": "The Gobi-Altay massif in southwestern Mongolia recorded one of the largest intracontinental earthquakes during the XXth century (04.12.57, Mw~8). This left-lateral strike-slip earthquake ruptured a 260 km-long section along the eastern part of the Bogd fault. About 100km of additional ruptures (essentially reverse) were also documented along subsidiary faults. Previous morphological and paleoseismological investigations along the eastern Bogd Fault determined a long-term slip rate of ~1 mm/yr and a mean recurrence interval of 3000-4000 years for events similar to the 1957 earthquake. The active tectonics of the western part of the Gobi-Altay massif proves to be more complex than the eastern section. Deformation is occurring along two strike-slip fault systems, the Western Bogd fault and the Valley-of-Lakes fault. This raises the question of the distribution of the deformation in space and time. In order to determine slip rates and dates of past events along the Western Bogd and Valley of Lakes faults, we carried out tectonic geomorphology and paleoseismological investigations. Preliminary results from a first expedition in 2014 allow estimating a slip rate of 0.3 mm/yr along the Valley-of-Lakes fault during the past 150 ka. Further analyses from a second expedition in summer 2015, should allow testing whether this rate remained stable through time, notably over the Holocene period. They will also enable determining the slip rate and the age of the most recent surface-rupturing event along the Western Bogd fault.",

            "abstract": "In the Polar Oceans, the surface ocean waves break up sea ice cover and create the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), an area between the sea-ice free ocean and pack ice characterized by highly fragmented ice. This band of sea ice cover is undergoing dramatic changes due to sea ice retreat, with a widening of up to 39% in the Arctic Ocean reported over the last three decades and projections predicting a continuing increase. The surface waves, sea ice and ocean interact in the MIZ through multiple complex feedbacks and processes which are not accounted for in any of the present-day climate models.\nTo address this issue, we present a model development which implements surface ocean wave effects in the global Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) NEMO, coupled to the CICE sea ice model. Our implementation takes into account a number of physical processes specific to the MIZ dynamics. Incoming surface waves are attenuated due to scattering and energy dissipation induced by the presence of ice cover, which is in turn fragmented in response to flexural stresses. This fragmentation modifies the floe size distribution and impacts the sea ice thermodynamics by increasing lateral melting and thus affecting momentum and heat transfer between sea ice and the upper ocean. In addition, the dynamics of the sea ice is modified by a combined rheology that takes into account floe collisions and allows for a more realistic representation of the MIZ.\nWe present results from the NEMO OGCM at 1 and 0.25 degree resolution with a wave-ice interaction module. The module introduces two new diagnostics previously unavailable in OGCM’s: surface wave spectra in sea ice covered areas, and floe size distribution (FSD) due to wave-induced fragmentation. We evaluate the sea ice and wave simulations with available observational estimates, and analyze the impact of these MIZ processes on the ocean and sea ice state. We focus on ocean mixing, stratification, circulation and the role of the MIZ in ocean seasonal variability.\nThe study is part of the EU FP7 project ‘Ships and Waves Reaching Polar Regions (SWARP)’, aimed at developing techniques for sea ice and waves modelling and forecasting in the MIZ in the Arctic.",

This presentation describes the iterative planning, implementation, and evaluation process of an ongoing transdisciplinary sea level rise (SLR) research project. Observations, reflections, and recommendations from firsthand experience are shared, illustrated with examples, and placed within a transdisciplinary research framework. The NOAA-sponsored project, Ecological Effects of Sea Level Rise in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (EESLR-NGOM) is a six-year regional study involving a team of biology, ecology, civil/coastal engineering, and communication scholars working with government agency personnel and industry professionals; supervising students and post-doctoral researchers; and engaging a group of non-academic stakeholders (i.e., coastal resource managers). EESLR-NGOM’s focus is on detailed assessment and process-based modeling to project SLR impacts on northern Gulf of Mexico coastal wetland habitats and flood plains. This presentation highlights collaboration, communication, and project management considerations, and explains knowledge co-production from a dynamic combination of natural and social scientific methods (secondary data analysis, computer modeling, field observations, field and laboratory experiments, focus group interviews, surveys) and interrelated stakeholder engagement mechanisms (advisory committee, project flow chart, workshops, focus groups, webinars) infused throughout the EESLR-NGOM project to improve accessibility and utility of the scientific results and products. Attention is also given to project evaluation including monitoring, multiple quantitative and qualitative measures, and recognition of challenges and limitations.

However, very little is understood on the metabolisms and ecological roles of this cosmopolitan sedimentary archaea , partly due to obstacles of cultivation. Bathyarchaeota could be divided into large members of subgroups with potentially high genetic heterogeneity, implying different metabolic capabilities and functions in different subgroups. Here, we report our work on investigating Bathyarchaeota abundance and types of subgroups in the South China Sea(SCS) sediments, aim to understand their ecological roles in the carbon cycling. Bathyarchaeota were found the most dominant archaeal group in the sediments of SCS , most of which belong to subgroups MCG-8, MCG-15, MCG-17 and MCG-3. A new pair of 16S rRNA gene primers was designed as the published primers could not cover MCG-15 and MCG-17, which are the most dominant subgroups in the SCS sediments. Comparing with previous primers which used for quantifying the abundance of Bathyarchaeota via Q-PCR, the new primer revealed about an order of magnitude higher abundance in all South China Sea sediments. The relationship of geochemical parameters and MCG subgroups will further be explored to provide the basis for further understanding the metabolic function and biogeochemical roles of these poor-understood sedimentary archaea.",

            "abstract": "Pulsating auroras are usually known to be led by the precipitation of energetic electrons from the central plasma sheet, and are thus often displayed in blue-line and/or green-line auroral emission lines. In this study we report the observations of 630nm oxygen red-line auroras by REGO imager, and explore their possible underlying mechanisms. Upon inspecting the temporal/spatial pattern of the red-line pulsating auroras and comparing with concurrent/collocated observations from THEMIS and RAINBOW imagers, we distinguish two types of red-line pulsating auroras. In one type of red-line pulsating aurora, the emission is weak in intensity, but its pulsation is synchronous with that of the collocated green-line pulsating aurora. The other type of red-line pulsating aurora is fairly strong in intensity, but its temporal pattern contains much longer-period components as compared to the green-line pulsating aurora. In both types of pulsating auroras, the spatial dimension and motion speed of the red- and green-line auroral patches are rather comparable. We suggest that the first type of red-line pulsating aurora is caused by secondary electrons and/or a cascading excitation of O(1D) as the byproduct of the primary electron precipitation (and the resulting green-line emission), while the second type of red-line pulsating aurora is directly led by the low-energy part (hundreds of eV) of the electron precipitation in the lower F-region ionosphere. In the latter regard, we present in-situ RBSP observations conjugate to the pulsating auroral patches in a few events, and explore a potential relationship between the red-line pulsating aurora and the electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) wave, which is capable of scattering the low-energy electrons into the loss-cone in the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric brown clouds (ABC) observed as widespread layers of brownish haze are regional scale plumes of air pollutants with a hot spot of emission located in East Asia. ABC are mainly composed of aerosol particles such as Black Carbon (BC) emitted to the atmosphere during biomass burning and fossil fuels combustion. The atmospheric lifetime of BC ranges from a few days in wet season up to one month in dry season. The use of stable lead isotopes and 21 elements as tracers of air pollution was applied to identify and characterized the main sources of anthropogenic activities in Asian region. Aerosol samples from Haiphong (North Vietnam) were collected by a high volume sampler for a period of one year from October 2012 to October 2013. Vietnam’s 207Pb/206Pb ratios were almost identical to those found for China. Ratios of 207Pb/206Pb ranged from 0.837 to 0.871 which agrees with values previously reported for the last 10 years in China (0.841 – 0.879). No significant variation in isotope ratio was observed during the sampling period, which suggests that there was no large seasonal variation in the isotope ratios of airborne lead. Trajectory analysis showed that almost two third of the air masses originated from East Northeast which implies that China was a major source of lead in atmosphere. Enrichment factor calculations indicated a large influence of coal activity (EF(Al) As = 1982 ± 796, EF(Al) Cd = 972 ± 659, EF(Al) Sb = 1358 ± 930) but the difference between combustion and mining exploitation could not be evidenced. Significant correlations were found between two others groups of elements: As, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Al, Fe K, Co. Wind dilution was effective on metals concentration variation. During the cold and dry season (winter) ambient concentrations were high and variable, during the warm and wet season (summer) concentrations were stable and low. Taken together, these factors also identified industrial and lithogenic activities in the region.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen consumption is a common proxy for aerobic respiration and novel in situ measurement techniques with high spatial resolution enable an accurate determination of the oxygen distribution in the streambed. The oxygen concentration at a certain location in the streambed depends on the input concentration, the respiration rate, temperature, and the travel time of the infiltrating flowpath. While oxygen concentrations and temperature can directly be measured, respiration rate and travel time must be estimated from the data. We investigated the interplay of these factors using a 6 month long, 5-min resolution dataset collected in a 3rdorder gravel-bed stream. Our objective was twofold, to determine transient rates of hyporheic respiration and to estimate travel times in the streambed based solely on oxygen and temperature measurements. Our results show that temperature and travel time explains ~70% of the variation in oxygen concentration in the streambed. Independent travel times were obtained using natural variations in the electrical conductivity (EC) of the stream water as tracer (µ=4.1 h; σ=2.3 h). By combining these travel times with the oxygen consumption, we calculated a first order respiration rate (µ=9.7 d-1; σ=6.1 d-1). Variations in the calculated respiration rate are largely explained by variations in streambed temperature. An empirical relationship between our respiration rate and temperature agrees with the theoretical Boltzmann-Arrhenius equation. With this relationship, a temperature-based respiration rate can be estimated and used to re-estimate subsurface travel times. The resulting travel times distinctively resemble the EC-derived travel times (R20.47; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient 0.32). Both calculations of travel time are correlated to stream water levels and increase during discharge events, enhancing the oxygen consumption for these periods. No other physical factors besides temperature were significantly correlated with the respiration rate. The temperature-based respiration rate, in combination with time series of oxygen concentration in the stream and the streambed, can reveal variations of streambed travel times. We applied our method to vertical oxygen profiles to estimate variations of streambed travel times over depth and time.",

            "abstract": "One of the goals of the FP7 SIGMA projects is the extension of remote sensing time series to better monitor agricultural productivity at global scale. Extending these time series can be seen in differnt ways; on the one hand we are looking at the integration of different existing data sets with equal resolution e.g. SPOT-VGT and PROBA-V 1km resolution, or building new time series for Eta and Soil moisture. on the other hand we are also updating methods to extend existing time series with respect to their resolution and revisting frequency. The research presentend here will focus on the latter, focussing on the integration of PROBA-V 100 and 300m.\nThe PROBA-V microsatellite is designed to offer a global coverage of land surfaces at four spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 300 m and 1 km with a daily revisit for latitudes 75\u000e N to 56\u000e S [1]. Due to the specific design, data can also be acquired at 100 m for a reduced swath, providing partial coverage (global coverage only every 5 days). This study proposes a data assimilation method that combines the 100 m data at the reduced swath with PROBA-V 300 m resolution data at the full swath. The resulting product is a synthetic product at 100 m spatial resolution, with a potential revisit time equal to the 300 m products (S10@300). Here, we concentrate on a ten day composite product (K10@100), to mitigate the effect of clouds. The goal of the proposed method is to produce continuous and cloud free time series of PROBA-V data at 100 m spatial resolution. The S10@300 and S10@100 ten day composits serve as input, with respective spatial resolutions of 300 m and 100 m. Whereas the S10@300 is obtained from all sensors onbaord the PROBA-V platform, the S10@100 is the product from the central viewing sensor only. Due to a combination of the reduced swath and potential cloud cover, the S10@100 is typically sparse (gaps). The data assimilation method follows the approach proposed in that is based on a Kalman filter. It is a recursive algorithm that uses a series of measurements and predicts the value of an unknown state, expresented here as a vector of NDVI values. Instead of assimilating data from Landsat and MODIS as in, we used data acquired from the same PROBA-V satellite platform at two different resolutions.\nThe results have been tested with a real application dealing with monitoring agriculture.",

            "abstract": "Changes in observed tropical mean precipitation and Northern\nHemisphere surface temperature show a clear, well-understood response\nto increases in atmospheric aerosols during the second half of the\n20th century. Based on simple theory and climate modelling, a robust\nnegative response to aerosols is also expected in Northern Hemisphere\nmid-latitude (NHML) precipitation, but none is detectable in the\nsurface-based record. In fact, a weak positive response seems to\noccur.\nIn this study, we explore possible reasons for this using\ncorresponding surface runoff observations and a new ensemble of land\nsurface models taken from the TRENDY project that simulate changes in\nrunoff in response to known physical processes when driven by observed\nprecipitation data and changes in land use. We find that observed and\nmodelled changes in runoff anomalies are similar in the second half of\nthe 20th century, but that all-century values differ markedly. Given\nthat observed values are much more consistent with the expected\nresponse to aerosol forcing than modelled values, a possible\nexplanation is that the precipitation observations driving the TRENDY\nmodels is in error. A range of other possible explanations for the\ndiscrepancy are discussed.\nIn common with previous studies, it is recommended that pre-1950 NHML\nprecipitation observations are not used for climate model validation\nwork. An exception is Europe, where we find excellent correspondence\nbetween precipitation and runoff observations and model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Solubility trapping of CO2 in saline aquifers is accepted to be the promising method in terms of carbon capture and storage (CCS). CO2 solubility at geological sequestration conditions is of great significance in evaluating the carbon capture potential of brine formation. Unfortunately, most CO2 solubility studies focus mainly on single-salt solutions, and only sparse literature exist for the data of CO2 solubility in aqueous solutions containing the mixture of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. To fill the research gap, an experimental investigation on the CO2 solubility in the synthetic brine is carried out. The samples were extracted through the injection wells of the Shenhua Carbon Capture and Storage project in the Erdos Basin located in northern China. The proportion of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ was determined by chemical analysis of the samples in the aquifers. The synthetic brine is used in this study, and the experimental process were improved to lower the risk of penetration of the supercritical fluid. Solubility data were measured over the temperature and pressure ranges of 318-348 K and 8-11 MPa. In the range studied, the average absolute deviation of CO2 solubility between literature and experimental results was 2.7%, and the maximum absolute deviation was less than 5.4%. Krichevsky-Kasarnovsky (KK) equation was established to analyze the experimental data and the effect of different ions on CO2 solubility was quantified using an optimization process. The liner fit between the CO2 solubility and mixed ion concentration is satisfied with correlation coefficient of 0.91. The proposed model and experimental data therefore possess broad adaptability to geological carbon storage. This ambiguity in the mechanism of the ion effect drives our efforts toward a better understanding of the factors controlling CO2 solubility in formation brine.",

            "abstract": "Many arc volcanoes are constructed by repeated tapping of complex subvolcanic magmatic plumbing containing new and inherited crystals and liquids that interact in the hours to millennia prior to an eruption. This process is often modulated by long-lived (10-100 k.y.) shallow (<5 km) silicic crystal mush. Constraining the development and growth of mush zones is therefore essential in predicting a volcano’s future behavior. The Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) in California and Mount Hood (MH) in Oregon are two of the most recently active Cascade volcanoes, with last major eruptions in 1915 and ~1780-81 respectively. We performed U-Th/U-Pb dating of LVC and MH zircon from lavas and tephras erupted between 0.1-825 ka. In the LVC, the Rockland Tephra (611 ka; Ar/Ar) contains zircon from 800-520 ka, spanning the age of the Rockland caldera complex (825-611 ka eruption ages). During the Lassen Domefield (315-0.1 ka eruption ages), zircon ages vary from secular equilibrium to 15 ka, overlapping with the Bumpass Sequence (315-190 ka eruption ages) and an eruptive hiatus (190-90 ka eruption ages). Nine of 116 Lassen Domefield zircon are in secular equilibrium (>350 ka). These data support a model of long-lived zircon-saturated silicic mushes existing under the LVC during the Rockland caldera complex stage and since the end of the Brokeoff Volcano stage (590-385 ka eruption ages). Preliminary zircon data from the Old Maid stage (~0.2 ka eruption age) at MH indicate two broad age groups. Younger zircon (<10 ka) suggest reactivation and/or expansion of mush following Polallie phase (20-12 ka eruption ages), Timberline (~1.5 ka eruption age), and Old Maid eruptions. Older zircon (>100 ka) are generally consistent with U-Th ages from plagioclase (~120 ka U-Th), indicating a long-lived zircon-saturated crystal mush tapped by Timberline and Old Maid lavas. At both of these volcanoes, silicic crystal mushes interact with intruding mafic magma, producing monotonous mixed andesite-dacite compositions at MH and dacitic-rhyodacitic mixed and mingled magmas at the LVC. This difference in lava compositions may be controlled by the volume and duration of basaltic intrusions, the duration of the mafic magma's interaction with the crystal mush along with the geometry, volume and conditions (P-T-x) within the crystal mush.",

            "abstract": "The Groningen gas field is a giant natural gas accumulation in the Northeast of the Netherlands. The gas is in a reservoir at a depth of about 3 km. The naturally-fractured gas-filled sandstone extends roughly 45 by 25 km laterally and 140 m vertically. Decades of production have led to significant compaction of the sandstone. The (differential) compaction is thought to have reactivated existing faults and being the main driver of induced seismicity.\nPrecise earthquake location is difficult due to a complicated subsurface, and that is the likely reason, the current hypocentre estimates do not clearly correlate with the well-known fault network. The seismic velocity model down to reservoir depth is quite well known from extensive seismic surveys and borehole data. Most to date earthquake detections, however, were made with a sparse pre-2015 seismic network. For shallow seismicity (<5 km depth) horizontal source-receiver distances tend to be much larger than vertical distances. Consequently, preferred source-receiver travel paths are refractions over high-velocity layers below the reservoir. However, the seismic velocities of layers below the reservoir are poorly known.\nWe estimated an effective velocity model of the main refracting layer below the reservoir and use this for relocating past seismicity. We took advantage of vertical-borehole recordings for estimating precise P-wave (refraction) onset times and used a tomographic approach to find the laterally varying velocity field of the refracting layer. This refracting layer is then added to the known velocity model, and the combined model is used to relocate the past seismicity. From the resulting relocations we assess which of the faults are being reactivated.",

Adequate calculation of gas emission from the northern territories requires calculation of balances of heat, moisture, and gases at the surface of water bodies on the sub-grid scale in the climate models. We carried out measurements in North Karelia on the lake Verkhneye (White Sea Biological Station of Moscow State University). The purpose of the study is evaluation of turbulent transport in the system “lake water– near-surface air – surrounding forest” in the winter season. We used an array of acoustic anemometers mounted at different distances from the lake shore. Measurements were taken at two heights in the center of the lake. It was revealed that the intensity of the turbulent transfer essentially depends on the height and location of sensors, and the wind direction. Stratification in the near-to-surface air probably does not play significant role. Besides, there is no constant-flux layer. The later makes Monin and Obukhov similarity theory (which is used in most of the parameterizations for calculating turbulent flows) inapplicable in this case.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols are of significant environmental importance, due to their effects on air quality, as well as their ability to alter the planet’s radiative balance. Recent studies characterizing the effects of climate change on air quality and the broader distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere show significant, but inconsistent results, including the sign of the effect. Using a suite of state-of-the-art climate models, we show that climate change is associated with a negative aerosol-climate feedback of -0.02 to -0.09 W m^-2 K^-1 for direct radiative effects, with much larger values likely for indirect radiative effects. This is related to an increase in most aerosol species, particularly over the tropics and Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, due to a decrease in wet deposition associated with less large scale precipitation over land. Although simulation of aerosol processes in global climate models possesses uncertainty, we conclude that climate change may increase aerosol burden and surface concentration, which may have implications for future air quality.",

            "abstract": "Details of relative sea level (RSL) since the mid-Holocene in Southeast Asia are poorly determined. We have developed mid-Holocene RSL records at two sites on Belitung Island, Indonesia, on the Sunda Shelf, based on slabbed coral microatolls. At both sites, RSL reached its initial peak at ~6750 yr BP. RSL then fell ~70 cm, remaining at a lowstand for 60–100 years, before rising ~60 cm to a second peak at ~6550 yr BP. Evidence at both sites suggests that this was followed by at least one additional oscillation and one additional RSL peak over the following ~300 yr. On southeastern Belitung, the amplitude of the first RSL peak was more than +1.0 m above 2013 levels, the lowstand was at +0.6 m, and the second RSL peak was at +1.2 m. On northwestern Belitung, the first RSL peak, the lowstand, and the second peak were at +1.9 m, +1.2 m, and +1.7 m, respectively. The similarities in the records from the two sites, which are 80 km apart, argue that none of the oscillations are artifacts of local factors, e.g., ponding of corals. Notwithstanding these similarities, there is a uniform shift in elevations between the two sites: elevations at the NW site are consistently 0.5–0.6 m higher than contemporaneous elevations at the SE site. This difference might be explained by spatial variability in glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), by changes over time in tidal range at one or both sites, and/or by a bias in elevations at the SE site if the modern “reference” corals were ponded. Decimetric fluctuations in RSL have also been suggested based on microatolls from southern China (Yu et al., 2009), but few other studies have the temporal and vertical resolution necessary to assess the geographic extent of such fluctuations. These RSL fluctuations across the South China Sea might be linked to oscillations in the strength of the monsoon.",

            "abstract": "Bradyseismic episodes consist in vertical movements of the ground that are driven by hydrothermal and/or magmatic fluids. The Campi Flegrei Caldera near Naples, Italy, is affected by episodic ground uplifts as fast as 1 m/yr. Such deformations have previously been suggested to be caused by pulses of CO2-rich fluids injected into the hydrothermal system or by the intrusion of magmatic bodies at shallow depths.\nWe show that since 1945 uplift episodes occurring at Campi Flegrei are caused by large regional earthquakes. Namely, passing body waves impose high dynamic strains at the roof of the magmatic reservoir at approximately 7 km depth resulting in the embrittlement of the magmatic carapace. This releases H2O-CO2 mixtures (and eventually magmas) that migrate upwards through a nominally plastic zone. After passing the brittle/ductile transition at approximately 3 km depth, the H2O-CO2 mixture undergoes phase separation and expands, leading to the observed rapid ground uplifts. Our model is quantitatively supported by numerical studies and statistics. The latter indicates a consistent time-lag between the occurrence of regional earthquakes and the onset of the following fluid-driven ground uplift. The corollary is that i) processes activated by dynamic triggering may become apparent long after the passage of the seismic waves and ii) hydrothermal systems are much more sensitive to external perturbations than previously thought. This study represents a valuable observation for volcanic risk mitigation plans and provides a new mechanism to explain rapid fluid flow in volcano-hydrothermal systems. Additionally, our results represent a new interpretation of one of the most studied volcano-hydrothermal system worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Magnetosonic waves (MSWs) are electromagnetic emissions whose properites can be described by the cold plasma extraordinary mode, which are typically generated at frequencies (f) between the proton cyclotron frequency (fcp) and the lower hybrid resonant frequency. It has been suggested that MSWs can contribute to the acceleration of relativistic electrons in the radiation belts. In this study, we investigate the Poynting vector of plasmaspheric MSWs using the spectral matrix data from the EMFISIS instrument onboard the Van Allen Probes spacecraft. We derived the polarization and planarity from the spectrum matrix using the SVD method (Santolik et al., 2003) and also estimated the Poynting vector. The planarity is used as a proxy to distinguish presence of a single wave vector from mixture of waves propagating in different directions. The Poynting vector of MSWs with high planarity shows that the MSWs are observed to propagate radially as well as longitudinally. The occurrence probability of the propagation directions depends on the geomagnetic activities. During the geomagnetically quiet periods　(Kp < 3), the percentage of inward, outward, and longitudinal propagations of MSWs at 60 Hz are 22%, 36% and 42% respectively. On the other hand, during the geomagnetically active periods (Kp > 5), the percentages are 53%, 21%, and 26%, respectively. The result indicates that the MSWs tend to propagate inward during the geomagnetically active periods. Since the fundamental frequency of the ion Bernstein mode would be local cyclotron frequency, we also investigate the source of MSWs from the minimum frequency of MSWs. It is found that a large number of MSWs tend to be generated at L=3.0-3.5 inside the plasmapause. We will also discuss the validity of the Poynting flux computation as a function of f/fcp.",

            "abstract": "The Andes, one of the most significant reliefs on Earth, is the case example of a subduction-type mountain belt. In central Chile and western Argentina, the particular east-vergent structure of the Aconcagua fold-and-thrust belt (AFTB) is found atop a huge basement high with elevations > 4000 m, the Frontal Cordillera.\nClassical conceptual models consider the Andes as an east-vergent orogen, opposite to the Nazca subduction, and describe the exhumation of the Frontal Cordillera as an eastward in-sequence event that occurred late in the andean deformation (by ~10My). An alternative model recently challenged this view by proposing that the Andes have mainly a primary westward vergence. Within this scheme, the exhumation of the Frontal Cordillera would have begun earlier, by ~25My, synchronous with formation of the AFTB on the western side of the basement high. Here we test these two models by revisiting structural cross-sections of the Andes at the latitude of Santiago de Chile and of the Aconcagua (~33°S). We provide thermochronological constraints on the timing of exhumation of the Frontal Cordillera by (U-Th)/He dating on apatites retrieved from paleozoic granitoids along a 2,3km high nearly vertical section in the core of the basement high. Preliminary results suggest that the Frontal Cordillera exhumation was not a late event and likely began around 25 Ma. Therefore it appears to be synchronous with deformation within the AFTB and the westernmost fold-and-thrust belt at this latitude. We discuss these results and their implications while building a crustal-scale cross section of the range at the latitude of Santiago de Chile.",

            "abstract": "Surface runoff contributes significantly to soil erosion by water which is a serious worldwide problem causing decline in water resources quality, agricultural and forest land productivity, alongside environmental and ecological degradations. A field experiment was carried out on two hillslope (2-7 %) positions (downslope (2.3%), upslope (5.8%)) and two land use types; maize-beans intercrop (MB); fallow shrub-grassland (SG) in Koupendri catchment in north-western part of Benin, West Africa using microplots. The objective was to evaluate the influence of slope positions and land use on surface runoff and their variability, and the ability of Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) approach to simulate the measured runoff on both slope positions and land use types in Koupendri catchment. Six microplots (1m x 1m) were installed at 0.5m spacing, and on the same soil type in each slope positions and land use giving a total of 24 microplots. Surface runoff was measured after each rain event from September – October, 2014 and major runoff producing rain events were selected for analysis. The data obtained was subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) in RCBD. The results showed a very low variability (CV= 9%) for measured surface runoff on both slope positions and land use respectively. The surface runoff measured was significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by the land use with a total surface runoff of 340.1 mm in MB as against 250.3 mm in SG. However, the higher surface runoff depth obtained at the downslope (299.9 mm) compared to the upslope (290.5 mm) was due to shallow soil depth and saturation of the soil downslope but not slope position. Thus, land use must be given greater priority in future surface runoff and soil erosion related studies in the catchment or region. A good simulation (R2= 0.92 – 0.97) of the measured runoff depth was obtained using the SCS-CN approach on both slopes and land use types. A better simulation was obtained under the cultivated plot (R2= 0.96 -0.97). From the preliminary results of this study, we suggest a minimum of six erosion plots per location for future studies, and the development and application of SCS-CN approach for runoff simulation in the catchment or region.\nKeywords: Surface runoff, ecological degradation, land productivity, water resources, hillslope, SCS-CN.",

            "abstract": "Using a dynamical-system approach we have investigated the efficiency of large-amplitude whistler waves for causing microburst precipitation in planetary radiation belts by modeling the microburst energy and particle fluxes produced as a result of non-linear wave-particle interactions. We show that wave parameters consistent with large-amplitude oblique whistlers commonly generate microbursts of electrons with hundreds of keV-energies, as a result of Landau trapping. Relativistic microbursts (> 1 MeV) can also be generated by a similar mechanism, but require waves with large propagation angles θkB > 50o and phase-speeds vΦ > c/9. Using our result for precipitating density and energy fluxes, we argue that holes in the distribution function of electrons near the magnetic mirror point can result in the generation of electrostatic structures consistent in scales (of the order the Debye length) and electric field amplitudes (of the order of 1 mV/m) to nonlinear structures observed in the radiation belts by the Van Allen Probes. Our results indicate a relationship between nonlinear electrostatic and electromagnetic structures in the dynamics of planetary radiation belts and their role in the cyclical production of energetic electrons (i.e. E > 100 keV) on kinetic timescales, that is much faster than previously inferred.",

            "abstract": "Buried-explosion experiments were used to investigate the spatial and volumetric distribution of extra-crater ejecta resulting from a range of explosion configurations with and without a crater present. Explosion configuration is defined in terms of scaled depth, the relationship between depth of burial and the cube root of explosion energy, where an optimal scaled depth explosion produces the largest crater diameter for a given energy. The multiple explosion experiments provide an analog for the formation of maar-diatreme ejecta deposits and the deposits of discrete explosions through existing conduits and hydrothermal systems. Experiments produced meter-sized craters with ejecta distributed between three major facies based on morphology and distance from the crater center. The proximal deposits form a constructional steep-sided ring that extends no more than two-times the crater radius away from center. The medial deposits form a low-angle continuous blanket that transitions with distance into the isolated clasts of the distal ejecta. Single explosion experiments produce a trend of increasing volume proportion of proximal ejecta as scaled depth increases (from 20-90% vol.). Multiple explosion experiments are dominated by proximal deposits (>90% vol.) for all but optimal scaled depth conditions (40-70% vol.). In addition to scaled depth, the presence of a crater influences jet shape and how the jet collapses, resulting in two end-member depositional mechanisms that produce distinctive facies. The experiments use one well-constrained explosion mechanism and, consequently, the variations in depositional facies and distribution are the result of conditions independent of that mechanism. Previous interpretations have invoked variations in fragmentation as the cause of this variability, but these experiments should help with a more complete reconstruction of the configuration and number of explosions that produce a tephra ring.",

In spite of recent advances in the understanding of the initial stages of their formation, there is still no physical explanation of the experimental results, and thus no theory predicting both their occurrence and the scaling of the mature bedforms. We address this problem using a well-established aeolian morphodynamic model that was extended to include (i) bedload transport, (ii) Hanratty’s model for dynamically smooth flows and (iii) the hydrodynamic effects of the free surface in dynamically rough flows. Simulations under unidirectional and uniform flow show that steady state ripples form in dynamically smooth conditions and dunes in dynamically transitional ones. Both ripples and dunes result from the nonlinear evolution of an initial flat bed and are clearly distinct from the small-scale bedforms arising during the initial linear stage. In agreement with experimental data, simulated ripples are very regular, scale with the hydrodynamical roughness length and their growth is limited by the internal structure of the flow. In contrast, steady state dunes exhibit a broader range of sizes, their growth is limited by the free surface and thus their maximum size scales with the flow depth.",

            "abstract": "Space-based lidar missions targeting greenhouse gases are expected to close observational gaps, e.g., over subarctic permafrost and tropical wetlands, where in-situ and passive remote sensing techniques have difficulties. Consequently, a “Methane Remote Lidar Mission” (MERLIN) was proposed by the German and French space agencies DLR and CNES. MERLIN is now in Phase B, in which all mission components are planned in detail; launch is foreseen in 2020. An integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar will measure weighted columns of atmospheric methane (XCH4) along the satellite track. Primary objective is to provide accurate global observations of methane concentration gradients for inverse numerical models in order to better quantify regional fluxes. DLR has developed an airborne demonstrator, CHARM-F, for technology demonstration and validation purposes. First successful flights on-board the German HALO research aircraft have been performed in May 2015 over Central Europe. The measurements are expected to help solve general retrieval issues for future space-borne IPDA lidars. For example, the CHARM-F flights over ocean and lakes help assess the strength and variability of backscatter from water surfaces. The IPDA weighting function, or measurement sensitivity, is dependent on atmospheric pressure and temperature, in particular close to the surface. We use ECMWF analyses interpolated in space and time to the aircraft track that provide these auxiliary data at 14 km horizontal resolution. Due to the coarse representation of orography the model’s pressure and temperature profiles have to be extrapolated down to the true lidar’s scattering surface elevation, which generates uncertainties that we assess. We also assess biases by spectroscopic uncertainties in the methane absorption lines’ parameters. Overall, the airborne results will support the development of advanced processing algorithms for future space lidar missions such as MERLIN.",

The IPCC 5AR concluded that extensive areas of the world will increase substantially their probability to fire in the near future. This issue is of difficult evaluation given the multiplicity drivers of fire, including anthropogenic factors, and because fire was impossible to observe and analyse as a global phenomenon until well into the satellite era. The study of the Pliocene may however afford some glimpses to this issue as one of the best ancient-climate analogues of present-day and future greenhouse-warming conditions.\nThe incidence of fire in the Pliocene has not been assessed in much detail. In fact, fossil evidence for fire activity over the last 50+ Ma from the Eocene through to the present day is scant, and is chiefly based on the presence of charred materials, or charcoal, which provides a partial perspective of fire occurrence, and the development of pyrophytic biomes such as savannahs and shrublands. Marine charcoal records, from widely separated geographic regions (North Pacific, Eastern south Atlantic, South China Sea), indicate low but significant fire activity throughout the Cenozoic until the late Miocene or Pliocene, when it increased, sometimes together with the rise of pyrophytic biomes.\nAn alternative to the study of charcoal records is the analysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are also generated in biomass combustion processes but are associated to soot and integrate the occurrence of fire over large regional provinces. One of the most abundant is retene, formed from the thermal degradation of resins. We have quantified PAHs in Site ODP 1125 which spans the Pliocene-Pleistocene, on the north slope of Chatham Rise, 600 km east of New Zealand's South Island. PAHs have been identified throughout the record, and namely during colder climatic episodes. Their abundance appears tightly linked to that of other terrigenous biomarkers like the n-alkanes, which are likely to result from changes in fluvial and aeolian inputs. Overall, they appear to increase from the Pliocene to present indicating a shift in fire regimes, although the role of transport processes in modulating fluxes of terrigenous biomarkers need to be investigated further.",

            "abstract": "The use of sinusoidal or periodic testing for field-scale tomography of aquifer parameters (conductivity / storativity) is a novel, minimally-invasive method for aquifer characterization between boreholes. Previous results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, which we name Oscillatory Hydraulic Tomography (OHT), through both numerical and laboratory experiments. However, implementation and analysis of field-scale OHT testing has not been achieved to-date, and thus the technique remains unproven for application in real-world aquifers. We present an evaluation of OHT at the field scale here through application at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), a field-scale (~20m diameter x 20m thickness) research site. Through Bayesian inversion, we assess issues such as data quality impacts and resolution of obtained tomographic images. We discuss issues associated with both data collection and data processing, and based on our experiences suggest a workflow for OHT performance at other field sites. The advantages of OHT, relative to “traditional” hydraulic tomography with constant rate pumping tests, include the ability to test across a range of stimulation frequencies (obtaining increased heterogeneity information), very high signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, we examine the impact of nonlinear effects – such as water table boundary conditions – and their impact on OHT analysis algorithms.",

            "abstract": "A decreasing density gradient in Saturn’s plasma disk allows for centrifugal interchange instability between the dense, heavy plasma inside 10 Rs and the lighter plasma outside. This instability results in the less dense plasma of the mid-magnetosphere moving inward to the inner-magnetosphere. As flux tubes move inward, their volume decreases, and the contained plasma heats adiabatically. Most studies of interchange have focused on older events that have had time to gradient and curvature drift such that they are easily identified by a characteristic “V” energy dispersion signature in the ion and electron data [e.g. Hill et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2010]. Recently, Kennelly et al. (2013) used radio wave data to identify >300 possible “fresh” injection events. These are characterized in the plasma data by a bite-out at low energies, an enhancement at high energies, and little to no energy dispersion. Our study builds on the Kennelly et al. study to investigate the shape and frequency of injection events in order to better characterize how hot plasma transports into the inner magnetosphere. In most models of centrifugal interchange at Saturn, the time and spatial scales for inward and outward transport are fairly symmetric, but Cassini data suggests that inward injections of plasma move at much greater velocity and in narrower flow channels than their outgoing counterparts. Here we investigate the morphology of Kronian inward injection events to see if our dataset of young injections can inform on whether the inward injections are extended fingers or more like “bubbles”, isolated flux tubes. Specifically, we apply minimum variance analysis to Cassini magnetic field data to determine the boundary normals at the spacecraft’s entrance and exit points for each event, from which we can statistically analyze the structure’s cross section. We will present our initial results on the morphology as well as the distribution of the injections over radial distance, latitude, and local time.",

            "abstract": "The task of delineating the contamination plumes as well as studying their impact on the soil and groundwater biogeochemical properties is needed to support the remediation efforts and plans. Geophysical methods including electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), induced polarization (IP), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and self-potential (SP) have been previously used to characterize contaminant plumes and investigate their impact on soil and groundwater properties (Atekwana et al., 2002, 2004; Benson et al., 1997; Campbell et al., 1996; Cassidy et al., 2001; Revil et al., 2003; Werkema et al., 2000). Our objective was to: estimate the hydrocarbon contamination extent in a contaminated site in northern France, and to adverse the effects of the oil spill on the groundwater properties. We aim to find a good combination of non-intrusive and low cost methods which we can use to follow the bio-remediation process, which is planned to proceed next year. We used four geophysical methods including electrical resistivity tomography, IP, GPR, and SP. The geophysical data was compared to geochemical ones obtained from 30 boreholes installed in the site during the geophysical surveys. Our results have shown: low electrical resistivity values; high chargeability values; negative SP anomalies; and attenuated GPR reflections coincident with groundwater contamination. Laboratory and field geochemical measurements have demonstrated increased groundwater electrical conductivity and increased microbial activity associated with hydrocarbon contamination of groundwater. Our study results support the conductive model suggested by studies such as Sauck (2000) and Atekwana et al., (2004), who suggest that biological alterations of hydrocarbon contamination can substantially modify the chemical and physical properties of the subsurface, producing a dramatic shift in the geo-electrical signature from resistive to conductive. The next stage of the research will include time lapse borehole and 3D geophysical measurements coupled to biological and chemical surface phase experiments in order to monitor the bioremediation processes.",

            "abstract": "Large precipitation events are a likely outcome of climate change as stated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report. The goal of our study was to develop a large precipitation database for Northern Vermont. In a collaborative examination of northern tier weather data that included the stations in Burlington (1864-2014), Johnson (2000-2014), Morrisville (1962-2014), and St. Johnsbury (1894-2014), we analyzed data trends and correlations within the context of larger scale climate change. Large precipitation events, per calendar day, were classified by a baseline of 0.8 inches of precipitation or greater. The number of events per month, year, decade, and the entire dataset were recorded, averaged, and normalized. Positive correlations between global temperature anomalies and the number of events at St. Johnsbury for the years 1894-2014 (0.34), 1900-1949 (0.25), 1950-2014 (0.39) 1984-2014 (0.48) were calculated. Decadal frequencies of event numbering ≥ 1 more than average (1894-2014) reveal twofold increases from 1900-1909 to 2000-2009, indicating a positive trend. Large precipitation events at St. Johnsbury were compared to mean concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). A correlation of 0.51 between CO2 concentrations and event number from 2000-2010 indicated a close relationship between anthropogenic warming and large precipitation events. Our results suggest that a more in depth analysis of the other Vermont stations is needed to corroborate these findings and confirm trends.",

            "abstract": "The ability to project and to mitigate the impacts of climate change is closely related to the evaluation of soil organic carbon (SOC) content and stock across different types of land use and soil groups. Therefore, this study aimed at estimating the surface and subsoil organic carbon stocks in different land use systems and across various soil groups. A further aim was to assess the spatial variability of SOC content and stocks and how this is controlled by climate and site properties. The Random Forest (RF) modelling was used and compared to Ordinary Kriging interpolation (OK) for the topsoil SOC and stock. About 70 soil profiles were described along 16 transects with 197 samples collected from different horizons up to 1 m depth where possible. In addition, 1205 samples were collected within an intensive auger grid mapping. Mid-infrared spectroscopy and partial least-squares analysis were used as a fast and low-cost technique to handle the large amount of samples for the SOC estimation. The natural/semi natural vegetation recorded the highest SOC stock in the topsoil (28.6 t C ha-1) as compared to the cropland (25.5 t C ha-1). Over 1 m depth, Gleysols (87.4 t C ha-1) stored the highest amount of SOC stock followed by the Cambisols (76. t C ha-1) and the Plinthosols (73.1 t C ha-1) while the lowest were found in the Lixisols (57.8 t C ha-1). For the topsoil, the RF model revealed soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and stone content as main factors affecting SOC content variability while CEC and bulk density were the major drivers for the subsoil. The carbon stock variability was mainly affected by the CEC and the reference soil group in the topsoil while horizon thickness and bulk density constituted the main factors for the subsoil. The geostatistical evaluation proved that the SOC content in the Dano catchment has a moderate spatial autocorrelation while the carbon stock was strongly spatially dependent. The RF gave a better prediction for the topsoil SOC content with the lowest root mean square error of 4.98 g kg-1 while the OK performed better for the topsoil carbon stock with a root mean square error of 14.98 t C ha-1. About 52 % of the carbon stock over 1 m depth was held in the upper 30 cm and is proned to release upon natural vegetation clearance and non-sustainable farming practices.",

            "abstract": "A perusal of the literature on bedload transport revealed that, notwithstanding the large number of studies on bedform morphology performed in the past decades, the upper plane bed regime has not been thoroughly investigated and the distinction between the upper plane bed and sheet flow transport regimes is still poorly defined. Previous experimental work demonstrated that the upper plane bed regime is characterized by long wavelength and small amplitude bedforms that migrate downstream. These bedforms, however, were not observed in experiments on sheet flow transport suggesting that the upper plane bed and the sheet flow are two different regimes. We thus designed and performed experiments in a sediment feed flume in the hydraulic laboratory of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of South Carolina at Columbia to study the transition from upper plane bed to sheet flow regime. Periodic measurements of water surface and bed elevation, bedform geometry and thicknesses of the bedload layer were performed by eyes, and with cameras, movies and a system of six ultrasonic probes that record the variations of bed elevation at a point over time. We used the time series of bed elevations to determine the probability functions of bed elevation. These probability functions are implemented in a continuous model of river morphodynamics, i.e. a model that does not use the active layer approximation to describe the sediment fluxes between the bedload and the deposit and that should thus be able to capture the details of the vertical and streamwise variation of the deposit grain size distribution. This model is validated against the experimental results for the case of uniform material. We then use the validated model in the attempt to study if and how the spatial distribution of grain sizes in the deposit changes from upper plane bed regime to sheet flow and if these results are influenced by the imposed rates of base level rise.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key link between the availability of water resources and climate change and climate variability. Variability of ET has important environmental and socioeconomic implications for managing hydrological hazards, food and energy production. Although there have been many observational and modeling studies of ET, how ET has varied and the drivers of the variations at different temporal scales remain elusive. Much of the uncertainty comes from the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), which is the combined effect of radiative and aerodynamic controls. The inconsistencies among modeled AED estimates and the limited observational data may originate from multiple sources including the limited time span and uncertainties in the data. To fully investigate and untangle the intertwined drivers of AED, we present a spectrum analysis to identify key controls of AED across multiple temporal scales. We use long-term records of observed pan evaporation for 1961-2006 from 317 weather stations across China and physically-based model estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PET). The model estimates are based on surface meteorology and radiation derived from reanalysis, satellite retrievals and station data. Our analyses show that temperature plays a dominant role in regulating variability of AED at the inter-annual scale. At the monthly and seasonal scales, the primary control of AED shifts from radiation in humid regions to humidity in dry regions. Unlike many studies focusing on the spatial pattern of ET drivers based on a traditional supply and demand framework, this study underlines the importance of temporal scales when discussing controls of ET variations.",

            "abstract": "Accurate representation of water fluxes and states is crucial for hydrological assessments of societally relevant events such as floods and droughts. Hydrologic and/or land surface models are now commonly used for this purpose. The seamless prediction of continental scale water fluxes from these models requires among other things (i) a robust parameterization technique that allows the model to operate across a range of spatial resolutions and (ii) an efficient parameter estimation technique to derive a representative set of spatially consistent hydrologic parameters to avoid discontinuities of simulated hydrologic fields. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of a mesoscale hydrologic modeling framework that incorporates a novel multiscale parameter regionalization technique (mHM-MPR) to derive the long-term gridded estimates of water fluxes and states over the Pan-EU domain. The MPR technique allows establishing linkages between hydrologic parameter fields and basin geophysical attributes (e.g., terrain, soil, vegetation properties) through a set of transfer functions and quasi-scale invariant global parameters. We devise a multi-basin parameter estimation strategy that utilizes observed streamflows from a reduced set of hydrologically diverse basins to infer a representative set of global parameters. The selection of diverse basins is guided through a stepwise clustering algorithm based on the basins geophysical and hydro-climatic attributes. Results of this strategy are contrasted against the single-basin calibration strategy across 400 European basins varying from approximately 100 km2 to 500000 km2. The single-basin parameter estimates although produced the site-specific best results, but their transferability to other basins resulted in poor performance. Initial results indicate that the multi-basin calibration strategy is at least as good as the best single-basin cross-validated results. Furthermore, the gridded fields of hydrologic parameters and the corresponding water fluxes and states generated based on global parameters from the multi-basin optimization technique is physically more plausible and exhibit spatial continuity rather than a patchy distribution generated by the single-basin optimization technique.",

            "abstract": "Identifying blocks formed by fractures is important in rock engineering. Most studies assume the fractures to be perfect planar whereas curved fractures are rarely considered. However, large fractures observed in the field are often curved. This paper presents a new method for identifying rock blocks formed by both curved and planar fractures based on the element-block-assembling approach. The curved and planar fractures are represented as triangle meshes and planar discs, respectively. In the beginning of the identification method, the intersection segments between different triangle meshes are calculated and the intersected triangles are re-meshed to construct a piecewise linear complex (PLC). Then, the modeling domain is divided into tetrahedral subdomains under the constraint of the PLC and these subdomains are further decomposed into element blocks by extended planar fractures. Finally, the element blocks are combined and the subdomains are assembled to form complex blocks. The combination of two subdomains is skipped if and only if the common facet lies on a curved fracture. In this study, the exact arithmetic is used to handle the computational errors, which may threat the robustness of the block identification program when the degenerated cases are encountered. Specifically, a real number is represented as the ratio between two integers and the basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between different real numbers can be performed exactly if an arbitrary precision integer package is used. In this way, the exact construction of blocks can be achieved without introducing computational errors. Several analytical examples are given in this paper and the results show effectiveness of this method in handling arbitrary shaped blocks. Moreover, there is no limitation on the number of blocks in a block system. The results also show (suggest) that the degenerated cases can be handled without affecting the robustness of the identification program.",

            "abstract": "The marine atmospheric environment is a receptor for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) which are advected from sources on land, primary, such as biomass burning by-products (PAHs, dioxins), and secondary, such as volatilization from contaminated soils (PCBs, pesticides). Primary sources do not exist in the marine environment, except for PAHs (ship engines) but following previous atmospheric deposition, the sea surface may turn to a secondary source by reversal of diffusive air-sea mass exchange. No monitoring is in place.\nWe studied the vertical fluxes of a wide range of primary and secondary emitted POPs based on measurements in air and surface seawater at a remote coastal site in the eastern Mediterranean (2012). To this end, silicon rubbers were used as passive water samplers, vertical concentration gradients were determined in air and fluxes were quantified based on Eddy covariance.\nDiffusive air–sea exchange fluxes of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and semivolatile PAHs were found close to phase equilibrium, except one PAH, retene, a wood burning tracer, was found seasonally net-volatilisational. Some PCBs, p,p’-DDE, penta- and hexachlorobenzene (PeCB, HCB) were mostly net-depositional, while PBDEs were net-volatilizational. Fluxes determined at a a remote coastal site ranged -33 – +2.4 µg m-2 d-1 for PAHs and -4.0 – +0.3 µg m-2 d-1for halogenated compounds (< 0 means net-deposition, > 0 means net-volatilization).\nIt is concluded that nowadays in open seas more pollutants are undergoing reversal of the direction of air-sea exchange. Recgional fire activity records in combination with box model simulations suggest that deposition of retene during summer is followed by a reversal of air–sea exchange. The seawater surface as secondary source of pollution should be assessed based on flux measurements across seasons and over longer time periods.",

            "abstract": "Bedload transport rates in mountain streams may exhibit wide fluctuations even under constant flow conditions. A better understanding of bedload pulses is key to predict natural hazards induced by torrential activity and sediment issues in mountainous areas. Several processes such as bedforms migration, grain sorting and random particles’ trajectories are evoked as the driving agents of pulse formation and development. Quantifying the effects of these processes is a difficult task. This work aims to investigate the interactions between bedload transport and bedform dynamics in steep gravel-bed rivers. Experiments are carried out in a 17-m long 60-cm wide flume inclined at an angle of 2.7%. The bed is initially flat and made of homogenous natural gravel with a mean diameter of 6 mm. We imposed 200 identical hydrographs (of 1 hr duration) at the flume inlet (the bed surface was not flattened out during these cycling floods). The input hydrograph and the input sediment discharge are nearly triangular. Bed topography is measured after each flood using ultrasound sensors while the bedload transport rate is steadily monitored at the outlet using accelerometers (accelerometers fixed on metallic plates record the impacts of the grains flowing out of the flume). For the sake of comparison, a similar experiment consisting of 19 floods of 10 hours is carried out under constant supply conditions. We show that accelerometers are a cost effective technique to obtain high-frequency bedload discharge data. Spectral analysis of the bedload timeseries is used to highlight the different time scales corresponding to different bedload transport processes. We show that long timeseries are necessary to capture the different processes that drive bedload transport, including the resilience time after a perturbation of the bed. The alternate bars that develop and migrate along the flume are found to significantly influence bedload transport rate fluctuations.",

The pluton intrudes Pennsylvanian and Precambrian wall rocks and has a surface exposure of ~8 km (E-W) by ~25 km (N-S). 40Ar/39Ar analysis on Whitehorn samples from two locations (2920 m and 2890 m) yield dates of 68.2 Ma and 69.1 Ma (hbl), 68.4 Ma and 68.9 Ma (bt), and 67.1 Ma and 74.2 Ma (kfs), respectively. AHe dates from 4 samples collected in Proterozoic wall rocks northwest of the Whitehorn pluton along a 625 m vertical transect, range from 56.9 Ma to 63.4 Ma, and 3 samples in a 345 m vertical transect east of the pluton range from 67.3Ma to 135.3Ma. Previous thermochronometric, paleomagnetic, and petrologic studies indicate Whitehorn pluton was emplaced at paleodepths of 8-10 km with ambient host rock temperatures of ~200°C, and insignificant tilting since then. We infer that, the biotite and hornblende Ar40/Ar39 dates record timing of pluton emplacement, and K-feldspar MDD modeling records post-emplacement cooling to ambient temperatures by 66 Ma. AHe dates record lower temperature (<60°C) cooling of the wall rocks and must reflect post-emplacement exhumation of the pluton and host rocks. The SW Front Range thus appears to have experienced rapid, large magnitude (~6-8 km) exhumation and differential uplift at ca. 60 Ma with respect to the SE Front Range. Presently, the southern Front Range is overlain by horizontal Oligocene volcanic rocks, deposited on a widespread regional erosion surface across the central CO Rockies. The preservation of Paleocene AHe dates below this regional surface suggests that it formed shortly after exhumation, and experienced < 2 km of reburial, or exhumation, from ~55 Ma until deposition of the Wall Mountain tuff at ca. 34 Ma. The Arkansas River cuts through both volcanic rocks (as young as middle Miocene) and Proterozoic basement, generating up to 1.5 km of local topographic relief. Paleocene AHe dates at the valley bottom indicate volcanic rock thicknesses were insufficient to bury and reset AHe ages, and thus that minimal regional erosion and exhumation occurred following volcanism in the southern Front Range.",

Blind inlets are proven conservation practices for reducing surface runoff, and consequently reducing nutrient loadings from small agricultural closed depressions to water bodies. Gravel is the most widely used blind inlet media to reduce flow, but not to sorb contaminants from the water. Readily available byproducts, such as steel slag and shredded tires, could be used as alternative media in blind inlets to sorb nutrients and pesticides from surface runoff. Sorption isotherms were performed to investigate the sorption capabilities of steel slag and shredded tires for phosphate and atrazine in electrolyte background solutions containing either 10 mM CaCl2 or KCl. Results of this research demonstrated that phosphate and atrazine were irreversibly sorbed by the steel slag and shredded tires. The steel slag increased the pH solution increased about 4 pH units after the sorption step; while the pH of the solution with shredded tires remained the same. Desorption of the phosphate and atrazine was low from the steel slag and shredded tires, respectively. Thus, the above results suggest that the steel slag and shredded tires can potentially be used as media to sorb phosphate and atrazine, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Accurate characterization and volume determination of iceberg sails is important for calculating wind drag effects on iceberg drift and estimating total iceberg mass, respectively. This information is of direct relevance to the shipping and offshore hydrocarbon industries operating on Canada’s east coast. A field campaign was completed in April 2015 offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada to assess the precision of point clouds generated from successive helicopter-borne aerial surveys of two drifting iceberg sails. A minimum of three GPS tracking beacons or survey-grade GPS units were deployed per iceberg and were paired with ground control points (GCPs). Two to eight flight lines were conducted per survey of the large (0.12 km2) and small (0.02 km2) icebergs, with altitudes varying from 750 to 1000 m. The nadir images were captured via a wireless connection to the DSLR camera which was contained within a ‘pod’ externally mounted on an MBB Bo105 helicopter. Drift was primarily translational over the survey periods, with average drift speeds of 0.59 and 0.95 km hr-1 and total drift magnitudes of 194 and 272 m for the large and small icebergs, respectively. Iceberg volumes varied by 15 to 17% between surveys as initially calculated in AgiSoft Photoscan after manual point cloud cleaning. Additional results of a cloud-to-cloud differencing algorithm, after drift correction with the georeferenced GCPs, suggest that repeat photogrammetric surveying is an effective method for identifying local iceberg deterioration on the order of > 0.8 m. This method of iceberg aerial survey was determined to be effective but challenges included helicopter use in a remote offshore location, GCP deployment on a moving and possibly unstable target and difficulty in acquiring adequate coverage of vertical sidewalls with a nadir camera angle.",

            "abstract": "The subduction of carbon to the deep mantle via subduction zones is interrupted by outputs via the fore-arc, volcanic front, and back-arc regions. Whereas output fluxes for arc and back-arc locales are well constrained for the Central America Volcanic Arc (CAVA) [1-2], the fore-arc flux via cold seeps and ground waters is poorly known. We present new He and CO2 data (isotopes and relative abundances) for the volcanic front and inner fore-arc of western Panama to complement on-going studies of fore-arc C-fluxes in Costa Rica [3-4] and to determine tectonic controls on the fore-arc C-outgassing fluxes.\nHelium isotope (3He/4He) values at Baru, La Yeguada, and El Valle volcanoes are high (5-8RA), consistent with results for other Central America volcanoes. However, CO2/3He values are variable (from > 1012 to < 108). Baru has an arc-like δ13C of - 4‰, whereas the other volcanoes have δ13C < -10 ‰. Cold seeps collected in the coastal fore-arc of Panama show a trend of decreasing He-isotopes from west (~6RA) to east (~1RA). This trend is mirrored by δ13C (-5‰ to <-20‰) values. CO2/3He values of the seeps are also variable and fall between 106 and 1012.\nUsing CO2/3He-δ13C mixing plots with conventional endmember values for Limestone, Organic Sediment and Mantle CO2, we show that several Panama samples have been extensively modified by crustal processes. Nevertheless, there are clear west-to east trends (both volcanoes and coastal seeps), whereby L dominates the CO2 inventory in the west, similar to Costa Rica, and S-derived CO2 increases eastward towards central Panama. Previously [4], we limited the Costa Rica subaerial fore-arc flux to ~ 6 × 107 gCkm-1yr-1, or ~ 4% of the total incoming sedimentary C-load. This flux diminishes to zero within ~400 km to the east of Baru volcano. The transition from orthogonal subduction of the Cocos Plate to oblique subduction of the Nazca Plate, relative to the common over-riding Caribbean Plate, is the major impediment to slab degassing towards the southern terminus of the CAVA.

            "abstract": "Spaceborne scatterometer observations, especially at Ku-band, are affected by rain and these effects need to be corrected to avoid errors in wind retrievals. Although several semi-empirical techniques have been already developed to correct the wind retrievals, a physical forward model of the backscattering coefficient accounting for both wind and rain may lead to a more accurate approach in estimating winds. Three main steps are needed to construct this model, such as: modeling the effects due to the raindrops impinging over the ocean surface; modeling the attenuation on the signal going through the precipitating event; modeling the volume backscattering introduced by rain. We propose a theoretical model of the ocean surface backscattering coefficient accounting for the surface modifications due to the raindrops’ impact. Modeling both the attenuation and volume backscattering will be the objective of future works. The ocean surface scattering model is based on a modified version of the surface wind waves spectrum developed by Donelan and Pierson (1997) which is suitable to include the splash effects. Main results suggest that this model is able to simulate the co-polar surface backscattering coefficient in both rainy and non-rainy conditions especially at V polarization. However, main discrepancies are found at H polarization where comparisons between the rain-free model and the QuikSCAT Ku-band scatterometer geophysical model function show disagreements especially at medium and high winds. To address this problem we are investigating the model of ocean surface response by analyzing its behavior for different wind wave spectra as well as by comparing it to different geophysical model functions. Moreover, analysis of wind variability will be carried out in order to perform a sensitivity study to the wind changes. Such approach is intended to develop a more realistic model to accurately simulate the ocean surface response considering both polarizations.",

            "abstract": "Currently most drought studies focus on time series analysis of area-averaged quantities, or spatial analysis of droughts of a given duration. However, maps of precipitation and soil moisture anomalies from model simulations show that droughts organize into clusters that evolve in time and can expand and contract, merge with other clusters to form larger ones, and move in space, sometimes traversing continents. Previous studies have suggested that the drought signal propagates downwind through a combination of land-atmospheric feedbacks, such as precipitation recycling, and moisture advection. Thus, to fully capture the development and recovery of droughts we need a simultaneous understanding of their temporal and spatial evolution.\nIn this work, drought clusters are identified globally in soil moisture data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) at a monthly time scale from 1979-2009, and their evolution is tracked through time and space. The cluster tracks are used to find “hotspots” throughout the world where higher densities of clusters pass through and to identify regions where clusters tend to move in the same direction (i.e. displacement patterns). Both of these were found to vary seasonally, with hotspots generally matching the world’s semi-arid regions. The distributions of the clusters’ properties, including their duration, severity, areal extent, and distance traveled by the centroids are also computed and compared across sub-regions. Furthermore, in order to understand the physical mechanisms behind the spatial displacement of these drought clusters, a few case studies in North America are considered. The propagation of drought is tracked in space and time through the hydrologic cycle starting in the atmosphere as moisture convergence anomalies, affecting precipitation, followed by soil moisture, and then evapotranspiration, using measures of moisture recycling. Lag correlations between these components are calculated along the clusters’ tracks, showing the degree to which information over a region under drought can help predict its subsequent growth or displacement into another region.",

            "abstract": "The North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) was initiated in 2011 to provide support for developing climate forecasting tools, calibrating land surface models and validating satellite-derived soil moisture algorithms. The NASMD has collected data from over 30 soil moisture observation networks providing millions of in situ soil moisture observations in all 50 states as well as Canada and Mexico. It is recognized that the quality of measured soil moisture in NASMD is highly variable due to the diversity of climatological conditions, land cover, soil texture, and topographies of the stations and differences in measurement devices (e.g., sensors) and installation. It is also recognized that error, inaccuracy and imprecision in the data set can have significant impacts on practical operations and scientific studies. Therefore, developing an appropriate quality control procedure is essential to ensure the data is of the best quality. In this study, an automated quality control approach is developed using the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) Noah soil porosity, soil temperature, and fraction of liquid and total soil moisture to flag erroneous and/or spurious measurements. Overall results show that this approach is able to flag unreasonable values when the soil is partially frozen. A validation example using NLDAS-2 multiple model soil moisture products at the 20 cm soil layer showed that the quality control procedure had a significant positive impact in Alabama, North Carolina, and West Texas. It had a greater impact in colder regions, particularly during spring and autumn. Over 433 NASMD stations have been quality controlled using the methodology proposed in this study, and the algorithm will be implemented to control data quality from the other ~1,200 NASMD stations in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The Critical Zone includes the range of biophysical processes occurring from the top of the vegetation canopy to the weathering zone below the groundwater table. These services (Field et al. 2015) provide a measure to value processes that support the goods and services from our landscapes. In intensively managed landscapes the provisioning and regulating services are being altered through anthropogenic energy inputs so as to derive more agricultural productivity from the landscapes. Land use change and other alterations to the environment result in positive and/or negative net Critical Zone services. Through studies in the Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes (IMLCZO), this research seeks to answer questions such as: Are perennial bioenergy crops or annual replaced crops better for the land and surrounding environment? How do we evaluate the products and services from the land for the energy and resources we put in? Before the economic valuation of Critical Zone services, these questions seemed abstract. However, with developments such as Critical Zone services and life cycle assessments, they are more concrete. To evaluate the trade-offs between positive and negative impacts, life cycle assessments are used to create an inventory of all the energy inputs and outputs in a landscape management system. Total energy is computed by summing the mechanical energy used to construct tile drains, fertilizer, and other processes involved in intensely managed landscapes and the chemical energy gained by the production of biofuels from bioenergy crops. A multi-layer canopy model (MLCan) computes soil, water, and nutrient outputs for each crop type, which can be translated into Critical Zone services. These values are then viewed alongside the energy inputs into the system to show the relationship between agricultural practices and their corresponding ecosystem and environmental impacts.",

            "abstract": "Rising global temperatures have the potential to influence the Earth’s climate feedback cycles due to permafrost thawing, altering the freshwater input and trace metal and carbon fluxes into the ocean and atmosphere. Riverine lithium isotope ratios (d7Li) are a tracer of silicate weathering processes, which are key in the removal of atmospheric CO2 over geological timescales.\nDespite this, little is known about the effects of permafrost thawing on d7Li variations. Strong seasonal changes in the thawed active layer thickness dictate surficial water flow paths, which may influence intra-annual riverine d7Li signatures. We present a study of the dissolved d7Li from the large permafrost-dominated watersheds of the Lena River (Siberia), which drain into the Arctic Ocean. This work comprises a temporal study during the May 2015 spring flood, from ice breakup through peak flooding, thus monitoring changes in water-rock and water-soil interaction, both processes that control weathering and hence Li isotopes.\nBefore riverine ice started to break up, high [Li] are observed as the river signature is governed by winter base flow conditions. As the river ice breaks up, surface runoff flows over the impermeable permafrost, interacting with leaf litter, diluting the [Li]. We compare d7Li over the spring flood period with a greater spatial study conducted over two summer field seasons (2012/2013) of the main Lena River channel and its tributaries, which drain a variety of lithologies/topographies. During the summer, the thawed active layer promotes deeper water flow paths, greater water-rock interaction and enhanced secondary minerals formation which preferentially take up 6Li. Summer riverine d7Li typically fall between +14.5 ‰ to +28.5 ‰, with rivers draining the Central Siberian Plateau typically exhibiting high [Li], but similar δ7Li to rivers draining the Verkhoyansk Mountain Range.\nOverall, this study demonstrates how Li isotopes respond to weathering in a permafrost-dominated region, and provides rates on how quickly water-rock interaction can affect silicate weathering.",

            "abstract": "The overexploitation of groundwater resulted in abandoning many shallow tube wells in the river Basin in Eastern India. For the sustainability of groundwater resources, basin-scale modelling of groundwater flow is essential for the efficient planning and management of the water resources. The main intent of this study is to develope a 3-D groundwater flow model of the study basin using the Visual MODFLOW package and successfully calibrate and validate it using 17 years of observed data. The sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify the susceptibility of aquifer system to the river bank seepage, recharge from rainfall and agriculture practices, horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities, and specific yield. To quantify the impact of parameter uncertainties, Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Algorithm (SUFI-2) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques were implemented. Results from the two techniques were compared and the advantages and disadvantages were analysed. Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were adopted as two criteria during calibration and validation of the developed model. NSE and R2 values of groundwater flow model for calibration and validation periods were in acceptable range. Also, the MCMC technique was able to provide more reasonable results than SUFI-2. The calibrated and validated model will be useful to identify the aquifer properties, analyse the groundwater flow dynamics and the change in groundwater levels in future forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The debate over the processes of igneous accretion of gabbroic lower crust at submarine spreading centers is centered on two end-member hypotheses: Gabbro Glaciers and Sheeted Sills. In order to determine which of these two hypotheses is most applicable to a well-studied lower crustal section, we present newly published data (VanTongeren et al., 2015 EPSL v. 427, p. 249-261) on plagioclase lattice preferred orientations (LPO) in the Wadi Khafifah section of the Samail ophiolite, Oman. Based on our results we provide five critical observations that any model for the accretion of the lower oceanic crust must satisfy: (1) There is a distinctive change in the orientation of the outcrop-scale layering from near-vertical to sub-horizontal that is also reflected in the plagioclase fabrics in the uppermost ~1000-1500 m of the gabbroic crust; (2) The distinction between the upper gabbros and lower gabbros is not a geochemical boundary. Rather, the change in outcrop-scale orientation from near-vertical to sub-horizontal occurs stratigraphically lower in the crust than a change in whole-rock geochemistry; (3) There is no systematic difference in plagioclase fabric strength in any crystallographic axis between the upper gabbros and the lower gabbros; (4) Beneath the abrupt transition from sub-vertical to sub-horizontal fabric, there is no systematic change in the geographic orientation of the plagioclase fabric, or in the development of a dominant lineation direction within the upper gabbros or the lower gabbros; (5) In the lower gabbros, the obliquity between the (010) and the modal layering remains approximately constant and indicates a consistent top to the right sense of shear throughout the stratigraphy.\nOur observations are most consistent with the Sheeted Sills hypothesis, in which the majority of lower crustal gabbros are crystallized in situ and fabrics are dominated by compaction and localized extension rather than by systematically increasing shear strain with increasing depth in a Gabbro Glacier. Our results suggest that extensional strain in fast spreading ridges is accommodated in partially molten regions at the ridge axis, whereas in slow and ultra-slow ridges large shear strains are accommodated by plastic deformation.",

            "abstract": "The potential for climate change to result in changes to the Antarctic ice sheet -- including the possibility of a full collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Shet (WAIS) is well known. Less well known is that the collapse of the ice sheet, if it occured, would have significant impcts on regional climate. We use climate model simulations to quantify the impact of topographic changes on the surface climate of Antarctica. As a general rule, lowered topography produces anomalous cyclonic circulation owing to fundamental atmospheric dynamical constraints. In the case of WAIS collapse, this causes increased flow of warm, maritime air toward the South Pole and cold-air advection from the East Antarctic plateau toward the Ross Sea and Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica. This resulting pattern The result is cooling in some areas and warming in others, a pattern that is similar to that observed from ice core paleotemperature data for the last interglacial period, suggesting that WAIS collapse occurred at that time. We find that magnitude of the response is roughly linear with the magnitude of the imposed elevation change. The regional response over West Antarctica is large enough that it probably needs to be taken into account in modeling future changes to the ice sheet. Of particular interest is that lowering of the WAIS topography results in anomalous westerlies along the Amundsen Sea coastline. Anomalous westerlies in this region today are in large part responsible for the for intrusion of circumpolar deepwater onto the continental shelf, and the observed rapid thinning of West Antarctic ice shelves. A positive feedback may thus exist in which lowering of the WAIS surface from climate forcing may enhance that forcing, leading to further elevation lowering and ice sheet mass loss.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotopes of paleo lake-water archived in subfossil aquatic organic material offer new insights into Arctic Holocene climate history. Here we present new constraints on the timing and magnitude of Holocene climate change in NW Greenland inferred from δ18O of chironomid head capsules, Cladocera ephippia, and aquatic macrophytes. δ18O of chironomids from surface sediments of multiple lakes in the region show consistent enrichment relative to lake-water (-18 to -22 ‰), on the order of 23 ‰. Lake-water δ18O collected during the summer of 2014 is comparable to modern and historical seasonal local meteoric water, and landscape position suggests dominantly precipitation inputs. Sediment cores recovered from two small, non-glacial lakes in 2014 near Thule Air Base capture continuous 7.7 kyr and 10.4 kyr records. δ18O of chironomids and macrophytes from Secret Lake decreases after 6 ka by 3 ‰ into the Neoglacial. Early Holocene values from Wax Lips Lake (informal name) are 3 to 4 ‰ higher than modern and decrease to the present, except for a large negative excursion ~5 ka. This is contemporaneous with a major change in stratigraphy and the hypothesized transient incursion of a regional, ice-dammed glacial lake system. At both lakes, declining δ18O from the early/middle to late Holocene is clearly recorded in multiple aquatic materials and is greater in magnitude than the mid to late Holocene changes in δ18O of the nearest ice core records (Agassiz and Camp Century, ~2 ‰). The temperature change of 4 to 6 °C inferred from this new δ18O approach is also larger than, but within the error of, chironomid assemblage based temperatures from Wax Lips Lake by McFarlin et al. (this meeting). This may indicate larger temperature changes at the ice sheet’s margin than inferred from high-elevation ice core sites and/or some overprinting by enhanced evaporation of lake-water in the warmer climate of the early Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Oil is the largest source of primary energy in the world, at 32% of 2014 consumption. Forecasts by the International Energy Agency suggest oil will continue to provide the largest share of global energy through 2040, even with new policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios indicate that between 1.5 and 3.8 trillion barrels of oil will be burnt between 2015 and 2100.\nVarious sources suggest that the world has 5 to 6 trillion barrels of remaining recoverable oil, more than half of which are in low grade deposits. Although oil sands and extra heavy oil are claimed to hold 1.5 trillion barrels, assessments of major deposits in the Canadian oil sands and the Venezuela Orinoco Belt, which hold the bulk of these resources, total less than 500 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Kerogen oil (oil shale), which has never been produced in anything but miniscule volumes, comprises an additional trillion barrels of these estimates. These unconventional deposits are very different from the conventional oil of the past as:\n- they are rate constrained, as they require massive upfront capital investments and lengthy construction periods, and therefore cannot be scaled up quickly in response to declines in conventional production.\n- they are expensive, both in terms of cost per barrel and the large energy inputs required for production. The best in situ oil sands deposits may yield an energy return of 3:1 and kerogen oil even less if it ever becomes commercially viable. This compares to 10:1 or more for conventional oil.\nShale oil (light tight oil), may yield another 300 billion barrels worldwide, but suffers from high decline rates, expensive wells and limited availability of high quality deposits.\nThe most productive and economically viable portions of these unconventional deposits tend to be exploited first, leaving the less productive, higher cost oil for later.\nAs a result, increasing global oil consumption will prove extremely difficult beyond the next few years, even with much higher prices. Long term oil consumption assumptions in RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5 are therefore too high, given the geological and economic characteristics of remaining recoverable resources. Consumption of other fuels would need to be increased to retain the radiative forcing in these RCP scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Two-phase flow in porous media is important in many natural and industrial processes like geologic CO2 sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and water infiltration in soil. While it is well known that the wetting properties of porous media can vary drastically depending on the type of media and the pore fluids, the effect of wettability on fluid displacement continues to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. Here we conduct two-phase flow experiments via radial displacement of viscous silicone oil by water, in planar microfluidic devices patterned with vertical posts. These devices allow for visualization of flow through a complex but well-defined microstructure. In addition, the surface energy of the devices can be tuned over a wide range of contact angles, allowing us to access different wettability conditions. We use a fluorescent dye to measure the in-plane water saturation.\nWe perform constant-rate injection experiments with highly unfavorable mobility contrast (viscosity of injected water is 350 times less than the displaced silicone oil) at injection rates over four orders of magnitude. We focus on three particular wetting conditions: drainage (θ=120°), weak imbibition (θ=60°), and strong imbibition (θ=7°). In drainage, we observe a transition from viscous fingering at high capillary numbers to a morphology that, in contrast with conventional knowledge, is different from capillary fingering. In weak imbibition, we observe an apparent stabilization of flow instabilities, as a result of cooperative invasion at the pore scale. In strong imbibition, we find that the flow behavior is heavily influenced by a precursor front that emanates from the main imbibition front. The nature of the precursor front depends on the capillary number. At intermediate capillary numbers, the precursor front consists primarily of corner flow that connects the surface of neighboring posts, forming ramified fingers. The progress of corner flow is overtaken by the spreading of precursor film (~1 um thick) at lower capillary numbers. The ensuing main imbibition front preferentially invades areas already coated by the precursor film, forming a more compact invasion pattern. Our work demonstrates the important, yet intricate, impact of wettability on the morphology of fluid-fluid displacement in porous media.",

However, quantitative measure of amount and distribution of the fluids has been difficult target to estimate so far. We tried to overcome this barrier by using transient discharge of hot-spring fluids associated with a large earthquake.\nOn November 22, 2014 at 22:08, a large earthquake (M 6.7 depth 5.0 km) occurred at the Hakuba area, Northern part of Nagano Prefecture (Naganoken-Hokubu Earthquake). The Kamishiro Fault, striking NS and dipping moderately to the east, and one of the active traces of Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line, was activated by the earthquake, and generated the surface displacements (reverse + left lateral, less than 0.5m) mainly at the southern trace of the fault. Eight hours after the main shock, hot spring suddenly gushed out at the northern part of Kamishiro Fault. We kept measuring the flow amount, electric conductivity, pH, chemical- and isotopic- characteristics of the spring-fluids for four months until transient spring was dried out. A clear trend of exponential decay of flow amount was observed (R2 = 8.63) with time, and total volume of fluid sprang out is estimated to be 7300 m3. Using our fluid – porous fracture zone model and Darcy-Brinkman’s equation, we estimated fluid pressure right after the main shock at the focal depth. Based on the results of observation and calculation, we discuss the relationship between mode of seismicity and fluid condition in and around the activated fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Gravity-driven folds and thrusts often characterize the slope and deep-water settings of passive margins. These structures exert a significant control on sediment gravity flows because they determine the location and configuration of sediment depo-centres and transport systems. Here we exploit 3D seismic data in the outer toe-thrust region of the deep-water Niger Delta to analyse the interaction between Plio-Pleistocene channel systems and actively-growing folds and thrusts. We first map folds and thrusts from the seismic data and we use this data to reconstruct the history of fold growth in detail. We then make quantitative measurements of the geomorphic response of submarine channels to growing tectonic structures in order to provide new constraints on their long-term erosional dynamics. This information is used to infer morphodyanamic processes that sculpted the channel systems through time, and to estimate the bed shear stresses and fluid velocities of typical flow events.\n The bathymetric long profiles of these channels have concavities that range from -0.08 to -0.34, and an average gradient of ~1o. Thrusts are associated with a local steepening in channel gradient of up to 3 times, and this effect extends 0.5 – 2 km upstream of the thrust. Within these knickzones, channel incision increases by approximately by a factor of 2, with a corresponding width decrease of approximately 25%. Channel incision across growing structures is achieved through enhanced bed-shear stress driven incision (up to 200 Pa) and flow velocity (up to 5 ms-1) assuming typical bulk sediment concentrations of 0.6%. Comparison of structural uplift since 1.7 Ma, and channel incision over an equivalent period, shows that many of these channels are able to keep pace with the time-integrated uplift since 1.7 Ma, and may have reached a bathymetric steady-state. Generally, bed-shear stresses of ~150 Pa are sufficient to keep pace with structural strain rates of 10-15 s-1. More widely, our data demonstrates that submarine channel systems dynamically adjust their geometry and basal gradient in order to keep pace with growth of tectonic structures and our results suggest that these factors must be incorporated into models to fully predict the downslope pathways of sea-bed channels in structurally complex areas.",

Gravity and topography can be combined to produce Bouguer gravity that reveals the distribution of mass in the subsurface, with high degrees in the spherical harmonic expansion of the Bouguer anomalies sensitive to shallowest structure. For isolated regions of the lunar highlands and several basins we have deconstructed the gravity field and mapped the subsurface distribution of density anomalies. While specified spherical harmonic degree ranges can be used to estimate contributions at different depths, such analyses require considerable caution in interpretation. A comparison of filtered Bouguer gravity with forward models of disk masses with plausible densities illustrates the interdependencies of the gravitational power of density anomalies with depth and spatial scale. The results have implications regarding the limits of interpretation of lunar subsurface structure.",

This region faces critical challenges regarding balancing food needs, resource conservation (e.g Ogallala aquifer), environmental concerns, and rural economy development. Developing transformative, multifunctional systems will require equally imaginative and efficient tools to help farmers manage complex agroecosystems in a rapidly changing climate. The Northern Plains long-term agroecosystem research (LTAR) site at Mandan, ND and the Platte River High Plains LTAR (ARS/University of Nebraska-Lincoln) at Lincoln, NE in collaboration with USDA-ARS research units in Brookings, SD and Fargo, ND are collaborating to address the grand challenge of providing and sustaining multiple service provisions from Northern Great Plains agroecosystems. We propose to attain these goals through sustainable intensification based on the adoption of conservation agriculture principles including reduced soil disturbance, livestock integration, and greater complexity and diversity in the cropping system. Here, we summarize new concepts these locations have pioneered in dynamic cropping systems, resource use efficiency, and agricultural management technologies. As part of the LTAR network, we will conduct long-term cross-site research to design and assess new agricultural practices and systems aimed at improving our understanding of decision making processes and outcomes across an array of agricultural systems.",

            "abstract": "In the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, it became critical to determine how radionuclides, both from atmospheric deposition and direct ocean discharge, were spreading in the ocean. One successful method used drifter observations from the Global Drifter Program (GDP) to predict the timing of the spread of surface contamination. U.S. coasts are home to a number of nuclear power plants as well as other industries capable of leaking contamination into the surface ocean. Here, the spread of surface contamination from a hypothetical accident at the existing Pilgrim nuclear power plant on the coast of Massachusetts is used as an example to show how the historical drifter dataset can be used as a prediction tool. Our investigation uses a combined dataset of drifter tracks from the GDP and the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Two scenarios are examined to estimate the spread of surface contamination: a local direct leakage scenario and a broader atmospheric deposition scenario that could result from an explosion. The local leakage scenario is used to study the spread of contamination within and beyond Cape Cod Bay, and the atmospheric deposition scenario is used to study the large-scale spread of contamination throughout the North Atlantic Basin. A multiple-iteration method of estimating probability makes best use of the available drifter data. This technique, which allows for direct observationally-based predictions, can be applied anywhere that drifter data are available to calculate estimates of the likelihood and general timing of the spread of surface contamination in the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems transport and process significant amounts of terrestrial carbon and can be considerable sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. A great deal of uncertainty, however, remains in both global estimates and our understanding of drivers of freshwater greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, small headwater streams have received insufficient attention to date and may contribute disproportionately to global GHG flux. Our objective was to quantify GHG flux and assess the impact of changes in DOC and NO3 concentrations in surface and subsurface water on flux rates in three streams in the Lamprey River watershed in New Hampshire, USA, that contrast in surface water DOC:NO3. We measured DOC, NO3 and dissolved gas concentrations in surface waters of each stream monthly from May 2011 to April 2012. Empirical measurements of reaeration coefficients were used to convert dissolved gas concentrations to fluxes. We found higher GHG concentrations and fluxes in the two streams with high DOC concentrations, particularly gases produced by anaerobic metabolism (CH4, N2O from methanogenesis and denitrification, respectively). The stream with high DOC and high NO3 showed high N2O and low CH4 flux, while the high DOC, low NO3 stream showed high CH4 and low N2O flux. Our results are consistent with a model in which C inputs drive total GHG production, while NO3 input regulates the relative importance of CH4 and N2O by suppressing methanogenesis and stimulating denitrification. The magnitude of GHG fluxes suggests that streams in this region are likely to be small sources of CO2, but potentially important sources of CH4 and N2O. Since CH4 and N2O are many times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere, freshwater emissions of these gases have the potential to offset a significant proportion of the climate benefits of the terrestrial carbon sink, a possibility that has not been sufficiently incorporated into climate models.",

            "abstract": "High northern latitude forests, particularly those in the taiga-tundra ecotone (TTE), lie at the leading edge of climate change. The structure of these forests contribute to climate feedbacks by modifying surface albedo and above- and below-ground carbon storage. These modifications are associated with vertical and horizontal forest characteristics such as tree height and canopy cover. These characteristics are changing unevenly throughout the TTE, and the degree to which forests are vulnerable to such changes varies, in part, according to whether the primary drivers of their response are controlled by site-scale factors or climate.\nObserving spatial variations in TTE forest structure is difficult given the uncertainties associated with spaceborne measurements of sparse forests. Global-scale spaceborne observations of these forests tend to overestimate sparse tree cover. This overestimation increases the uncertainty in the patterns of forests that may reflect critical site-scale controls of its structure, its vulnerability to change and the potential for climate feedbacks. The key to improving prediction of feedbacks between TTE forests and climate may be linked to how well we understand the fine-scale patterns of heterogeneous TTE forest structure.\nWe examine the spaceborne potential for delineating fine-scale (< 2m) forest structure (height and cover) in sparse forests in the TTE. We apply automated digital stereo-photogrammetry to high resolution spaceborne images. This processing allows us to combine surface elevation models and multispectral data at forested study sites to extract detailed vertical and horizontal forest structure characteristics. With this data, we can validate coarser (~30m) global tree cover data, model forest structure characteristics and patterns, and use these patterns to examine the differences in the vulnerability of TTE forest structure at multiple scales across the circumpolar domain.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars, HSRL-1 and HSRL-2, have acquired large datasets of vertically resolved aerosol extinction, backscatter, and depolarization during >30 airborne field missions since 2006. The lidar measurements of aerosol intensive parameters like lidar ratio and color ratio embed information about intrinsic aerosol properties, and are combined to qualitatively classify HSRL aerosol measurements into aerosol types.\nKnowledge of aerosol type is important for assessing aerosol radiative forcing, and can provide useful information for source attribution studies. However, atmospheric aerosol is frequently not a single pure type, but instead is a mixture, which affects the optical and radiative properties of the aerosol. We show that aerosol intensive parameters measured by lidar can be understood using mixing rules for cases of external mixing.\nBeyond coarse classification and mixing between classes, variations in the lidar aerosol intensive parameters provide additional insight into aerosol processes and composition. This is illustrated by depolarization measurements at three wavelengths, 355 nm, 532 nm, and 1064 nm, made by HSRL-2. Particle depolarization ratio is an indicator of non-spherical particles. Three cases each have a significantly different spectral dependence of the depolarization ratio, related to the size of the depolarizing particles. For two dust cases, large non-spherical particles account for the depolarization of the lidar light. The spectral dependence reflects the size distribution of these particles and reveals differences in the transport histories of the two plumes. For a smoke case, the depolarization is inferred to be due to the presence of small coated soot aggregates. Interestingly, the depolarization at 355 nm is similar for this smoke case compared to the dust cases, having potential implications for the upcoming EarthCARE satellite, which will measure particle depolarization ratio only at 355 nm.",

It fulfills eyewitnesses’ needs by offering information on felt earthquakes and their effects within tens of seconds of their occurrence. Associated with an active presence on Facebook, Pinterest and on websites, this proves a very efficient engagement strategy. For example, the app was installed thousands of times after the Ghorka earthquake in Nepal. Language barriers have been erased by using visual communication; for example, felt reports are collected through a set of cartoons representing different shaking levels. Within 3 weeks of the magnitude 7.8 Ghorka earthquakes, 7,000 felt reports with thousands of comments were collected related to the mainshock and tens of its aftershocks as well as 100 informative geo-located pics. The QuakeBot was essential in allowing us to be identified so well and interact with those affected.\nLastQuake is also a risk reduction tool since it provides rapid information. Rapid information is similar to prevention since when it does not exist, disasters can happen. When no information is available after a felt earthquake, the public block emergency lines by trying to find out the cause of the shaking, crowds form potentially leading to unpredictable crowd movement, rumors spread. In its next release LastQuake will also provide people with guidance immediately after a shaking through a number of pop-up cartoons illustrating “do/don’t do” items (go to open places, do not phone emergency services except if people are injured…).\nLastQuake’s app design is simple and intuitive and has a global audience. It benefited from a crowdfunding campaign (and the support of the Fondation MAIF) and more improvements have been planned after an online feedback campaign organized in early June with the Ghorka earthquake eyewitnesses.\nLastQuake is also a seismic risk reduction tools thanks to its very rapid information. When such information does not exist, people tend to call emergency services, crowds emerge and rumors spread. In its next release, LastQuake will also have “do/don’t do” cartoons popping up after an earthquake to encourage appropriate behavior.",

            "abstract": "Research Question: Is there a bacteria in camel feces that digests cellulose material and can be used for waste to energy projects?   Fossil fuels are the current main resource of energy in the modern world. However, as the demand for fuel increases, biofuels have been proposed as an alternative energy source that is a more sustainable form of liquid fuel generation from living things or waste, commonly known as biofuels and ethanol. The Camelus dromedarius’, also known as Arabian camel, diet consist of grass, grains, wheat and oats as well desert vegetation in their natural habitat. However, as the Arabian camel lacks the enzymes to degrade cellulose, it is hypothesized that cellulose digestion is performed by microbial symbionts in camel microbiota. Fecal samples were collected from the Camelus dromedarius in United Arab Emirates and diluted 10-7 times. The diluted sample was then streaked onto a Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose plate, and inoculated onto CMC and Azure-B plates. Afterwards, Congo Red was used for staining in order to identify clearance zones of single colonies that may potentially be used as a qualitative assays for cellulose digestion. Then the colonies undergo polymerase chain reaction amplification to produce amplified RNA fragments. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene is identified based on BLAST result using Sanger Sequencing. Amongst the three identified microbes: Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Escherichia coli, both Bacillus and Staphylococcus are cellulose-digesting microbes, and through the fermentation of lignocellulosic, biomasses can be converted into cellulosic ethanol (Biofuel). According to the Improvements in Life Cycle Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Corn-Ethanol by Adam J. Liska, ““Ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 40-50% when compared directly to gasoline.” The determination of bacterial communities that are capable of efficiently and effectively digesting cellulose materials requires that the bacteria be first isolated and then a full genome characterization. This bacteria study is apart of a much larger study and will be tested against the gut microbiome of other animals successfully digesting cellulose to determine the ones that are best suited for biofuel production.",

            "abstract": "Current knowledge of the present-day physical state and structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle essentially derives from four independent sources: i) gravity field and thermal modelling, ii) modelling/inversion of different seismic datasets, iii) magnetotelluric studies, and iv) thermobarometric and geochemical data from exhumed mantle samples. Unfortunately, the integration of these different sources of information in modern geophysical studies is still uncommon and significant discrepancies and/or inconsistencies in predictions between these sources are still the rule rather than the exception.\nIn this contribution we will present a thermodynamically-constrained multi-observable probabilistic inversion method capable of jointly inverting i) surface and body wave datasets, gravity anomalies, geoid height, gravity gradients, receiver functions, surface heat flow, magnetotelluric data, and elevation (static and dynamic) in 3D spherical coordinates. Key aspects of the method are: (a) it combines multiple geophysical observables with different sensitivities to deep/shallow, thermal/compositional anomalies into a single thermodynamic-geophysical framework; (b) it works with thermophysical models of the Earth rather than with parameterized structures of physical parameters (e.g. Vs, Vp, density, etc), (c) it uses a general probabilistic (Bayesian) formulation to appraise the data; (d) no initial model is needed; (e) a priori compositional information relies on robust statistical analyses of a large database of natural mantle samples; (f) it provides a natural platform to estimate realistic uncertainties; (g) it handles multiscale parameterizations and complex physical models, and (h) it includes dynamic (convection) effects on surface observables by solving the complete Stokes flow using multi-dimensional decomposition methods. We will present results for both synthetic and real case studies, which serve to highlight the advantages and limitations of this new approach.",

            "abstract": "Distinctive low-reflectance material (LRM) was first observed on Mercury in Mariner 10 flyby images. Visible to near infrared reflectance spectra of LRM exhibit a flatter slope than the average reflectance for Mercury, which is strongly red sloped (increasing in reflectance with longer wavelength). Moreover, LRM is lower in reflectance (<0.04–0.05 at 560 nm wavelength) than an already dark planet (global average 0.06–0.07). In some cases, LRM spectra also exhibit a curvature suggestive of a weak, broad absorption band near 600 nm. From Mariner 10 and early MESSENGER flyby observations, it was suggested that ilmenite, ulvöspinel, carbon, or iron metal could cause the characteristic dark, flat spectrum of LRM. However, once MESSENGER entered orbit, low iron and titanium abundances measured by the X-Ray Spectrometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer ruled out ilmenite and ulvöspinel as important constituents and implied a different darkening phase, such as carbon or small amounts of opaque minerals dispersed as micro- or nanophase particles in a silicate matrix. To test the various hypotheses for the darkening agent in LRM and on Mercury more generally, we present a global map of the distribution of LRM across Mercury. We also examine the spectral properties of major LRM deposits as measured by the Mercury Dual Imaging Spectrometer and Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer to further constrain the composition of the darkening agent. Our mapping and spectral analysis supports the inferences that LRM is excavated from depth by large impacts, and that the darkening agent is likely carbon that is native to Mercury rather than exogenic.",

            "abstract": "Zn isotope geochemistry has shown great potential in exploring planetary differentiation and volatilization history [1,2,3,4]. However, the zinc isotopic composition of the mantle and its fractionation mechanism in high-temperature processes are still unclear. In order to understand Zn isotope composition of the mantle, here we measured Zn isotope data for mantle rocks and minerals, including coexisting olivine, orthopyroxene (Opx), clinopyroxene (Cpx) and spinel from peridotite xenoliths in the Hannuoba (China), Vitim (Siberia), Tariat (central Mongolia), and Dariganga (SE Mongolia).\nAs an accessary mineral, spinels in our study have high Zn contents (500-1400 ppm), accounting for 18%-40% of the total Zn budget in peridotites. Spinels have higher δ66Zn ranging from 0.17 to 0.30‰ than other mantle minerals. For most samples, the δ66Zn of olivines vary from -0.03‰ to 0.19‰, indistinguishable to the value of the coexisting Opx (0.05‰ to 0.20‰). However, we also observed large fractionation between these two minerals, which may reflect disequilibrium fractionation due to kinetic processes. Finally, δ66Zn for peridotites are 0.12-0.21‰, slightly lighter than that of basalts (~0.25±0.05‰), revealing that Zn isotopes can be slightly fractionated during mantle melting.\n[1] Luck et al., (2005) Geochimica Cosmo Acta, 69, 5351-5363.

            "abstract": "Mesoscale hydrological models like mHM (Samaniego et al., 2010, WRR) are usually evaluated with observed discharge, which is a spatially integrated signal of the watershed. However, an accurate prediction of spatially distributed soil water content often is of higher interest for hydrologic prediction. For hydrologic models operating at intermediate to regional scales, Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensors provide unrivaled soil moisture data which are much more representative than point data and of higher spatio-temporal resolution than most remote-sensing products. We are aiming to improve soil moisture calibration and evaluation in mHM with the support of the intermediate-scale data from cosmic-ray neutrons. The relationship between soil moisture profiles in the footprint and the corresponding cosmic-ray neutron counts is non-linear and not unique. Therefore we assimilate cosmic-ray neutron data directly by employing the nested forward model COSMIC (Shuttleworth et al. 2013, HESS), which calculates neutron counts from the modeled soil moisture. In optimization mode, mHM is able to calibrate parameters of both, the hydrological system and/or the neutron prediction model itself. Model performance is evaluated with independent measurements of soil moisture patterns from several catchment-wide TDR campaigns, time series of a Wireless Sensor Network and discharge in the small catchment \"Schäfertal\" (1.6 km2) in central Germany. One of the major challenges is to improve soil moisture and discharge performance simultaneously in the hydrologic model. This work is an important step towards the assimilation of continuous spatial data from mobile Cosmic Ray Sensing. The so-called TERENO:Rover delivers highly-resolved spatial patterns of water content in a whole catchment, which has a great potential to improve spatial performance of hydrological models.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 30 years, loess and paleosol deposits have provided the scientific community a unique opportunity to study past climate and environmental change of the continents. Fluctuating magnetic susceptibility of glacial loess and interglacial soil deposits in China, and a few places elsewhere, have been correlated with the marine isotope stages and ice core records, illustrating the loess-climate connection. Furthermore, the logarithm of the magnetic susceptibility and other ferrimagnetism dependant concentration parameters in modern topsoil are found to be linearly related to modern rainfall records. But, the transfer function is site specific. Others have suggested that the relationship is more universal if precipitation and evapotranspiration are considered together. This said, major roadblocks remain for loess/paleosol magnetism to reach its full potential as a quantitative tool in climate and environmental studies. Reaching this full potential is impaired primarily because of the difficulty in identifying iron oxides and oxyhydroxides other than magnetite or maghemite in natural samples and (semi-)quantifying their concentration and grain size. This talk will present results obtained recently through research targeting loess and paleosol magnetism emphasising the need to further consider the following scientific questions. Which environmental and climate variables cause the change in magnetism in soils? How does magnetism evolve with time, quantitatively, when soils are buried under newly deposited loess and become paleosols? Can we overcome the imprecision of paleomagnetic dating inherent to our poor understanding of the magnetization acquisition process in loess and soils?",

            "abstract": "Fires play an important role in the Earth system and are one of the major sources of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Satellites have been key to understand their spatial and temporal variability in space and time, but the most frequently used satellite datasets start only in 1995. There are still large uncertainties about the frequency and intensity of fires in the pre-satellite time period, especially in regions with active deforestation, which may have changed dramatically in intensity in the past decades influencing fire dynamics. We used two datasets to extend the record of fires and deforestation in the Amazon region back in time: 1) annual forest loss rates starting in 1990 derived from Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), which is a satellite-based vegetation product that can be used as proxy for forest loss, and 2) horizontal visibility as proxy for fire emissions, reported by weather stations and airports in the Amazon, which started around 1940, and having widespread coverage since 1973. We show that these datasets overlap with fire emission estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) enabling us to estimate fire emissions over the last 50 years. We will discuss how fires have varied over time in this region with globally significant emissions, how droughts have influenced fire activity and deforestation rates, and what the impact is of land-use change caused by fire on emissions in the Amazon region.",

            "abstract": "Since the beginning of 2015, the Visible InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard the NASA Dawn mission has obtained hyperspectral images of Ceres, with improving spatial resolution. VIR operates in the overall spectral range 0.25-5.1 µm, with the main goal of inferring the surface composition of the target in its uppermost layer, as thick as tens of microns.\nTaking advantage of the wavelength range longward of 3 µm, VIR can be used as a thermal mapper, i.e. as a tool to derive thermal images and spatially-resolved temperature maps. To do this, the VIR team uses a Bayesian approach to nonlinear inversion that was extensively applied to the Vesta dataset earlier.\nAlready in February 2015, VIR had the chance to acquire data with a spatial resolution of ~11 km/px. Those temperature images revealed that a spot of high-albedo (bright) material, highlighted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) earlier and recently associated with the crater Haulani, was cooler than sorrounding regions seen under similar solar illumination, whereas the brightest spots on Ceres, in the crater Occator, did not display any thermal contrast. The following Survey phase yielded hyperspectral coverage of Ceres at ~1.3 km/px, and the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) phase starting in mid-August 2015 is expected to provide VIR data with a resolution of ~0.4 km/px. These datasets allow derivation of regional and local temperature maps as well as the study of thermal anomalies at those spatial scales. Due to the low overall thermal inertia of Ceres, the surface temperature is essentially dominated by the instantaneous value of the solar incidence angle. Small values of this angle result in high surface temperatures, and, unlike Vesta, the low obliquity of Ceres (~4°) does not result in observable seasonal effects for a given location on the surface. However, different responses to insolation as observed at the local scale may be indicative of differences in density/porosity and thermal conductivity, which is key to constrain thermo-physical modeling.",

It hosts a seismological station CCD which has provided observatory quality data since the year 2000, has been integrated into the Geoscope network since 2008 and whose data are now available in real-time from IRIS. The current seismic vault is located 800m from Concordia base, as far away as is deemed logistically possible by IPEV, at a depth of 12m. The vault is thermally very stable, but given the close distance to the base, suffers from increased diurnal noise (up to 40 dB) at frequencies above 1Hz, especially in the summer season. Anthropic noise is trapped in the firn (snow) layer, which forms an 100-110m thick waveguide, and is picked up very easily in the seismic vault. The vault is made from steel containers buried vertically in the snow. The hydrostatic pressure of the snow is deforming them: we see container cracking events on the seismograms, and also visual evidence of container deformation inside the vault. In the near future, this deformation will create a security problem.We have decided to progressively abandon our current vault, and construct a new post-hole seismological installation nearby. We plan to drill to 130m depth, which would place us below the firn layer waveguide and also below the ice pinch-out depth. To be able to run the station for several years and change or service the instrumentation if required, we need to keep the hole open, to avoid any hydrostatic movement, and to maintain good coupling between the sensor and the surrounding hard ice. To achieve these goals, we shall install a casing in the fin layer and then drill a few meters more without casing in hard ice. After installing the instrument, we shall then fill the whole hole with a drilling fluid whose density is similar to that of ice.The drilling will be carried out by the French drilling facility C2FN (Centre de Carottage et de Forage National) of the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), and the is planned for the 2018-2019 summer season.",

            "abstract": "oceanography. One of the grand challenges of oceanography is to develop model techniques to more effectively incorporate genomic information. As one approach, we developed an ecosystem model whose community is determined by randomly assigning functional genes to build each organism’s “DNA”. Microbes are assigned a size that sets their baseline environmental responses using allometric response cuves. These responses are modified by the costs and benefits conferred by each gene in an organism’s genome. The microbes are embedded in a general circulation model where environmental conditions shape the emergent population. This model is used to explore whether organisms constructed from randomized combinations of metabolic capability alone can self-organize to create realistic oceanic biogeochemical gradients. Realistic community size spectra and chlorophyll-a concentrations emerge in the model. The model is run repeatedly with randomly-generated microbial communities and each time realistic gradients in community size spectra, chlorophyll-a, and forms of nitrogen develop. This supports the hypothesis that the metabolic potential of a community rather than the realized species composition is the primary factor setting vertical and horizontal environmental gradients. Vertical distributions of nitrogen and transcripts for genes involved in nitrification are broadly consistent with observations. Modeled gene and transcript abundance for nitrogen cycling and processing of land-derived organic material match observations along the extreme gradients in the Amazon River plume, and they help to explain the factors controlling observed variability.",

            "abstract": "Tungurahua volcano has been intermittently erupting since 1999, with observed deformation between 2007-2011 using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from the ALOS satellite of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Our recent analysis during that time period has provided insights into the characteristics of the subsurface, suggesting multiple connected magma chambers underneath the edifice with distinct temporal and spatial behaviors. However, the previous source models are too simplistic and fail to incorporate realistic physical properties and forces acting within the volcano that would generate the observed deformation. We use deformation data from InSAR and solve for the optimal deformation source parameters with Finite Element Methods (FEM) by incorporating into the models the material heterogeneities (e.g. temperature, density, elastic, viscoelastic), and stresses (e.g. background stresses, edifice loading, magma chamber overpressure) acting on the volcano. We attempt to integrate previous multidisciplinary volcanological studies with our results to constrain the subsurface characteristics and understand the volcanic processes generating the observed deformation.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing appreciation that seafloor gradients in many ancient deep-marine clastic environments are likely to have been steep enough to promote upper flow regime (Froude Number >1) processes and deposits. This issue was addressed by Komar (1971) who concluded that for a reasonable friction factor, f = 0.02, turbidity currents would be supercritical on slopes > 0.5°, a value exceeded on many basin-margin slopes and on the upper parts of submarine fans. Many deep-water depositional systems, therefore, probably contain significant volumes of deposits that have been misinterpreted using the classic Bouma Ta-Te divisions for a waning flow rather than as upper flow-regime (supercritical) bedforms. Using outcrop examples from lower-slope, base-of-slope and proximal basin-floor settings in the Middle Eocene Ainsa Basin, Spanish Pyrenees, linked with recent experimental and theoretical work, this paper considers the range of deposits that can be reinterpreted as upper-flow regime bedforms in what might be termed \"supercritical clastic systems\". Such sedimentary structures involve a very wide range of grain sizes and include discontinuous and irregular sandwaves, backset (upstream-inclined) bedding in mounded gravels and sands and scour-and-fill structures. Irrespective of varying relative base level in the staging area for such flows, supercritical clastic systems show complex facies relationships.\nKomar, P.D. 1971.

Results of a collaboration between the Department of the Interior (DOI) Strategic Sciences Group (SSG) and the Southwest Colorado Social-Ecological Climate Resilience Project are presented in which SSG scenario-building methods were revised and applied to climate change adaptation planning in Colorado’s Gunnison Basin, United States.\nThe SSG provides the DOI with the capacity to rapidly assemble multidisciplinary teams of experts to develop scenarios of the potential environmental, social, and economic cascading consequences of environmental crises, and to analyze these chains to determine actionable intervention points. By design, the SSG responds to acute events of a relatively defined duration.\nAs a capacity-building exercise, the SSG explored how its scenario-building methodology could be applied to outlining the cascading consequences of slow-onset events related to climate change. SSG staff facilitated two workshops to analyze the impacts of drought, wildfire, and insect outbreak in the sagebrush and spruce-fir ecosystems. Participants included local land managers, natural and social scientists, ranchers, and other stakeholders. Key findings were: 1) scenario framing must be adjusted to accommodate the multiple, synergistic components and longer time frames of slow-onset events; 2) the development of slow-onset event scenarios is likely influenced by participants having had more time to consider potential consequences, relative to acute events; 3) participants who are from the affected area may have a more vested interest in the outcome and/or may be able to directly implement interventions.",

We used HEC-RAS to model the changing flooding regime in the lower White River floodplain, Arkansas, in response to rapid incision of the Mississippi River in the 1930s, and quantified flood frequency, depth, and duration by forest community type. Incision has decreased flooding especially in terms of frequency, which is one of the most important variables for ecological processes. Modeled depth-duration curves varied more among floodplain reaches than among forest communities within the same reach, but forest communities are now arranged in accordance with new flood regimes in place after river incision. Forest responses to subtle geomorphic change are slower than other vegetation communities, so detection of the full ramifications of ecohydrologic change may require decades.",

Traditionally, anomalies have been modelled from Earth’s surface down to the crust-upper mantle boundary, considering the Moho as the magnetic-non magnetic interface. However, long wavelength magnetic anomalies appear as residuals not modelled in most global and large regional magnetic models.\nIn the last years, several publications have proposed and analysed the magnetic signal from fresh upper mantle xenolith showing the presence of minor inclusions of magnetite that might be in ferrimagnetic state at those depths, depending on the particular geotherm of the geological setting.\nIt has been modelled the effect on Earth surface of those magnetite inclusions taking into account the variation of magnetic intensity at depth, magnetic susceptibility and concentration of magnetite reported from mantle xenolith on different setting finding the effect of the inclusions can have measurable intensities at the surface. Results show that the effect of magnetite in the upper mantle could have a relevant effect when modelling magnetic signal from satellite missions.",

            "abstract": "Earth Observation (EO) based yield modelling has long been in development as an alternative method to the traditional survey based methods in forecasting the regional and global crop yield. However, it is only in last decade or so, with availability of high quality regional EO data in near real time (NRT), EO-based crop yield forecasting has become practical enough to be applied towards operational crop yield reporting. The Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF) is one of such modelling tool that designed to provide regional and national crop yield outlooks during and shortly after the growing season. The CCYF integrates climate, remote sensing and other earth observation information (e.g., historical yields, soil and crop maps) using a physical based soil moisture budget model and a statistical based yield forecasting model. One of the major challenges for CCYF and many other EO-based crop yield forecasting systems is to determine a proper spatial modelling scale that could be easily aggregated to various required yield reporting units, yet still retain the statistical sensitivity of crop yield to variations in climate, soil and remote sensing vegetation indices. In this study, we have compared yield modelling using CCYF at three different administrative scales, i.e. township, Census Agricultural Regions (CARs) and province for four crops (spring wheat, canola, corn and soybeans) in the agricultural regions of Manitoba, Canada. Due to the shorter available historical yield records at the township scale, different modelling scheme is applied for township scale modelling compared to the other two larger scales. The modelling at provincial scale did not capture the yield variability, while the modelling at CAR level provided reasonable results for some CARs while failed for others. The modelling at township scale captured most of the yield variability, yet its performance and implementation is restricted by the availability of the yield data at this scale.",

            "abstract": "The presence of natural and synthetic estrogens in treated wastewater used for irrigation of agricultural fields poses a potential risk to surface water ecosystems. While a large number of recent studies have investigated the occurrence, fate, and transport of estrogens in the environment, the vast majority of these studies have focused on the fate of estrogens in streams and rivers. However, no studies have been conducted assessing the occurrence, persistence, and fate of estrogens in impacted sensitive aquatic ecosystems such as vernal pools. This is of particular importance because vernal pools serve as critical breeding habitat for amphibians, which are known to be sensitive to the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds. A spray irrigation system was implemented over 50 years ago at Penn State’s “Living Filter” as an alternative to discharging treated wastewater to a high quality trout stream. This system introduces all of Penn State’s treated wastewater onto approximately 250 ha of agricultural and forested land at a rate of ~5 cm/ha/week. More than a dozen vernal pools are impacted by this wastewater irrigation, with some ponds adjacent to irrigation laterals receiving direct inputs of the treated wastewater. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of these weekly irrigation activities on the occurrence, persistence, and fate of estrogens (17α- and 17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, and ethinylestradiol) in 3 vernal pools during an 8-week field study. The spring 2015 study period coincided with wood frog breeding and metamorphosis. Irrigation wastewater was collected weekly and water samples near the sediment-water interface in each vernal pool were collected daily. Real-time monitoring stations continuously recorded the temperature, pH, redox potential, DO, EC, and water level at each pool. Nearly 100% of the daily samples (n>130) collected contained estrogens, and the concentrations were several times higher compared to the wastewater. Additionally, the data suggest transformation of estrone back to 17α- and 17β-estradiol potentially due to anaerobic conditions in the vernal pools. This unique field study suggests that more research is needed to quantify the potential impact of estrogenic activity on amphibians, particularly during the critical metamorphosis period.",

Several questions remain unanswered, such as: I) How the ionospheric ions plasma impact the global structure of the magnetosphere. II) What are the energisation processes of that plasma and where they operate (plasma sheet, ring currents). III) What fraction of the supplied plasma returns to the ionosphere and with what properties after a journey in the magnetosphere; etc. Here, we use a spherical symmetric ionospheric model (International reference ionosphere IRI-2007) that we merge with 3D PIC EM Global code to simulate Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Our aim is to investigate the time-dependent content and dynamics of the 3D magnetosphere in response to thermal ions plasma supply from the ionosphere. Following a comprehensive approach, in this first step, we do not consider chemical reactions nor any feedback from the magnetosphere into the ionosphere. Our newly developed 3D PIC model has a finer grid size (0.1-0.2 RE), a H+ to electron mass ratio of up to 100, includes Earth gravity and tilt of the dipole field. Most importantly, the new tool has the capability to consider distinct species with different masses and charges and to follow them in time separately in the simulation box. We present our first results for the content and dynamics of the magnetosphere following H+ and O+ supply from the ionosphere in the conditions of northern IMF of the solar wind.",

However, the mechanisms for which this deeply sequestered carbon was released, and the relative importance it played in the history of atmospheric CO2 prior to the LGM, remain subjects of debate. Here, we present new redox-sensitive trace metal records from the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean that provide an unprecedented reconstruction of transient changes in deep ocean oxygenation and, by inference, respired carbon storage throughout the last glacial cycle. Our results show that respired carbon was removed from the abyssal Southern Ocean during the northern hemisphere cold phases of the deglaciation, when atmospheric CO2 rose rapidly, due to a combination of dwindling iron fertilization by dust and enhanced deep ocean ventilation. Furthermore, our new records show that the correlation between atmospheric CO2 and abyssal Southern Ocean oxygenation was maintained throughout most of the prior 80 kyrs, consistent with a unifying role of the Southern Ocean through a coupled control on deep ocean circulation and iron fertilization.

The South Georgia Basin also lies at the center of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). It is thus an excellent location to examine the importance of magmatism and pre-existing structures on continental extension.\nHere we present preliminary results from the SUwanee Suture and GA Rift basin (SUGAR) project, an active-source seismic refraction project to image the crustal structure across these features. In March 2014, we acquired data along SUGAR Line 1, a ~325-km-long, NW-SE oriented profile that crossed the Suwanee Suture and western part of South Georgia Basin. The profile was densely instrumented with 1193 single-channel RekTek 125A seismographs (“Texans”) spaced at ~250 m. The sources were 100 to 1800 lb shots spaced at ~20-50 km. In August 2015, we will acquire data along SUGAR Lines 2 and 3. SUGAR Line 2 is a ~450-km-long profile spanning the eastern part of the South Georgia Basin and two possible locations for the Suwanee Suture. We will deploy 1983 “Texans” spaced at 250 m and detonate seventeen 400 to 1600 lb shots spaced at ~16-50 km. SUGAR Line 3 targets the Brunswick magnetic anomaly; we plan to instrument a 100-km-long profile with 700 Texans spaced at 150 m and eleven 200 lb shots spaced at ~10 km. Over 68 students participated in field work for SUGAR.\nPreliminary models of SUGAR Line 1 indicate that the crust thins to ~33 km beneath the South Georgia Basin. Anomalously high lower crustal velocities occur beneath the basin in the area of the greatest crustal thinning and may represent mafic intrusions from CAMP/synrift magmatism. We will present initial velocity models of Lines 1 and 2 and discuss their implications for along-strike variations in the style of rifting, the volume and distribution of magmatism, and the location of the suture and its control on later tectonic and magmatic events.",

To quantify GW-SW interactions, existing methods are mainly based on the analytical solution of one-dimensional heat transport equation. However, the assumptions therein are usually violated in practical applications. Furthermore, there are relatively limited experimental sandbox studies regarding heat tracer for complicated GW-SW interactions. In this study, we developed a data assimilation method to quantify the GW-SW interaction in the presence of heterogeneous river bed. A numerical simulator was used to solve the groundwater and heat transport equation. Then the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was employed to assimilate the temperature data to quantify the unknown interactions (velocity field) between GW-SW and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field. The validity of this method was verified by both numerical simulation and sandbox experiment for different scenarios.",

            "abstract": "This study utilizes both chirp sonar images and coring results to investigate the unstable seafloor strata east of the Fangliao Submarine Canyon offshore southwestern Taiwan. We have constructed 3D chirp sonar images from a densely surveyed block to trace the attitude of an acoustic transparent layer and features caused by fluid activities. Based on the distribution of this transparent layer and fluid-related features, we suggest that this transparent layer forms a pathway for fluid migration which induces fluid-related characters such as acoustic blanking and fluid chimneys in the 3D chirp sonar images. Cored seafloor samples are used in this study to investigate the sediment compositions. The 210Pb activity profiles of the cores show oscillating and unsteady values at about 20~25 cm from core top. The bulk densities of the core samples in the same section (about 20~25 cm from core top) give values lower than those at deeper parts of the cores. These results indicate that the water content is much higher in the shallow sediments than in the deeper strata. From core sample analyses, we deduce that the local sediments are disturbed by liquefaction. From the analyses of 3D chirp sonar images and core data, we suggest that the seafloor east of the Fangliao Submarine Canyon is in an unstable condition, if disturbed by earthquakes, submarine landslides and gravity flows could be easily triggered and cause some geohazards, like breaking submarine cables during the 2006 Pingtung earthquake event.",

            "abstract": "Mermaids are floating seismometers. The first generation used Argo floats developed for oceanographers to measure temperature and salinity. The Mermaids drift under water at about the speed of USArray and share with USArray the ability to cover a large surface. They record teleseismic P waves for events above magnitude 6.5 under noisy conditions (Indian Ocean), well below magnitude 6 under mild conditions (Mediterranean, Pacific). There are occasional recordings of PKP and PP waves. Local events can be seen down to magnitude 2. They are a perfect, low expensive and maintainable modern tool to fill the gap for monitoring the ocean. Ten mermaids have been launched May 2014 near the Galapagos to provide seismic information for deep tomography of the plume, whereas three of the Mermaids in the Mediterranean are currently being deployed/redeployed in the Ligurian Sea. These are the first launches with a purely scientific goal (as opposed to 8 earlier test deployments). Using the experience with the first fleet of prototypes, a new version is being developed. These are long-lived (five years), reach deeper (3000 m), multidisciplinary (up to eight instruments). The basic model also provides temperature and salinity data to facilitate co-financing with oceanography. In a more advanced version, it will be fully programmable by the scientist using them, and will have the ability to adapt software during missions using two-way satellite communication. If deployed in a dense array (e.g. rapid response) they obtain relative locations by sending out chirp signals between each other, surfacing from time to time for data transmission and to obtain a location and drift via GPS. They will have a \"landing\" capability to stay at location and monitor aftershocks while surfacing regularly for data transmission. For solo drifters, a magnetometer and a bathymetry sounder will assist in constraining the trajectory at depth.\nThe first tests of seaworthiness of this second generation Mermaid have taken place, and a version for seismologists will be available early in 2016. Software development of the more advanced features is still under way.",

            "abstract": "We present a method to estimate the uncertainties in remote-sensing wind measurements of planetary atmospheres. Many planetary missions have measured atmospheric wind speeds by tracking the movements of the clouds. One of the common cloud-tracking methods used today is the two-dimensional Correlation Imaging Velocimetry (CIV) technique, which returns a two-dimensional wind vector field from a pair of images taken at two different times. The CIV algorithm computes a wind vector by calculating the two-dimensional correlation between the pair of maps; a peak in the correlation is judged to be a match. For zonal wind measurements, error bars can be represented by the zonal standard deviation of the wind vectors; while this serves as an indicator of the overall quality of the wind field, it does not address the quality of the individual vectors. Furthermore, the zonal standard deviation contains contributions from both real spatial variations in the wind speed as well as uncertainty in the measurements. This raises a difficulty in distinguishing small, real changes in the wind field from the uncertainties in the measurement. We have developed a technique which isolates real spatial variations from measurement uncertainties by analyzing the correlation fields produced in the CIV algorithm. We determine the size, shape, and orientation of the peak by fitting an ellipse to the peak and calculating the area, eccentricity, and orientation angle of the ellipse. Combining these metrics provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with individual wind vectors. Vectors with smaller, sharper, more circular peaks will have a smaller uncertainty than vectors with larger, flatter, more elliptical peaks. We use our new technique to make zonal wind measurements of Saturn using Cassini ISS images taken between 2004 and 2014. Our measurements reveal small temporal changes in the zonal wind profiles.

            "abstract": "In August 2014 segmented lateral dyke growth has been observed in a rifting event at Bardarbunga volcanic system, Iceland. The temporal evolution of the magma source and the physical nature of magma flow process during dyke propagation and arrest are unclear. The epidemic-type aftershock sequence model has been used to detect fluid signals in seismicity data. We use the earthquake catalog recorded during the rifting event to reconstruct the magma flow signal at the feeding source of the dyke. We find that the segmentation of dyke growth is caused by a pulsating nature of the magma flow source. We identify two main magma flow pulses, which initiate and propagate the two main segments of the dyke. During phases of dyke arrest magma flow pulses are low and cannot further propagate the dyke. We use the reconstructed magma flow signal to set up a numerical model of non-linear magma pressure diffusion. By using the magma pressure changes resulting from magma flow, we simulate the earthquake catalog caused by the reduction of the effective principal stress. We observe an excellent agreement between the spatio-temporal characteristics of the simulated earthquake catalog and recorded seismicity. Our results suggest that the process of magma pressure relaxation can be described as a non-linear diffusion process. Because the opening of the dyke creates significant new fracture volume, the permeability of the rock is strongly increasing and the diffusion process becomes highly non-linear. Our analysis is based on lessons learned from analysis of seismicity observed during hydraulic fracturing of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Despite large differences in scale, the underlying physical processes are comparable. Finally, we analyze the decay of seismic activity after start of the effusive fissure eruption near the end of the dyke. The magma flow strongly decreases and seismic activity decays according to Omori’s law, which describes the decay of aftershock activity after tectonic earthquakes. Nevertheless, we find that the earthquakes are triggered by the still ongoing process of magma pressure diffusion and not by stress transfer caused by the occurrence of preceding seismic events. Our results provide valuable insights into the nature of magma flow processes, which drive dyke propagation and associated earthquakes.",

Wintertime soil respiration of CO2 has been estimated to significantly contribute to the carbon budget, but CO2 must first diffuse through the snowpack before being released to the atmosphere. The snowpack is not homogeneous; the structure varies both in space and in time, which can have profound impacts on the snow diffusivity. Former assessments of gas flux in seasonal snow apply empirical relations based on single, fixed conditions, which limits the accuracy of the assessment results. In this presentation we report on laboratory measurements through snow and firn samples that have various metamorphic properties. Diffusion coefficients determined from the measurements are used to investigate the impact of layering and inhomogeneous structure on diffusion rates on larger scales, through multidimensional numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "This study proposes a method to develop efficient operational policies for a reservoir the southern Chile. The main water uses in this system are hydropower and irrigation, with conflicting seasonal demands. The conflict between these two uses is currently managed through a so-called “irrigation agreement” which defines a series of operational conditions on the reservoir by restricting volumes used for power production depending on reservoir storage level. Other than that, the reservoir operation is driven by cost-minimization over the power grid.\nRecent evidence shows an increasing degree of conflict in this basin, which suggests that the static approach of irrigation agreements, might no longer be appropriate. Moreover, this agreement could be revised in light of decreased water availability. This problem poses a challenge related to the spatial scope of analysis. Thus, irrigation benefits are driven by decisions made within the basin, whereas hydropower benefits depend on the operation of the entire power grid. Exploring the tradeoffs between these two water uses involves modeling both scales.\nThe proposed methodology integrates information from both a grid-wide power operations model and a basin-wide agro-economic model into a decision model for optimal reservoir operation. The first model, a hydrothermal coordination tool, schedules power production by each plant in the grid, and allows capturing technical and economic aspects to the operation of hydropower reservoirs. The agro-economic model incorporates economic features of irrigation in the basin, and allows obtaining irrigation water demand functions. Finally, the results of both models are integrated into a single model for optimal reservoir operation considering the tradeoffs between the two uses.\nThe result of the joint operation of water resources, show a flexible coordination of uses, revealing the opportunity cost of irrigation, which it gives the possibility of negotiating transfers of water to hydropower in dry years, with the aim of obtaining greater benefits from water use in the basin",

With a view to developing techniques for remote fluid monitoring using magnetic properties, we have examined the correlation between the corrosion properties of NEO-magnets and related changes in the magnetic properties of the alloy with fluid chemistry and crystal-chemical changes of the Na-bentonite matrix.\nBatch experiments comprised fragments of NEO-magnets with deionised water, saline and alkaline solution both in the presence and absence of MX-80 bentonite, and were performed in sealed vessels for durations of up to 5 months at 70°C. This study combined PXRD, thermomagnetic and hysteresis analysis to demonstrate how progressive hydrogenation of the main magnetic phase led to a maximum loss of remanence and coercitivity and increasing Curie temperature in the samples reacted with deionised water with the samples reacted in saline and alkaline solutions showing smaller changes. Semi-quantitative analysis allowed comparison of the Curie temperatures with crystal-chemical parameters. This reveals a clear positive correlation of increasing lattice parameters a and c (and cell volume) with mean hydrogens per unit formula and the Curie temperature of the product NdFeB hydrides. Precipitation of Nd and Fe hydrides/oxyhydroxides is also demonstated by the PXRD data.\nA crucial role is played by the transformations occurring to the smectite matrix, in particular by the cation exchange in the interlayer, which causes precipitation of highly charged K- and Ca-smectites.\nThis study demonstrates how NEO-magnets are capable of detecting water saturation in the EBS, and that the NdFeB corrosion properties are strongly controlled by the initial fluid composition and presence / absence of the bentonite matrix.",

            "abstract": "Global aerosol models and observations differ strongly in their spatio-temporal sampling. Model results are typical of large gridboxes (200 by 200 km), while observations are made over much smaller areas (e.g. 10 by 10 km for MODIS, even smaller for ground sites). Model results are always available in contrast to observations that are intermittent due to orbital constraints, retrieval limitations and instrument failure/maintenance. These twin issues of temporal sampling and spatial aggregation are relevant for any observation, be it remotely sensed, or in-situ. We ask this question: will a perfect model agree with perfect observations? The short answer is: unlikely.\nUsing two different modelling frame-works (year-long global model runs collocated with actual observations and month-long high resolution regional models runs) we show that significant errors can be introduced in a model to observation comparison due to different spatio-temporal sampling. These sampling errors are typically larger than observational errors and are of comparable size as true model errors. While the temporal sampling issue can be dealt with by properly resampling model data to observation times, the spatial aggregation issue introduces noise into the comparison. We propose and evaluate several strategies for mitigating this noise.\nThe most succesfull strategy is further temporal averaging of the data. However, this seems to have a less benefical effect on surface in-situ observations than on remotely sensed column-integrated measurements. For instance, monthly averaged black carbon mass concentrations measured at ground sites still allow significant (~ 30%) noise into the comparison. Furthermore, flight campaign data, by its nature, are not open to long-term (monthly, yearly) averaging and allow sampling errors of 50% or more in black carbon mass concentrations. Other observables (AOT, extinction profiles, number densities, PM2.5, CCN) will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In this work we evaluate a method to estimate systematic errors of individual in-situ observations. The approach is based on parameter estimation using an augmented state in an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Biased observations are assimilated in the highly chaotic Lorenz (2005) model that combines small and large scales. For this purpose, synthetic observations are created by introducing a grid-point dependent bias and random errors to a nature run (truth). The sensitivity of the methodology to model error, the number of ensemble members, the number of parameters, and the parameter variance is evaluated.\nResults demonstrate that the methodology is able to estimate observation bias for a both a perfect model and an imperfect model if the model error is estimated. The parameter estimation and the rms errors are significantly deteriorated if model error is ignored. Errors are qualitatively independent of model forcing when model error is estimated. By contrast, parameter estimation depends on model error when model error is not estimated, especially if observation biases are estimated. Errors increase with the number of estimated parameters, but they are independent of ensemble size as long as the number of ensembles members is large enough. There is an optimum value of parameter variance that minimizes the errors and improves the parameter estimation, but this value depends on observation bias and model error. Overall, the results suggest more accuracy in observation bias estimates than model error estimates.",

            "abstract": "The distinction between biotic and abiotic control on microbialites formation and its signatures is relevant since stromatolites are considered the oldest evidence for life on Earth and a target for astrobiological research. The Laguna Negra is a shallow hypersaline lake placed at the Andes, Northwest Argentina, where carbonate microbialites and microbial mats develop. It is a unique system where microbial influence on carbonate precipitation and potential preserved biosignatures in the microbialites can be studied. Here we compare three distinct microbialites systems: carbonate laminar crusts with no visible microbial mats, stromatolites and dm-size oncoids, both related with different microbial mats. Our goal is to unravel the biotic controls on their formation, and the biosignatures there recorded.\nLaminar crusts are composed of stacked regular and isopachous carbonate lamina. Oncoids laminae are typically characterized by irregular hybrid micro-textures, composed of alternating micritic and botryoidal laminae, and the stromatolites are mostly composed by irregular micritic laminae. Sulfur isotopes of carbonate associated sulphate show similar values but they show differences in the pyrite sulfur isotopes suggesting differences in the fractionation degree, possibly related to sulphate reducing bacteria and variable sulphate reservoirs in the case of stromatolites and oncoids. δ13C fractionation between organic carbon and carbonates suggests photosynthesis, but other metabolisms cannot yet be discarded. 16S rDNA data of the microbial communities associated with the carbonate structures indicate the presence of these taxonomic groups and those that are known to influence carbonate precipitation, particularly in the stromatolites associated microbial community.\nOur data indicate significant differences between the three systems in terms of stable isotopes, textures and associated microbial diversity, suggesting a microbial control on stromatolites and oncoids formation in the Laguna Negra. Further studies may provide a valuable contribution on biosignatures preservation and recognition that can shed light on understanding the early biosphere record.",

            "abstract": "Many seismic events are only picked up by seismometers but the only earthquakes that really interest the public (and the authorities) are those which are felt by the population. It is not a magnitude issue only; even a small magnitude earthquake, if widely felt can create a public desire for information.\nIn LastQuake, felt events are automatically discriminated through the reactions of the population on the Internet. It uses three different and complementary methods. Twitter Earthquake detection, initially developed by the USGS, detects surges in the number of tweets containing the word “earthquake” in different languages. Flashsourcing, developed by EMSC, detects traffic surges caused by eyewitnesses on its website – one of the top global earthquake information websites. Both detections happen typically within 2 minutes of an event’s occurrence. Finally, an earthquake is also confirmed as being felt when at least 3 independent felt reports (questionnaires) are collected.\nLastQuake automatically merges seismic data, direct (crowdsourced) and indirect eyewitnesses’ contributions, damage scenarios and tsunami alerts to provide information on felt earthquakes and their effects in a time ranging from a few tens of seconds to 90 minutes. It is based on visual communication to erase language hurdles, for instance, it crowdsources felt reports through simple cartoons as well as geo-located pics. It was massively adopted in Nepal within hours of the Gorkha earthquake and collected thousands of felt reports and more than 100 informative pics.\nLastQuake is also a seismic risk reduction tools thanks to its very rapid information. When such information does not exist, people tend to call emergency services, crowds emerge and rumors spread. In its next release, LastQuake will also have “do/don’t do” cartoons popping up after an earthquake to encourage appropriate behavior.",

            "abstract": "The large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) observed in the lowermost mantle represent anomalously dense bodies, which may have been formed as a consequence of solidification of a basal magma ocean [Labrosse et al., 2007 Nature; Nomura et al., 2011 Nature]. Recent melting experiments have demonstrated that 1) MgSiO3-rich perovskite (bridgmanite) is the first phase to crystallize from melts with a wide range of (Mg+Fe)/Si ratios in the middle to deep lower mantle and 2) iron is preferentially partitioned into melt rather than solid [Tateno et al., 2014 JGR], suggesting that melts evolve towards an FeO-rich and SiO2-poor composition upon crystallization. However, the mineral assemblage and chemical composition of LLSVPs still remain largely uncertain. Here we carried out melting experiments at both shallow and deep lower mantle pressures using a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC), in order to examine the melting phase equilibria in the MgO-FeO-SiO2 ternary system. A focused ion beam (FIB) and field-emission-type electron microprobe (FE-EPMA) were used for textural and chemical characterization of samples recovered from the DAC. They exhibited a melting texture with quenched partial melt at the hottest part and one or two solid phases at its outside. Our result demonstrate that a crystallizing solid assemblage changes from bridgmanite, bridgmanite + (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase, SiO2 seifertite + FeO-rich (Mg,Fe)O magnesiowüstite, and to seifertite + FeO upon fractional crystallization from a pyrolitic melt at the core-mantle boundary pressure. These also suggest that a residual melt left after extensive solidification is strongly enrich in FeO and thus exceedingly heavy and stable at the base of the mantle, which possibly represents an ultralow velocity zone (ULVZ).",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the regional variability of the impacts of the autoconversion rate on the warm clouds simulated by a global cloud system-resolving model (GCSRM). To investigate the impact, two types of autoconversion schemes i.e., Berry [1968] and Khairoutdinov and Kogan [2000] were tested for a single moment bulk microphysical scheme in GCSRM. The former scheme, which has been used in General Circulation Model (GCM), has larger autoconversion rate. The latter, originally developed for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model, has smaller autoconversion rate. Results of the sensitivity experiments indicate that liquid water path (LWP) simulated by the Khairoutdinov and Kogan [2000] scheme is larger than that simulated by the Berry [1968] scheme, and the slow autoconversion of Khairoutdinov and Kogan [2000] improves the underestimation of the LWP simulated by the Berry [1968]. The detailed analyses of the results clarify that the improvement is mainly shown over the regions where the lower tropospheric static stability (LTSS) is higher than 12 K and the cloud droplet effective radius is smaller than other regions. This indicates that the scheme of Berry [1968] overestimates the autoconversion rate of small cloud droplets, which constitute shallow clouds existing below sharp inversion of potential temperature. This is due to the smaller dependency of the autoconversion rate of Berry [1968] on the cloud droplet size than inferred from satellite observations that tend to be better represented by the Khairoutdinov and Kogan [2000] scheme. These results demonstrate that such a process-oriented type of information is useful to improve the autoconversion and accretion parameterizations in GCMs.",

However, the use of this approach to retrieve crustal body waves has seen less widespread use. While some studies (e.g., Zhan et al. 2010, Poli et al. 2012) have successfully recovered phases over a few hundred kilometers on continental shields, crustal body waves are not yet seen routinely over longer distances and in more structurally complex regions. In this study, we investigate the recovery of crustal body waves in the continental USA using stacked cross-correlations. The data for correlation was gathered over three to five years of continuous recording on an east-to-west line of USArray stations spanning the northern USA. Specifically, we study four parameters to determine which combination of processing produces the most robust crustal body wave estimates in this geologic setting: 1) the role of the total amount of data; 2) the impact of different processes for selecting which correlation traces are to be used or discarded from the final stacks; 3) the recoverability of waves in different directional components of the data; and 4) the geographic region of data collection. We are able to recover short period crustal S-wave phases at as far as 1500 kilometer interstation distances, which will provide unique information for future tomography models.",

LUC can also directly impact the emission and deposition of important reactive trace gases, altering the oxidative chemistry of the atmosphere and subsequently air quality and climate. Large-scale tree mortality as a result of insects and disease may therefore have unexplored feedbacks on atmospheric chemistry. Between 2013 and 2027, over 80 million acres of treed land in the United States is predicted to experience basal area mortality rates exceeding 25%. We harmonized the description of land cover across the relevant surface-atmosphere exchange processes in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to facilitate LUC simulations, and used this adapted model to test the impact of projected tree mortality according to the 2012 USDA National Insect and Disease Risk Assessment. Nation-wide biogenic VOC emissions were reduced by 5%, with local impacts approaching 50% in some regions. By themselves, these emission reductions resulted in lower surface-level O3 mixing ratios, but this was counteracted by decreases in the O3 deposition velocity (by up to 10%) due to the reduction in vegetation density. Organic aerosol mass concentrations were also significantly affected across the United States, decreasing by 5-10% across the eastern U.S. and the northwest, with local impacts exceeding 25% in some regions. We discuss the general impacts on air quality in clean and polluted regions of the US, and point to developments needed for a more robust understanding of land cover change feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Corn farms in the Philippines are rainfed farms, hence, it is of utmost importance to choose the start of planting date so that the critical growth stages that are in need of water will fall on dates when there is rain. Most farmers in the Philippines use superstitions and traditions as basis for farming decisions such as when to start planting [1]. Before climate change, superstitions like planting after a feast day of a saint has worked for them but with the recent progression of climate change, farmers now recognize that there is a need for technological intervention [1]. The application discussed in this paper presents a solution that makes use of meteorological station sensors, localized seasonal climate forecast, localized weather forecast and a crop simulation model to provide recommendations to farmers based on the crop cultivar, soil type and fertilizer type used by farmers. It is critical that the recommendations given to farmers are not generic as each farmer would have different needs based on their cultivar, soil, fertilizer, planting schedule and even location [2]. This application allows the farmer to inquire about whether it will rain in the next seven days, the best date to start planting based on the potential yield upon harvest, when to apply fertilizer and by how much, when to water and by how much. Short messaging service (SMS) is the medium chosen for this application because while mobile penetration in the Philippines is as high as 101%, the smart phone penetration is only at 15% [3]. SMS has been selected as it has been identified as the most effective way of reaching farmers with timely agricultural information and knowledge [4,5]. The recommendations while derived from making use of Automated Weather Station (AWS) sensor data, Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) models and DSSAT 4.5 [9], are translated into the local language of the farmers and in a format that is easily understood as recommended in [6,7,8]. A pilot study has been started in May 2015 and the harvest of this pilot season will be September 2015.",

In our current interglacial situation, the global shelf area is 27 million km2 compared to 8 million km2 under fully glacial conditions, where more than 80% of the previously inundated area gets drained. The change between inundation and drainage of the shelves not only allows or blocks ambient air access to sediments within the drainable range of the shelf wedge, but it also has long-range effects on the terrestrial water tables and both, terrestrial and shelf erosion patterns. We use a forward model driven by sea level change to assess the effect of inundation and drainage on carbon release from shelves and on global CO2 levels. We identify a previously unrecognized mechanism that may cause global scale CO2 release in low sea level situations. This mechanism is consistent with the \"mystery interval\" addition of ∂14C depleted carbon around 14.6 ka and it might explain the steep late glacial rise in CO2 that seems to be very hard to model with the current constraints.",

            "abstract": "Formic acid (HFo) and acetic acid (HAc) have both natural and anthropogenic sources and a role in the atmospheric processing of carbon. These organic acids also have an increasing importance in setting the acidity of rain and snow as precipitation nitrate and sulfate concentrations have decreased. Primary emissions for both organic acids include biomass burning, agriculture, and motor vehicle emissions. Secondary production is also a substantial source for both acids especially from biogenic precursors, secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), and photochemical production from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs). Chemical transport models underestimate organic acid concentrations and recent research has sought to develop additional production mechanisms. Here we report HFo and HAc measurements during two campaigns over Colorado using the peroxide chemical ionization mass spectrometer (PCIMS). Iodide clusters of both HFo and HAc were recorded at mass-to-charge ratios of 173 and 187, respectively. The PCIMS was flown aboard the NCAR Gulfstream-V platform during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment (DC3) and aboard the NCAR C-130 during the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE). The DC3 observations were made in May and June 2012 extending from the surface to 13 km over the central and eastern United States. FRAPPE observations were made in July and August 2014 from the surface to 7 km over Colorado. DC3 measurements reported here are focused over the Colorado Front Range and complement the FRAPPE observations. DC3 HFo altitude profiles are characterized by a decrease up to 6 km followed by an increase either back to boundary layer mixing ratio values or higher (a “C” shape). Organic acid measurements from both campaigns are interpreted with an emphasis on emission sources (both natural and anthropogenic) over Colorado and in situ photochemical production especially ozone precursors.",

            "abstract": "Evolved rocks like trachyte occur as minor components of many plume-related basaltic ocean islands (e.g. Hawaii, Gran Canaria, Azores, Réunion), and are typically interpreted as products of extreme fractional crystallization from broadly basaltic magmas. Trachytes from Mauritius (Indian Ocean) suggest otherwise. Here, 6.8 Ma nepheline-bearing trachytes (SiO2 ~63%, Na2O + K2O ~12%) are enriched in all incompatible elements except Ba, Sr and Eu, which show prominent negative anomalies. Initial eNd values cluster at 4.03 ± 0.15 (n = 13), near the lower end of the range for Mauritian basalts (eNd = 3.70 – 5.75), but initial Sr is highly variable (ISr = 0.70408 – 0.71034) suggesting secondary deuteric alteration. Fractional crystallization models starting with a basaltic parent fail, because when plagioclase joins olivine in the crystallizing assemblage, residual liquids become depleted in Al2O3, produce no nepheline, and do not approach trachytic compositions. Mauritian basalts and trachytes do not fall near the ends of known miscibility gaps, eliminating liquid immiscibility processes. Partial melting of extant gabbroic bodies, either from the oceanic crust or from Réunion plume-related magmas should yield quartz-saturated melts different from the critically undersaturated Mauritian trachytes. A remaining possibility is that the trachytes represent direct, small-degree partial melts of fertile, perhaps metasomatized mantle. This is supported by the presence of trachytic glasses in many mantle xenoliths, and experimental results show that low-degree trachytic melts can be produced from mantle peridotites even under anhydrous conditions. If some feldspar is left behind as a residual phase, this would account for the negative Ba, Sr and Eu anomalies observed in Mauritian trachytes. Two trachyte samples that are less depleted in these elements contain xenocrysts of anorthoclase, Al-rich cpx and Cl-rich kaersutite that are out of equilibrium with host trachyte magmas; these may represent fragments of a refertilized mantle source. A model of direct, low-degree partial melting of metasomatized mantle may apply to other worldwide examples of evolved rocks in ocean islands.",

            "abstract": "High spatial resolution maps from the IBEX mission (McComas et al, Science, 2009) suggest the presence of “fine structure” in the signal from beyond the termination shock. That is, areas of enhanced ENA emission that span less than a degree in the IBEX sky map. If confirmed, this would suggest very concentrated areas of emission from sources with scales of a few AU embedded in the outer heliosphere (or proportionally larger if they are located beyond the heliopause). This, in turn, would require the presence of unanticipated structures (plasma or neutral) beyond the termination shock for which the physics is poorly defined. It is therefore crucial to confirm the presence of these structures through careful analysis, or to establish the detection limits if the data taken to date is not sufficient for such a confirmation.\nIn this work, we use 5 years worth of IBEX data to examine the statistical significance of these enhancements. We examine correlations in time, ENA energy and coincidence type for evidence of these small-scale spatial structures. Then, using the known spatial response of the IBEX instrument, establish the conditions under which such structure, if present, would be detectable. This detection threshold analysis is fully applicable future measurements, such as those planned for IMAP.",

            "abstract": "In the tropical Andes, glacial meltwater is an important water resource for downstream communities, especially during the dry season. Due to climate change, glacial retreat is accelerating and straining already limited water resources in the region. It is hypothesized that groundwater storage and discharge will play a critical role in sustaining future river flows. To improve our understanding of the hydrologic fluxes in proglacial valleys of the tropical Andes, we monitored a ~1.2 km reach of the Quilcayhuanca River, in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, using a high resolution infrared (IR) camera and in-stream temperature sensors. We positioned the IR camera on the southern valley wall, 96 m above the valley floor, and collected >700 IR images at 10 minute intervals over 5 days. We deployed 40 temperature sensors along the stream at ~25 m intervals and 10 sensors at additional control points throughout the surrounding valley, recording temperature at 10 minute intervals. Groundwater temperature was recorded in 6 wells in the study area. The reach had diurnal temperature fluctuations from ~4 to 13°C, but did not exhibit large longitudinal temperature differences. Stream temperature profiles within the water column show stream water is well mixed, improving the ability of the IR camera to accurately observe the stream temperature at this research site. Temperature sensors in 4 reach tributaries recorded warmer temperatures than the main channel. The daily temperatures of one tributary fluctuated within the range of the groundwater temperature (~9 to 11°C), while another tributary exhibited a range of ~18°C. A weather station in the study area recorded climate data (air temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) at 10 minute intervals. We used this field data as input for a spatial and temporal energy balance model of the reach. Our model demonstrates the utility of IR imagery to monitor stream temperatures and improves our understanding of energy fluxes in this proglacial stream.",

Loss of sea ice is leading to development of oil and gas extraction activities and increased shipping in the Arctic. Arctic aerosol emissions are expected to increase with increasing anthropogenic activities and production of sea spray aerosol. These particles have significant climate effects, including interacting with radiation, forming cloud droplets and ice crystals, and depositing onto surfaces. Given the complexity and evolving nature of atmospheric particles, as well as the challenges associated with Arctic measurements, significant uncertainties remain in our understanding of particle sources, evolution, and impacts in the Arctic. To investigate the size and chemistry of individual particles in real-time, an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) was deployed to Barrow, Alaska during August-September 2015. Parallel size-resolved number concentration measurements allow the quantification of number and mass concentrations of particles from various sources, including sea spray aerosol, biomass burning, and diesel combustion, for example.",

            "abstract": "Accuracy and reliability of hydrological modeling studies heavily depend on quality and availability of precipitation estimates. Difficulties in representation of high rainfall variability over mountainous areas using ground based sensors make satellite remote sensing techniques attractive for hydrologic studies over these regions. Even though satellite-based rainfall measurements are quasi global and available at high spatial resolution, these products have uncertainties that necessitate use of error characterization and correction procedures based upon more accurate in situ rainfall measurements, such as those obtained during experimental studies with research radars. This study evaluates rainfall estimates from passive microwave (PMW) sensors onboard different earth orbiting platforms based on high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall estimates derived from dual-polarization X-band radar (XPOL) observations during various field experiments in US and the Mediterranean region. The study first conducts independent error analysis of the XPOL using independent in situ observations from rain gauges and disdrometers. Subsequently, coincident XPOL and PMW rainfall estimates are matched in space and time for a number of convective and stratiform type precipitation events. Matching is conducted for different time intervals to determine the time lag between PMW measurement and XPOL as well as different spatial resolution. Standard GPROF PMW retrievals on SSM/I, TMI (2A12), GPM-DPR and CNR-ISAC PMW products for SSMIS and AMSU/MHS are used to conduct the error analysis. All coincident XPOL data are extracted for the indicated overpasses to produce the satellite field-of-view averages for the orbital PMW sensor and produce match-ups of PMW/XPOL rainfall and raindrop size distribution parameters. We will present error analysis results of PMW rainfall estimation and investigate dependences on precipitation type, vertical structure and precipitation microphysics (derived from XPOL).",

The photo-oxidation of glyoxal leads to the rapid production of peroxy radicals and condensable products, which are expected to result in formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).\nWe report new measurements of glyoxal in the tropical marine boundary layer, which were made using laser-induced phosphorescence (LIP) spectroscopy at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory in June and August-September 2014 during the Ocean Reactive Carbon: Chemistry-Climate impacts (ORC3) campaign. The measurement site is marked by an absence of coastal features such as extensive shallows or large seaweed beds, and receives clean, well-processed marine air more than 95 % of the time, with minimal influence from local effects.\nMaximum glyoxal mixing ratios of ~15 ppt were observed during the ORC3 campaigns, with typical daytime maxima of ~ 5-6 ppt during June and ~ 6-8 ppt during August-September, and nighttime minima of ~ 4 ppt and ~4-5 ptt during June and August-September, respectively.\nThis presentation will summarise these new measurements of glyoxal, in conjunction with box model simulations using the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM). Simulations are constrained to observations of glyoxal precursors, and are used to investigate the sources and sinks of glyoxal in the tropical marine boundary layer.\nModel calculations significantly underestimate the observed abundances of glyoxal, indicating the need for additional sources in the model. A number of possible scenarios will be discussed to explain the discrepancy between the measurements and the model.",

Here, we review organic biogeochemistry proprieties and isotopic fingerprinting of C1-C5 alkanes to address this problem. For instance, the concentration ratios of CH4 to C2-C5 alkanes can be used to distinguish between thermogenic and microbial generated CH4. Together C and H isotopes of CH4 are used to differentiate bacterial generated sources and thermogenic CH4 and may also identify processes such as alteration and source mixing. Carbon isotope ratios pattern of C1-C5 alkanes highlight sources and oxidation processes in the gas reservoirs. Stable carbon isotope measurements are a viable tool for monitoring the degradation progress of methane and light hydrocarbons. The carbon isotope ratios of the reactants and products are independent of the concentration and only depend on the relative progress of the particular reaction. Oxidation/degradation of light alkanes are typically associated with increasing ð13C values. Isotopic mass balances offer the possibility to independently determine the fractions coming from microbial versus thermogenic and would also permit differentiation of the isotope fractionations associated with degradation. Unlike conventional concentration measurements, this approach is constrained by the different isotopic signatures of various sources and sinks.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is located in the East-Asian monsoon region with average 2,500mm annual precipitation. Most significant Meteorological disasters are related to extreme precipitation which is associated with a complex terrain. Therefore, the long-term trends or climate variations in precipitation due to climate change are our major concern. We studied the climatology of extreme rainfall (ER, 95thpercentile) events in Taiwan using hourly precipitation data form 21 surface stations during 1960-2014. ER contributes about 40% of the total rain amount. It was found that approximately 68% of ER is related to typhoon (TY) and 22% associated with the Mei-Yu (MY) frontal system.\nThe total ER amount annual variation is strongly related to TY, with correlation coefficient of 0.89 for rainfall amount and 0.86 for frequency. There is a significant increasing trend of TY-ER in past 55 years, but also has large variations over the annual and decadal time scales. The inter-annual variation of astounding extreme rainfall (AER, 99.9thpercentile) is increased significantly, especially in the past 15 years. It implies that the increasing of AER rainfall amount majorly caused by the increasing of frequency instead of average rain intensity of TY-AER. The MY-ER events are also highly correlated with the frontal system. The correlation is 0.84 for the rainfall amount and 0.83 of the frequency with the frontal days. There are also strong inter-annual variations of MY-ER, but the long-term trends are not as significant as TY-ER. The variation of frontal system number is another parameter may impact the MY-ER. The observational frontal system numbers had positive correlation with the MY-ER.\nThe attribution of Taiwan TY-ER changes was debated in the research community. In general, the public acceptance of Taiwan extreme precipitation events is affected by multi-scale systems. According to observational data, the increasing of TY-ER amount is 37 % (48% )in Taiwan and some resent studies (Wang et al. 2015 and Chen et al. 2015) indicates the 10-15%(25%) of the TY rainfall (ER) increasing was contributed by GHG effect. In the other words, the impact of climate change may be obscured by the terrain effects. We also indicate the climate scale variations may also play an important role for the large-scale water vapor supply or the track of tropical cyclones.",

            "abstract": "The end-Triassic mass extinction was likely triggered by a rapid rise in pCO2 associated with the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) ca. 201 Ma. Shallow-marine anoxia has long been hypothesized to have caused the extinction and/or delayed the recovery of marine life. However, due to a lack of proxy data, the effects of CAMP emplacement on seawater chemistry remain poorly constrained. Local proxies for anoxia may not reflect widespread ocean redox conditions. However, coupled records of U concentration and isotopic composition (δ238U) in CaCO3 sediments precipitated beneath well-oxygenated bottom waters can potentially serve as a proxy for the global extent of anoxia due to fractionation of U during reduction and associated imbalances in the marine U cycle due to redox changes. We measured δ238U and Th/U values in shallow marine limestones from two stratigraphic sections in the Lombardy Basin, northern Italy, spanning over 400 m, to quantify the change in the extent of ocean anoxia during the end-Triassic extinction. We observe a ca. 0.6‰ negative excursion in δ238U beginning in the lowermost Jurassic, coeval with the onset of the negative δ13C excursion and persisting for the duration of subsequent high δ13C values in the lower–middle Hettangian (earliest Jurassic). Th/U values are generally low at the T/J boundary, peak near the nadir of the δ238U excursion, and steadily return to pre-event values by the end of the measured section. Using a numerical model of the U cycle, we demonstrate that this excursion corresponds to a thirty-fold increase in the extent of anoxia worldwide and a simultaneous increase in the riverine U flux, consistent with increased weathering and eutrophication following massive CO2 injection from CAMP volcanism. Scenarios involving an increase in marine anoxia would also predict higher rates of organic C burial, explaining the large protracted positive δ13C excursion in the lower-mid Hettangian. Recovery of marine fauna, particularly reef builders, was delayed until the late Hettangian, suggesting that environmental conditions were unfavorable for >1 My after the extinction. Uranium isotope data provide strong support for the hypothesis that persistent ocean anoxia inhibited biotic recovery throughout this interval.",

            "abstract": "The Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) onboard Mars Express is able to detect remotely the Martian topside electron densities down to the main ionospheric peak. In the ionospheric mode it transmits a sequence of pulses in the frequency range 0.1 to 5.5 MHz and measures the delay of reception of the reflected signals returned by the ionospheric plasma layers below the spacecraft. Previous studies using MARSIS have investigated localized electron density structures in the dayside Martian ionosphere, located in areas of typically near-vertical or oblique orientation of the Martian crustal magnetic fields. These crustal fields are remnants of the now extinct global Martian dipole magnetic field, with the strongest fields in the Southern hemisphere reaching up to |B| > 200 nT at altitudes of 400 km. These density structures are often detected as apparent upwellings above the surrounding ideally horizontally stratified ionosphere. Previous studies searched the density structures at a fixed sounding frequency of 1.9 MHz (equivalent to a plasma density of 4.47·104 cm-3), which is a typical frequency at which they are detected. In addition, these studies did not account for the signal dispersion due to the propagation through the ionosphere, which causes larger time delays for receiving the radar echoes, and therefore an underestimation of the altitude of these structures. In the present work we propose to use a statistical dataset of such density structures detected on the dayside of Mars by MARSIS in areas of oblique crustal fields, to determine the interval of densities for which the structures are found to make apparent upwellings. Then we use the corresponding electron density profiles corrected for signal dispersion, to determine the real altitudes of the density structures, their vertical extent and their plasma scale heights compared to the surrounding ionosphere. These new informations give critical hints for uncovering their origins (plasma diffusion along near-vertical fields or reduced electron-ion recombination rates due to localized heating in areas of near-vertical fields), in addition of their control by the crustal field orientation and their established long term stability, despite changing solar wind conditions.",

Despite their widespread use for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis, formal Bayesian approaches require strong assumptions about the nature of model residuals via the likelihood function that may not be well satisfied. Here, we introduce a framework for specifying residual error models (likelihood functions), which seeks to improve the application of Bayesian methods. Residual error models are selected through a nested approach that is both flexible and extendible and integrates many previously employed residual error models. Residual error models were explored using a top-down approach that focused on assessing each on its ability to properly characterize the underlying assumptions. Results from synthetic and real data applications indicated that the adequacy of an individual likelihood function must be considered using a multifaceted assessment strategy. The form of the residual error model was found to significantly impact the calibrated parameter posterior distributions (statistical distributions of the calibrated parameter values), which in turn have the potential to greatly affect the uncertainty estimates.",

            "abstract": "A systematic flow-through column study was conducted using sediments and groundwater from the subsurface at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC) site in Rifle, Colorado, to better understand the efficacy of uranium removal from the groundwater with and without biostimulation in the form of acetate amendments. The interactive effects of acetate amendment, groundwater/sediment geochemistry, and intrinsic bacterial community composition were evaluated using four types of sediments, collected from different uranium-contaminated (D08, LQ107, CD) or non-contaminated (RABS) aquifers. Subtle variations in the sediments’ geochemistry in terms of mineral compositions, particle sizes, redox conditions, and metal(loid) co-contaminants had a marked effect on the uranium removal efficiency, following a descending trend of D08 (~ 90 to 95%) >> RABS (~ 20 to 25) ≥ LQ107 (~ 15 to 20%) > CD (~ -10 to 0%). Overall, biostimulation of the sediments with acetate drove deeper anoxic conditions and observable shifts in bacterial population structures. The abundance of dissimilatory sulfate-reduction genes (i.e., drsA), markers of sulfate-reducing bacteria, were highest in the sediments that performed best in terms of uranium removal. By comparison, no obvious associations were found between the uranium removal efficiency and the abundance of typical iron-reducing microorganisms, e.g., Geobacter spp. In the sediments where bacterial biomass was relatively low and sulfate-reduction was not detected (i.e., CD), abiotic adsorption onto fine mineral surfaces such as phyllosilates likely played a dominant role in the attenuation of aqueous uranium. In these scenarios, however, acetate amendment induced significant remobilization of the sequestered uranium and other heavy metals (e.g., strontium), leading to zero or negative uranium removal efficiencies (i.e., CD). The results of this study suggest that reductive immobilization of uranium can be effectively achieved under predominantly sulfate-reducing conditions in sediment microenvironments when bioavailable iron (III) (oxyhydr)oxides are mostly depleted, and provide insight into the integrated roles of sediment geochemistry, mineralogy, and bacterial population dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The classified forest of TENE located in the department of OUME has a role of timber production characterized by a high logging. This operation requires a measure of preservation of sensitive sites to exploitation in order to maintain ecological functions, ecosystem and biodiversity living there. The parameters such as streams, slopes, wetlands and rivers are indicators of the existence of sensitive sites to preserve. However, no knowledge of the location, boundaries and the surface of these natural habitats makes its protection difficult. Thus, knowledge of the natural and conceptual environment at the forest of TENE is necessary for the preservation of the ecosystem and biodiversity, prerequisite for its sustainability. Furthermore, Remote Sensing and GIS are less expensive techniques for synthetic and fast analysis of these parameters at different scales as well as spatially and temporally. It should be noted that this study is focused on wetlands mapping in the forest of TENE for a sustainable management. The satellite image of December 2014 from Landsat 8 carried on the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor was used for analysis. The methodological approach is based primarily on prior knowledge of the spectral signatures of different elements on the image in different wavelengths. Then the thematic layers extraction of hydromorphic soil without and with vegetation are made by thresholding associated luminance values. The combination of the obtained layers allowed to map all wetlands in the forest of TENE. Finally, the superimposition of this layer with the water system was used to assess the conformity of the result with the reality on the ground. The result showed that the wetlands subject of sensitive sites are mainly found in the western part of the forest of TENE. They are also encountered along the rivers. These wetlands extend over a total area of 12,915 ha against 16,898.22 ha for the non wetlands with a coverage rate of 43.32 %. These areas should be protected against logging in order to do not disturb them because they are refuge environments for fauna as well as flora conservation. This study will enable the manager of the classified forest of TENE to target those sites considered sensitive to preserve for a sustainable management.

The Obama administration permitted Royal Dutch Shell to conduct exploratory oil drilling in the Chukchi Sea in summer 2015. If successful, further development will follow. The Bering Strait, as the exit of the Northern Sea Route, has already seen increased ship traffic, and this will likely continue if the sea ice remains reliably low. While not the only factor, predictability of sea ice extent, particularly on seasonal scales (3-12 months), is essential; a wrong decision will be costly if not catastrophic (e.g, Kulluk 2012). Using a reduced form model, we investigate geophysical processes which govern the advance and retreat of the sea ice edge at key points (e.g., Nome, Kotzebue, Barrow, Prudhoe Bay). Using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula, we estimate costs and risks associated with the ice edge variability.",

In this study, an integrated modeling framework is developed through high performance computing to investigate the climate change effects on probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF). Multiple historical storms from 1981–2012 over the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin near the Atlanta metropolitan area are simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) forcings. After further WRF model tuning, these storms are used to simulate PMP through moisture maximization at initial and lateral boundaries. A high resolution hydrological model, Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model, implemented at 90m resolution and calibrated by the U.S. Geological Survey streamflow observations, is then used to simulate the corresponding PMF. In addition to the control simulation that is driven by CFSR, multiple storms from the Community Climate System Model version 4 under the Representative Concentrations Pathway 8.5 emission scenario are used to simulate PMP and PMF in the projected future climate conditions. The multiple PMF scenarios developed through this integrated modeling framework may be utilized to evaluate the vulnerability of existing energy-water infrastructures with various aspects associated PMP and PMF.",

These field campaigns have generated a great wealth of observations, including a wide range of the trace gases and aerosol properties. The ASDC Toolsets for Airborne Data (TAD) is designed to meet the user community needs for manipulating aircraft data for scientific research on climate change and air quality relevant issues. TAD makes use of aircraft data stored in the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) file format. ICARTT has been the NASA standard since 2010, and is widely used by NOAA, NSF, and international partners (DLR, FAAM). Its level of acceptance is due in part to it being generally self-describing for researchers, i.e., it provides necessary data descriptions for proper research use. Despite this, there are a number of issues with the current ICARTT format, especially concerning the machine readability. In order to overcome these issues, the TAD team has developed an “idealized” file format. This format is ASCII and is sufficiently machine readable to sustain the TAD system, however, it is not fully compatible with the current ICARTT format. The process of mapping ICARTT metadata to the idealized format, the format specifics, and the actual conversion process will be discussed. The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate an example of how to improve the machine readability of ASCII data format protocols.",

To increase resource efficiency and productivity in a sustainable fashion, co-management of water, energy, and food resources is becoming inevitable. These co-management schemes require implementation of nexus-based approaches, which takes the interconnections of water, energy, and food systems into account and considers that development in one area may have major effects on others. While society, economy and environment are the action areas to implement a nexus approach, finance, governance, infrastructure and technology can create solutions. Existing obstacles in the action areas and challenges associated with creating solutions increase the complexities to develop nexus-based approaches and complicate their implementation. This study, identifies existing social, economic, and environmental obstacles, financial demands and constraints, shortcomings in governance, and infrastructure problems in the United States as the main challenges that need to be overcome. Then, it will be discussed how advanced technology could be employed to facilitate implementation of nexus-based approaches, followed by providing some recommendations to enable institutions to employ new technology, overcome existing obstacles, and address challenges in order to implement nexus-based management approaches.",

This presentation will describe pre-launch L3_FT_A algorithm implementation and evaluation using NASA/SAC-D Aquarius L-band radar data, and provide an update on the current status of the SMAP L3_FT_A product.\nIn advance of SMAP measurements, the L3_FT_A algorithm was configured and evaluated using Aquarius measurements. While the temporal (weekly) and spatial (~100 km) resolution is much coarser than SMAP, Aquarius provides L-band radar measurements at an incidence angle (normalized to 40 degrees) which is close to SMAP. Evaluation of FT retrievals derived using both Aquarius freeze/thaw references and backscatter time series as inputs identified good agreement during the fall freeze-up period with FT flag agreement (Aquarius versus in situ) exceeding the 80% SMAP mission requirement when summarized on a monthly basis. Disagreement was greater during the spring thaw transition due in part to uncertainty in characterizing the surface state from in situ measurements and backscatter sensitivity to the onset of snow melt, independent of the soil temperature beneath the snowpack. Initial challenges for SMAP derived FT retrievals include the scale difference between the Aquarius references (~100 km) and the SMAP measurements (3 km) which is particularly problematic in areas of complex topography and/or mixed land cover, and false freeze detection across the mid-latitudes due to a relatively weak difference in the radar signal between frozen and thawed conditions. It is anticipated that the shift from Aquarius to SMAP derived freeze and thaw references will significantly reduce these challenges.",

            "abstract": "The rise in atmospheric methane that began in 2007 and continued strongly through 2014 has been accompanied by a global decrease in methane's stable carbon isotopic ratio. The δ13CH4 isotopic shifts and loci of growth observed globally imply that a major driver of recent growth in atmospheric methane has been the response of microbial methane sources, particularly tropical wetlands, to meteorological changes over the past 8 years.\nIn the southern tropics, summer (Dec-March) wetland or ruminant emissions can lead to isotopically depleted excursions, while winter (June-Sept) biomass burning of C4 grasslands will produce isotopically relatively enriched methane. At Ascension (8oS) in marine boundary air a trend (>0.2‰) to more 13C-depleted values began in 2009, becoming more marked with excursions to much more negative values in early 2011 and 2012. Values have since recovered slightly but Ascension δ13CH4 values in early 2015 remained markedly more negative than in 2007-8. At Cape Point (34oS), the methane record (2011-2014) also shows a similar isotopic shift.\nTo identify the causes of the large changes in the global methane budget, we perform a budget analysis of methane mole fraction and δ13CH4 data from NOAA and RHUL sites. The increase in tropical methane from 2011 fits a shift to more isotopically negative (lighter) δ13CH4 values, most likely a consequence of the exceptional water transfer to wetland by rainfall in the major La Niña event. Strong tropical wetland emissions may have continued in warm subsequent years. High precipitation and floods east of the Andes, and exceptional global warmth (emissions are exponentially temperature-dependent provided enough water is present) may have combined to give strong emission in 2014. In contrast to the methane increase in the 1980s, which was probably mainly driven by rising anthropogenic emissions, the recent isotopic shift suggests the present growth is more likely to have been a consequence of meteorological events, especially in the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands have been widely demonstrated to provide important watershed services, such as the sequestration of carbon (C) and removal of nitrate (NO3-) from through-flowing water. Hydrologic connectivity (degree of water and associated material exchange) between floodplain water bodies (e.g., side channels, ponds) and the main channel influence rates of C accumulation and NO3- uptake, and the degree to which wetlands contribute to enhanced water quality at the catchment scale. However, environmental engineers have largely ignored the role of hydrologic connectivity in providing essential ecosystem services, and constructed wetlands are commonly built using compacted clay and berms that result in less groundwater and surface water exchange than observed in natural wetlands. In a study of an active beaver meadow (multithreaded, riparian wetland) in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, we show how shifts in hydrology (connectivity, residence times, flow paths) from late spring snowmelt (high connectivity) to autumn/winter baseflow (low connectivity) influence ecosystem metabolism metrics (e.g., gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity) and NO3- uptake rates. We use a combination of mixing analyses, tracer tests, and hydrometric methods to evaluate shifts in surface and subsurface hydrologic connections between floodplain water bodies from snowmelt to baseflow. In the main channel and three floodplain water bodies, we quantify metabolism metrics and NO3- uptake kinetics across shifting flow regimes. Results from our research indicate that NO3- uptake and metabolism dynamics respond to changing levels of hydrologic connectivity to the main channel, emphasizing the importance of incorporating connectivity in wetland mitigation practices that seek to enhance water quality at the catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol radiative forcing estimates with high certainty are required in climate change studies. The approach in estimating the aerosol radiative forcing by using the chemical composition of aerosols is not effective as the chemical composition data with radiative properties are not widely available. In this study we look into the approach where ground based spectral radiation flux measurements along with an RT model is used to estimate radiative forcing. Measurements of spectral flux were made using an ASD spectroradiometer with 350 – 1050 nm wavelength range and 3nm resolution for around 54 clear-sky days during which AOD range was around 0.1 to 0.7. Simultaneous measurements of black carbon were also made using Aethalometer (Magee Scientific) which ranged from around 1.5 ug/m3 to 8 ug/m3. All the measurements were made in the campus of Indian Institute of Science which is in the heart of Bangalore city. The primary study involved in understanding the sensitivity of spectral flux to change in the mass concentration of individual aerosol species (Optical properties of Aerosols and Clouds -OPAC classified aerosol species) using the SBDART RT model. This made us clearly distinguish the region of influence of different aerosol species on the spectral flux. Following this, a new technique has been introduced to estimate an optically equivalent mixture of aerosol species for the given location. The new method involves an iterative process where the mixture of aerosol species are changed in OPAC model and RT model is run as long as the mixture which mimics the measured spectral flux within 2-3% deviation from measured spectral flux is obtained. Using the optically equivalent aerosol mixture and RT model aerosol radiative forcing is estimated. The new method is limited to clear sky scenes and its accuracy to derive an optically equivalent aerosol mixture reduces when diffuse component of flux increases. Our analysis also showed that direct component of spectral flux is more sensitive to different aerosol species than total spectral flux which was also supported by our observed data.",

            "abstract": "Many storylines presenting a geoscientific background are portrayed in science fiction movies. However, this background is often discussed only in qualitative terms in outreach books and forums. Here we report a mentoring experience of an end of degree project carried out in the fourth year of the degree in Physics in the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). The supervisors intended to take advantage of the students’ passion for science fiction movies to foster learning by assessing a robust, quantitative and critical analysis of the main geoscientific phenomena appearing in Avatar movie by James Cameron (2009). The student was supposed to consult abundant scientific literature. Much interest was paid to analyze the conditions for the levitation of Hallelujah floating mountains in Pandora, the imaginary satellite where the movie action takes place. Pandora was assumed to be an Earth-like astronomical object where the same physical laws as in the Earth could be applied. Hallelujah Mountains are made of unobtanium, an electrical superconductor at room-temperature and therefore diamagnetic material and they are assumed to be located over a magnetic field pole. The numerical values of the magnetic susceptibility and the required field to make the material levitate at the Pandora’s gravity conditions were estimated. For this purpose, the magnetic susceptibility of the superconductor with the highest critical temperature existing today on Earth, the cuprate YBa2Cu3O7 was estimated. Results were compared with the magnetic susceptibility of two diamagnetic and abundant materials in the Earth’s crust, namely quartz and calcite, and with the water susceptibility. The magnetic field required to levitate cuprates was almost 9 T, about six orders of magnitude higher than the Earth’s magnetic field. On the basis of the quantitative analysis of magnetic and gravity field in Pandora, the student provided a list of suggestions to improve the scientific basis for futures releases.",

In this study, we examine the wave expansion in the ion-electron two-fluid plasma. Our results can explain the wave characteristics of the observed rising-tone waves and the falling-tone waves.

            "abstract": "Aerosol particle number concentrations have been measured at Halley and Neumayer on the Antarctic coast, since 2004 and 1984 respectively. Sulphur compounds known to be implicated in particle formation and growth were independently measured: sulphate ions and methane sulphonic acid in filtered aerosol samples; and gas-phase di-methyl sulphide for limited periods. Iodine oxide, IO, was determined by a satellite sensor from 2003 to 2009, and by different ground-based sensors at Halley in 2004 and in 2007. Previous model results and mid-latitude observations show that iodine compounds consistent with the large values of IO observed may be responsible for an increase in number concentrations of small particles. Coastal Antarctica is useful for investigating correlations between particles, sulphur and iodine compounds, because of their large annual cycles together with the source of iodine compounds in sea ice. After smoothing all measured data by several days, the shapes of the annual cycles in particle concentration at Halley and at Neumayer are approximated by linear combinations of the shapes of sulphur compounds and IO, but not by sulphur compounds alone. However, there is no short-term correlation between IO and particle concentration. The apparent correlation after smoothing but not in the short term suggests that iodine compounds and particles are sourced some distance offshore. This suggests that new particles formed from iodine compounds are viable, i.e. they can last long enough to grow to the larger particles that contribute to Cloud Condensation Nuclei, rather than being adsorbed by existing particles. If so there is significant potential for climate feedback near the sea ice zone via the aerosol indirect effect.",

            "abstract": "Forest canopy structure is a key predictor of gas exchange processes that control carbon (C) uptake, including the allocation of photosynthetically fixed C to new plant biomass growth, or net primary production (NPP). Prior work suggests forest canopy structural complexity (CSC), the arrangement of leaves within a volume of canopy, changes as forests develop and is a strong predictor of NPP. However, the expressions of CSC that best predict NPP over decadal to century timescales is unknown.\nOur objectives were to use multiple remote sensing observations to characterize forest canopy structure in increasing dimensional complexity over a forest age gradient, and to identify which expressions of physical structure best served as proxies of NPP. The study at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI, USA uses two parallel forest chronosequences with different harvesting and fire disturbance histories and includes three old-growth ecosystems varying in canopy composition.\nWe have derived several expressions of 2-D and 3-D forest canopy structure from hemispherical images, a ground-based portable canopy lidar (PCL), and a 3-D terrestrial lidar scanner (TLS), and are relating these structural metrics with NPP and light and nitrogen allocation within the canopy. Preliminary analysis shows that old-growth stands converged on a common mean CSC, but with substantially higher within-stand variation in complexity as deciduous tree species increased in forest canopy dominance. Forest stands that were more intensely disturbed were slower to recover leaf area index (LAI) as they regrew, but 2-D measures of CSC increased similarly as forests aged, regardless of disturbance history. Ongoing work will relate long-term trends in forest CSC with NPP and resource allocation to determine which forest structure remote sensing products are most useful for modeling and scaling C cycling processes through different stages of forest development.",

Two simulation scenarios were employed: one was to quantify the mechanisms of water use, nitrogen uptake and biomass production in a eucalypt plantation under the normal soil conditions, the other was to estimate the same mechanisms under the wet and dry soil conditions. In general, the rates of evaporation, transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET), and root water uptake were in the following order: ET > root uptake > leaf transpiration > soil evaporation. A profound discrepancy in water use was observed between the wet and dry soil conditions. Leaching of nitrate-N and soluble organic N depended not only on soil N content but also on rainfall rate and duration. The yield of biomass from the eucalypt was primarily regulated by water availability in a fertilized plantation. ",

We explore how the use of modern (AFLP fingerprinting techniques) and ancient DNA (metabarcoding P6 loop of chloroplast DNA) help to reveal past distribution of vascular plant species, dispersal processes, and effect of species traits. Based on studies of modern DNA combined with species distribution models, we show the dispersal routes and barriers to dispersal throughout the circumarctic/circumboreal region, likely dispersal vectors, the cost of dispersal in term of loss of genetic diversity, and how these relates to species traits, dispersal distance, and size of colonized region. We also estimate the expected future distribution and loss of genetic diversity and show how this relates to life form and adaptations to dispersal. To gain more knowledge on time lags in past range change events, we rely on palaeorecords. Current data on past distribution are limited by the taxonomic and time resolution of macrofossil and pollen records. We show how this may be improved by studying ancient DNA of lake sediments. DNA of lake sediments recorded about half of the flora surrounding the lake. Compared to macrofossil, the taxonomic resolution is similar but the detection rate is considerable improved. By taking into account main determinants of founder effect, dispersal vectors, and dispersal lags, we may improve our ability to forecast effects of climate change, whereas more studies on ancient DNA may provide us with knowledge on distribution time lags.",

            "abstract": "Reproducibility of diurnal precipitation over northern Eurasia simulated by CMIP5 climate models in their historical runs were evaluated, in comparison with station data (NCDC-9813) and satellite data (GSMaP-V5). We first calculated diurnal cycles by averaging precipitation at each local solar time (LST) in June-July-August during 1981-2000 over the continent of northern Eurasia (0-180E, 45-90N). Then we examined occurrence time of maximum precipitation and a contribution of diurnally varying precipitation to the total precipitation.\nThe contribution of diurnal precipitation was about 21% in both NCDC-9813 and GSMaP-V5. The maximum precipitation occurred at 18LST in NCDC-9813 but 16LST in GSMaP-V5, indicating some uncertainties even in the observational datasets. The diurnal contribution of the CMIP5 models varied largely from 11% to 62%, and their timing of the precipitation maximum ranged from 11LST to 20LST. Interestingly, the contribution and the timing had strong negative correlation of -0.65. The models with larger diurnal precipitation showed precipitation maximum earlier around noon.\nNext, we compared sensitivity of precipitation to surface temperature and tropospheric humidity between 5 models with large diurnal precipitation (LDMs) and 5 models with small diurnal precipitation (SDMs). Precipitation in LDMs showed high sensitivity to surface temperature, indicating its close relationship with local instability. On the other hand, synoptic disturbances were more active in SDMs with a dominant role of the large scale condensation, and precipitation in SDMs was more related with tropospheric moisture. Therefore, the relative importance of the local instability and the synoptic disturbances was suggested to be an important factor in determining the contribution and timing of the diurnal precipitation. \nAcknowledgment: This study is supported by Green Network of Excellence (GRENE) Program by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1503) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

            "abstract": "The offshore Nicaraguan Rise in the western Caribbean Sea is an approximately 500,000 km2 area of Precambrian to Late Cretaceous tectonic terranes that have been assembled during the Late Cretaceous formation of the Caribbean plate and include: 1) the Chortis block, a continental fragment; 2) the Great Arc of the Caribbean, a deformed Cretaceous arc, and 3) the Caribbean large igneous province formed in late Cretaceous time. Middle Eocene to Recent eastward motion of the Caribbean plate has been largely controlled by strike-slip faulting along the northern Caribbean plate boundary zone that bounds the northern margin of the Nicaraguan Rise. These faults reactivate older rift structures near the island of Jamaica and form the transtensional basins of the Honduran Borderlands near Honduras. Recent GPS studies suggest that small amount of intraplate motion within the current margin of error of GPS measurements (1-3 mm/yr) may occur within the center of the western Caribbean plate at the Pedro Bank fault zone and Hess Escarpment. This study uses a database of over 54,000 km of modern and vintage 2D seismic data, combined with earthquake data and results from previous GPS studies to define the active areas of inter- and intraplate fault zones in the western Caribbean. Intraplate deformation occurs along the 700-km-long Pedro Bank fault zone that traverses the center of the Nicaraguan Rise and reactivates the paleo suture zone between the Great Arc of the Caribbean and the Caribbean large igneous province. The Pedro Bank fault zone also drives active extension at the 200-km-long San Andres rift along the southwest margin of the Nicaraguan Rise. Influence of the Cocos Ridge indentor may be contributing to reactivation of faulting along the southwesternmost, active segment of the Hess Escarpment.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the inter event time distribution of hydraulic-fracturing-induced seismicity collected during 18 stages at four different injection locations. We identify the statistical process describing the distribution of hydraulic-fracturing-induced events in time and develop a statistical model to compute the occurrence probability of hydraulic fracturing-induced seismicity. This model can be used to assess the seismic hazard associated with hydraulic fracturing operations. We observe a universal distribution of waiting times between subsequently occurring events. The distribution is given by the exponential distribution of the homogeneous Poisson process (HPP). Moreover, the process of event occurrence in the injection volume domain is a HPP. Our findings suggest that hydraulic-fracturing-induced seismicity is directly triggered by the relaxation process of stress and pore pressure perturbation that initially was created at the injection source. Compared to this relaxation process the stress transfer, caused by the occurrence of preceding seismic events, is insignificant for the seismogenesis of subsequently occurring events. It means that no aftershock triggering has to be included in the statistical model. This is an important difference to naturally occurring earthquakes, which has to be considered during seismic hazard assessment of fluid injection-induced seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Among various strategies introduced for controlling seawater intrusion, artificial recharge through either well injection or pond infiltration is used most commonly in practice. In this study, we compare the performance of well injection and pond infiltration in controlling seawater intrusion through two scenario groups. First, a single injection well is compared with an elliptical infiltration pond by assuming that the pond and the well share the same location and the recharge rate. Second, an injection-extraction well pair system is compared with an elliptical pond infiltration-well extraction system by assuming the same condition as in the first scenario and the same location of the extraction well. The quantitative indicators including the interface toe location, saltwater volume, and the maximum net extraction rate are derived analytically using the potential theory. By comparing the two schemes in the first scenario group, it is found that the infiltration pond significantly outperforms the injection well under the condition that the major semi-axis of the ellipse is along the coastline. Importantly, a critical location of the infiltration pond/injection well is found, under which the maximum reduction in the saltwater volume is achieved. The study of the second scenario suggests that the pond-well system significantly outperforms a well-pair system in terms of the maximum net extraction rate, if the major semi-axis of the ellipse is along the coastline. Sensitivity analysis shows that the shape of the elliptical pond (i.e., the ratio of the major semi-axis to the minor semi-axis) is a key design parameter controlling its performance. The analytical analysis in this study provides initial guidance for practitioners when using the aquifer recharge strategy to restore a salinized coastal aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the hydrology of disturbed lands is important given the increasing human footprint on earth. Surface coal mining has caused significant land-use change in central Appalachia in the past few decades. The mining process breaks up overburden rock above coal seams, and then replaces that material at the mine location and in adjacent unmined valleys (valley fills). The freshly exposed rock surfaces undergo weathering which often alters water quality and ultimately aquatic communities in effluent streams. One of the most common water quality effects is increased total dissolved solids (TDS), which is usually measured via its surrogate, specific conductance (SC). The SC of valley fill effluent is a function of fill construction methods, materials, and age. Yet hydrologic studies that relate these variables to water quality are sparse due to the difficulty of implementing traditional hydrologic measurements in fill material. We tested the effectiveness of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to monitor subsurface geologic patterns and hydrologic flow paths in a test-case valley fill. We paired ERI with artificial rainfall experiments to track infiltrated water as it moved through the valley fill material. Results indicate that ERI can be used to identify the subsurface geologic structure and track advancing wetting fronts or preferential flow paths. We observed that the upper portion of the fill profile contains significant fines, while the deeper profile is primarily composed of large rocks and void spaces. The artificial rainfall experiments revealed that water ponded on the surface of compacted areas until it reached preferential flow paths, where it infiltrated quickly and deeply. We observed water moving from the surface down to >10 m depth within 75 minutes. In sum, vertical and lateral preferential flow paths were evident at both shallow (through compacted layers) and deep (among boulders) locations. Such extensive preferential flow suggests that a relatively small proportion of fill material experiences water movement and therefore contributes to elevated SC. This study demonstrates that ERI can improve understanding of storm hydrology and groundwater response in disturbed landscapes and aid development of valley-fill construction methods to reduce environmental impacts.",

            "abstract": "Cheongsong is located in the central eastern area of South Korea. Unique spherulitic rhyolites occur in this region as dykes formed about 48 to 50 million years ago. Composed of quartz and feldspar these spherulitic rhyolites show various flowerlike shapes, such as chrysanthemum, dandelion, rose, carnation, sunflower, dahlia and so on, so they are called ‘flower stones’. The spherulite indicates that it was undercooled caused by very fast cooling at a shallow depth near the surface and the variety of shapes resulted from the difference of crystallizing conditions. According to the condition, minerals start to crystallize homogeneously or heterogeneously and develop as rounded or fibrous shapes, representing beautiful patterns when combined. These spherulitic structures are very rare not only in Korea but also globally, being valuable for research and preservation because of their rarity, beauty and diversity. Cheongsong therefore applies to the UGG (UNESCO Global Geopark) in an attempt to popularize the flower stones and use them as education materials which can also be incorporated in other valuable sites. The exhibition center provides diverse types of flower stones in which visitors could learn about rhyolitic volcanism, crystallization and spherulite and can experience the process of changing a rough stone into a flower stone. A geotrail course has also been created, showing each type of flower stone on the outcrop and providing educational programs about geological mechanisms of the stones with a trained guide.",

            "abstract": "As part of the EU-ECLIPSE project, a set of global and regional chemistry and transport models have performed simulations predicting atmospheric distributions of aerosols both globally and in the Arctic region. Here, model accuracy has been evaluated using satellite observations in the Arctic. All models used the same anthropogenic (ECLIPSEv4a), biogenic (MEGAN), and biomass burning (GFED-v3) emissions. Aerosol data derived from the spaceborne CALIOP lidar are used to evaluate models over the entire Arctic region during spring and summer 2008. Monthly mean results from the ECLIPSE models are compared with vertical distributions of attenuated scattering ratio at 532 nm from CALIOP averaged using a 3°x5° grid over a region covering 30° N to 82° N. This new product (Ancellet et al., 2014), based on CALIOP level 1 backscatter signals filtered using CALIPSO level 2 cloud masks, is not affected by errors associated with a lidar signal inversion.\nModelled aerosol distributions are shown to overestimate aerosols in mid-latitude source regions and underestimate aerosols in the lower Arctic troposphere (0-2km), compared to CALIOP satellite data despite the fact that models use the new ECLIPSE emissions that include improved representations of Russian flaring and domestic wood burning. . During April 2008, lower aerosol levels are observed over the Arctic near the surface compared to the free troposphere. Intense fires over Siberia and western Russia/eastern Europe coupled with transport of Asian emissions into the Arctic free troposphere during spring 2008 led to enhanced aerosol concentrations aloft at this time of year. The models have problems simulating enhanced aerosols aloft during spring 2008. In general, observed aerosol levels are lower during the summer months due to more efficient scavenging processes and less efficient transport of polluted air masses into the Arctic at this time of year. All the ECLIPSE models have too little aerosol in the Arctic in July 2008 pointing to aerosol lifetimes that are too short or suggesting that vertical transport in the models may not be efficient enough.\n\nDiscrepancies point to remaining uncertainties in emissions as well as deficiencies in global model transport processes and uncertainties in wet scavenging of aerosols during transport to the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "During the earlier stages of accretion, the mass distribution of planetesimals evolved through a discontinuous process of collisions (merging of planetesimals). In between collisions, the internal temperature of the planetesimals varied continuously by radioactive heat release, mostly the decay of 36Al, and radiation at their surface. The collisions were also accompanied by a partial release of the kinetics energy of the impactor in the target planetesimal. Although the distribution of planetesimal sizes have been previously discussed, this is not the case of their temperatures. In this presentation we will present a statistical model able to capture the distribution of planetesimal temperatures and masses as a function of time. Even in simulations where the accretion is rapid enough so that in the temperature-mass distribution, large and molten planetesimals (with radii larger than 50 km formed in less than 500 kyrs) are present, the average planetesimals remain often small and cold (with radii smaller than 5 km and temperature of only a few 100 K). The swarm of planetesimals contains indeed a large number of small objets that cannot retain the heat produced by radioactivity. This points to a necessary very fast accretion (50 km planetesimals formed in less than 100 kyrs) to melt the majority of planetesimals.",

            "abstract": "Local mountain glaciers and ice caps are common and widespread along the periphery of Greenland and provide valuable paleoclimatic records because they respond sensitively to climate change. In contrast to extensive research on Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) margin changes, the relative timing of mountain glaciation during the Holocene is poorly documented. Here, we use a multi-proxy approach to document the timing of local glacier advance and retreat throughout the past ~10 ka in western Greenland by combining: (1) proglacial lake sediment analysis, (2) 14C-dating of ice-cap-killed in situ plants, and (3) cosmogenic 10Be dating. Radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from Sikuiui and Pauiaivik lakes, eastern Nuussuaq, provide minimum-limiting ages for local deglaciation of 9.4 ± 0.06 and 8.8 ± 0.16 ka, respectively, and are in agreement with 10Be ages of regional deglaciation that average 10.9 ± 0.7 ka (n=8). Radiocarbon ages (n=54) of in situ plants along retreating cold-based ice cap margins reveal net snowline lowering beginning ~5 ka and are concurrent with the onset of Neoglaciation recorded in both lake systems. Modes of vegetation kill dates highlight distinct ice cap expansion phases at ~3.7, ~3.0, ~1.5 ka, and during the Little Ice Age. The most pronounced snowline lowering event ~4-3 ka is expressed in both lake records by deposition of mineral-rich sediments between ~4.5 and 2.5 ka. Ice cap expansion phases are broadly correlative with elevated minerogenic input in both lakes with some modes in the vegetation ages occurring just prior to increases in mineral-rich sediment input. Published studies of the western GIS margin suggest a major cooling event between ~4.3-3.2 ka, which overlaps with periods of enhanced local glacier activity and ice cap expansion in our dataset. Lastly, the dominant ice cap expansion episode ~3.7 ka in western Greenland is synchronous with a significant snowline lowering event on Baffin Island, suggesting a common climate forcing across Baffin Bay during the late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the patterns of sediment delivery processes and their budgets between channel and floodplains of large rivers is important because both hydrogeomorphic and biogeochemical alterations in floodplains take place through these interactions. The Amazon River has continuous exchange of sediment with floodplains, which may exceed over 3500 Mt/yr in both directions. However, characterizing the sediment transport and deposition patterns in floodplains and quantifying their budgets still remains a challenge.\nIn this study, geomorphic units in floodplains are digitized and their hydrological connectivity are assessed by identifying recharge thresholds from the main channel. Historical floodplain recharge records are examined from daily water level data measured at nearby gauge stations by calculating number of days falling in between the connection and disconnection thresholds within a hydrological cycle. Historical recharge patterns of each unit is assessed using Mann-Kendall test. Intensity of hydrological connectivity is further investigated for by building power spectrum of over 15 years water extent time series data through fast Fourier transform, which the power spectral density indicates the intensity of flooding pulses from the main channel.\nTo quantify the sediment budget stored in floodplains, PALSAR DEM acquired during the lowest water level season is used with the MODIS 8-day composite data. First, shoreline grids derived from MODIS-MNDWI is overlaid on PALSAR image to identify the water level at each floodplain lake unit (h). Total imported Sediment Fluxes (TiSF) entering each floodplain lake during a given period will be calculated as sum of (ht1-ht2) x (SSC(x,y)x1000) x 2502, where htn is the water level in floodplain lake at time tn; SSC(x, y) denotes sediment concentration at x, y coordinate; 1000 is a scale factor; and 2502 is the area of MODIS pixel (m2). Successively summing up TiSF derived from each period will retrieve the amount of total sediment influx from the main channel stored in floodplains.\n",

            "abstract": "Changes in freshwater ecosystems due to a climate change have been great concern for sustainable river basin management both for water resources utilization and ecological conservation. However, their impact seems to be difficult to evaluate because of wide variety of basin characteristics along a river network both in nature and social environment. This presentation uses equilibrium water temperature as a simple criterion index for evaluating the long-term changes of stream thermal environment due to the historical climate change in Japan. It examines, at first, the relationship between the equilibrium water temperature and the stream temperature observed for 7 years at a lower reach in the Ibo River, Japan. It analyzes, then, the seasonal and regional trends of the equilibrium water temperature change for the last 50 years at 133 meteorological station sites throughout Japan, discussing their rising or falling characteristics.\nThe correlation analysis at the local reach of the Ibo River shows that the equilibrium water temperature has similar trend of change as the stream temperature. However, its value tends to be higher than the stream temperature in summer, while lower in winter. The onset of the higher equilibrium water temperature fluctuates annually from mid February to early April. This onset fluctuation at each spring could be influenced by the different amount of snow at the antecedent winter.\nThe rising or falling trends of the equilibrium water temperature are analyzed both annually and seasonally through the regression analysis of the 133 sites in Japan. Consequently, the trends of the temperature change could be categorized by 12 patterns. As for the seasonal analysis, the results shows that there are many sites indicating the falling trend in spring and summer, and rising trends in autumn and winter. In particular, winter has the strong rising tendency throughout Japan. As for the regional analysis, the result illustrates the precise rationality; e.g., northern parts of Japan show the temperature fall in spring and the temperature rise in autumn, while the urbanized regions along the Pacific coastline indicate the temperature rise in all the four seasons.",

            "abstract": "Distributed models offer the potential to resolve catchment systems in more detail, and therefore simulate the hydrological impacts of spatial changes in catchment forcing (e.g. landscape change). Such models may contain a large number of model parameters which are computationally expensive to calibrate. Even when calibration is possible, insufficient data can result in model parameter and structural equifinality. In order to help reduce the space of feasible models and supplement traditional outlet discharge calibration data, semi-quantitative information (e.g. knowledge of relative groundwater levels), may also be used to identify behavioural models when applied to constrain spatially distributed predictions of states and fluxes. The challenge is to combine these different sources of information together to identify a behavioural region of state-space, and efficiently search a large, complex parameter space to identify behavioural parameter sets that produce predictions that fall within this behavioural region.\nHere we present a methodology to incorporate different sources of data to efficiently calibrate distributed catchment models. Metrics of model performance may be derived from multiple sources of data (e.g. perceptual understanding and measured or regionalised hydrologic signatures). For each metric, an interval or inequality is used to define the behaviour of the catchment system, accounting for data uncertainties. These intervals are then combined to produce a hyper-volume in state space. The state space is then recast as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and the Borg MOEA is applied to first find, and then populate the hyper-volume, thereby identifying acceptable model parameter sets. We apply the methodology to calibrate the PIHM model at Plynlimon, UK by incorporating perceptual and hydrologic data into the calibration problem. Furthermore, we explore how to improve calibration efficiency through search initialisation from shorter model runs.",

Work in recent years has shed light on this problem. Networks driven by seepage flow, in particular, have been shown to grow in a field that can be described by the Laplace equation, providing us with an understanding of valley growth and shape. However, the process by which such networks branch to form these ramified shapes is yet a mystery. We focus our attention on a highly ramified seepage valley network in Bristol, Florida. We study the behavior of flux to valley heads as a function of valley length, and use this result to motivate our discussion of branch formation. We then hypothesize that a critical groundwater flux demarcates a transition point where topographic diffusion is overcome by branching processes, and we present network-wide flux calculations, cosmogenic data, and simulation to support our claim. Our results ultimately suggest a mechanism for seepage bifurcation, and inform our understanding of pattern formation in river networks.",

            "abstract": "Modeling at the intersection of climate variability and hydrology is complicated by uncertainties that make predicting physical behavior a challenge. Environmental models used to simulate how climate will impact hydrology are typically complex, demand many spatial and temporal data inputs, contain numerous parameters, and can be computationally expensive. Distributed models in particular complicate the assessment of how uncertainty in the model framework, inputs, parameters, and observations impact predictive uncertainty. In addition, future climate perturbations may alter the magnitude of these uncertainties. Here, we focus on model parameters as a key source of uncertainty. Identifying those model parameters that most influence the predictions at a particular place can reduce a complex, multidimensional problem to a simpler form. We demonstrate how sensitivity analysis in the absence of observational streamflow can be used to identify sensitive model parameters by conditioning a model on climate data and a priori parameter ranges. We apply this approach to five headwater catchments in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest located in central Montana using the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model. Across these five sub-catchments, climate clearly organizes parameter sensitivities. To further explore the relationship between parameter sensitivities and climate, we assess how parameter sensitivities change when meteorological forcing data is perturbed to reflect natural variability at the site. This general approach can support uncertainty reduction. However, parameter equifinality will still impact finer scale predictions of any environmental variable in space and time. As such, improving our certainty in environmental predictions should evaluate point predictions as well as simulations of internal catchment behavior, and must not only rely on our use of computational methods but on our basic understanding of system functioning.",

            "abstract": "Bangladesh is plagued by high concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic (As) in the shallow groundwater of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta (GBMD), leading to widespread poisoning of people in the region. Most of the 156 million people in Bangladesh obtain their drinking water through hand-pumped tube wells that often draw arsenic-contaminated water from shallow, Holocene-age aquifers of the delta. The distribution of arsenic within these aquifers is heterogeneous and linked with the complex stratigraphy of the GBMD through its controls on hydrogeology and aquifer biogeochemistry. This research investigates differences in the fluvio-deltaic deposits formed by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, as well as differences in the tectonic setting across the lower delta plain. Furthermore, we investigate how these overarching controls influence stratigraphic architecture and the resulting aquifer systems, and ultimately the distribution of As within the shallow aquifers of the lower delta plain. To accomplish this, a transect of 55 sediment cores spanning the entire lower delta plain of Bangladesh was drilled to a depth of 90 m. In addition to knowledge of the stratigraphic architecture gained from borehole lithologs, samples from these cores were analyzed for provenance and grain size to determine source of the sediments and the depositional history of the rivers. Relating delta stratigraphy to As distribution was accomplished by measuring groundwater As in 10-20 tubewells within a 1 km radius of each borehole. This data was combined with groundwater data from the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project within 25 km of the transect. Statistical analysis of the groundwater data was then conducted using hierarchical regressions as well as a nearest neighbor algorithm. This study provides a better understanding of Holocene delta evolution and river behavior, as well as a more complete understanding of the geologic controls on As and the characteristics of contaminant distribution in fluvial settings as they relate to stratigraphic features.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon is an important short-term climate forcer that has been linked with adverse health effects. Multiple black carbon measurement methodologies exist, but no standard measurement method or calibration material has been agreed upon. Moreover, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses elemental carbon in its ambient monitoring networks and in its emissions inventory, assuming that elemental carbon is equivalent to black carbon. Instrument comparisons with ambient aerosols have demonstrated considerable differences between black carbon and elemental carbon, as well as among different black carbon measurements. However, there have been few published comparable studies for source emissions. We used multiple measurement methods to quantify black carbon and elemental carbon emissions from a range of combustion sources (diesel gensets, coal fired boilers, prescribed fires and cookstoves) emitting particles of varying composition and physical characteristics. The ratio of black carbon to elemental carbon (BC/EC) ranged from 0.50 to 2.8 and depended upon the combustion source. The greatest agreement was observed for emissions from cookstoves (BC/EC = 1.1 ± 0.3). The largest differences were seen for emissions from large stationary diesel genset (BC/EC = 2.3 ± 0.5) and were most pronounced when a diesel particulate filter was used (BC/EC 2.5 ± 0.6). This suggests that this source category may be underrepresented in emissions inventories based on elemental carbon. Black carbon concentrations derived from filter-based attenuation were highly correlated with photo-acoustic absorption measurements, but were generally 50% greater. This is likely due to the choice of calibration factor, which is currently ambiguously defined. These results highlight the importance of developing a standard calibration material to improve comparability among measurements.",

This segment has also been the nucleation site of the largest historical earthquake in Europe, the 365 AD earthquake, with a magnitude of Mw 8. This event generates a devastating tsunami, which spread along the Adriatic Sea and in the Nile Delta region.\nThe southwestern segment of the Hellenic subduction zone has been the aim of a marine geophysical survey on board the N/O Le Pourquoi Pas? of IFREMER, in November 2012. During this survey, two seismic refraction profiles perpendicular of the subduction have been carried out. These two profiles of 25 OBS/OBH each are coincident with two other seismic reflection profiles by using a 11000 cu.inch airgun source. An additional set of 650 km of seismic reflection profiles has been acquired. The aim of this study is to image the megathrust fault in the depth range of 15 to 40 km, identify the structural markers of the downdip and updip limits of the potential seismogenic zone and the geometry variation of these markers along this segment.\nDuring this survey, Chirp and multi-beam bathymetric data have also been collected. These elements provide constraints on the superficial and recent tectonic evolution in the region.\nIn this study, we will propose an interpretation of all the imaged structural markers, in the overriding plate and in the subducted plate, of the first meters down to 40 km depth, with the analysis and the comparison between the two main profiles of seismic reflection on the one hand and one refraction profile on the other hand.",

At present, this region is characterised by upwelling of waters from 150-500 m depth. Stable isotopes (d18O and d13C) and Mg/Ca were measured on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides, which may be assumed to thrive in upwelled waters. Stable isotopes were also measured on the benthic foraminifer Cibicides wuellerstorfi. Core MD08-3167 records were dated based on 23 14C dates covering the last 30 ky. These records are compared with new and published surface and deep water records from cores from the North-East Brazil margin (MD09-3257, 4.3°S, 2340 m, and MD09-3256Q, 3.33°S, 3537 m; Burckel et al., 2015) and the South Atlantic (core MD07-3076Q, 44°S, 3770 m; Gottschalk et al., 2015).\nOur comparison of surface records indicates that sea surface temperature increases, in phase with Antarctic warming during the Younger Dryas (YD), Heinrich Stadial (HS) 1 and HS4, took place everywhere in the South Atlantic, form equatorial Brazil to the Subantarctic region. In addition, the planktonic d18O records from the Namibian margin indicate that rapid changes in surface ocean circulation and upwelling intensity took place in that region at the beginning of HS1, possibly in response to sea-ice retreat around Antarctica and/or changes in the intensity or position of the westerlies.\nThe deep water records show that water mass ventilation during the YD and Heinrich stadials in the South Atlantic was very similar between 1800 and 2900 m, but a chemical divide seems to be present below this depth before HS1. The comparison of these records demonstrates that the large ocean circulation changes observed during the YD and HS1 (e.g., Waelbroeck et al., 2011) also prevailed during preceding Heinrich stadials and are thus not characteristic of terminations.",

Here we present reactive transport models, calibrated from field observations, which demonstrates that this primarily arises because gaseous solutes such as DO are continuously equilibrating with the atmosphere. This limits the distance over which upstream signal variation driven by watershed processes or discontinuities such as tributary confluences persists, facilitating the emergence of the diel signal due to in-stream biological processing. For non-gaseous solutes the persistence of upstream influence obscures the emergence of the in-stream signal, which must be extracted using a two-station approach utilizing the change in concentration over a finite reach. However, proper application of the two-station method must still account for hydraulic transformation (primarily mixing through dispersion and transient storage zone retention) of the signal rather than assuming plug flow. As the array of solute signals we are capable of detecting continues to expand with advances in sensor technology, rigorous consideration of the processes (both biologic and hydraulic) responsible for signal emergence and downstream evolution is needed. Failure to account for differences in signal emergence across solute type, as well as hydraulic transformations of the signal, may result in incorrect inferences regarding the magnitude and temporal coupling of assimilatory processing of solutes.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to modify the timing of seasonal transitions this century, impacting wildlife migrations, ecosystem function, and agricultural activity. Tracking seasonal transitions in a consistent manner across space and through time requires indices that can be used for monitoring and managing biophysical and ecological systems during the coming decades. Here a new gridded dataset of spring indices is described and used to understand interannual, decadal, and secular trends across the coterminous US. This dataset is derived from daily interpolated meteorological data, and results are compared with historical station data to ensure the trends and variations are robust. Regional trends in the first leaf index range from –0.8 to –1.6 days per decade, while first bloom index trends are between –0.4 and –1.2 for most regions. However, these trends are modulated by interannual to multidecadal variations, which are substantial throughout the regions considered here. These findings emphasize the important role large-scale climate modes of variability play in modulating spring onset on interannual to multidecadal timescales. Finally, there is some potential for successful sub-seasonal forecasts of spring onset, as indices from most regions are significantly correlated with antecedent large-scale modes of variability.",

The permeability structure around a fault zone is anisotropic and non-uniform as a function of distance from the fault zone. Thus it is not surprising to expect a full non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling between dynamic earthquake ruptures and the surrounding off-fault medium. Another potential benefit in understanding non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling between dynamic earthquake ruptures and the surrounding off-fault medium is in properly characterizing the relationship between underground storage/waste disposal and induced seismicity.

            "abstract": "Climate change is surfacing as one of the most important environmental and social issues of the 21st century. Over the last 100 years, observations show increasing trends in global temperatures and intensity and frequency of precipitation events such as flooding, drought, and extreme storms. Global circulation models (GCM) show similar trends for historic and future climate indicators, albeit with geographic and topographic variability at regional and local scale. In order to assess the utility of GCM projections for hydrologic modeling, it is important to quantify how robust GCM outputs are compared to robust historical observations at finer spatial scales. Previous research in the United States has primarily focused on the Western and Northeastern regions due to dominance of snow melt for runoff and aquifer recharge but the impact of climate warming in the mountainous central Appalachian Region is poorly understood. In this research, we assess the performance of GCM-generated historical climate compared to historical observations primarily in the context of forcing data for macro-scale hydrologic modeling. Our results show significant spatial heterogeneity of modeled climate indices when compared to observational trends at the watershed scale. Observational data is showing considerable variability within maximum temperature and precipitation trends, with consistent increases in minimum temperature. The geographic, temperature, and complex topographic gradient throughout the central Appalachian region is likely the contributing factor in temperature and precipitation variability. Variable climate changes are leading to more severe and frequent climate events such as temperature extremes and storm events, which can have significant impacts on our drinking water supply, infrastructure, and health of all downstream communities.",

They contribute up to 30% in the Caribbean Region, Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Pacific during high active seasons. Although Easterly Waves (EWs) are considered high-impact weather phenomena, their regional importance in summer rainfall and regional differences in their development into TCs remains uncertain. This study quantifies the contribution of EWs to summer rainfall. We find that EWs contributed up to 50% of summer rainfall over IAS and EPA during the period 1980-2013. In addition, this study demonstrates regional dependency of the structure of EWs that develop into hurricanes and the thresholds of tropical cyclogenesis. Using ERA-Interim data, vorticity at three levels (850, 700 and 600), Column Integrated Heating, equivalent potential temperature, sea surface temperature, wind speed, stretching radius and integrated moisture flux were analyzed to investigate regional dependency of thresholds for tropical cyclogenesis during the 1980-2013 period. We found that tropical cyclogenesis occurred under different regional environments over Pacific and Atlantic Ocean and the structure of EWs changed depending on the basin. This research can be relevant to improve operational forecast of tropical cyclogenesis since thresholds are used to indicate where and when a TC formation can occur.",

            "abstract": "The Tokyo Metropolitan area is subject to high earthquake activity due to its location near the complex junction of three plates. The seismic hazard Tokyo faces is amplified because it lies in the Kanto basin. The Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) is one of the crustal fault zones that comprise these plate boundaries. The ISTL accommodates plate motion between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate, hosts oblique-strike slip earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7, and is only ~ 150-200km away from Tokyo. It is thought to be at a mature stage in its seismic cycle, and predicting strong ground motion from earthquakes on it is important for seismic hazard assessment. We take advantage of the dense seismic network MeSO-net (MEtropolitan Seismic Observation network) and of the locations of the Hi-net (High Sensitivity Seismograph network) stations near the ISTL fault to build virtual earthquakes from the ambient seismic field. First, we construct the Earth’s impulse responses from deconvolution of the ambient seismic field recorded between Hi-net stations (as sources) and MeSO-net stations (as receivers) with a method that preserves the relative amplitudes of the response. Fundamental and higher modes are often excited in sedimentary basins and we isolate them in the waveforms through phase velocity analysis in the frequency-wavenumber domain. The virtual earthquake approach turns each station-source near the fault into a double-couple point source by correcting the 9-component impulse response for source depth and mechanism. We use recordings of the M6.7 Northern Nagano earthquake that occurred on November 22, 2014 at the northern end of the fault segment to calibrate absolute amplitudes. We estimate the long period (1-10 seconds) ground motions for a suite of of M7+ scenario ruptures on the ISTL and explore the role of waveguides, basin resonance, and basin edges in strong ground motion.",

The optical extinction is due to both scattering and absorption. In situ measurements of aerosol extinction and scattering are well established and have uncertainties less than 5%. However measurements of aerosol absorption typically have uncertainties of 20-30%. Development and characterization of more accurate and precise instrumentation for measurement of aerosol absorption will enable a deeper understand of significance and spatial distribution of black and brown carbon aerosol, the effect of atmospheric processes on aerosol optical properties, and influence of aerosol optical properties on direct radiative forcing.\nHere, we present a detailed characterization of a photoacoustic aerosol absorption spectrometer designed for deployment aboard research aircraft. The spectrometer operates at three colors across the visible spectrum and is calibrated in the field using ozone. The field calibration is validated in the laboratory using synthetic aerosol and simultaneous measurements of extinction and scattering. In addition, the sensitivity of the instrument is characterized under conditions typically encountered during aircraft sampling e.g. as a function of changing pressure. We will apply this instrument characterization to ambient aerosol absorption data collected during the SENEX and SEAC4RS aircraft based field campaigns.",

In such a context, developing suitable demand-side management strategies is essential to meet future water demands, pursue water savings, and reduce the costs for water utilities. Yet, the effectiveness of water demand management strategies (WDMS) relies on our understanding of water consumers’ behavior, their consumption habits, and the water use drivers. While low spatial and temporal resolution water consumption data, as traditionally gathered for billing purposes, hardly support this understanding, the advent of high-resolution, smart metering technologies allowed for quasi real-time monitoring water consumption at the single household level. This, in turn, is advancing our ability in characterizing consumers’ behavior, modeling, and designing user-oriented residential water demand management strategies.\nSeveral water smart metering programs have been rolled-out in the last two decades worldwide, addressing one or more of the following water demand management phases: (i) data gathering, (ii) water end-uses characterization, (iii) user modeling, (iv) design and implementation of personalized WDMS. Moreover, the number of research studies in this domain is quickly increasing and big economic investments are currently being devoted worldwide to smart metering programs. With this work, we contribute the first comprehensive review of more than 100 experiences in the field of residential water demand modeling and management, and we propose a general framework for their classification. We revise consolidated practices, identify emerging trends and highlight the challenges and opportunities for future developments given by the use of smart meters advancing residential water demand management.\nOur analysis of the status quo of smart urban water demand management research and market constitutes a structured collection of information supporting the development of integrated procedures in the field of urban water management, as well as common actions aiding the collaboration with other sectors, as the nexus with energy demand management.",

            "abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has gained popularity in hydrological data assimilation problems. As a Monte Carlo based method, a relatively large ensemble size is usually required to guarantee the accuracy. As an alternative approach, the probabilistic collocation based Kalman filter (PCKF) employs the Polynomial Chaos to approximate the original system. In this way, the sampling error can be reduced. However, PCKF suffers from the so called \"cure of dimensionality\". When the system nonlinearity is strong and number of parameters is large, PCKF is even more computationally expensive than EnKF. Motivated by recent developments in uncertainty quantification, we propose a restart adaptive probabilistic collocation based Kalman filter (RAPCKF) for data assimilation in unsaturated flow problem. During the implementation of RAPCKF, the important parameters are identified and active PCE basis functions are adaptively selected. The \"restart\" technology is used to alleviate the inconsistency between model parameters and states. The performance of RAPCKF is tested by unsaturated flow numerical cases. It is shown that RAPCKF is more efficient than EnKF with the same computational cost. Compared with the traditional PCKF, the RAPCKF is more applicable in strongly nonlinear and high dimensional problems.",

Important questions remain unanswered regarding the gas sources feeding these seeps, the export of carbon from the seafloor and the fundamental biogeochemical processes that regulate the flux and transformation of carbon along this margin. In addition, few programs have ever systematically studied the dynamics across the upper slope transition from no hydrate to hydrate. In September 2015, the US Geological Survey, Oregon State University, Geomar and UCLA conducted a multidisciplinary study aboard the R/V Sharp that included piston coring, multicoring, seafloor heat flow measurements, imaging of sub-seafloor sediments and water column methane plumes, and sampling of methane plumes in the water column. This presentation provides some of the basic geochemical results from the cruise, focusing on the pore water characteristics in upper slope gas hydrate provinces that will be used to constrain the fundamental biogeochemical processes operating at methane seeps, including data on the origin of seep methane at sites with and without a possible association with gas hydrate degradation. Water column profiling of methane and other biogeochemically relevant species (e.g., dissolved inorganic and organic carbon) are also used to establish how carbon exported from the seeps affects ocean chemistry and carbon availability in the deep ocean.",

            "abstract": "Increasing demands on the agricultural industry to produce higher crop yields and provide sustainable agriculture solutions under changing climate and land use is, in part, constrained by the tools available to explore crop-soil-water interactions at the field scale. Traditional measurements of soil moisture offer information about local scale processes, or are resource intensive for investigation at the large scale. As in many other areas of hydrology, geophysical techniques are emerging as potentially valuable methods for large scale investigations, although the full potential of these methods is yet to be realised. We report here on a field-based experimental study in which electrical resistivity tomography and multi-coil electromagnetic induction methods were used to monitor changes in soil electrical conductivity over the growing season of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Changes in electrical conductivity was used as a proxy for changes in soil water content in an attempt to reveal different characteristics of soil water uptake by 23 different lines of wheat. The study was performed in a randomised block experiment using replicate plots for each wheat line. Neutron probe data and penetrometer measurements collected during the study permit a comparison with direct estimates of changes in soil water and changes in soil strength, respectively. The results of the geophysical surveys appear consistent with these independent measurements. Additional constraints in interpretation due to the effect of soil cracking are also explored. It appears that electrical conductivity is potentially useful as an indicator of changes to soil water in such agricultural environments. Resolving subtle differences between different lines of wheat may be challenging and limit the value of these methods in breeding programs. However, the ability to monitor changes in soil water status over large areas with vehicle-mounted geophysical instrumentation remains a major potential advantage of such methods.",

            "abstract": "Lake evaporation, nexus between lake hydrological cycle and energy balance, is very sensitive to climate change. Despite considerable observational and modeling studies on water surface evaporation, mechanisms underlying the response of long-term lake evaporation variations to climate change are still uncertain. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain interannual variations in lake evaporation. In the first hypothesis, water surface evaporation will increase as air temperature rises, at a rate of about 7% K-1 predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The second hypothesis, supported by the universal decline trends in pan evaporation tied to global diming, is that evaporation variabilities are controlled by variabilities in the surface solar radiation. In this study, we firstly validated the evaporation simulations of NCAR’s CLM4.5-LISSS (Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator) against 28 lake observations. Then historical (1991-2010) and future (2005-2100, RCP8.5) lake evaporation were simulated by the same lake model. Results show that global lake evaporation increases with air temperature at a rate faster under the RCP8.5 scenario (3.72 W m-2 oC-1) than in the historical case (3.03 W m-2 oC-1). With normalization of energy constrains, both observed and modeled lake evaporation fraction (the ratio of latent heat flux to net radiation minus heat storage) increase as air temperature rises at a rate perfectly captured by the Priestley-Taylor model with the model parameter of 1.26. From the energy partitioning perspective, the lake evaporation variations are explained primary by air temperature not by surface solar radiation.",

            "abstract": "Forward modeling of seismic body wave travel times and ray parameters for a given density and seismic velocity model is an important tool to investigate the interior structure of planets. The popular toolbox TauP by Crotwell et al. (1999) facilitates application to planets other than Earth, but does not consider a planet's ellipticity nor its surface topography. Due to their ellipticity, smaller radii and larger relative surface topography, these corrections become more significant in predicting seismic observations for celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars. In preparation for NASA's INSIGHT discovery mission (launch in March 2016), we include ellipticity corrections, geometrical spreading and topography corrections into TauP. The respective TauP extensions, as well as Lunar and Martian applications are presented: Previously, Lunar and Martian seismic velocity models have been proposed based on mass, moment of inertia, Love numbers and estimated bulk composition, and in case of the Moon also based on seismic data acquired during the Apollo Program (1969-1977). Due to the lack of direct seismic evidence, current Martian seismic velocity models vary widely and exhibit large travel time excursions, as well as considerable variations in epicentral distance ranges for which a given body wave is predicted to arrive. We discuss the effects of Lunar and Martian ellipticity and crustal structure on seismic travel times for a set of seismic velocity models and compare these to variations observed between the different 1D models. This comparison demonstrates the relevance of modeling the effects of ellipticity and crustal thickness during interpretation of seismic data acquired on planets like Mars or Moon.",

The results of this study indicate that in the Pearl River basin: (1) the exceptional drought lasts about 1.5 months and the drought with the severity not less than the abnormally dry lasts about 3 months; (2) it takes about 3.5 months for the exceptional drought to be recovered to no drought while about 1.7 months for the abnormally dry to be recovered to no drought; and (3) generally, there is a moderate drought in 1 and 2 years for the severe drought, 3 years for the extreme drought, 5.5 years for the exceptional drought. Besides, the results of this study indicate higher risk of drought in the southeast part of the Pearl River basin and these regions are densely populated and economically developed, especially in the Pearl River delta.

            "abstract": "Recent observations by HOPE and MagEIS onboard the Van Allen Probes show frequent penetration of 10s to 100s keV electrons through the slot region and into the inner belt, resulting in an abundant electron population below L=3. The conventional picture is that the source populations of these 10s to 100s keV electrons originate in the plasma sheet and are injected (along with plasma sheet ions) into the inner magnetosphere either through enhancements in the large-scale convection electric field and/or through earthward propagating dipolarization fronts associated with substorms. In such cases the inward radial limit of the injections should coincide with the plasmapause. However, these electron injections often extend inside the plasmasphere, are observed far earthward of the typically accepted “flow-braking” region for dipolarization fronts, and occur at much lower L shells than injections of ions with similar energies. We investigate the electric fields associated with these deep electron injections using data from the Van Allen Probes and THEMIS in order to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that allow them to penetrate so far into the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes is dominated by mainly basaltic to andesitic products, as is the case of the Villarrica 2015 eruption. An exception is the case of the nearby Quetrupillán Volcanic Complex (QVC). The QVC forms part of the NW-SE Villarrica-Quetrupillán-Lanín active volcanic chain and contains products of mainly trachy-dacitic composition that differs from the basaltic and basaltic-andesite composition of the neighboring stratovolcanoes.\nThe studied Holocene QVC trachy-dacites exhibit similar geochemical, mineralogical features. They are crystal-poor (<12% phenocrysts) with phenocrysts occurring as isolated crystals or forming crystal clots within a glass-rich groundmass. Two groups of plagioclase phenocrysts were found: Group 1 plagioclases are commonly associated with pyroxene in crystal clots and with oscillatory zoning of An40-50, and Group 2 plagioclases occur as isolated crystals of variable composition (An70-85), with rims of similar composition to Group 1. Some Group 2 crystals have cores with compositions similar to the rims with resorption features. Clinopyroxenes within clots have compositions of En40-46Fs11-21Wo39-43 similar to the isolated clinopyroxenes. Orthopyroxene phenocrysts have composition of En36-68Fs15-34Wo03-04. Microphenocrysts of magnetite-ilmenite pairs (Mt14-36-Il90-94) were identified.\nPyroxene phenocrysts are in disequilibrium with the whole-rock composition, suggesting that they are antecrysts. Two-pyroxene thermometry gives temperatures of 911-980ºC, while the Mt-Il equilibrium gives higher temperatures of 963-1114ºC, for the later stages of lava crystallization.\nThe presence of a crystalline mush is suggested by the abundance of crystal clots in disequilibrium with the host rock composition whose calculated formation conditions of 0.5-1.5 kbar, 950-990ºC and 2.1-3.1 wt% of H2O, were obtained from a Rhyolite-MELTS simulation. Rejuvenation of a crystal mush by reservoir heating events is suggested due to resorption, regrowth and complex zonation of plagioclases and the higher temperatures obtained from the late stage of Fe-Ti oxide equilibrium. These events would generate the opening of the mush at the bottom of the magma chamber, allowing the interstitial melt extraction prior to eruption.",

            "abstract": "Simulating marine ice sheets remains challenging for large-scale numerical models, in part because of the high resolution needed to accurately track grounding-line motion. Here we show results from marine-ice simulations using version 2 of the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM). CISM is a parallel, higher-order model that can solve several sets of flow equations, including the shallow-shelf approximation (SSA), a depth-integrated higher-order approximation, and the Blatter-Pattyn approximation. Using a new subgrid grounding-line parameterization (GLP) at moderate (~1 km) grid resolution, we have successfully run benchmark experiments for the Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP and MISMIP3d). For a standard MISMIP experiment on a downward-sloping bed, CISM’s SSA results are in good agreement with the analytic boundary-layer solution, and higher-order results are similar to those from a Stokes model. For MISMIP3d experiments with basal-sliding perturbations, CISM simulates reversible migration of curved grounding lines. Without a GLP, much finer resolution (or alternatively, a basal-friction parameterization that smooths the transition between grounded and floating ice) is needed for similar accuracy. We are now using CISM to simulate the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet. We show early results and discuss the remaining work needed to simulate whole marine ice sheets at ~1 km resolution.",

Simulations of the transit time distributions (TTDs) show broad distributions with long tails and mean transit times (ages) significantly larger than the modal ages at all locations. However the TTD shape varies, e.g., the ratio of the width to mean of the TTD is larger than 2 in northern high latitudes but is less than 0.7 in the SH. Estimates of the mean age and width from trace gases show similar spatial variations, including large meridional gradients in the mean age in northern subtropics, and a decrease in the width/mean shape parameter from southern subtropics to the south pole. The above variations in the TTDs will be discussed in terms of the contributions of fast transport paths relative to slow eddy-diffusive recirculation, and related to tropospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The deformation caused by an earthquake induces changes in the Earth’s gravitational field known as coseismic gravity changes, especially during mega-earthquakes. So far, only static gravity changes have been detected, considerably after the end of the rupture. Since gravity changes propagate at the speed of light, a dynamic gravity signal is produced everywhere on Earth during the rupture, even before the arrival of seismic waves.\nHere we confirm the evidence of this prompt gravity signal. We have analyzed, with a statistical blind method, the data recorded during the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake by a superconducting gravimeter in the underground Kamioka observatory, about 500 km away from the earthquake centroid. We find that a gravity signal is present before the P wave arrival, with a statistical significance of more than 99%. The signal amplitude is a fraction of μGal, consistent in sign and order-of-magnitude with theoretical predictions. A similar analysis is being conducted on data recorded by the broadband seismometers of the japanese network Fnet.\nNumerical simulations based on normal-mode method and an analytical model of dynamic gravity signals are used to compute synthetic seismograms, and thus characterize the prompt gravity signal.\nThe robust detection of this prompt gravity signal with instruments more immune to the background seismic noise could, in principle, open new directions in earthquake seismology and overcome limitations of current earthquake early-warning systems imposed by the propagation speed of seismic waves.",

            "abstract": "Techniques for retrieving height resolved information on stratospheric aerosol improved significantly in the past decade with the availability of satellites measurements in limb geometry. Instruments like OMPS, OSIRIS and SCIAMACHY provide height resolved radiance spectra with global coverage. Long term data sets of stratospheric aerosol extinction profiles are important for a detailed investigation of spatial and temporal variation and formation processes (e.g. after volcanic eruptions or in polar stratospheric clouds). Resulting data sets contain vital information for climate models (radiative effect) or chemistry models (reaction surface for heterogeneous chemistry). This study focuses on the SCIAMACHY instrument which measured scattered sunlight in the ultra violet, visible and near infra red spectral range between 2002 and 2012. SCIAMACHY's unique method of alternating measurements in limb and nadir geometry provides co-located profile and column information respectively that can be used to characterize plumes with small horizontal extents. The covered wavelength range potentially provides information on effective micro-physical properties of the aerosol particles. However, scattering on background aerosol constitutes only a small fraction of detected radiance and assumptions on particle characteristics (e.g., size distribution) have to be made which results in potential uncertainties especially for wavelengths below 700 nm and for measurements in backscatter geometry. Methods to reduce these uncertainties are investigated and applied to our newly developed retrieval algorithm. In addition, so called spatial straylight contamination of the measured signal was identified as a significant error source and an empirical correction scheme was developed. Comparisons with SAGE II measurement in occultation geometry and balloon borne measurements with an optical particle counter confirm the viability of our retrieval algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the impact and benefit of geospatial information is a multidisciplinary task that involves the social, economic and environmental knowledge to formulate indicators and methods. There are use cases that couple the social sciences including economics, psychology, sociology that incorporate geospatial information. Benefit – cost analysis is an empirical approach that uses money as an indicator for decision making. It is a traditional base for a use case and has been applied to geospatial information and other areas. A new use case that applies indicators is Meta Regression analysis, which is used to evaluate transfers of socioeconomic benefits from different geographic regions into a unifying statistical approach. In this technique, qualitative and quantitative variables are indicators, which provide a weighted average of value for the nonmarket good or resource over a large region. The expected willingness to pay for the nonmarket good can be applied to a specific region. A third use case is the application of Decision Support Systems and Tools that have been used for forecasting agricultural prices and analysis of hazard policies. However, new methods for integrating these disciplines into use cases, an avenue to instruct the development of operational applications of geospatial information, are needed. Experience in one case may not be broadly transferable to other uses and applications if multiple disciplines are involved. To move forward, more use cases are needed and, especially, applications in the private sector. Applications are being examined across a multidisciplinary community for good examples that would be instructive in meeting the challenge. This presentation will look at the results of an investigation into directions in the broader applications of use cases to teach the methodologies and use of indicators that have applications across fields of interest.",

            "abstract": "Springs in the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco are significant sources for public water supply, and understanding a spring’s response to storm events and seasonal variations can provide insight on the sensitivity of that spring’s flow to climate change. From 18 March 2014 to 15 May 2015, at 15-minute intervals, water temperatures and water levels were measured at three springs (Ribaa, Sidi Rached, and Zerouka), and water levels were measured at Sidi Rached and Zerouka. From 19 March 2014 to 28 March 2015, daily water samples were taken at Zerouka for analyses of deuterium and oxygen-18. Temperature responses varied between the springs. Sidi Rached showed a time-lagged seasonal signal, with minima in May and June and maxima in October, on which responses to individual storms (inferred from water-level spikes) were superposed. Ribaa showed two cycles of temperature fluctuations from April to November 2014, followed by more flashy behavior from November 2014 to May 2015. Event-related temperature fluctuations were as much as 0.36 C for Sidi Rached and 0.74 C for Ribaa. Duplicate thermistors from different manufacturers showed different behaviors at Zerouka: one showed long-term downward drift from ~ 12.6 to 12.3 C, whereas the other was stable within +/- 0.06 C. Subtle temperature fluctuations superposed on the long-term trends may reflect responses to individual storms at Zerouka. Preliminary stable-isotope data from Zerouka indicate daily fluctuations of as much as 0.5 per mil 18O and 3.9 per mil 2H superposed on longer-term upward and downward trends (on the order of 2 months). Acquisition of meteorological data from the study area and statistical analyses are pending, but initial results indicate a variety of spring behaviors suggestive of differences in hydraulic connectivity within each spring basin.",

The development of land use scenarios in West Africa is needed to predict future impacts of change in the environment and the socio-economic status of rural communities.\nThe study aims at developing land use scenario based on mitigation strategy to climate change as an issue of contributing for carbon and nitrogen sequestration, the condition ‘food focused’ as a scenario based crop production and ‘financial investment’ as scenario based on an economic development pathway, and to explore the possible future temporal and spatial impacts on vegetation carbon/nitrogen sequestration/emission and socio-economic status of rural communities.\nPreliminary results: BEN-LUDAS (Benin-Land Use DyNamic Simulator) model, carbon and nitrogen equations, remote sensing and socio-economic data were used to predict the future impacts of each scenario in the environment and human systems. The preliminary results which are under analysis will be presented soon.\nConclusion: The proposed BEN-LUDAS models will help to contribute to policy decision making at the local and regional scale and to predict future impacts of change in the environment and socio-economic status of the rural communities.

            "abstract": "In the context of shallow flows, the spatial distribution of the flow is highly influenced by the micro-topography. For instance, local oriented depressions may exist in which the flow depth and velocity may exceed the threshold for soil erosion initiation. If a mean uniform flow shear stress is used to characterize the area, it would be smaller and therefore may not initiate erosion. However, management of water and sediment fluxes requires analysis and modeling at the watershed scale in order to integrate the relations between upstream and downstream areas. At this scale, high resolution information on the microtopography is usually not always available and would anyway require too extensive computation resources to be explicitly integrated in modelling attempt. Moreover, in agricultural context, this information is likely to change during the year depending on the agricultural practices. In this context, the objective of this study is to propose a parameterisation of the influence of microtopography on erosion into the framework of the shallow water equation. For each cell, the proportion of wetted area is used as a microtopography indicator. For the case of erosion, the system is coupled to the sediment transport equations. In such context, an additional equation describing the micro-topography evolution caused by erosion is introduced. Different case study will be presented to investigate the potential of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrates are ice-like crystals that are present along continental margins, occurring in the pore space of deep sediments or as massive blocks near the seafloor. They form in high pressure and low temperature environments constrained by thermodynamic stability, and supply of methane. In the Arctic, gas hydrates are abundant, and the methane released by their destabilization can affect local to global carbon budgets and cycles, ocean acidification, and benthic community survival. With the aim to locate in space and time the periodicity of methane venting, CAGE is engaged in a vast research program in the Arctic, a component of which comprises the analyses of numerous sediment cores and correlative geophysical and geochemical data from different areas.\nHere we present results from combined analyses of biogenic carbonate archives along the western Svalbard Margin, which reveal past methane venting events in this region. The reconstruction of paleo-methane discharge is complicated by precipitation of secondary carbonate on foraminifera shells, driven by an increase in alkalinity during anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). The biogeochemical processes involved in methane cycling and processes that drive methane migration affect the depth where AOM occurs, with relevance to secondary carbonate formation. Our results show the value and complexity of separating primary vs. secondary signals in bioarchives with relevance to understanding fluid-burial history in methane seep provinces.\nResults from our core analyses are integrated with observations made during the CAGE15-2 cruise in May 2015, when we deployed a towed vehicle equipped with camera, multicore and water sampling capabilities. The instrument design was based on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) MISO TowCam sled equipped with a deep-sea digital camera and CTD real-time system. Sediment sampling was visually-guided using this system. In one of the pockmarks along the Vestnesa Ridge where high methane discharge was measured, we deployed the CAGE 888 marker as our first step in conducting time series studies to establish temporal variability going forward.\nThis research is partially supported by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme, project number 223259.",

            "abstract": "The extraction of hydrokinetic energy is the conversion of the kinetic energy of moving water into another more useful form of energy, frequently electricity. This water motion may be in the form of waves, tides, ocean currents or river flows. In addition to the development of the technology, the successful extraction of hydrokinetic energy requires a better understanding of physical, environmental and social aspects of the resource and their interactions with the technology. To assist with the development of the hydrokinetic industry as a whole, much work over the past decade has been completed developing international technical standards which can be used by the full range of stakeholders in the hydrokinetic industry. To support the design of projects for tidal energy extraction, a new International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Specification (TS) has recently been published outlining a standardized methodology for performing resource assessments. In addition, presently work is ongoing on producing another TS for performing resource assessments on in-stream river projects. While the specific technology for extracting the energy from tidal and river flows may be similar, the methodologies for performing the respective resource assessments is quite different due to the differing nature of the physical processes involved. This presentation will discuss both the tidal and in-stream river methodologies, highlighting their respective key aspects. In addition, a case study illustrating the use of the published tidal TS will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Several recent Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer heat extremes have been linked to persistent high-amplitude planetary wave patterns (e.g. heat waves in Europe 2003, Russia 2010 and in the US 2011, Floods in Pakistan 2010 and Europe 2013) with large-scale circulation patterns characterized by persistent longitudinal planetary-scale high-amplitude waves of relative high wavenumber (6-8).\nBased on atmospheric wave dynamics, Petoukhov et al. (2013) proposed a so called quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) mechanism that, in case certain conditions in the NH circulation are fulfilled, can lead to such situations.\nKey requirements for the amplification of a slow moving (quasi stationary) synoptic wave of wavenumber 6 – 8 are i.) the formation of a waveguide to prevent meridional dissipation of their energy and ii.)a reasonable strong thermal and orographic forcing for the respective wavenumber.\nBy casting these conditions into a script, we implemented an automated detection scheme to scan reanalysis data for QRA events. By employing this more objective approach, we were able to analyze duration and occurrence of QRA, investigate its role during summer extremes and put prior results to the test.\nIn accordance with earlier studies we identify a rise of long lasting QRA events over the last decade, primarily attributed to an increase of wave 7 QRA episodes many of them coinciding with extreme weather in the mid-latitudes. During those periods a double jet flow regime is identified as the prevalent circulation pattern.\nDetected events include the summers of the record breaking heat extremes of 2003 and 2010. We employ these examples as case studies to explain evolution and effect of the QRA mechanism in detail.\nIn a complementary study we adapted the detection scheme to the Southern Hemisphere (SH) to investigate if the mechanism is a general feature of mid-latitude circulation or whether specific conditions are needed which might only be fulfilled in the NH.\nWe present preliminary results showing that the QRA conditions were met during some record-breaking Australian heatwaves.",

An impact of this size would cause local fires and may also generate submicron dust particles. Dust aerosols are injected into the upper atmosphere where they persist for ~3 years. Soot aerosols from fires are injected into the troposphere and absorb solar radiation heating the air which helps loft the soot into the stratosphere where it persists for ~10 years. Initially, these aerosols cause a heating of over 240 K in the stratosphere and up to a 70% reduction in downwelling solar radiation at the surface. Global average surface temperature cools by as much as -8.5 K, ocean temperature cools by -4.5 K, precipitation is reduced by 50%, and the ozone column is reduced by 55%. The surface UV Index exceeds 20 in the tropics for several years. These changes represent a significant hazard to life on a global scale. These results extend the work of Pierazzo et al. (2010), also using CESM, which found a significant impact on stratospheric ozone, but little change in surface temperature or precipitation, from a 1 km asteroid impact in the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Delta regions are attractive for high intensity agriculture due to the availability of rich sedimentary soils and of fresh water. Many of the world’s tropical deltas support high population densities which are reliant on irrigated agriculture. However environmental changes such as sea level rise, tidal inundation and reduced river flows have reduced the quantity and quality of water available for successful agriculture. Additionally, anthropogenic influences such as the over abstraction of ground water and the increased use of low quality water from river inlets has resulted in the accumulation of salts in the soils which diminishes crop productivity. Communities based in these regions are usually reliant on the same water for drinking and cooking because surface water is frequently contaminated by commercial and urban pollution. The expansion of shallow tube well systems for drinking water and agricultural use over the last few decades has resulted in mobilisation of salinity in the coastal and estuarine fringes.\nSustainable development in delta regions is becoming constrained by water salinity. However salinity is often studied as an independent issue by specialists working in the fields of agriculture, community water supply and groundwater. The lack of interaction between these disciplines often results in corrective actions being applied to one sector without fully assessing the effects of these actions on other sectors. This paper describes a framework for indentifying the causes and impacts of salinity in delta regions based on the source-pathway-receptor framework. It uses examples and scenarios from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh together with field measurements and observations made in vulnerable coastal communities. The paper demonstrates the importance of creating an holistic understanding of the development and management of water resources to reduce the impact of salinity in fresh water in delta regions.",

            "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a valuable tool in the measurement and monitoring of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). To obtain accurate GPS-derived TEC, satellite and receiver hardware biases, known as Differential Code Biases (DCBs), must be estimated and removed. The Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) provides monthly averages of receiver DCBs for a number of stations in the International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Service (IGS) network. A comparison of the monthly receiver DCBs provided by CODE with DCBs estimated using the Minimization of Standard Deviations (MSD) method (Ma & Maruyama, 2003), on both daily and monthly time intervals, is presented. TEC, which has been unbiased using CODE-derived DCBs, shows inconsistencies in differenced sTEC up to 6.906 TECU, while TEC that has been unbiased using MSD-derived DCBs results in inconsistencies rarely exceeding 1.5 TECU. A number of possible factors that could be causing the CODE-derived DCB inconsistencies, such as hardware configuration, solar activity, and seasonal variations, are analyzed and discussed. It is also noted that daily MSD-derived DCBs show significant variations from day to day, with standard deviations up to 42 TECU in a given month. The magnitude of day-to-day variations was found to have a strong correlation between co-located receiver pairs. This correlation was seen regardless of hardware make, model, and configuration, which suggests that the variations are likely caused by ionospheric artifacts within the bias estimation method.",

            "abstract": "Elevation dependent snowmelt magnitude and timing strongly influences net ecosystem productivity in forested mountain watersheds. However, previous work has provided little insight into how internal watershed topography may modulate plant available water, microclimate and therefore forest growth. We analyzed 331 tree cores from three coniferous tree species across a range of elevation, landscape positions and aspects in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, Montana, USA. We compared the annual basal area increment (BAI) to measures of the annual climatic water deficit, hydro-meteorological data in sideslope and hollow positions, and topographic indices derived from a LiDAR digital elevation models. Results indicate strong relationships between measures of BAI and the topographic wetness index, with differing slopes dependent on tree species. Generally, trees located in wetter landscape positions (hollows) exhibited greater annual basal growth relative to trees located in drier landscape positions (sideslopes). At the watershed scale, we evaluated the relationships between convergence and divergence, LiDAR derived estimates of basal area and seasonal patterns of the Landsat derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; 1984-2012).These indicated differential growth response due to elevation gradients, irradiance and local convergence and divergence. Wetter landscape positions have higher values of greenness and basal area than drier positions. These observations suggest that the topography of semi-arid watersheds is a necessary consideration for quantifying conifer productivity and resiliency, due to its potential to mediate local microclimate and subsurface water redistribution.",

            "abstract": "Talus slopes in Yosemite Valley, California, are a rich archive of rock fall processes occurring since deglaciation (~ 15 ka). The valley is an ideal natural laboratory for investigating rock fall processes because the cliffs display a wide range of heights, steepnesses, orientations, and granitic lithologies. We measured the spatial distribution of boulder volumes on rock fall-dominated talus slopes along 10 transects at 8 locations in Yosemite Valley. Boulder volumes span 6 orders of magnitude, from 0.003 to 3000 m3. As expected, boulder volumes increase non-linearly downslope, with the largest boulders located at or beyond the base of talus slopes. Boulder volumes are smaller below cliffs composed of more mafic lithologies, likely reflecting the greater fracture density in those cliffs. Moderately tall cliffs (400-550 m) tend to produce larger boulders than the tallest and shortest cliffs. Using airborne lidar data, we calculated talus surface roughness and found modest increases in roughness as a function of downslope distance, likely related to the downslope increase in boulder volume. By quantifying the spatial distribution of boulder volumes, our results can be used to improve future assessments of rockfall hazard adjacent to talus slopes.",

            "abstract": "Plant roots are recognized to play a key role in the riparian ecosystems: they contribute to the plant as well as to the streambank and bedforms stability, help to enhance the water quality of the river, and sustain the belowground biodiversity. The complexity of the root-system architecture recalls their remarkable ability to respond to environmental conditions, notably including soil heterogeneity, resource availability, and climate. In fluvial environments where nutrient availability is not a limiting factor for plant to grow, the root growth of phreatophytic plants is strongly influenced by water and oxygen availability in the soil. In this work, we demonstrate that the randomness of water table fluctuations, determined by streamflow stochastic variability, is likely to be the main driver for the root development strategy of riparian plants. A collection of root measurements from field and outdoor controlled experiments is used to demonstrate that the vertical root density distribution can be described by a simple analytical expression, whose parameters are linked to properties of soil, plant and water table fluctuations. This physically-based expression is able to predict riparian plant roots adaptability to different hydrological and pedologic scenarios in riverine environments. Hence, this model has great potential towards the comprehension of the effects of future climate and environmental changing conditions on plant adaptation and river ecomorphodynamic processes. Finally, we present an open access graphical user interface that we developed in order to estimate the vertical root distribution in fluvial environments and to make the model easily available to a wider scientific and professional audience.",

There are still important signals to be recovered and issues related to errors in the models have been identified.\nIn this study, a series of newer gravity models including observations from GRACE and GOCE are compared with the DTU13MSS mean sea surface to analyse resolution capacities and to identify issues caused by errors in the models. The comparisons are carried out in regional analyses using Fourier techniques to derive the spectral characteristics as well as anisotropic patterns to identify differences and to quantify quality measures associated with the models. In addition, regional analyses are carried out using in-situ observations of the geostrophic surface currents from drifters.

            "abstract": "Peatlands are a critically important global carbon reserve. There is increasing concern that such ecosystems are vulnerable to projected increases in wildfire severity under a changing climate. Severe fires may exceed peatland ecological resilience resulting in the long term degradation of this carbon store. Evaporation provides the primary mechanisms of water loss from such environments and can regulate the ecological stress in the initial years after wildfire. We examine variations in evaporation within burned peatlands after wildfire through small scale chamber and large scale remote sensing measurements. We show that near-surface water repellency limits peatland evaporation in these initial years post fire. Water repellent peat produced by the fire restricts the supply of water to the surface, reducing evaporation and providing a strong negative feedback to disturbance. This previously unidentified feedback operates at the landscape scale. High surface temperatures that result from large reductions in evaporation within water repellent peat are observed across the 60,000 ha burn scar three months after the wildfire. This large scale reduction in evaporation promotes high water table positions at a landscape scale which limits the rate of peat decomposition and supports the post fire ecohydrological recovery of the peatlands. However, severe burns are shown to exceed this negative feedback response. Deep burns at the peatland margins remove the hydrophobic layer, increasing post fire evaporation and leaving the peatland vulnerable to drying and associated ecological shifts.",

Here we present trace element and stable isotope data from benthic foraminiferal calcite from sediment cores in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty (~37˚S), a region that is influenced by deep waters derived from the Pacific and Southern Oceans. Large deglacial shifts in carbonate ion ([CO32-]) have been observed at ~1600m depth (Allen et al., 2015), likely reflecting a combination of shifting water mass boundaries and loss of CO2 from interior ocean waters. Extension of this record deeper into the ice age suggests that carbonate chemistry may also have shifted during HS2 (~23-26 ka). Mg/Ca records suggest that deep waters warmed gradually since the Last Glacial Maximum, with peak temperatures coinciding with peak [CO32-] at ~14.5 ka during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. We discuss these records in regional context and explore the implications for ocean-climate links on millennial and ice age timescales.",

The rapid development of technology in BRICS inevitably altered their culture and behavior, as reflected by education, gender equality, health, and other demographic/socio-economic indicators.

Global climatic changes also drives the demand for sustainable energy. With a focus on solar energy, we analyzed time series of energy consuming behaviors, government policies, and the ecosystem services. Structural equation modeling was applied to confirm the relationships among societal transition, ecosystem services, and climate change. We compared the energy consumption patterns for the five countries and forecasted the changes through 2025.

            "abstract": "The next generation of Ecosystem and Earth System Models (EESMs) will require detailed information on ecosystem structure and function, including properties of vegetation related to carbon (C), water, and energy cycling, in order to project the future state of ecosystems. High spatial-temporal resolution measurements of terrestrial ecosystem are also important for EESMs, because they can provide critical inputs and benchmark datasets for evaluation of EESMs simulations across scales. The recent development of high-quality, low-altitude remote sensing platforms or small UAS (< 25 kg) enables measurements of terrestrial ecosystems at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, these new platforms can provide detailed information on patterns and processes of terrestrial ecosystems at a critical intermediate scale between point measurements and suborbital and satellite platforms. Given their potential for sub-decimeter spatial resolution, improved mission safety, high revisit frequency, and reduced operation cost, these platforms are of particular interest in the development of ecological scaling algorithms to parameterize and benchmark EESMs, particularly over complex and remote terrain.\nOur group is developing a small UAS platform and integrated sensor package focused on measurement needs for scaling and informing ecosystem modeling activities, as well as scaling and mapping plant functional traits. To do this we are developing an integrated software workflow and hardware package using off-the-shelf instrumentation including a high-resolution digital camera for Structure from Motion, spectroradiometer, and a thermal infrared camera. Our workflow includes platform design, measurement, image processing, data management, and information extraction. The fusion of 3D structure information, thermal-infrared imagery, and spectroscopic measurements, will provide a foundation for the development of ecological scaling and mapping algorithms. Our initial focus is in temperate forests but near-term research will expand into the high-arctic and eventually tropical systems. The results of this prototype study show that off-the-shelf technology can be used to develop a low-cost alternative for mapping plant traits and three-dimensional structure for ecological research.",

            "abstract": "Waves can have a significant impact on many coastal operations including navigational safety, recreation, and even the economy. Despite this, as of 2009, there were only 181 in situ real-time wave observation networks nationwide (IOOS 2009). There has recently been interest in adding real-time wave measurement systems to already existing NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) stations. Several steps have already been taken in order to achieve this, such as integrating information from existing wave measurement buoys and initial testing of multiple different wave measurement systems (Heitsenrether et al. 2012). Since wave observations can be derived from high frequency water level changes, we will investigate water level sensors’ capability to measure waves. Recently, CO-OPS has been transitioning to new microwave radar water level (MWWL) sensors which have higher resolution and theoretically a greater potential wave measurement capability than the acoustic sensors in stilling wells. In this study, we analyze the wave measurement capability of MWWL sensors at two high energy wave environments, Duck, NC and La Jolla, CA, and compare results to two “reference” sensors (A Nortek acoustic waves and currents profiler (AWAC) at Duck and a single point pressure sensor at La Jolla). A summary of results from the two field test sites will be presented, including comparisons of wave energy spectra, significant wave height, and peak period measured by the test MWWL sensors and both reference AWAC and pressure sensors. In addition, relationships between MWWL versus reference wave sensor differences and specific wave conditions will be discussed.  Initial results from spectral analysis and the calculation of bulk wave parameters indicate that MWWL sensors set to the “NoFilter” processing setting can produce wave measurements capability that compare well to the two reference sensors. These results support continued development to enable the installation of MWWL sensors at CO-OPS locations as a method of measuring waves.",

            "abstract": "The Sheepbed mudstone forms the base of the succession examined by the Curiosity rover and is also the first bona fide mudstone known on another planet. Many initial papers have discussed a lacustrine depositional setting, geochemical features, and implications for habitability. Careful review of all collected images and associated data prompts us to update interpretations of depositional regime, diagenesis, and burial history. The lake basin received sediment pulses associated with localized scouring, lateral thinning of beds, and decelerating flows. Bed cross sections suggest mm-cm scale layering to be the norm, probably recording distal pulses of fluvial sediment injections (fine grained hyperpycnites), fall-out from river plumes, and some eolian supply. Prior diagenesis studies focused on synaeresis cracks and mm-scale nodules but contrary to other genetic models we consider centrifugal diffusion could have formed hollow nodule shells, some continuing until filled. There is also an element of stratiform cementation and formation of thin, laterally extensive concretions that establish outcrop appearance of the uppermost meter of the Sheepbed mudstone.\nTypical surface mud with 80 vol% water has a water/rock ratio of about 1.4 (assuming basaltic debris), and this ratio declines with further compaction. Given that clay formation is thought to require rather higher w/r, the observation of around 20% clays in these rocks seems to argue against in situ clay generation, and instead suggests that they were derived from the crater’s periphery and carried into the basin by fluvial discharge. This view is also supported by the presence of significant amounts (>30%) of likely highly reactive amorphous component(s) and Fe-forsterite in John Klein, and the need for an initial presence of clay minerals to enable synaeresis. The virtual lack of Fe-forsterite in Cumberland is more supportive of in situ alteration, although significant amorphous material exists in Cumberland.",

            "abstract": "New faults in a strike-slip stress field are expected to be sub-vertical. However, continental strike-slip faults commonly reactivate arrays of pre-existing non-vertical faults with non-optimal strike. The systems of strike-slip faults that dissect the Inner California Continental Borderland , Santa Monica Bay, and south-Central California are imaged with multiple grids of closely spaced 2D multichannel seismic reflection profiles. From these and stratigraphic information, we constructed multiple digital 3D fault and fold interpretations. Quaternary strike-slip faults that dip moderately in their upper few km include the southern Hosgri fault, part of the Carlsbad fault, and the Santa Monica-Dume fault. These faults reactivate structures that developed in pre-19 Ma subduction and subsequent Miocene extension and transtension. Seismic reflection imaging reveal that they dip 40° to 55°. 3D seismic data image the Hosgri fault to locally dip less than 30° below 1 km depth. Where Pliocene-Quaternary sediment accumulated in basins, these faults tend to propagate upwards as sub-vertical faults, as expected. Thus, cross sectional fault geometry can be used together with other information to infer strike-slip motion. Imaged gently-dipping faults underlie and/or interact with the Santa Monica-Dume and Carlsbad faults. Seismicity and tectonic models suggest that the southern Hosgri fault and faults to its west do not affect the subducted oceanic lower crust. Thus, strike-slip motion there may occur on the former subduction megathrust.\nThese moderately-dipping faults also describe bends and stepovers in map view, resulting in significant vertical deformation. Northwest of San Diego, the Carlsbad fault bends sharply as part of a 15 km right-stepover to the Descanso and Coronado Bank fault system. N-striking fault strands, a releasing orientation for the Pliocene to present strain orientation, connect between the Newport-Inglewood and Carlsbad faults and also between the Rose Canyon fault (same fault as the Newport-Inglewood) and the Descanso fault, within a few km of the San Diego metropolitan area. It is not known whether prehistoric earthquakes rupture through these bends, connecting faults, and stepovers, but the 3D geometry should be considered in models.",

            "abstract": "Since the 20 century, the rate of urbanization has been increasing, and today over half the global population lives in urban areas (United Nations World Urbanization Prospects, 2014). This increasing urbanization has impacted environments around the world, particularly urban waterways. In New York City, pollution from infrastructure such as CSOs (combined sewer overflows) and MS4s (municipal separate storm sewer systems) deposit high concentrations of nutrients and fecal matter into the city’s surrounding waterways. The Bronx River, the city’s only fresh water river, has historically suffered from eutrophication and hypoxia from these inputs. This study aimed to examine the oxygen content and characterize vegetative productivity on the Bronx River as a means to determine the effect that pollution has had on the river’s metabolism. Two YSI sites, (Yellow Spring Instrument) measuring temperature, salinity, conductivity, depth, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, chlorophyll, blue/green algae, and oxygen content were utilized to characterize the water quality. Complementary, discrete water samples were collected to analyze water quality parameters that are inaccessible via YSI instrumentation, measuring concentrations of NO3, PO4 and enterococci fecal indicator bacteria. It was hypothesized that with the combination of efforts to clean up the Bronx, and the absence of CSOs upstream of the study area, that relatively low pollution levels would be recorded. It was found that though the river was highly hypoxic, both chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations were low, indicating that low oxygen concentrations were not the result of high levels of pollution and eutrophication. However, high concentrations of enterococci bacteria suggest that the Bronx is still very polluted. Hypoxic conditions within water bodies have been associated with a decreased capacity for bacteria to “fix” nitrogen and phosphorous pollutants into NO and PO4 for plant uptake (Roberts et al., 2012), and could explain low concentrations of NO3 and PO4 in the river in the context of high concentrations of enterococci bacteria. Future research should measure other nitrogen and phosphorous species to better determine if nutrient loading is occurring.",

This junction defines the upstream apex of the Mekong delta. As such, the morphological evolution of this confluence-diffluence over single flood events, and larger temporal scales, determines the partitioning of water and sediment as it enters the Mekong delta, as well as to the critically important ecosystem that is the Tonlé Sap Lake.\nHere, we present data from a series of high spatial resolution topographic (Multibeam Echo Sounder), flow (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) and sub-bottom profiling (Parametric Echo Sounder) surveys undertaken on the Chaktomuk Junction, which reveal the temporal and spatial evolution of this critically important confluence-diffluence unit. We show spatial patterns of morphological change across a range of monsoonal flow stages and at various temporal scales, as well as sub-bottom profiling across the large bars present at the confluence. We also identify the response in the partitioning of the suspended and bedload portions of sediment transport through the confluence-diffluence, and elucidate the implications of this partitioning for the evolution of the downstream channel.",

            "abstract": "New measurements of the water concentration and new constraints on oxygen fugacity of Basin and Range basalts enable more accurate pressure (P) and temperature (T) estimates of the depth of equilibration of the mantle melts. We developed a revised thermobarometer that more precisely predicts the results of laboratory experiments on melts equilibrated with olivine and orthopyroxene. Applying these methods to basalts from recently active volcanic settings in the Basin and Range province, we find that most equilibrated near the dry solidus in P-T space and that the depths are in the vicinity of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) inferred from receiver function analysis and surface wave tomography. The basalts have enough water that they should have begun melting well below the dry solidus, so the depths of equilibration probably reflect pooling and stalling of upward migrated melts beneath a dry lithosphere rather than a mean depth of formation. The equilibration conditions then reflect the pre-existing thickness of the lithosphere, which may be eroded in spots by the thermal and chemical corrosion of melts infiltrating into the depleted layer. Assuming that there is a ~5% drop in shear velocity at the LAB associated with pooled melt, a two-parameter thermal model is sufficient to simultaneously satisfy both the seismological and petrological constraints in each of the study areas. In the model, depth to the dry solidus defines the bottom boundary of the conductive lid, while the potential temperature (Tp) controls the asthenosphere and LAB thermal structure. Combining the petrological and seismological constraints, the optimum estimates of Tp range from < 1300 to > 1500 °C, and depths to the LAB range from ~ 45 to 70 km. The highest Tp (> 1400°C) occurs just west of the Colorado Plateau. Upwelling of regionally hot and wet mantle creates widespread melting beneath the Basin and Range, which maintains the base of the lithosphere at its solidus.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are inherently dynamic, likely responsible for high variability of the boundary conditions acting during magma break-up, transport and deposition. Eruptive processes cannot be observed directly because of the hostile nature close to the eruptive vent(s) and the opaqueness of the volcanic edifice and suspended ash. Detailed observation of on-going eruptions and thorough descriptions of the related deposits have allowed for empirical relationships between eruption and deposit characteristics.\nMagma evolves during its ascent as a response to horizontal and vertical gradients of stress and temperature. This commonly results in strong vertical and horizontal gradients in crystallinity and porosity, potentially accentuated by heterogeneous strain distribution during flow. As a result, the ratio of dense to porous magma and the geometry of the gradient are largely unknown. Magma disintegration is largely controlled by its textural properties and the applied stress, leading to considerable variability in the fragmentation timescales and efficiency.\nMany deposits are investigated primarily through the analysis of key properties, selected grain size classes and small sample numbers. As flow deposits tend to show a significant textural variability, most quantitative analysis of explosive eruptions is done via the analysis of fall deposits. Their appearance (massive or stratified, degree of sorting) is a result from a combination of eruptive, transport and deposition processes and should therefore not straightforwardly be takes as a proxy for any of these. We show how magma textures and eruption condition may both affect the contribution to a certain granulometry class. For a qualitative reassembling of the magma column and a better understanding of the observed eruption dynamics, the described magma heterogeneity and the related response during an eruption has to be taken into account.",

However, the relative importance of soil diffusivity vs. methanotroph physiology has not been disentangled to date. Testing methanotroph physiology in the laboratory can lead to misleading results due to changes in the fine-scale habitat where methanotrophs reside. To assay the soil moisture sensitivity of methanotrophs under field conditions, we studied 22 field plots scattered across eight Great Plains grassland sites that differed in precipitation regime and soil moisture, making ca. bi-weekly measures during the growing seasons over three years. Quantification of methanotroph activity was achieved from chamber-based measures of methane uptake coincident with SF6-derived soil diffusivity, and interpretation in a reaction-diffusion model. At each plot, we also measured soil water content (SWC), soil temperature and inorganic nitrogen (N) contents. We also assessed methanotroph community composition via 454 sequencing of the pmoA gene. Statistical analyses showed that methanotroph activity had a parabolic response with SWC (concave down), and significant differences in the shape of this response among sites. Moreover, we found that the SWC at peak methanotroph activity was strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) of the site. The sequence data revealed distinct composition patterns, with structure that was associated with variation in MAP and soil texture. These results suggest that local precipitation regime shapes methanotroph community composition, which in turn lead to unique sensitivity of methane uptake rates with soil moisture. Our findings suggest that methanotroph activity may be more accurately modeled when the biological and environmental responses are explicitly described.",

The global land and atmosphere products use science algorithms developed by the NASA MODIS science team investigators. MODAPS completed Collection 6 reprocessing of MODIS Atmosphere science data products in April 2015 and is currently generating the Collection 6 products using the latest version of the science algorithms. This reprocessing has generated one of the longest time series of consistent data records for understanding cloud, aerosol, and other constituents in the earth’s atmosphere. It is important to carefully evaluate and assess the quality of this data and remove any artifacts to maintain a useful climate data record. Quality Assessment (QA) is an integral part of the processing chain at MODAPS. This presentation will describe the QA approaches and tools adopted by the MODIS Land/Atmosphere Operational Product Evaluation (LDOPE) team to assess the quality of MODIS operational Atmospheric products produced at MODAPS. Some of the tools include global high resolution images, time series analysis and statistical QA metrics. The new high resolution global browse images with pan and zoom have provided the ability to perform QA of products in real time through synoptic QA on the web. This global browse generation has been useful in identifying production error, data loss, and data quality issues from calibration error, geolocation error and algorithm performance. A time series analysis for various science datasets in the Level-3 monthly product was recently developed for assessing any long term drifts in the data arising from instrument errors or other artifacts. This presentation will describe and discuss some test cases from the recently processed C6 products. We will also describe the various tools and approaches developed to verify and assess the algorithm changes implemented by the science team to address known issues in the products and improve the quality of the products.",

            "abstract": "The land surface is a key component in seasonal forecasting, and well-represented soil moisture is particularly important for the simulation of heatwaves.\nMethods to represent uncertainties in the atmosphere of climate models have been shown to improve forecasts. However these methods have not yet been applied to the land surface component of climate models.\nWe consider three methods of incorporating uncertainties into CHTESSEL, the land surface model of the ECMWF forecasting system. These methods are: stochastic perturbation of soil moisture tendencies, static and then stochastic perturbation of key soil parameters. We present analysis of the results of fully coupled seasonal hindcasts with each method applied.\nWe find significant improvement for extreme events, particularly in terms of forecast reliability of upper and lower quintile soil moisture. These improvements also propagate into the atmosphere, impacting the reliability of seasonal-average predictions of latent and sensible heat flux anomalies and air temperature. This improvement is consistent over the hindcast, and also for particular cases such as the 2003 European summer (MacLeod et al 2015).\nWe also present work with an uncoupled version of CHTESSEL. Extending the method of Wood & Lettenmaier (2008), we quantify the global evolution over forecast lead-time of the relative magnitudes of initial condition, forcing and parameter uncertainty in the land surface. Among other things this gives some indication of where predictability from initial conditions is more persistent, and where uncertainty in land surface parameters has the largest impact on simulated soil moisture.\nMacLeod DA, CLoke, HL, Pappenberger F and Weisheimer AF (2015), Improved seasonal prediction of the hot summer of 2003 through better representation of uncertainty in the land surface, QJRMS\nWood, AW, and Lettenmaier DP (2008), An ensemble approach for attribution of hydrologic prediction uncertainty, GRL",

PM can be formed through chemical changes of precursors, including biogenic VOCs and anthropogenic SO2 and NOx often from fossil fuel combustion. In the past decades, PM pollution in the US has improved substantially. However, some areas in the Mid-Atlantic States are still designated as ‘moderate’ nonattainment by EPA. We utilize datasets obtained during the NASA 2011 DISCOVER-AQ campaign to characterize the composition and distribution of summertime PM pollution in the Mid-Atlantic States. Aircraft measurements and OMI satellite retrieval of major anthropogenic precursors (NO2 and SO2) are analyzed to investigate the regional transport of PM precursors from upwind sources. We compare PM concentration and chemical composition observed during the field campaign to CMAQ simulations with the latest EPA emission inventory. Specifically, we focus on the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemistry in CMAQ simulations using various biogenic VOCs estimates from the MEGAN and BEIS models. Airborne PM observations including PILS measurements from DISCOVER-AQ campaign and OMI retrievals of HCHO are also used to validate and improve the representation of SOA chemistry and PM pollution within CMAQ. The comparison reveals the source and evolution of PM pollution in the Mid-Atlantic States.",

            "abstract": "A number of researchers have reported on accelerated sea level along the east coast of North America, particularly in the northeast. We have previously modeled sea-level rates and accelerations from the last half of the 20th and early 21st centuries inferred from tide gauges in this region using steric sea-level changes, gravitationally self-consistent sea-level changes that includes self-attraction and loading (SAL), and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). We have found that, whereas the spatial variability of sea-level rates is dominated by GIA, the observed accelerations are not explained by these processes. In this talk, we first further investigate the observed accelerations, which we took to be constant during the study period. We have found, however, some evidence that the accelerations began in the timeframe 1990-2000. For example, the figure below shows the root-mean-square (rms) residual after removing a best-fit model wherein the acceleration was zero before the indicated year, for the Boston tide gauge, having one of the longest tide-gauge records. The minimimum rms residual occurs in the year 2000. A Monte Carlo simulation (red curve) shows that no time-dependence is expected from white noise. Evaluation of the statistical significance of these results has been difficult, since the postfit residuals are dominated by interannual variability. We will utilize time-dependent models for dynamic sea-level changes (including steric changes), GIA. For the Greenland ice mass, we will combine estimates of Greenland ice-mass variability obtained from recent analyses of GRACE data with long-term climate models for Greenland (from, e.g., RACMO) to calculate long-term sea-level impact. Comparing these models with tide-gauge data will yield insights into the nature and timing of accelerated sea level in this region. We will also discuss the implciations of these models for long-term global sea-level change.",

            "abstract": "The 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake ruptured a previously locked portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault (MHT) that has not slipped in a large event since 1833 (Mw7.6). The earthquake was well recorded by geodetic (SAR, InSAR and GPS) and seismic instruments. In particular, high-rate (5Hz) GPS channels provide waveform records at local distances, with three stations located directly above the major asperities of the earthquake. Here we derive a kinematic rupture model of the earthquake by jointly inverting the seismic and geodetic data, using a Kostrov source time function with variable rise times. Our inversion result indicates that the earthquake had a weak initiation and ruptured unilaterally along strike towards the ESE, with an average rupture speed of 3.0km/s and total duration of ~60s. The preferred slip rate of the beginning portion of the rupture had a longer rise time compared with the strongest ruptures, which took place at ~22s and ~35s after the origin, located 30km to the northwest and 20km to the east of the Kathmandu valley, respectively. The horizontal vibration and amplification of ground shaking in the valley was well recorded by one of the GPS stations (NAST) and the accelerometric station (KANTP), with a dominant frequency of 0.25Hz. A simplified basin model with top shear wave speed of 250 m/s and geometry constrained by a previous micro-tremor study can largely explain the amplification and vibration, realized by 3D staggered-grid finite difference simulations. This study shows that ground shaking can be strongly affected by complexities of the rupture and velocity structure.",

            "abstract": "Drought is a costly and widespread natural hazard, with the characteristics and occurrence of drought expected to change under the more intense hydrological cycle that is expected as a result of climate change. However, there is much uncertainty as to whether changes in drought occurrence have already taken place, with contrasting results from different studies, in part due to the use of different drought indices. Improved understanding of present day variation, and the drivers of such variation, are needed to better understand how future changes in climate may influence drought. Here, time series variation (including trends) is analysed for two widely-used drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index and Standardised Precipitation-Evaporation Index) for the entire European continent for the period 1958 onwards. By analysing precipitation-driven (SPI) and meteorological water balance-driven (SPEI) drought this analysis will be able to provide information on water deficits in both the precipitation-dominated north, and in the south (where evaporation is more important). The SPI and SPEI can be examined at a range of timescales, typically from 1 to 24 months, thus providing a comprehensive range of information about the presence and propagation of drought through land surface hydrological systems. In addition to analysis of time series variation, climate mechanisms associated with drought occurrence are investigated, thus providing information on the mechanisms driving variation in drought occurrence. Results indicate that recent time series variation is the result of both cyclical and directional drivers, and that to be better understood, European-scale drought needs to be considered within the context of a complex series of time-varying interactions between different modes of large-scale variation in the ocean-atmosphere system.",

            "abstract": "Neodymium isotopes of ferromanganese oxide coatings precipitated on planktonic foraminifera have been intensively used as a proxy for water mass reconstruction in the deep Atlantic and Indian Ocean, but their suitability is not well constrained in the Pacific and may be affected by enhanced inputs and scavenging relative to advection. In this study, Nd isotopes and Rare Earth Element (REE) concentrations of planktonic foraminifera from ~60 sites widely distributed throughout the Pacific are presented. We found that the REE pattern associated with planktonic foraminifera in our study and Fe-Mn oxides/coatings in the global ocean have a common heavy REE depleted pattern when normalized to their ambient seawater due to preferential removal of light REEs onto particles relative to heavy REEs during scavenging. The core-top εNd results agree with the proximal seawater compositions, indicating that planktonic foraminiferal coatings can give a reliable record of past changes in bottom water Nd isotopes in the Pacific. A good correlation between foraminifera Nd isotopes and seawater phosphate suggests that Nd with a predominantly radiogenic isotopic composition was probably added gradually along continental boundaries so that the Nd isotopic composition change paralleled the accumulation of nutrients in the deep Pacific. By confirming Nd isotopes as a reliable water mass tracer in the Pacific Ocean, this proxy is then applied to reconstruct how the water mass circulation changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Most of the cores in deep North Pacific show essentially invariant Nd isotopic compositions during the LGM compared with core-top values, suggesting that Nd isotope of Pacific end-member did not change during glacial times. However, the LGM Southwest Pacific cores have more radiogenic εNd than core-tops corroborating the previous findings of reduced inflow of North Atlantic Deep Water. The Eastern Equatorial Pacific cores above ~2 km showed consistently lower LGM εNd values, which might suggest a reduced influence of more radiogenic North Pacific Deep Water return flow. Taken together, our results indicate a slower Pacific overturning circulation during the glacial times, and the inflow and return flow of the Pacific meridional overturning were closely linked in the glacial-interglacial cycles.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the dynamic connection between SW-GW has been documented across a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. However this appreciation for dynamic GW exchange has not yet been fully incorporated into our interpretation and quantification of stream ecological processes. To address this, we explored the influence of GW exchange on estimates of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in real time over 4 months in a snowmelt-dominated catchment in Montana. We examine how metabolism varied seasonally, and assess how the relationship between GW exchange and in-stream processes evolved over the snowmelt-baseflow recession.\nTraditional 1-station metabolism methods do not fully incorporate hydrologic information into NEP estimates. They are generally insensitive to variation in discharge, and do not incorporate travel times or account for GW exchange. Here we demonstrate that failing to account for both gains and losses can bias NEP estimates and fluxes, particularly in systems with high rates of GW exchange. At our site, accounting for GW exchange during high flow conditions when GW-SW exchange was highest increased instantaneous NEP rates by 2.6 times. Over the entire growing season, this led to a 2.4-fold increase in cumulative growing season NEP.\nEcosystem metabolism is a biologically mediated process that is often obfuscated by physical hydrological processes. In order to assess the magnitudes of biotic processes, we must first disentangle them from co-occurring physical processes. We demonstrate that SW-GW exchange is an influential physical process that exerts a strong influence on metabolism estimates. We posit that incorporating GW into metabolism methods will influence NEP estimates across a wide range of systems, particularly those with high rates of exchange or strong seasonality in gains and losses. Incorporating hydrology more fully into stream ecological methods is necessary for accurate understanding and quantification of carbon cycling in streams.",

            "abstract": "Côte d'Ivoire located in West Africa, registers high level of biodiversity which occurs mainly in forest land. The country has suffered severe deforestation. However, deforestation and forest degradation release Greenhouse Gases into the atmosphere which contributes to Climate Change. In order to address the deforestation, many actions are taken, one of which is the implementation of protected areas within countries. These measures put restrictions on the access of local communities to forest services. However, local communities supplement their daily livelihood from forests, especially from timber and non-timber forest products. What are the effects of forests conservation in protected areas on surrounding population? This study focuses on the Bouaflé protected forest (foret classée de Bouaflé) in the western part of Côte d’Ivoire. The forest is 20350 ha and was made a protected forest in 1974. It is one of the most deforested protected areas in the country. Firstly, we described the perception of forest benefits by the population. Secondly, we estimated the benefits of forest conservation using a contingent valuation approach, particularly the Willingness to Pay (WTP) methodology. From our sample size of 156 households, it appears that most of the individuals are aware of the importance of the forest (94 % against 6%). According to the estimate of the benefits, it results on average, people are willing to pay 1658.491F CFA (2.53 Euros). The median WTP is 1000 FCFA. This study will be helpful by adding to the scientific literature and for inducing local people implication in conservation.",

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed tremendous scientific and technological advances in our ability to forecast climate variability and extremes, which are potentially useful to help operate and manage water resources systems with larger reliability and efficiency. However, many forecasts are rarely effectively used in practice and there is little evidence of incorporating them in real-world decision making. One of the main barriers of the uptake of forecasts, which is often cited by studies, is related to forecast uncertainty; however, even reliable forecasts alone are not sufficient to ensure the expected response. There exist other barriers that affect effective use of forecasts such as water managers’ behavior and institutional impediments. In fact, water managers make decisions in a sophisticated setting, which is on one hand affected by uncertainty and on the other hand constrained by regulations and policies. Therefore, it is not only important to recognize the various key individual challenges, but also critical to understand the interdependencies among them (Figure 1) in order to properly address the effective use of forecasts. This understanding is also essential to assess the expected value of forecasts information which is of high importance for decision makers prior to incorporating forecasts. The main objectives of this talk, which builds upon an extensive literature review of using forecasts in water resources and agricultural decision making, are to 1) address the key challenges limiting the uptake of forecast, 2) highlight the interdependency among different factors, and 3) shed light on how these insights can help improve the use of forecast in real-world practices.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved oxygen content defines two broad categories of subseafloor sediment. In areas with high rates of microbial respiration, most of the sediment column is anoxic and active anaerobic microbial communities are present for hundreds of meters or more below the seafloor. In these regions, O2 and aerobic communities penetrate only millimeters to centimeters into the sediment from the sediment-water interface. In some areas of active fluid flow through the underlying basalt, O2 may also penetrate meters upward into the sediment from the basalt. In areas with low sedimentary respiration, O2 and aerobic communities penetrate tens of meters downward from the seafloor and may persist throughout the entire sediment column. IODP Expedition 329 showed that microbial cells and aerobic respiration persist through the entire sediment sequence (to depths of at least 75 meters below seafloor) in the South Pacific Gyre. Extrapolating from these results and a global relationship of O2 penetration depth to sedimentation rate and sediment thickness, we suggest that oxygen and aerobic communities occur throughout the entire sediment sequence in 15–44% of the Pacific and 9–37% of the global seafloor. Subduction of sediment from largely anoxic regions and subduction of sediment and basalt from fully oxic regions are respectively sources of reduced and oxidized material to the mantle. The balance between oxic and anoxic regions has presumably changed considerably throughout Earth history. Regions with largely anoxic sediment and regions with fully oxic sediment present fundamentally different opportunities for understanding of (i) paleoceanographic history and (ii) the nature of microbial life under extreme energy limitations.",

Atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen can lead to acidification of surface water bodies (lakes, rivers, and coasts) and subsequent damage to aquatic ecosystems as well as damage to forests and vegetation. Louisiana has abundant water resources with approximately 11% of the total surface area composed of water bodies. It is important to protect water resources from excessive atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen. However, the information obtained from the observation systems for understanding the deposition of sulfur and nitrogen and the adverse effects in Louisiana is limited.\nThis study uses a source-oriented CMAQ model to simulate emission, formation, transport, and deposition of sulfur and nitrogen species in Louisiana. WRF is used to generate the meteorological inputs and SMOKE is used to generate the emissions based on national emission inventory (NEI). The forms and quantities of sulfur and nitrogen deposition from wet and dry processes in Louisiana will be discovered. The spatial and temporal variations of sulfur and nitrogen fluxes will be quantified and contributions of major source sectors or source regions will be quantified.",

            "abstract": "To understand the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) on dust surfaces, this study investigated the concentrations and compositions of dicarboxylic acids (C2-C11), keto-carboxylic acids (C3-C7), α-dicarbonyls and inorganic ions in size-segregated aerosols (9-stages) collected in Xi’an, China during the nondust storm and dust storm periods of 2009 and 2011. During the events the ambient particulate dicarboxylic acids were 932−2240 ng m-3, which are comparable and even higher than those in nondust periods. Molecular compositions of the above SOA are similar to those in nondust periods with oxalic acid being the leading species. In the presence of the dust storms, all the above mentioned SOA species in Xi’an were predominantly enriched on the coarse particles (>2.1μm), and oxalic acid well correlated with NO3- (R2=0.72, p<0.001) rather than SO42-.This phenomenon differs greatly from the SOA in any other nondust period that is characterized by an enrichment of oxalic acid in fine particles and a strong correlation of oxalic acid with SO42-. Our results further demonstrate that NO3- in the dust periods in Xi’an was mostly derived from secondary oxidation, whereas SO42- during the events was largely derived from surface soil of Gobi deserts. We propose a formation pathway to explain these observations, in which nitric acid and/or nitrogen oxides react with dust to produce Ca(NO3)2 and form a liquid phase on the surface of dust aerosols via water vapor-absorption of Ca(NO3)2, followed by a partitioning of the gas-phase water-soluble organic precursors (e.g.,glyoxal and methylglyoxal) into the aqueous-phase and a subsequent oxidation into oxalic acid. To the best of our knowledge, we found for the first time the enrichment of glyoxal and methylglyoxal on dust surface. Our data suggest an important role of nitrate in the heterogeneous formation process of SOA on the surface of Asian dust.",

The warmer waters off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula provided suitable habitats for taxa (i.e., sharks) that live today at lower latitudes. Stable isotope analysis of Eocene shark teeth provides a proxy to understand high latitude temperature gradients. However, shark ecology, in particular migration and occupation of tidal versus pelagic habitats, must be considered in the interpretation of stable isotope data. In this study, we analyze d18OPO4 values from the enameloid of Striatolamia (synonymized with Carcharias) shark teeth from the La Meseta formation (Seymour Island, Antarctica) to estimate paleotemperature in Early-Mid Eocene Antarctica, and assess the impact of ecology versus environmental signals on d18OPO4 values. We compare the ranges and offsets between our measured shark tooth d18OPO4 and published bivalve d18OCO3 values to test whether shark teeth record signals of migration across latitudinal temperature gradients, or instead reflect seasonal and long-term temporal variation across La Meseta stratigraphic units.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of the kinematics and duration of collisional events between the Chinese blocks and Siberia is still inadequate. Likewise, the accretionary history of the Central Asian fold belt itself is contentious. The primary goal for this study was to address key questions about the geographic positions of the Junggar Basin in Paleozoic and Mesozoic times and its tectonic relationship with other major Asian blocks by generating high-quality paleomagnetically inferred paleolatitudes and basin histories. Another objective is to see what it can tell us about intraplate motions within central Asia and to recognize vertical-axis tectonic rotations in the region. We collected 348 samples from 42 sites in Paleozoic and Mesozoic stratigraphic sections of east Junggar Basin. Useful results were obtained by progressive demagnetization for sandstone samples of Xiaoquan Formation dated paleontologically as mid to late Triassic. The ChRM direction for the Xiaoquan Formation is directed easterly with intermediate to steep downward inclination in geographic coordinates. After tectonic correction, the mean direction of the ChRM becomes northeasterly with intermediate to shallow inclination, which corresponds to a mean paleolatitude of 20.7° within a 95% confidence band of ± 12 degrees. It is obvious from the data that Junggar and other major parts of eastern Asia did not occupy the same relative positions in terms of paleolatitudes in Late Triassic. Paleomagnetic declinations indicate clockwise vertical-axis rotations of R = 98.3° +/- 16° for the Late Triassic rock unit relative to North China Block (NCB), and 12.4° +/- 16.2° relative to South China Block (SCB). The paleomagnetically inferred latitudinal displacements between Junggar and SCB are general statistically insignificant, as well as the rotational data. These data suggest that Junggar Basin may have been very close to SCB during the Triassic time. A plausible cause of the rotation is the westward rotational closure of the South and North China Blocks, which is inferred to have occurred during the Late Triassic according to several geologic and tectonic analyses.",

During a July 2015 R/V Atlantis expedition, scientists used the submersible Alvin to explore seep sites at depths of 300 to 1500 m. Study sites ranged from Norfolk Canyon north to New England Seep 2 and included Baltimore, Veatch, and Shallop Canyon sites, as well as new unnamed sites between Norfolk and Baltimore Canyons. Mussels dominated the seep sites (cf ‘’Bathymodiolus’’ childressi) but only small populations (<10s of individuals) were observed at seep sites associated with Shallop Canyon. B. heckerae, the dominant mussel at the Blake Ridge and Cape Fear seep sites (sites associated with salt diapirs off the Carolinas), appear to be present at only one of the Atlantic Margin seeps. At the Norfolk Canyon site, dead B. heckerae shells were observed and live individuals may be within the explored area. The abundant vesicomyid clam of Blake Ridge and Cape Fear sites was absent at the continental margin seeps. Apart from B. childressi, the most conspicuous megafaunal invertebrate species at the newly explored seeps was the red crab, Chaceon sp. and the rock crab, Cancer sp. These crabs are not seep endemic but they were especially abundant at the seeps and were observed to feed and mate on the seep grounds. Molecular tools will be used to explore the genetic structure of mussel populations from Norfolk to New England seeps, and stable isotope methods will be used to test for differences among sites in the source of carbon used by mussels. Alvin video transects and photo-mosaics will be used to collect data on macrofauna associated with seeps and to test the hypothesis that shallow seeps (300-500m) support more diverse assemblages than deep sites (1000-1500m).",

Initiated in 2009, OIB has conducted campaigns over the western Arctic Ocean (March/April) and Southern Oceans (October/November) on an annual basis when the thickness of sea ice cover is nearing its maximum. More recently, a series of Arctic surveys have also collected observations in the late summer, at the end of the melt season. The Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeter is one of OIB’s primary sensors, in combination with the Digital Mapping System digital camera, a Ku-band radar altimeter, a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) snow radar, and a KT-19 infrared radiation pyrometer. Data from the campaigns are available to the research community at:\nhttp://nsidc.org/data/icebridge/\n.\nThis presentation will summarize the spatial and temporal extent of the OIB campaigns and their complementary role in linking in situ and satellite measurements, advancing observations of sea ice processes across all length scales. Key scientific insights gained on the state of the sea ice cover will be highlighted, including snow depth, ice thickness, surface roughness and morphology, and melt pond evolution.",

            "abstract": "The dense spatial wavefield sampling provided by modern seismological acquisitions allows the resolution of the near-field focal spot. The large-amplitude focal spot emerges from the superposition of a collapsing, time reversed wavefront. We discuss an imaging method that is based on high resolution reconstructions of the focal spot that is obtained from cross correlation. This approach exploits the dependence of the spot's shape on local properties of the propagation medium, i.e., the distance of the first zero crossing is proportional to the wave length. We construct noise correlation functions from data collected by a highly-dense Nodal array centered on the San Jacinto fault zone south of Anza. The focal spot can be obtained from the amplitude distributions at zero lag time. We repeat this analysis using each geophone location as the collapsing point to which the wave length estimate is related. The anisotropic intensity of the converging wavefields leads to distorted focal spots. In addition, strong body and fault zone waves that are associated with the complex fault zone structure prohibit the straightforward analysis of the spatially variable zero-lag time distributions. We discuss strategies to mute the influence of the wavefield anisotropy and the removal of the body and fault zone wave components for improved reconstructions of the symmetric surface wave focal spot. The overall consistency of the local wave speed estimates from the zero crossing and images obtained with more traditional far-field travel time inversions validates the near-field approach. We discuss causes for the remaining inconsistencies and compare limits of the resolution in both cases. At higher frequencies (>3 Hz) both methods reveal a heterogeneous velocity structure that exhibits pronounced low-velocity zones. In addition, near-field based images obtained at wave lengths that are too large for the application of far-field methods suggest a strong velocity contrast across the fault.",

The recent rifting in the Andaman Sea initiated 4.5 Ma ago, rifting the Alcock and Seawell Rises that were formed by extensive volcanism between 23-16 Ma. The spreading started with a full spreading rate of 1.6 cm/yr and increased to 3.8 cm/yr in the last 2.5 Ma.\nWe have access to high-resolution deep seismic reflection data crossing the whole spreading center from the rifted volcanic provinces to the spreading center. The data show the whole oceanic crust up to the Moho. The Andaman Sea is covered with a thick pile of sediments that record the tectonic history of the rift system up to the spreading axis, allowing to decipher the whole process from rifting to spreading for the first time. We see a very rapid phase of transition from the rifting of the rises to the spreading in less than 20 km. Then a succession of at least 7 half-grabens is well recorded by the sediments on both sides of the spreading center. These half grabens are separated by outward tilted low angle detachment faults, which form the base of steeply dipping normal faults due to stretching. These low angle faults seem to connect with axial magma chambers that control evolution of the rift valley. We find that new detachment faults develop every 350,000 years, forming a new rift valley. The images of active normal faults within the central rift valley allow us to quantify the formation of oceanic crust by tectonic versus magmatic processes.",

Nitrate is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, and nitrate removal through denitrification can occur during infiltration in natural and anthropogenic systems, including during managed aquifer recharge (MAR). The rate of denitrification can vary depending on factors such as infiltration rate; previous work suggests that denitrification rates can increase monotonically with infiltration rates until reaching a critical threshold. We are performing controlled field tests of variables that affect denitrification rate, including sampling to link water chemistry changes to microbial ecology and activity. This study explores how microbial activity and denitrification rates respond to different infiltration rates and the presence or absence of a reactive material (wood chips, a carbon source). We are conducting four two-week-long tests, each under different conditions. For each test, we measure bulk infiltration rate (the sum of lateral and vertical infiltration), vertical infiltration rate using heat as a tracer, and water level. We collect surface and subsurface water samples daily, and we collect soil samples at the start and end of each test. For each water sample, we are measuring NO3–, NO2–, NH3, DOC, and N and O isotopes in nitrate. Soil samples will be tested for grain size, total C/N, and the presence of microbiological genes associated with denitrification. These results will expand our knowledge of the conditions under which denitrification occurs by implicating specific microorganisms and physical infiltration parameters. Our design has the potential for additional experimentation with variables that impact water chemistry during infiltration. This study has broad applications for designing MAR systems that effectively improve water supply and water quality.",

            "abstract": "Landscape patterns of shallow water table dynamics are strongly variable, largely driven by the influences of subsurface lateral water redistribution and evapotranspiration. While we recognize that landscape context affects the movement of water through a catchment, we still have a limited understanding of the relationship between water table dynamics and landscape position. Even less understood is how these dynamics vary across many locations, and how they vary year to year, due to the lack of long duration and high frequency water table measurements across a range of landscape positions. To disentangle the relationship between landscape context and response, we analyzed six years of hourly shallow groundwater levels across 26 instrumented hillslope-riparian landscape transitions within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (central Montana). To compare shallow groundwater level signals, we extracted several annual metrics related to response magnitude, connectivity, variability, and flashiness. Landscape influence was quantified in terms of statistical descriptors of upgradient topographic distributions across the 26 delineated hillslopes. For all wells, we explored relationships between landscape characteristics and water table response as well as water table response and streamflow. We compared these relationships between years, enabling us to identify parts of the landscape that were more stable versus more variable with respect to climate. Overall, the complex relationships between vegetation, topography, and climate led to variable water table dynamics that are well explained in some locations but widely changing and poorly predicted in others. Observations that span space and time not only improve our understanding of connections between the landscape and the hydrologic behavior it defines, but help to identify where the gaps in our understanding, in both space and time, still exist.",

            "abstract": "The summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO), which is strongly related to changes in Atlantic and European summer storm tracks and the latitudinal position of the jet stream, exerts a strong influence on rainfall, temperature, and cloudiness and is related to summer extremes, such as droughts and floods, mainly in Europe. Reconstructions suggest that the SNAO was mainly negative during the last several centuries until the mid-twentieth century when it entered a positive phase, and climate model projections have suggested a predominantly positive SNAO under future global warming. However, during the recent decade, the SNAO has mainly been in a negative phase, along with a southerly shift in the jet stream, accompanied by wet and cool summers in northwest Europe. Sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic (related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO) strongly influence the SNAO, and the current positive phase of the AMO has likely played some role in the recent downturn of the SNAO. Additionally, we found a consistent association between winter/spring Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC), particularly in the Labrador and Nordic seas, and the SNAO over the last decades based on observations. However, since the 1990s the strength of the correlations with the regional SIC has changed, weakening over the Labrador Sea and strengthening over Barents Sea. This is particularly evident during the last decade. Possibly this is a response to the rapid changes in Arctic sea ice. To test this, a new tree-ring based reconstruction of the SNAO as well as CMIP5 model runs are used to examine the influence of Arctic sea ice on the summer atmospheric circulation over northwestern Europe in a long-term context.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotope measurements of authigenic carbonate from Cleland Lake (British Columbia), Paradise Lake (British Columbia), and Lime Lake (Washington) provide an ~9,000 year Holocene record of precipitation-evaporation balance variations in the Pacific Northwest. Both Cleland Lake and Paradise Lake are small, surficially closed-basin systems with no active inflows or outflows. Lime Lake is surficially open with a seasonally active overflow. We sampled the lake sediment cores at 1-60 mm intervals (~3-33 years per sample on average) and measured the isotopic composition of fine-grained, authigenic CaCO3 in each sample. Negative δ18O values, which indicate wetter conditions in closed-basin lakes, occur in Cleland Lake and Paradise Lake sediment during the mid-Holocene and are followed by more positive δ18O values, which suggest drier conditions, in the late Holocene. The δ18O record from Lime Lake, which principally reflects changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation, exhibits less variability than the closed-basin lake records and follows an increasing trend from the mid-Holocene to present. Power spectrum analysis of the Cleland Lake δ18O data from 1,000 yr BP to present demonstrates significant periodicities of ~6 and ~67 years that likely reflect the enhancement of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the late Holocene with an associated multidecadal (i.e., 50 to 70 yr) component of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Results from mid-Holocene (6,000 yr BP) climate model simulations conducted as part of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) indicate that in much of western North America, the cold season was wetter, and the warm season (April–September) was considerably drier (relative to the late Holocene), leading to an overall drier climate in western North America but with enhanced hydroclimatic seasonality. This is consistent with inferences from the Cleland and Paradise Lake δ18O records, which lake modeling experiments indicate are strongly influenced by cold season precipitation-evaporation balance. This also helps to explain apparent inconsistencies between the lake δ18O records and other proxies of hydroclimatic change from the greater Pacific Northwest region that indicate relatively drier conditions during the mid-Holocene.",

HFAs are universal phenomena that have been observed near the bow shock of Earth, Venus, Mars, and Saturn. HFAs are not stable structures and they evolve with time. Statistical study shows that both ion and electron spectra can be used to classify young and mature HFAs. HFAs were also classified into four categories (“-+”, “+-”, “M”, and “W”) according their dynamic pressure profile. Most “W” type HFAs are mature HFAs (according to ion spectra) and most “-+” and “+-” type HFAs are young HFAs. Half of the “M” type HFAs are mature HFAs. Superposed epoch analysis result shows that variations of plasma parameters and magnetic field of mature HFAs are more dramatic than those of young HFAs, except for temperature. “M\" and “W\" type HFAs may be the later evolution stages of “-+\" and “+-\" type HFAs; on the other hand, four categories of HFAs may be due to the fact that the spacecraft crossed an HFA structure along different paths.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of seismic process in terms of non-linear dynamics of a hierarchical system of blocks-and-faults and deterministic chaos, has already led to reproducible intermediate-term middle-range prediction of the great and significant earthquakes. The technique based on monitoring charcteristics of seismic static in an area proportional to source size of incipient earthquake is confirmed at the confidence level above 99% by statistics of Global Testing in forward application from 1992 to the present. The semi-annual predictions determined for the next half-year by the algorithm M8 aimed (i) at magnitude 8+ earthquakes in 262 circles of investigation, CI’s, each of 667-km radius and (ii) at magnitude 7.5+ earthquakes in 180 CI’s, each of 427-km radius are communicated each January and July to the Global Test Observers (about 150 today). The pre-fixed location of CI’s cover all seismic regions where the M8 algorithm could run in its original version that requires annual rate of activity of 16 or more main shocks.\nAccording to predictions released in January 2015 for the first half of 2015, the 25 April 2015 Nepal MwGCMT = 7.9 earthquake falls outside the Test area for M7.5+, while its epicenter is within the accuracy limits of the alarm area for M8.0+ that spread along 1300 km of Himalayas. We note that (i) the earthquake confirms identification of areas prone to strong earthquakes in Himalayas by pattern recognition (Bhatia et al. 1992) and (ii) it would have been predicted by the modified version of the M8 algorithm aimed at M7.5+. The modified version is adjusted to a low level of earthquake detection, about 10 main shocks per year, and is tested successfully by Mojarab et al. (2015) in application to the recent earthquakes in Eastern Anatolia (23 October 2011, M7.3 Van earthquake) and Iranian Plateau (16 April 2013, M7.7 Saravan and the 24 September 2013, M7.7 Awaran earthquakes).",

            "abstract": "During the last decades, geodetic tools like C-GPS allowed the detection of slow slip events associated with transient motion below the seismogenic zone. This new class of fault motion lead us to revise the standard version of the seismic cycle simply including coseismic, postseismic and interseismic phases. Most of these discoveries occurred on subduction margins in various places like Japan, Cascadia, Chile and Indonesia. By contrast, GPS and strainmeters have provided little evidence of slow slip beneath the seismogenic zone of large continental faults like the San Andreas fault or the North Anatolian fault. Because the detectability of such motions is mostly tributary from instrumental precision, we examine the theoretical capability of tiltmeter arrays for detecting horizontal motion of a buried vertical fault.\nWe define the slipping part of the strike-slip fault like a buried rectangular patch submitted to horizontal motion. This motion provides horizontal and vertical surface deformation as a function of both patch geometry (length, width, depth) and motion amplitude. Using a dislocation buried at 15km depth, we compute the maximum motion and tilt as a function of seismic moment. Assuming yields of detectability of 1mm for GPS horizontal motion and 10 nrad for a tiltmeter, we show that small slip events could be better detected using high resolution and stability tiltmeters. We then examine how tiltmeters arrays could be used for such a purpose. In particular, we discuss how to deal with usual problems often plaguing tiltmeters data like instrumental drift, borehole coupling and hydrological strain.",

(2015) showed that the shortwave radiative forcing by the stratocumulus over the southeast Pacific (SEP) is much enhanced by anthropogenic aerosols from South America. Here we further investigate the aerosol-stratocumulus interactions on the process level using the WRF-Chem model which explicitly simulates the aerosol emissions and formations. Two cloud microphysics schemes are used: the widely-applied Lin scheme and the physics-based two-moment scheme used in Chen et al. (2015). The simulations with the Lin scheme captured some observed features of aerosols (e.g., aerosol mass and optical depth decreases westward along 20°S) and key aerosol-cloud microphysics interactions (e.g., more cloud droplet numbers near the coast). However, biases were also noticed, such as the overestimation of cloud droplet number near the coast, and the underestimation of aerosol concentration over the remote ocean. These could be caused by the inadequacy in cloud process parameterization, such as a lack of aerosol recycling from rain droplets in coupling with chemistry and microphysical modules (Saide et al, 2012). The two-moment scheme that explicitly addresses these processes is expected to minimize the biases. Detailed investigations of the cloud microphysics processes using the two schemes, and, to the extent possible, comparisons with observations will be presented and discussed.\nChen, G.-X., W.-C.

            "abstract": "A large number of people live in coastal areas using the available water resources, which in (semi-)arid regions are often taken from groundwater resources. Compared to surface water, these usually provide a safe water supply due to the remediation and retention capabilities of the subsurface, their high yield, and potentially longer term stability. With a water withdrawal from a coastal aquifer, coastal water management, however, has to ensure that seawater intrusion is retained in order to keep the water salinity at an acceptable level for all water users (e.g. agriculture, industry, households).\nBesides monitoring of water levels and saline intrusion, it has become a common practice to use numerical modeling for evaluating the coastal water resources and projecting future scenarios. When applying a model, it is necessary for the simplifications implied during the conceptualization of the setup to include the relevant processes (here variable-density flow and mass transport) and sensitive parameters (for a steady state commonly hydraulic conductivity, density ratio, dispersivity).\nAdditionally, the model’s boundary conditions are essential to the simulation results. In order to reduce the number of elements, and thus, the computational burden, one simplification that is made in most regional scale saltwater intrusion applications, is to represent the shelf with a vertical boundary, contrary to the natural conditions, that usually show a very shallow decent of the interface between the aquifer and the open sea water.\nWe use the scientific open-source modeling toolbox OpenGeoSys [1] to quantify the influence of this simplification on the saline intrusion. Using an ensemble of different shelf shapes for a steady state setup, we identified a significant dependency of saline intrusion length on the geometric parameters of the shelf. With these simplified setups (homogeneous aquifer, steady state), the drawn conclusions provide valuable insight for real-world applications that potentially overestimate the saline intrusion length.\n[1] Kolditz, O., et al.

            "abstract": "We analyze large numbers of regional seismograms recorded on about 260 broadband permanent stations to measure Q of crustal Lg waves in eastern Eurasia using two-station based methods. Extracting reliable Q from observed spectra is difficult in that they are tightly coupled with source spectra, site response and geometric spreading. The two-station (TS), as well as its improvements, reversed two-station (RTS) and reversed two-event (RTE) provides the most reliable methods in estimating Q as they are able to efficiently cancel out source spectra, as well as site responses and instrument responses from spectral ratio of observed seismograms, but they all require restricted recording geometries. Our recording stations consist of backbone national seismic stations across China, regional stations in the western China, and IRIS stations around China, forming a densely and evenly distributed virtual seismic network that makes these two-station based methods desirable. After strict data quality screening, thousands of interstation path-variable Q measurements are collected. They are used to invert for Lg Qo and η and yield tomographic models of lateral variation.\nThe most striking low Qo region is in and around the Tibetan plateau where Qo is generally below 200. The low Qo regions also include the Qaidam and Sichuan basins, probably reflecting thick sedimentary structure on the top of crust. The regions in north and west of China, including the Tarim basin, the Ordos basin and Inner Mongolia, have Qo around 500. The Qo values continue increasing to 600 – 800 in the Tianshan, the Altai, and Mongolia in the north. To the eastern China, Qo values are around 550 – 600 in the Sino-Korean craton, Yangtze craton and South China blocks.\nThe major distribution of η values concentrates on 0.33 – 0.47 with a mean at 0.45±0.21. This average of η is higher than that derived from previous study using TS method, but close to the mean using Lg coda or joint inversion of source spectra and Lg Q. However, such comparison is superficial because our study region is not exactly the same as the other studies, and the estimates of η usually contain higher uncertainties than Qo. Moreover, the ratio of site responses derived from RTS method exhibits complicated patterns with frequencies, and makes it a non-ignorable term in estimating Qo and η.",

            "abstract": "Numerical climate models render data in a gridded format which is often problematic for integrated analysis with other kinds of data in jurisdictional formats. In this paper a joint analysis of municipal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) and predicted temperature increase was undertaken in order to estimate different levels of human and economic exposure. This is based on a method of converting model outputs into a country municipal grid which enabled depicting climate predictions from the Eta-Hadgem2-ES Regional Climate Model (RCM) into the municipal level in Brazil. The conversion to country municipality grid was made using a combination of interpolation and buffering techniques in ArcGIS for two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and three timeframes (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100) for mean temperature increase and number of heatwave days (WSDI).\nThe results were used to support the Third National Communication (TCN) of Brazil to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and show a coherent matching of the gridded output from the original RCM. The joint climate and GDPc analysis show that in the beginning of the century the more severe warming is centred over regions where GDPc is generally higher (Centre-West and Southeast). At the end of the century, critical levels of warming spread north and northeastwards where municipalities have the lowest GDPc levels. In the high emission scenario (RCP 8.5) the strongest warming and the spreading over poorer regions is anticipated to the mid-century. These results are key to further explore solutions for climate change adaptation based on current resources and prepare in different sectors, for long-term risk management and climate adaptation planning strategies.",

            "abstract": "The recent retreat of many of Greenland’s marine terminating glaciers has been coincident with a period of anomalously warm ocean temperatures. It has been hypothesised that warming ocean waters may affect the stability of glacier termini through an increase in the rate of submarine melting or a decrease in the buttressing influence of sea ice and icebergs, both of which could drive an increase in the rate of mass loss through calving. As Greenland’s outlet glaciers typically terminate at the head of lengthy fjord systems, the availability of oceanic heat at the calving front is however dependent not only on the temperature of the water around the Greenland coast, but also on the advection of this heat towards the glaciers by the circulation of the fjord. Assessment of spatial and temporal variation in this up-fjord heat transport may therefore provide a means of examining the role of the ocean in forcing the dynamic variability of these glaciers.\nThe rate at which oceanic heat is delivered to a particular glacier is likely to depend on a range of environmental factors. These may be oceanic (e.g. shelf water temperature), atmospheric (e.g. glacial melt water input, the strength of along-fjord and along-shelf winds) or topographic (e.g. fjord depth, length, width or sinuosity). Here we assess the sensitivity of up-fjord heat flux to each of these parameters by undertaking a suite of experiments using an ocean model (MITgcm), applied to an idealised fjord system. Through this, we identify those factors that are of greatest importance in controlling the delivery of oceanic heat to Greenland’s marine-terminating glaciers. Our experiments facilitate assessment of 1) how the influence of the ocean may differ from one marine-terminating glacier to the next and 2) how the oceanic forcing of these glaciers may have changed, and continue to change, over time in response to varying environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Sediment is considered a source of water quality impairment in many streams but is also an essential component of lotic ecosystems. Assessment of water quality impairment related to sediment, in contrast to synthetic chemicals, requires a framework to account for the influence of natural physiographic factors before any impairment can be attributed to anthropogenic factors. A conceptual sediment balance was applied to account for the size and stability fo bed material in a synoptic investigation of 100 streams in the midwestern US conducted collaboratively through the USGS National Water Quality Assessment and US EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys. Basin slope and water surface gradient serve as indicators of sediment supply and transport capacity, respectively, that are associated with variation in the size of bed material across sites in the investigation. Given this general model, urban development, reservoirs, and agricultural land use emerge as other significant factors influencing the particle size-distribution of stream bed material. Sediment loading, which presumes a monotonic relation between impairment and sediment supply, is an incomplete and potentially misleading description of how anthropogenic factors influence the quality of small streams. A sediment balance provides a better conceptual model for assessing stream quality impairment because it can identify both excess and lack of sediment. A sediment balance provides additional information about whether transport capacity or sediment supply may be causal factors and how management of these factor is likely to influence stream quality.",

            "abstract": "Exchange of water between the atmosphere and biosphere via evapotranspiration (ET) influences global hydrological, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. Isotopic analysis has shown that evapotranspiration over the continents is largely dominated by transpiration. Water is taken up from soil by plant roots, transported through the plant’s vascular system, and evaporated from the leaves. Yet current Land Surface Models (LSMs) integrated into Earth System Models (ESMs) treat plant roots as passive components. These models distribute the ET sink vertically over the soil column, neglect the vertical pressure distribution along the plant vascular system, and assume that leaves can directly access water from any soil layer within the root zone. Numerous studies have suggested that increased warming due to climate change will lead drought and heat-induced tree mortality. A more mechanistic treatment of water dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is essential for investigating the fate of ecosystems under a warmer climate.\nIn this work, we describe a 3D SPAC model that can be coupled to a LSM. The SPAC model uses the variably saturated Richards equations to simulate water transport. The model uses individual governing equations and constitutive relationships for the various SPAC components (i.e., soil, root, and xylem). Finite volume spatial discretization and backward Euler temporal discretization is used to solve the SPAC model. The Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) is used to numerically integrate the discretized system of equations. Furthermore, PETSc’s multi-physics coupling capability (DMComposite) is used to solve the tightly coupled system of equations of the SPAC model. Numerical results are presented for multiple test problems.",

We show how the fluid and MHD equations can be written in multi-symplectic form using multi-momenta (the de Donder Weyl approach) in which both space and time are placed on an equal footing. We illustrate how this approach gives rise to both local and non-local conservation laws for both barotropic and non-barotropic gases. We obtain the symplecticity and pullback conservation laws for 1D gas dynamics and for the multi-dimensional gas and MHD equations. For the case of a non-barotropic gas, the helicity and cross helicity conservation laws are nonlocal conservation laws. A similar nonlocal conservation law also applies for 1D, non-barotropic gas dynamics, in which a nonlocal variable corresponding to the integral of the temperature back along the fluid path, keeps track of the history of the fluid element.",

Advanced Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave (IM-CW) lidar techniques are being investigated as a means of facilitating CO2 measurements from space and airborne platforms to meet the mission science measurement requirements. In recent numerical, laboratory and flight experiments we have successfully used the Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation technique to uniquely discriminate surface lidar returns from intermediate aerosol and cloud returns. We demonstrate the utility of BPSK to eliminate sidelobes in the range profile as a means of making Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) column CO2 measurements in the presence of intervening optically thin clouds, thereby minimizing bias errors caused by the clouds. Furthermore, high accuracy and precision ranging to the Earth’s surface as well as to the top of intermediate cloud layers, which is a requirement for the inversion of column CO2 number density measurements to column CO2 mixing ratios, has been demonstrated using new hyperfine interpolation techniques that takes advantage of the periodicity of the modulation waveforms. This approach works well for both BPSK and linear swept-frequency modulation techniques and provides very high (at sub-meter level) range resolution. The BPSK technique under investigation has excellent auto-correlation properties while possessing a finite bandwidth. A comparison of BPSK and linear swept-frequency is also discussed in this paper. These techniques are used in a new data processing architecture to support the ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator (ACES) and ACT-America programs.",

            "abstract": "In the past century engineering projects and changes in land use significantly modified the hydrology and the sediment supply of large sand bed rivers all over the world. Field studies documented the river responses to the imposed changes, which can be summarized as adjustments in channel geometry, slope, and/or characteristics of the bed material. Further, one-, two- and three-dimensional river morphodynamic models were used to predict the fluvial system response to the imposed changes at time scales ranging from few months up to several decades. Notwithstading this previous research effort, the spatial and temporal scales of river adjustment, as well as quantitative predictions of the river responses, are still a matter of debate due to the difficulties associated with the interpretation of limited field datasets and with the large scale sediment transport modeling. Here we present the preliminary results of a study of the Missouri River response to the construction of dams, i.e. reduction in flood flow and sediment supply. In particular, we first compare the numerical results of a one-dimensional model of river morphodynamics for large, low slope sand bed rivers with field data to validate the model. The validated model is then used to constrain the spatial and temporal scales of the river adjustment, i.e. bed degradation in the Missouri River case. In other words, our numerical work focuses on how the magnitude and speed of the wave of channel bed degradation changes in time and space for the Missouri River case and how these scales change for different values of the ratio between pre- and pos-dam flow rates, and pre- and post-dam sediment loads.",

From EM wave velocity data, we can estimate dielectric permittivity of the soil. The dielectric permittivity is then used to calculate volumetric water contents from one of empirically derived equations relating dielectric permittivity and volumetric water content. In many GPR surveys, wide angle reflection and refraction (WARR) or common midpoint (CMP) survey techniques with a pair of GPR antennas are used to obtain EM wave velocities. WARR and CMP, however, are not suitable to monitor dynamic processes, such as soil water infiltration processes, as it takes time to complete each survey.\nA multi-offset (MO) GPR survey technique allows one to obtain EM wave velocity profiles in short time by scanning soil profiles with multiple GPR antennas. In this study, the MO GPR survey was used to monitor changes in soil water content distribution during infiltration test. A field experiment was conducted at an experimental field at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology where top soils consisted mainly with well aggregated volcanic as soils. The GPR system used in this study was composed of a transmitter and multiple receivers of 250 MHz GPR. Ground truth of soil water content was obtained simultaneously with soil moisture sensors such as Profile Probe.",

Prior to its 2011 magmatic eruption, several phreatic eruptions occurred on August 2008 and March, April, May, June and July 2010. Using time series InSAR from 2007-2011 ALOS PALSAR data, we found a small deflating area around Shinmoe-dake volcano summit and a relatively large inflating area on the northwest of Shinmoe-dake volcano, before 2011 Kirishima, Shinmoe-dake eruption. Modeling constrained from both InSAR and dense regional GPS network data revealed deep and shallow deformation sources for Kirishima volcano. This double sources system would help us better understand the complex process of volcanic deformation.",

This question can only be answered with comparisons to observational datasets, yet these datasets are typically spatially sparse and temporally brief. This paper addresses the question of how long a dataset needs to be to give a reliable assessment of the “true” value of various metrics of land-atmosphere coupling strength. We demonstrate that the amount of data required to obtain robust estimates of metrics assessing relationships between variables is greater than that necessary to constrain means of directly-measured observables such as temperature or precipitation. Moreover, while the addition of unbiased noise does not significantly alter the mean of a directly observable quantity, inclusion of such noise degrades metrics assessing connections between variables, yielding a unidirectional and negative impact on metric strength estimates. This analysis suggests that longer records of surface observations are required to correctly estimate land-atmosphere coupling strength than are required to estimate mean values of the observed quantities.",

            "abstract": "Overpressure within a magma chamber is a key parameter to understanding the onset of an eruption. Recent investigations indicate that surface inflation at a volcanic edifice does not always precede eruption (Chaussard and Amelung, 2012; Biggs et al., 2014), suggesting that the overpressure threshold may differ between volcanoes. To understand the failure conditions of a magma reservoir, mechanical models were developed to quantify the range of overpressure affordable in a reservoir for a given situation. Even if the choice of the failure criterion is still debated, most investigators agree that the overpressure required to fail the magma reservoir is at first order a function of the crustal stress field and the shape of the magma reservoir. Radar interferometry (InSAR) provides a large dataset of ground deformation worldwide, but many of these InSAR studies continue to use point or dislocation sources (Mogi, Okada) to explain deformation on volcanoes. Even if these simple solutions often fit the data and estimate the depth and the volume change of the source of deformation, key parameters such as the magma overpressure or the mechanical properties of the rocks cannot be derived. We use mechanical numerical models of reservoir failure combined with ground deformation data. It has been observed that volume change before an eruption can easily range one or two order of magnitude from 1-100x106 m3. The first goal of this study is to understand which parameter(s) control the critical volume changes just before the failure of the reservoir. First, a parametric study is performed to quantify the effect of the geometry of the reservoir (radius, depth), the local stress (compressive/extensive) and even the crust rheology (elastic/viscoelastic). We then compare modeling results with several active volcanoes where long time series of volume change are available: Okmok and Westdahl in Alaska, Sinabung and Agung in Indonesia and Galapagos. For each case, the maximum overpressure expected inside the reservoir is estimated and constraints on mechanical parameters of the rocks such as the tensile strength and the shear modulus are provided.",

            "abstract": "During rapid rise flood events, crevasse-splay complexes are a key conduit through which sediment and water are passed from the main channel onto the floodplain, particularly for large rivers. These crevasse-splay systems may therefore be key loci of floodplain sedimentation, as well as conditioning the location of avulsions. As such they may preserve climatic signals within the depositional record of large alluvial rivers. Despite recent advances in our capabilities to model the development and evolution of these systems, our understanding of the passage, storage and reworking of water and sediment across them remains relatively poor. A key limitation concerns the point that, since floodplain topography is a first-order control on the hydrodynamics of crevasse-splays, publicly available topographic data sets (e.g. SRTM, ASTER) are currently unable to resolve key processes at the necessary spatial resolution.\nHere we employ Structure-from-Motion (SfM) on low-level aerial photography to obtain high-resolution (3m grid cell) georectified topographic data (horizontal error = 0.02 m; vertical error = 0.2 m) for a representative crevasse-splay complex (27 km2) located along the Mekong River, Cambodia. We use the coupled hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model, Delft-3D to simulate sedimentation patterns for a series of idealised and observed rapid-rise flood events. We model floodplain deposition and erosion and validate simulated spatial and temporal variations against observed patterns of sedimentation determined through analysis of 210Pb geochronology of a network of floodplain cores and in-situ, post-event surface scrapings.",

            "abstract": "The ANDRILL 2A core contains a succession of Neogene glaciomarine deposits, cemented by up to 20 wt% carbonate. Isotopic analysis of the cements yielded extremely negative d18O values, indicating either formation from isotopically negative fluids or at extremely high temperature. In outcrop, such values could be interpreted as being the result of meteoric diagenesis, but the lack of any exposure horizons in the core precludes such an interpretation. A previous study of the pore fluids described a brine below 200m, with an extremely negative δ18O value (c. -10‰), probably formed by batch-freezing seawater on the continental margin. The present study integrates ∆47­ values of the cements with traditional approaches to further assess the nature of diagenetic fluids and processes. Isotopic data suggest three sources of carbonate: marine, methane reducing, and the aforementioned brines. Marine carbonate indicates δ13C and water δ18O within the range typical of seawater (c. -1‰), whereas the cryogenic brines show more negative values. A few samples exhibited extremely low δ13C values, the lowest below -25‰; the only feasible source for these cements would be the oxidation of methane. The shallow cements’ signatures diminish with depth as cryogenic brines begin to dominate the isotopic signal. Biogenic materials show an increased influence of this brine at depth, the deepest buried shells are isotopically indistinguishable from adjacent cements. These analyses show that these cryogenic brines play a major role in the diagenetic history of this site. Clumped isotopic results support previous interpretations using traditional methods, which have identified cryogenic brine as a major cementing agent in the subsurface of Southern McMurdo Sound. Because cryogenic brines have likely formed throughout Earth history, results have the potential to change the way diagenesis is evaluated in sedimentary successions that formed in polar environments.",

            "abstract": "Past climatic hyperthermals, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), provide imperfect but useful geological analogs to human-induced climate warming. Changes in terrestrial biota, hydrology, sedimentary processes, and climate patterns during past abrupt warming events provide valuable insights to the intensity of climate impacts on water and carbon cycles on land. Carbon isotope excursions (CIE) that accompany warming are often documented first in marine records, and then used to connect events from sea to land, and across diverse terrestrial environments. As a result, CIE are highly valuable chemostratigraphic signals, even though their records on land can be noisy. Isotopic records of organic carbon in terrestrial environments are widespread and preserved even when carbonate records are lacking. While readily measured, they are often less reliable, exhibiting both enhanced noise and attenuated signals relative to marine and inorganic records. Soil organic matter is subject to extensive carbon loss, selective preservation, and the inputs of refractory, allochthonous carbon. This is particularly true during the PETM, and new records and quantitative treatments lend insights to the relative influence of each.\nPatterns in preservation are not the only source of isotope variability in terrestrial organic carbon. Landscapes also experience strong heterogeneity in biomass production, transport, and deposition, all of which are sensitive to geographic and ecological patterns in water and carbon dynamics. Lipid biomarkers from ancient plants provide useful tools to recognize and circumvent this complexity. In particular, insights to ecological and climatic patterns can be gained from abundances and isotopic characteristics of taxon-specific compounds. Biomarkers also can help resolve the influence of marine organic carbon when terrestrial materials are deposited in coastal or marginal marine settings.\nThis presentation will illustrate the challenges and opportunities in interpreting terrestrial records of the PETM CIE using bulk and biomarker data from the eastern coastal US and intermountain basins of Wyoming and Colorado.",

Dating sediments deposited in the last few centuries is difficult due to the uncertainty range of radiocarbon ages, bioturbation, and anthropogenic disturbance of systems. Here we show a variety of proxy records throughout the top 2 m of sediment in Carpinteria Marsh, southern California including charcoal, grain size, pollen, scanning XRF, and spheroidal carbon particle stratigraphies. We use the combination of these records to correlate stratigraphy and identify sedimentological evidence of documented historical storm occurrences, tsunami impacts, land use changes, and fire events. We show the sedimentation rate of the historical period varies from ~1 mm/yr to 5 mm/yr throughout the marsh, while long term rates of sedimentation are ~2 mm/yr. Sedimentation rates are also not consistent temporally, since the record is punctuated by periods of rapid or absent deposition. Multi-proxy comparisons can aid attempts to identify evidence of historical coastal hazards and correlate deposits despite variability in sedimentary processes throughout an estuary.",

            "abstract": "China is facing increasingly severe water pollution issue with rapid socio-economic development. Non-point source pollution, which is rarely monitored, has become the main forms of water pollution in China. In this study, the Geomorphology-Based Non-point source Pollution (GBNP) model was used to simulate the processes of rain-runoff, soil erosion, sediment routing and pollutant transport in the Songhua River basin from 2001 to 2010. The spatio-temporal variation of non-point source pollution and river water quality were analyzed based on the simulation outputs. In the entire basin, the annual mean loading of TN, TP and soil erosion are 270,000 ton/a, 42,200 ton/a and 55,900,000 ton/a, respectively. The point and non-point source pollution respectively account for 44.9% and 55.1% in TN loading. For TP loading, the proportions of point and non-point source pollution are 14.4% and 85.6%, respectively. It suggests that the non-point source pollution control and treatments should be paid more attention in the Songhua River basin. The inter-annual and intra-annual variations of non-point source pollution components and potential driving mechanisms are further examined. The annual loading of soil erosion, TN and TP are highly correlated with annual runoff, with the correlation coefficients of 0.75, 0.91 and 0.92, respectively, which implies that rain-runoff could be the main driving force of non-point pollution. The monthly sediment concentration in the watercourse is high in flood season and low in non-flood season, which agrees well with the seasonality of monthly runoff. By contrast, the concentrations of TN and TP in watercourse show the opposite features.",

In response to this catastrophe and in line with the Nairobi Declaration of the Heads of States Summit regarding the crisis, and building on the experience and expertise of its International Hydrological programme, UNESCO launched the Groundwater Resources Investigation for Drought Mitigation in Africa Programme (GRIDMAP). Through GRIDMAP the Turkana groundwater Survey was implemented. The approach comprised of integrating existing ancillary field data, satellite imagery and ground-truthing. High resolution maps identifying groundwater occurrence, soil textures and recharge areas were constructed. Exploratory wells were drilled in some of the identified aquifers.A network of shallow aquifers was identified to spread across the area, only hidden by a few meters of the overburden below the surface.\nPresently 5 boreholes have been drilled within this aquifer and the average yield per borehole is about 80cu m/hour. The large paleo lake Lotikipi Basin aquifer covers a surface of 4146sq.km and hosts over 248 BCM in its 3-km deep graben structure. These deep aquifer-bearing structures comprise highly permeable Plio-Pleistocene fluvio-deltaic and lacustrine deposits interlayed with volcanic ash layers reworked by nearby rivers. Groundwater in these aquifers is partly static and partly dynamic in the graben-like structures.\nIn view of these findings, the Government of Kenya and UNESCO Nairobi office have signed a cooperative framework agreement in May 2015 to continue with these groundwater assessments in a phased approach but eventually to cover the whole country.\nIn addition and following UNESCO-IHP strategic plan-VIII: Water Security: Responses to Local, Regional, and Global Challenges (2014-2021) under theme 2: Groundwater in a changing environment, Kenya and Tanzania has proposed to carry out Kilimanjaro trasboundary Aquifer assessment in collaboration with UNESCO-IAEA Joint International Isotope Hydrology Programme (JIIHP).

The cause of this depletion remains unknown but might be related to loss from impacts or to the presence of an hidden reservoir (e.g. core). The presence of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz of various ages is an opportunity to follow the evolution of the composition of the atmosphere (N, noble gases) through time [2] but also of halogens in seawater (their main reservoir). Such studies may help to constrain what is the origin of these volatile elements on Earth. For this purpose, we analysed quartz from hydrothermal veins and pods of various localities and ages (e.g. Barberton Greenstone Belt (South Africa; 3.2 Ga), Fortescue Group (Australia; 2.7 Ga)) by crushing and step-heating following the extended Ar-Ar method [3]. In Barberton and Fortescue Gp. quartz, a hydrothermal component characterized by excess 40Ar (40ArE) and closely associated with chlorine is clearly identified from crushing and step-heating results and permits to define a 40ArE/Cl used to correct Ar-Ar data for this contribution. In the case of Barberton, the correction for the hydrothermal component leads to an approximate formation age of the quartz of 3.2 (+/- 0.1) Ga. In Barberton quartz, halogens elemental ratios obtained during crushing and step-heating experiments are highly enriched in iodine and bromine (I/Cl=2-7x10-4; Br/Cl=4-10x10-3) relative to modern seawater. These results are similar to those found in a previous study of Barberton fluid inclusions [3] and can be interpreted as indicators that organic carbon was not sufficiently abundant at this time and/or this location to efficiently pump Br and I during sediment burial. Iodine and bromine, in Fortescue Gp. quartz, are less enriched suggesting that, in that case, organic activity already acted as pump for these elements.

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows are needed by many scientific communities, such as seismology, as they enable easy composition and execution of applications, enabling scientists to focus on their research without being distracted by arranging computation and data management. However, there are challenges to be addressed. In many systems users have to adapt their codes and data movement as they change from one HPC-architecture to another. They still need to be aware of the computing architectures available for achieving the best application performance.\nWe present dispel4py, an open-source framework presented as a Python library for encoding and automating data-intensive scientific methods as a graph of operations coupled together by data-streams. It enables scientists to develop and experiment with their own data-intensive applications using their familiar work environment. These are then automatically mapped to a variety of HPC-architectures, i.e., MPI, multiprocessing, Storm and Spark frameworks, increasing the chances to reuse their applications in different computing resources.\ndispel4py comes with data provenance, as shown in the screenshot, and with an information registry that can be accessed transparently from within workflows. dispel4py has been enhanced with a new run-time adaptive compression strategy to reduce the data stream volume and a diagnostic tool which monitors workflow performance and computes the most efficient parallelisation to use.\ndispel4py has been used by seismologists in the project VERCE for seismic ambient noise cross-correlation applications and for orchestrated HPC wave simulation and data misfit analysis workflows; two data-intensive problems that are common in today’s research practice. Both have been tested in several local computing resources and later submitted to a variety of European PRACE HPC-architectures (e.g. SuperMUC & CINECA) for longer runs without change. Results show that dispel4py is an easy tool for developing, sharing and reusing data-intensive scientific methods.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric oxidation of isoprene emission from land plants affects radiative forcing of global climate change. There is an urgent need to understand the factors that control isoprene emission variability on large spatiotemporal scales but such direct observations of isoprene emission do not exist. In this study we apply three readily available global-scale long-term observationally based data sets to explore surface isoprene activity: gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from FLUXNET measurements, satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SiF) and satellite-based tropospheric formaldehyde column variability (HCHOv). The observed correlations are used to evaluate a global Earth system model that embeds three alternative leaf-level isoprene emission algorithms. On daily time scales, observed SiF-HCHOv correlations are not statistically significant across the globe. On seasonal to interannual time scales, GPP and HCHOv are decoupled in the summertime in the southeast US (r=−0.03). The SiF-HCHOv correlations show similar patterns as the GPP-HCHOv. Isoprene emission algorithms that include soil moisture dependence demonstrate greater skill in reproducing the observed interannual seasonal GPP–HCHOv correlations in the southeast US and the Amazon. In isoprene emission models that include soil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is correlated with photosynthesis and anticorrelated with HCHOv. In an isoprene emission model without soil moisture dependence, isoprene emission is anticorrelated with photosynthesis and correlated with HCHOv. The relationships between photosynthesis, isoprene emission and HCHOv are investigated at 9 flux tower sites for which time-varying isoprene emission was measured using eddy covariance. At the Missouri Ozarks site, which experienced the severe drought in central US in July 2012, substantial reductions in isoprene flux and SiF were observed, but no concomitant reduction in HCHO column was found. Long-term monitoring of isoprene emission, soil moisture and meteorology is required in water-limited ecosystems to improve understanding of the factors controlling isoprene emission and its representation in global Earth system models.",

It is, therefore, important to represent these emissions as accurately as possible in the global and regional models.

With 14 models currently participating, we are starting to work with the rich dataset of model output to compare several aspects of simulated Biomass Burning aerosols in these models.\nWe will present a reference dataset of biomass burning cases constructed specifically for this project, initial findings from comparing total AOD and BB AOD between the models and with the reference satellite dataset, and mention future directions of this project. We will also showcase our approach for treating AOD snapshots to be suitable for comparison with the global models, and its potential applications to other BB-related projects.",

            "abstract": "Titan exhibits aeolian sand dunes that cover ~20% of its surface, attesting to significant sediment transport by the wind. Recent experiments in the Titan Wind Tunnel (TWT) at NASA Ames Research Center [1,2] found that the threshold friction speed needed to detach Titanian “sand” is about 50% higher than previous estimates based on theory alone [3], a result that might be explained by the low ratio of particle to fluid density on the body [1].\nFollowing the successful completion of the initial Titan threshold tests, we are conducting new experiments that expand the pressure range above and below current Titan values. The basic experimental techniques are described in [1], with minor updates to the instrumentation as described in [2]. To reproduce the kinematic viscosity and particle friction Reynolds number equivalent to that expected for Titan’s nitrogen atmosphere at 1.4 bars and 94 K requires that TWT be pressurized to 12.5 bars for air at 293K. In addition to running experiments at this pressure to reproduce previous results [1] and investigate low density (high density ratio) materials, TWT pressures of 3 and 8 bars are in the experimental matrix to understand threshold under past Titan conditions when the atmospheric pressure may have been lower [4]. Higher pressures, at 15 and 20 bars in TWT, are also being run to understand the putative effects of low density ratio conditions. Our experimental matrix for this follow-on work uses some of the same materials as previously used, including walnut shells, basalt, quartz, glass spheres, and various low density materials to better simulate the gravity-equivalent weight of Titan sand.\nFor these experiments, the TWT is now equipped with a new high pressure Tavis transducer with sufficient sensitivity to measure freestream speeds of less than 0.5 m s-1 at 12.5 bars. New techniques include video documentation of the experiments. We are also investigating methods of measuring humidity of the wind tunnel environment and electrostatic forces to assess their effect on threshold.\n[1] Burr, D.M. et al.

            "abstract": "Continued use of fossil fuel drives an accelerating increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and is the principal cause of global climate change. Many of the observed and projected impacts of rising [CO2] portend increasing environmental and economic risk, yet the uncertainty surrounding the projection of our future climate by Earth System Models (ESMs) is unacceptably high. Improving confidence in our estimation of future [CO2] is essential if we seek to project global change with greater confidence. There are critical uncertainties over the long term response of terrestrial CO2 uptake to global change, more specifically, over the size of the terrestrial carbon sink and over its sensitivity to rising [CO2] and temperature. Reducing the uncertainty associated with model representation of the largest CO2 flux on the planet is therefore an essential part of improving confidence in projections of global change. Here we have examined model representation of photosynthesis in seven process models including several global models that underlie the representation of photosynthesis in the land surface model component of ESMs that were part of the recent Fifth Assessment Report from the IPCC. Our approach was to focus on how physiological responses are represented by these models, and to better understand how structural and parametric differences drive variation in model responses to light, CO2, nutrients, temperature, vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture. We challenged each model to produce leaf and canopy responses to these factors to help us identify areas in which current process knowledge and emerging data sets could be used to improve model skill, and also identify knowledge gaps in current understanding that directly impact model outputs. We hope this work will provide a roadmap for the scientific activity that is necessary to advance process representation, parameterization and scaling of photosynthesis in the next generation of Earth System Models.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that Paleozoic stratified rocks in some regions of central New England are dominated by relatively flat structural features (e.g., recumbent folds, shallow dipping foliation) while other areas are dominated by near vertical upright structures. The northern Casco Bay region of coastal Maine (Brunswick 7.5' quadrangle and adjacent areas) provides an excellent venue for studying the relationships between these two structural regimes as they are in close proximity due to juxtaposition by high angle faulting associated with the Norumbega fault system.\nStratified rocks exposed west of the Flying Point fault in northern Casco Bay are dominated by moderately east dipping foliation (ave. = 025o, 37o), moderate northeast plunging mineral lineations, and recumbent to gently inclined minor folds. In stark contrast, immediately east of the Flying Point fault, stratified rocks are dominated by steep east dipping foliation (ave. = 014o, 73o), subhorizontal mineral lineations, and upright to steeply inclined minor folds. The structural differences correspond directly to differences in the thermal histories preserved in these rocks as revealed by earlier thermochronological studies. Rocks in the zone of upright structures east of the Flying Point fault were last subjected to high grade metamorphic conditions and granitic plutonism in the Late Devonian and were relatively cold (<300oC) by Late Carboniferous time. In contrast, flat lying rocks west of the Flying Point fault were over 500oC in the Early Permian and Permian pegmatites are common.\nGeochronological studies north of the study area have revealed that the two distinctly different structural styles are not the product of strain partitioning during the same deformational episode, but rather they represent two temporally and kinematically distinct deformational events. Swanson (1999), originally suggested flat structures west of the Flying Point fault are consistent with an episode of northwest directed thrusting and our findings are consistent with this interpretation. However, this flat phase of deformation significantly post-dates the older upright structures preserved to the east and thus models for the structural evolution of the region must integrate both the kinematic and temporal differences in this deformation.",

            "abstract": "A traditional assumption for unsaturated flow is that the pores are either water-filled and conducting or empty and nonconducting. Evidence from lab and field investigations, however, shows that substantial preferential flow can occur in macropores that are partially filled. Such flow can transmit large fluxes of water. Rates of transport can exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity, because of possible reductions of friction and buoyancy effects. These conditions reduce the influence of capillarity on energy state, driving force, and the configuration of water-filled space. Influences such as gravity, inertia, and chaotic liquid-phase irregularities then take on increased importance. Perhaps most important is that with partial filling, the flux of water entering the pore is a determining influence on the configuration of air and water phases. Hence the incoming flux itself influences the pore’s conductance, and Darcy’s law cannot be expected to apply.\nFlow through partially-filled macropores thus requires new or revised concepts of flow pathways in unsaturated soil, and new ways of quantifying their effect. Flow modes can include free-surface films, rivulets that are not fully confined by capillarity, pulse flow, and sliding drops. Gravity dominates the driving force. Because capillarity does not establish complete geometrical confinement for these modes of flow, the mathematical relation between flux and force is not the direct Darcian proportionality, but rather a mode-specific relation involving incoming flux and flow-stream dimensions. In swelling soils there is the further complication that flow may switch from one mode to another because macropore size, shape, and connectedness vary dynamically with changing water content.\nThis presentation evaluates commonalities and divergences among different partially-filled flow modes and compares them with commonly-assumed Poiseuille flow modes. Mathematical relations for the physical processes of these flow modes provide a basis for developing an improved model for the preferential component of unsaturated flow.",

The high time resolution allows study of the fine structure of velocity-dispersed ion signatures observed by the MMS spacecraft during instrument commissioning in the magnetotail. The observed ion dispersions can be considered to result from plasma injections at a reconnection site that is distant from the spacecraft location. However, MMS observed many cases of double dispersed ion populations overlapped in time, which are consistent with similar signatures observed on the dayside and explained to result from double (or multiple) reconnection sites. This can be taken as evidence that the MMS spacecraft crossed field lines directly connected to the reconnection sites.

            "abstract": "The internationally collaborative volcanic ash website (\nhttp://volcanoes.usgs.gov/ash/\n) has been an important global information resource for ashfall preparedness and impact guidance since 2004. Recent volcanic ashfalls with significant local, regional, and global impacts highlighted the need to improve the website to make it more accessible and pertinent to users worldwide. Recently, the Volcanic Ash Impacts Working Group (Cities and Volcanoes Commission of IAVCEI) redesigned and modernized the website. Improvements include 1) a database-driven back end, 2) reorganized menu navigation, 3) language translation, 4) increased downloadable content, 5) addition of ash-impact case studies, 7) expanded and updated references , 8) an image database, and 9) inclusion of cooperating organization's logos. The database-driven platform makes the website more dynamic and efficient to operate and update. New menus provide information about specific impact topics (buildings, transportation, power, health, agriculture, water and waste water, equipment and communications, clean up) and updated content has been added throughout all topics. A new “for scientists” menu includes information on ash collection and analysis. Website translation using Google translate will significantly increase user base. Printable resources (e.g. checklists, pamphlets, posters) provide information to people without Internet access. Ash impact studies are used to improve mitigation measures during future eruptions, and links to case studies will assist communities’ preparation and response plans. The Case Studies menu is intended to be a living topic area, growing as new case studies are published. A database of all images from the website allows users to access larger resolution images and additional descriptive details. Logos clarify linkages among key contributors and assure users that the site is authoritative and science-based.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude and frequency of hydrometeorological extremes are expected to increase in the conterminous United States over the coming century with significant implications for future water resource planning. However, future changes in the frequency and severity of extreme hydrological events is highly uncertain, in part because of under representation of fine scale topographic and weather features in the continental- to global-scale models. In this study, the influence of spatial resolution on both extremes (floods and droughts) and mean hydrologic conditions is investigated using the macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, implemented and calibrated at 1/24th degree grid cell (~4km) resolution. The coarser resolution simulations are achieved by averaging the 1/24o forcing data to 1/8o which is then used to drive the VIC model. To investigate the sensitivity of simulated high and low runoff conditions to changes in precipitation and temperature at different spatial resolution, further simulations are conducted by (a) increasing both historic maximum and minimum daily temperature by 1° C, (b) increasing historic precipitation by 10%, and (c) decreasing historic precipitation by 10%. The results are further analyzed for various types of extreme precipitation events across different watershed scales and for different regions representing a variety of hydrometeorological characteristics. This work helps us to understand the sensitivity of runoff to spatial resolution of climate forcings and also its sensitivity to different watershed sizes and characteristics of extreme precipitation events in the future climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Occurrence of extreme weather and climate events is dependent on the spatial and temporal confluence of a host of meteorological ingredients. Primary among these ingredients is the circulation pattern of the atmosphere. Research indicates that synoptic- to regional-scale circulation patterns dictate the atmospheric environment, and that the likelihood of an extreme event changes depending on the circulation pattern type present. It follows then, that changes in the frequency and/or duration of particular circulation patterns may alter the frequency or severity of extreme events. Recent work analyzing reanalysis data identified robust multi-decadal trends in the occurrence and duration of some circulation pattern types over select regional mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere domains. Despite the detection of circulation pattern trends, their attribution to internal variability and/or anthropogenic forcing remains unresolved. Here, in an initial step toward attribution, we examine the likelihood of detecting robust circulation pattern trends in pre-industrial, historical, and future climate simulations using the CESM1 (CAM5) Large Ensemble (LENS) Community Project single-model, multi-realization framework. To identify seasonal atmospheric circulation patterns and determine their temporal variation, we analyze mid-atmospheric geopotential heights using self-organizing map (SOM) cluster analysis. Within the LENS framework, we quantify the probability of detecting seasonal circulation pattern trends in climate systems devoid of human influence, with observed human influence, and with RCP8.5 projected forcing. In addition to pattern trend assessment, for each regional domain, we quantify the likelihood that a particular circulation pattern type, e.g., an anticyclonic blocking circulation, will change in frequency or duration due to increased radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Noble gases are chemically inert and variably soluble in crustal fluids. They are primarily introduced into hydrocarbon reservoirs through exchange with formation waters, and can be used to assess migration pathways, mechanisms and reservoir storage. Of particular interest is the role groundwater plays in hydrocarbon transport, which is reflected in hydrocarbon-water volume ratios.\nWe present compositional, stable isotope and noble gas isotope and abundance data from the Sleipner Vest field, in the Norwegian North Sea. Sleipner gases are generated from primary cracking of kerogen and the thermal cracking of oil, sourced from type II marine source, with relatively homogeneous maturities and a range in vitrinite reflectance (1.2-1.7%). Gases are hosted in the lower shoreface sandstones of the Jurassic Hugin formation, which is sealed by the Jurassic Upper Draupne and Heather formations.\nGases are composed of N2 (0.6-0.9%), CO2 (5.4-15.3%) and hydrocarbons (69-80%). Helium isotopes (3He/4He) are radiogenic and range from 0.065 to 0.116 RA, showing a small mantle contribution, consistent with Ne isotopes (20Ne/22Ne from 9.70-9.91; 21Ne/22Ne from 0.0290-0.0344) and Ar isotopes (40Ar/36Ar from 315-489). 20Ne/36Ar, 84Kr/36Ar and 132Xe/36Ar values are systematically higher relative to air saturated water ratios. These data are discussed within the framework of several conceptual models: i) Total gas-stripping model, which defines the minimum volume of water to have interacted with the hydrocarbon phase; ii) Equilibrium model, assuming simple equilibration between groundwater and hydrocarbon phase at reservoir P,T and salinity; and iii) Open and closed system gas-stripping models. Using Ne-Ar, we estimate gas-water ratios for the Sleipner system of 0.02-0.09, which compare with geologic gas-water estimates of ~0.24, and suggest more groundwater interaction than a static system estimate. Kr and Xe show evidence for an additional source or process involving oil or sediments.",

            "abstract": "Routing streamflow through a river network is a basic step within any distributed hydrologic model. It integrates the generated runoff and allows comparison with observed discharge at the outlet of a catchment.\nThe Muskingum routing is a textbook river routing scheme that has been implemented in Earth System Models (e.g., WRF-HYDRO), stand-alone routing schemes (e.g., RAPID), and hydrologic models (e.g., the mesoscale Hydrologic Model). Most implementations suffer from a high computational demand because the spatial routing resolution is fixed to that of the elevation model irrespective of the hydrologic modeling resolution. This is because the model parameters are scale-dependent and cannot be used at other resolutions without re-estimation.\nHere, we present the multiscale Routing Model (mRM) that allows for a flexible choice of the routing resolution. mRM exploits the Multiscale Parameter Regionalization (MPR) included in the open-source mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM, www.ufz.de/mhm) that relates model parameters to physiographic properties and allows to estimate scale-independent model parameters. mRM is currently coupled to mHM and is presented here as stand-alone Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The mRM source code is highly modular and provides a subroutine for internal re-use in any land surface scheme.\nmRM is coupled in this work to the state-of-the-art land surface model Noah-MP. Simulation results using mRM are compared with those available in WRF-HYDRO for the Red River during the period 1990-2000. mRM allows to increase the routing resolution from 100m to more than 10km without deteriorating the model performance. Therefore, it speeds up model calculation by reducing the contribution of routing to total runtime from over 80\\% to less than 5\\% in the case of WRF-HYDRO. mRM thus makes discharge data available to land surface modeling with only little extra calculations.",

Using the same new comprehensive sets of measured detailed snowpack physical properties (input data), we compared simulated TBs at 11, 19 and 37 GHz from these 3 models based on different electromagnetic approaches using three different snow grain metrics, i.e. respectively measured specific surface area (SSA), calculated correlation length using the Debye relationship and measured maximum extent. Comparison with surface-based radiometric measurements for different types of snow (in southern Québec, and in subarctic and arctic areas) shows similar averaged root mean square errors in the range of 10 K or less between measured and simulated TBs when simulations are optimized using scaling factors applied on these metrics. This means that, in practice, the different approaches of these models (physical to empirical) converge to similar results when driven with appropriate scaled in-situ measurements. We discuss the results relatively to the uncertainties in snow microstructure measurements. In particular, we show that the scaling factor to be applied on the SSA measurements in order to minimize the DMRT-ML simulated TBs compared to measured TBs is not due to uncertainty in SSA measurements.",

Savannas cover half the surface of Africa, large areas of Australia, South America, and India. . The region that was studied is located in Kruger National Park in northeastern South Africa, which was heavily affected by the wildfires. The CAR measured surface reflectance along its flight path covering both burned and unburned areas. . In this study, we compared surface reflectance between burnt and un-burnt areas at various wavelengths (340nm, 380nm, 472nm, 682nm, 870nm, 1036nm, 1219nm, 1273nm, and 2205nm) at satellite sub-pixel scales. We found a relative burnt surface reflectance decrease of between 8 and 65% due to fires. These results not only serve to highlight the importance of biomass burning and effects on the energy budgets, but also the need to determine the effects of albedo changes due to fires on soil moisture budget, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff, all of which govern the land-surface component of the water cycle.",

            "abstract": "Both the natural and social science data communities are attempting to address the long-term sustainability of their data infrastructures in rapidly changing research, technological, and policy environments. Many parts of these communities are also considering how to improve the interoperability and integration of their data and systems across natural, social, health, and other domains. However, these efforts have generally been undertaken in parallel, with little thought about how different sustainability approaches may impact long-term interoperability from scientific, legal, or economic perspectives, or vice versa, i.e., how improved interoperability could enhance—or threaten—infrastructure sustainability.\nScientific progress depends substantially on the ability to learn from the legacy of previous work available for current and future scientists to study, often by integrating disparate data not previously assembled. Digital data are less likely than scientific publications to be usable in the future unless they are managed by science-oriented repositories that can support long-term data access with the documentation and services needed for future interoperability.\nWe summarize recent discussions in the social and natural science communities on emerging approaches to sustainability and relevant interoperability activities, including efforts by the Belmont Forum E-Infrastructures project to address global change data infrastructure needs; the Group on Earth Observations to further implement data sharing and improve data management across diverse societal benefit areas; and the Research Data Alliance to develop legal interoperability principles and guidelines and to address challenges faced by domain repositories. We also examine emerging needs for data interoperability in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and the expected set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which set ambitious targets for sustainable development, poverty reduction, and environmental stewardship by 2030. These efforts suggest the need for a holistic approach towards improving and implementing strategies, policies, and practices that will ensure long-term sustainability and interoperability of scientific data repositories and networks across multiple scientific domains.",

            "abstract": "The importance of heterogeneities in partial melting and melt migration is widely recognized, but the dynamics of melting in a heterogeneous mantle are still poorly understood. Here we show that one-dimensional models commonly used in geochemical studies of heterogeneous melting may lead to fundamentally different dynamics and may give misleading results.\nIn a low-porosity background the melting of a fertile heterogeneity leads to the formation of a porosity wave. The propagation velocity of this porosity wave is generally slower than the migration velocity of the melt. In one dimension this leads to a separation of the chemical signal transported by the melt and slower moving porosity wave. In addition the migration speed of a chemical signals depends inversely on its compatability in the solid matrix, so that chromatographic separations are expected where the most incompatible elments arrive first.\nHowever, in higher dimensions, the porosity wave and the chemical signals travel together. Geochemical signals do not move linearly upward as in 1D, rather, they travel in a circular motion inside the rising porosity wave. This occurs when the background fluid velocity drops below the phase speed of the porosity wave. The phase speed of the porosity wave is controlled by its amplidude and is independent of the background porosity while the background fluid velocity declines as the cubic root of the background porosity.\nIn the reference frame of the moving porosity wave the melt streamlines are circular. In the center of the porosity wave the melt moves faster than the phase speed and rises to the top. Here the melt is deflected to the sides where porosity is low and the melt speed drops below the phase velocity of the porosity wave. After the porosity wave passes, the melt is reentrained and a circular motion develops. This flow slowly mixes the geochemical signal originating from the heterogeneity with that of the low-porosity ambient mantle that the wave traverses.\nThis circular pattern of melt migration allows the re-ordring of the chromatograpic sequence depending on the exact timing of the extration of the melt from the top of the porosity wave. This may explain the reverse chromatographic sequences observed in some monogenetic vents that are likely the product of the melting of heterogeneities in a otherwise low-porosity mantle.",

            "abstract": "Many wicked water resources problems are approached in a social planner perspective. This not always matches the real institutional and policy-making context, where, rather, multiple decision-makers (DMs) can act independently, or weakly cooperate, ultimately producing system-wide inefficient trade-offs. The idea in this work is to adopt a more realistic approach, where the multi-DMs nature of the problem is preserved and the uncoordinated DMs are driven, thorough coordination mechanisms, towards a more system-wide efficient solution. An agent-based modelling framework linked to a surface and groundwater model is used to design these coordination mechanisms as constraints to the independent agents (i.e., DMs) behaviour.\nIn the Heihe Basin the ongoing introduction of smart meter IC-card systems on farmers’ pumping wells will soon allow monitoring and control of abstractions with the goal of preventing further depletion of the resource. The major interest of policy makers in the region concerns the development of new and the improvement of existing legislation on pricing schemes and/or groundwater quotas. The model outcome where agents act rationally but selfishly is compared to the optimal solution at system-level assuming perfect coordination and cooperation. The optimal solutions with respect to the given utility functions are computed using nonlinear optimization with a rolling out time horizon. The Pareto-Frontier is synthesized through an exhaustive sampling of the weight coefficient space and related to the current and to the historical management of the last 4 decades. The best parameter values for the proposed coordination mechanisms are determined and the alternatives are compared with respect to their efficiency and acceptability.\nPreliminary results suggest that a regulatory tax on groundwater of about a factor 10 of the current resource fee is required to increase the elasticity of the groundwater demand curve such that reducing consumption becomes attractive. The payback of the tax in form of subsidies to the farmers reduces the losses due to higher expenses. Findings will be presented to the local decision makers and have the potential to improve water governance in the Heihe River Basin in the coming years.",

However, the available data are scarce. By means of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations that treat all anharmonic effects accurately, we extensively explore the effects of the existence of Fe, including both Fe2+ and Fe3+, and Al on the elastic properties of MgSiO3, at different compositions and atomic distributions, mineral phases, and pressure and temperature conditions that are relevant to the Earth’s lower mantle. Based on these results, we find that the laterally averaged (1D) density and seismic velocities support a pyrolitic composition across the whole lower mantle; we also study the transverse anisotropy of these minerals in a subducting slab near the core-mantle boundary, and confirm that the pPv phase with predominant (001) slip plane matches the seismic anisotropy in the D′′ region independent of the amount of Fe or Al. These results provide a useful resource to investigate the seismic properties of mineral assemblages in the deep mantle and to explore the mineralogical origin of heterogeneities in the lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage in carbonate reservoirs is essential for mitigating climate change. Supercritical CO2 mixed with host brine is acidic and can dissolve the surrounding pore structure and change flow dynamics. However, the type, speed, and magnitude of the dissolution are dependent on both the reactive transport properties of the pore-fluid and the intrinsic properties of the rock. Understanding how changes in the pore structure, chemistry, and flow properties affect dissolution is vital for successful predictive modelling both on the pore-scale and for up-scaled reservoir simulations.\nReaction in carbonates has been studied at the pore-scale but has never been imaged dynamically in situ. We present an experimental method whereby both lab-based benchtop instruments and ‘Pink Beam’ synchrotron radiation are used in X-ray microtomography to investigate pore structure changes during supercritical CO2 injection at reservoir conditions.\nThree types of pure limestone rock with broadly varying rock topology were imaged under the same reservoir conditions. Flow-rate and brine acidity was varied in successive experiments by half an order of magnitude to gain insight into the impact of flow, transport, and physical heterogeneity. The images were binarized and the magnitude of dissolution was identified on a voxel-by-voxel basis to extract pore-by-pore dissolution data. The impact of dissolution on flow characteristics was studied by computing the evolution of the pore-scale velocity fields with a flow solver. We found that increasing rock heterogeneity increased channelized flow [Figure 1] through preferential pathways and that higher flow rate increased total dissolution. Additionally, decreasing reaction rate lowered overall reaction rate and made axial flow less uniform.\nExperimentally measured reaction rates in real rocks are at least an order of magnitude lower when compared to batch experiments. We provide evidence that this can be due to transport limitations whose impact is dependent on pore architecture, flow conditions, and reaction rates.",

Key properties of our methods are (i) low algorithmic complexity and easy implementation, (ii) applicability to any tomographic technique, including full-waveform inversion and linearized ray tomography, (iii) applicability in any spatial dimension and to inversions with a large number of model parameters, (iv) low computational costs that are mostly a fraction of those required for synthetic recovery tests, and (v) the ability to quantify both spatial resolution and inter-parameter trade-offs.\nUsing synthetic full-waveform inversions as benchmarks, we demonstrate that auto-correlations of random-model applications to the Hessian yield various resolution measures, including direction- and position-dependent resolution lengths, and the strength of inter-parameter mappings. We observe that the required number of random test models is around 5 in one, two and three dimensions. This means that the proposed resolution analyses are not only more meaningful than recovery tests but also computationally less expensive. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in 3D real-data full-waveform inversions for the western Mediterranean and Japan.\nIn addition to tomographic problems, resolution analysis by random probing may be used in other inverse methods that constrain continuously distributed properties, including electromagnetic and potential-field inversions, as well as recently emerging geodynamic data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate models (RCMs) intent to provide physically consistent climate data to the climate change impact research community. However, the effects of parametrisations of unresolved sub-grid processes and systematic biases in the model output requires not only a post-processing in form of bias adjustment but also an analysis of inter-variable relations. Many impact models require several climate variables as input data, which makes it necessary to check if the inter-variable dependence structure is simulated realistically by RCMs.\nA common practice is to bias adjust RCM output variables to improve their individual distribution and mean climate characteristics. This can be done by empirical bias adjustment procedures such as quantile mapping. However, applying statistical bias adjustment procedures on individual variables may alter the inter-variable relationships given by the climate model and hence distort the physical consistency.\nIn our study we examined the inter-variable relations of RCM output variables by using estimates of conditional probability density functions for pairs of variables. Conditional densities obtained from multiple European RCMs were compared with those obtained from observations. We quantified the extent to which these conditional density estimates are distorted by an empirical bias adjustment procedure.\nAdditionally, the influence of the model physics on the representation of inter-variable relations is analysed for a 24 member perturbed physics ensemble of WRF simulations in the U.S.. Here, multiple observational data sets were used to address the influence of observational uncertainties on the analysis. Finally, the results obtained from the European and U.S. modelling initiatives are compared to provide a common basis on the representation of inter-variable relations in RCM outputs.",

Structures within drill cores, borehole and site survey seismic data indicate that tectonic deformation in the outer IBM fore arc is mainly post-magmatic. Extension generated asymmetric sediment basins such as half-grabens at sites 352-U1439 and 352-U1442 on the upper trench slope. Along their eastern margins the basins are bounded by west-dipping normal faults. Deformation was localized along multiple sets of faults, accompanied by syn-tectonic pelagic and volcaniclastic sedimentation. The lowermost sedimentary units were tilted eastward by ~20°. Tilted beds were covered by sub-horizontal beds. Biostratigraphic constraints reveal a minimum age of the oldest sediments at ~ 35 Ma; timing of the sedimentary unconformities is between ~ 27 and 32 Ma. At sites 352-U1440 and 352-U1441 on the outer fore arc strike-slip faults are bounding sediment basins. Sediments were not significantly affected by tectonic tilting. Biostratigraphy gives a minimum age of the basement-cover contact between ~29.5 and 32 Ma.\nThe post-magmatic structures reveal a multiphase tectonic evolution of the outer IBM fore arc. At sites 352-U1439 and 352-U1442, shear with dominant reverse to oblique reverse displacement was localized along subhorizontal fault zones, steep slickensides and shear fractures. These were either re-activated as or cut by normal-faults and strike-slip faults. Extension was also accommodated by steep to subvertical mineralized veins and extensional fractures. Faults at sites 352-U1440 and 352-U1441 show mainly strike-slip kinematics. Sediments overlying the igneous basement(maximum Late Eocene to Recent age), document ash and aeolian input, together with mass wasting of the fault-bounded sediment ponds.",

            "abstract": "Eroded volcanoes expose plumbing systems that provide important information on intrusive geometries, magma propagation directions, and the effects of host rock types and heterogeneities. Summer Coon Volcano, CO, is an Oligocene stratovolcano where erosion has removed much of the original edifice, revealing the intrusive stocks of the central intrusive complex (CIC). Surrounding the CIC are hundreds of radial dikes ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic in composition. Published geologic maps indicate most radial dikes do not connect to the intrusive stocks, supporting published theories that most did not emanate from the central intrusions. However, much of the area surrounding the CIC is covered by alluvium, suggesting that the lack of connection might be an artifact of exposure. We completed a ground magnetic survey and detailed geological mapping to determine if the dikes continue beneath the alluvium and into the intrusive stocks. Linear magnetic anomalies indicate four NW-SE trending rhyodacite dikes continue beneath the alluvium for up to 250 m, and mapping indicates that at least two of the rhyodacite dikes do extend into the CIC. Shorter linear anomalies are attributed to seven NW-SE trending basaltic dikes ~100-500-m-long which are sparsely exposed in the alluvium. Mapping shows that three rhyodacite dikes extend into the CIC and to within 200 m of their possible source, an 800-m-wide granodiorite stock. Additionally, three rhyolitic dikes extend to within several meters of a 200×500-m-wide tuff breccia zone of similar composition, likely their source. In summary, magnetic data and detailed mapping indicate that radial dikes do extend into the central intrusive complex in contrast to some model predictions.",

Several studies have focused on the impacts of power-related thermal emissions in Europe and the U.S., in terms of river temperature increase and the capacity for power production, especially in the light of legislative measures designed to protect freshwater bodies from excessive temperature. In this work we present a comprehensive, global analysis of current freshwater thermal pollution by thermoelectric facilities. The Platts World Electric Power Plant (WEPP) database was the principal data source. Data gaps in the principal parameters of the steam-electric power cycle were filled in by regression relationships developed in this work. Some 2400 steam-electric units using once-through freshwater cooling systems, amounting to 19% of the global installed capacity of thermoelectric units, were identified and georeferenced, and a global view of thermal emission rates was achieved by systematically solving the Rankine cycle on a power generating unit level. The rejected heat rates are linearly proportional to the steam flow rate, which in turn is directly proportional to the power produced. By applying the appropriate capacity factors, the rejected heat rate can be estimated for each unit or agglomeration of units at the desired temporal resolution. We coupled mean annual emission rates with the global gridded hydrological-river temperature model VIC-RBM to obtain a first view of river temperature increases resulting from power generation. The results show that in many cases, even on a mean annual emission rate basis and a relatively large spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees, the local limits for temperature increase are often exceeded, especially in the U.S. and Europe.",

In situ observations of ESPs provide an excellent tool to study the physics of shock acceleration and the mechanisms that energize particles in events where the IP shock is remote (e.g. solar energetic particles – SEPs – that are accelerated in the solar corona). In this study, we use 1 AU observations during solar cycle 24 from ACE, STEREO-A, and STEREO-B during several ESP events observed at two or more spacecraft to examine the relationship between IP shocks and their associated energetic particles. Specifically, we examine the connection between variations in the properties of ~0.1 – 5 MeV/nucleon heavy ions (e.g. peak intensities, energy spectra, abundances) and IP shock parameters (e.g. shock obliquity, compression ratio, Mach number) that are observed at different points along the same CME-driven shock front. These results will be compared with theoretical predictions for heavy ion energy spectra and abundances in ESP events and could provide important additional constraints for particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere.",

In this study, the performances of APEX and SWAT models in evaluating the effects of alternate grazing management practices on water balances, and sediment and nutrient losses in a rangeland-dominated Clear Creek watershed (763 km2) located in north central Texas, were compared. Three grazing management practices including the light continuous (LC), heavy continuous (HC) and planned multi-paddock (MP) grazing were simulated. Measured data on vegetation, soil physical and hydrological properties, and grazing management at four study ranches within the study watershed (two under planned MP and one each under LC and HC grazing management), was used to parameterize both APEX and SWAT models. Both models were calibrated and validated using the measured streamflow (1980-2013), sediment (1994-2009), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) (1986-2009) load data at the watershed outlet. Preliminary results indicated that in general, both models performed equally well in terms of hydrology, but the APEX model performed better in predicting sediment and nutrient losses. At the watershed level, shifting grazing management from the baseline HC scenario to planned MP grazing decreased annual streamflow by 29% and 27%, and TN load by 47% and 35%, according to the APEX and SWAT models, respectively. The simulated reduction in sediment load with the change in grazing management from the baseline HC to the planned MP grazing was about the same (40%) according to both models.",

            "abstract": "Driven by an expansive atmosphere, Titan’s lakes, seas and accompanied hydrological cycle hold vast amounts of information regarding the history and evolution of Titan. To understand these features, we constructed a geomorphologic map of Titan's polar terrains using a combination of the Cassini SAR, ISS, VIMS, and topographic datasets. In combining SAR, ISS, and VIMS imagery with topographic data, our geomorphic map reveals a stratigraphic sequence from which we infer formation processes. In mapping both the South and North poles with the same morphologic units, we conclude that processes that dominated the North Pole also operated in the South. Large seas, which are currently methane/ethane filled in the North and dry in the South, characterize both poles. The current day dichotomy may result only from differing initial conditions. Regions removed from the mare are dominated by smooth, undulating plains, bounded by moderately dissected uplands that are discretized into observable drainage basins. These plains contain the highest density of filled and empty lake depressions, which appear morphologically distinct from the larger mare. The thicknesses of these undulating plains are retrieved from the depths of the embedded empty depressions that are up to 800 m deep. The development of such large deposits and the surrounding hillslopes can be explained by the presence of previously vast polar oceans. Larger liquid bodies would have allowed for a sustained accumulation of soluble and insoluble sediments from Titan’s lower latitudes. Two plausible evolutionary scenarios include seas that were slightly larger, followed by tectonic uplift, or oceans that were much larger, that have since lost most of their volume over time to methane photolysis. In either scenario, thick sedimentary deposits of soluble materials are required to have been emplaced prior to the formation of the small lake depressions.",

            "abstract": "Mountain belts act as sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere if physical erosion and exhumation expose rock-derived organic carbon (‘petrogenic’ organic carbon, OCpetro) to chemical weathering. Estimates suggest 15x1021g of carbon is stored in rocks globally as OCpetro, ~25,000 times the amount of carbon in the pre-industrial atmosphere. Alongside volcanic and metamorphic degassing, OCpetro weathering is thought to be the main source of CO2 to the atmosphere over geological timescales. Erosion in mountain river catchments has been shown to enhance oxidative weathering and CO2 release. However, we still lack studies which quantify this process. In addition, it is not clear how glaciation may impact OCpetro oxidation. In analogy with silicate weathering, large amounts of fine sediment in glacial catchments may enhance oxidative weathering.\nHere we quantify oxidative weathering in nine catchments draining OCpetro bearing rocks in the western Southern Alps, New Zealand. Using rhenium (Re) as a tracer of oxidative weathering, we develop techniques to precisely measure Re concentration at sub-ppt levels in river waters. Using [Re]water/[Re]rock as a weathering tracer, we estimate that the weathering efficiency in glacial catchments is >4 times that of non-glacial catchments. Combining this with the OCpetro content of rocks and dissolved Re flux, we estimate the CO2 release by OCpetro oxidation. The analysis suggests that non-glacial catchments in the western Southern Alps release similar amounts of CO2 as catchments in Taiwan where erosion rates are comparable. In this mountain belt, the CO2 release does not negate CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering and by riverine transfer of organic matter. Based on our results, we propose that mountain glaciation may greatly enhance OCpetro oxidation rates. Depending on the global fluxes involved, this provides a feedback to damp low atmospheric CO2 levels and global cooling. During glacial periods (low CO2, low global temperatures), increased CO2 emissions by OCpetro oxidation in mountain belts may act to counter global cooling.",

The measured data allow us to test chemical models simulating the atmospheric concentrations of OH, HO2 and RO2, and help to improve chemical mechanisms used in regional and global models for predictions of the atmospheric chemical composition. In Spring 2015, an international, IGAC-endorsed workshop took place at Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany, to assess the performance and reliability of current HOx measurement techniques. Fifteen international groups from Germany, UK, Ireland, France, Finland, USA, China and Japan came together to discuss achievements, challenges and future directions of laser-based, mass-spectrometry based, and chemical techniques. Following the discussions, a working group was established to guide the community in the near future in making progress on continued improvement in HOx measurements. Three goals will be persued: the development of a common calibration unit, the development of procedures to investigate and, if necessary, eliminate possible measurement artefacts, and planning for future instrumental intercomparisons. This contribution will give an overview of the workshop, its outcome and planned activites.",

            "abstract": "Historic ruptures on some plate boundary faults occur episodically. Fluids play a key role in modifying the chemical and physical properties of fault zones, which may prime them for repeated rupture by the generation of high pore fluid pressures. Modelling of fluid loss rates from fault zones has led to estimates of fluid fluxes required to maintain overpressure (Faulkner and Rutter, 2001), but fluid sources and fluxes, and permeability evolution in fault zones remain poorly constrained. High mountains in orogenic belts can drive meteoric water to the middle crust, and metamorphic water is generated during rock dehydration. Additionally, fluids from the mantle are transported into the crust when fluid pathways are created by tectonism or volcanism. Here we use geochemical tracers to determine fluid flow budgets for meteoric, metamorphic and mantle fluids at a major compressional tectonic plate boundary.\nThe Alpine Fault marks the transpressional Pacific-Australian plate boundary through South Island of New Zealand, it has historically produced large earthquakes (Mw ~8) and is late in its 329±68 year seismic cycle, having last ruptured in 1717. We present strontium isotope ratios of hot springs and hydrothermal minerals that trace fluid flow paths in and around the Alpine Fault to illustrate that the fluid flow regime is restricted by low cross-fault permeability. Fluid-rock interaction limits cross-fault fluid flow by the precipitating clays and calcite that infill pore spaces and fractures in the Alpine Fault alteration zone. In contrast, helium isotopes ratios measured in hot springs near to the fault (0.15-0.81 RA) indicate the fault acts as a conduit for mantle fluids from below. Mantle fluid fluxes are similar to the San Andreas Fault (<1x10-5 m3m-2/yr) and insufficient to promote fault weakening. The metamorphic fluid flux is of similar magnitude to the mantle flux. The dominant fluid throughout the seismogenic zone is meteoric in origin (secondary mineral δDH2O = -45 to -87 ‰), but fluid channelling into the fault zone is required to maintain high pore fluid pressure that would promote fault weakening. Our results show that meteoric waters are primarily responsible for modifying fault zone permeability and for maintaining high pore fluid pressures that may assist episodic earthquake rupture.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of the magnetic field data collected by the NASA ST-5 satellites in the low Earth orbit have revealed many wave events with frequencies of 30-200 mHz (in the Pc 2-3 band). It was soon realized that these waves were in fact Doppler-shifted waves in the magnetosphere, with wave frequencies of merely a few mHz (in the Pc 5 band) and azimuthal wavenumbers (m) of the order of 100. Oscillating in the poloidal direction, high-mwaves are known to engage in drift or drift bounce resonance with energetic ring current particles, and therefore they are expected to play a role in modulating the energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere.\nUsing a new method that examines the differences in wave phase detected by the three ST-5 satellites in a \"pearls-on-a-string\" configuration, we confirm that the frequencies of the observed poloidal waves are mainly between 3 and 5 mHz in the Earth frame. In some events, the NOAA satellites were located at the equator and close to the field lines connected to the ST-5 satellites, confirming the wave frequencies estimated using only ST-5 observations. In each of the poloidal wave events observed by ST-5, the azimuthal wavenumber may change with L, but the wave frequency in the Earth frame remains the same. We have also found cases where poloidal waves were observed in both dayside and nightside of the magnetosphere when ST-5 satellite passed through the same Lshells within a single orbit, supporting the theoretical prediction of a global poloidal mode, which is also known as the transverse Alfvén resonator.\nSatellite observations in low Earth orbits have shown that high-m poloidal waves can last many hours even during geomagnetically quiet conditions, suggesting that a very weak ring current may be capable of supplying enough energetic particles to excite poloidal waves. We will address the implications for energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere with theoretical and modeling considerations.",

            "abstract": "Surface mass balance (SMB) estimates from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are fundamental for assessing and understanding ice sheet mass trends. Mass budget and altimetry assessments rely on RCMs both directly for estimates of the SMB contribution to the total mass trend, and indirectly for ancillary data in the form of firn compaction corrections. As such, mass balance assessments can be highly sensitive to RCM outputs and therefore their accuracy. Here we assess the extent to which geodetic measurements of mass balance are sensitive to RCM model outputs at different resolutions. We achieve this by comparing SMB dependent estimates of mass balance from the mass budget method and altimetry, with those from satellite gravimetry that are independent of SMB estimates. Using the outputs of the RACMO/ANT 2.3 model at 5.5 km and 27 km horizontal spatial resolution, we generate estimates of mass balance using the mass budget method and altimetry for the Western Palmer Land region of the Antarctic Peninsula between 2003 and 2014. We find a 19% increase in the long-term (1980 to 2014) mean annual SMB for the region when enhancing the model resolution to 5.5 km. This translates into an approximate 50% reduction in the total mass loss from 2003 to 2014 calculated with the mass budget method and a 15% increase in the altimetry estimate. The use of the enhanced resolution product leads to consistency between the estimates of mass loss from the altimetry and the mass budget method that is not observed with the coarser resolution product, in which estimates of cumulative mass fall beyond the relative errors. Critically, when using the 5.5 km product, we find excellent agreement, both in pattern and magnitude, with the independent estimate derived from gravimetry. Our results point toward the crucial need for high resolution SMB products from RCMs for mass balance assessments, particularly in regions of high mass turnover and complex terrain as found over the Antarctic Peninsula.",

CSDRs serve as a ‘middle tail’ or boundary organization between information scientists and the long-tail community of individual geoscientists collecting and analyzing paleoecological data. Over the past decades, a distributed network of CSDRs has emerged, each serving a particular suite of data and research communities, e.g. Neotoma Paleoecology Database, Paleobiology Database, International Tree Ring Database, NOAA NCEI for Paleoclimatology, Morphobank, iDigPaleo, and Integrated Earth Data Alliance. Recently, these groups have organized into a common Paleobiology Data Consortium dedicated to improving interoperability and sharing best practices and protocols.\nThe Neotoma Paleoecology Database offers one example of an active and growing CSDR, designed to facilitate research into ecological and evolutionary dynamics during recent past global change. Neotoma combines a centralized database structure with distributed scientific governance via multiple virtual constituent data working groups. The Neotoma data model is flexible and can accommodate a variety of paleoecological proxies from many depositional contests. Data input into Neotoma is done by trained Data Stewards, drawn from their communities.

            "abstract": "The Cayman Trough (CT) has one of the world’s deepest axial valleys, thinnest crust, end-member basalt composition, and slowest spreading rate. Accommodating motion between the North American and Caribbean plates, and the Gonave microplate, marine magnetic anomalies show that the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center (MCSC) has been spreading at ~15 mm/yr (F.R.) since 20 Ma, if not 49 Ma. At a little over 100 km in length, the MCSC is now recognized to host oceanic core complexes (OCCs), hydrothermal vents, and a seafloor of variably distributed lower crustal gabbros, upper mantle peridotite/serpentinite, and basaltic lavas. Though spreading rate appears to be relatively symmetric over geologic time, the structure of the CT is quite asymmetric, with a broad region of low gravity and somewhat lineated magnetic anomalies to the east, and gravity highs and irregular magnetic anomalies to the west. Until now it has been difficult to further assess the nature of the CT because of the sparse and generally old data from the region; the CT’s claim on thinnest crust, for example, stems primarily from pre-1960’s seismic data and inferences from satellite gravity. The CaySEIS active-source OBS-experiment on the R/V Meteor thus set out in April of 2015 to provide a more complete, deeper view of the CT. A serendipitous discovery during the expedition is that the off-axis seafloor is characterized by curvilinear ridges preserving what appear to be dismembered OCCs. Thus, a previously proposed model based on the oblique volcanic ridge to the south of the axial OCC, Mt. Dent, could also apply to the geologic history of the CT. This model, which we call “the magmatic cleaver”, envisions how intrusions cut the OCC surfaces and raft the hanging-wall-dominated portion of the OCC to the east, and the footwall-dominated portion to the west. The “cleaver” appears to have been operating over at least the last 20 Ma, illustrating how melt flow in ultraslow-spread crust can create distinctive seafloor morphologies.",

We interpret the sedimentary record of early glacial SC shelf stratigraphy based on analysis of seismic facies and morphological features. We identify at least nine erosional surfaces that indicate advances of the Totten Glacier - Moscow University Ice Shelf system, part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), to the SC shelf. The most prominent features include two series of undulating, channelized erosional surfaces truncating strata below and showing highly irregular morphology with elevation amplitudes of up to ~120 m and widths of individual undulations of up to ~10 km. These surfaces are located stratigraphically above a core bearing IRD and assigned biostratigraphically to the Late Eocene and below a regional erosional surface of Late Miocene age. Our major results show that: (1) Oligocene-early Miocene evolution of EAIS consists of low-frequency, high-amplitude glacial expansions followed by long periods of ice-distal to open marine conditions; (2) the presence of grounded EAIS expansions on shelf is expressed in a series of deep, hummocky undulations and first Antarctic sedimentary tunnel valley system, suggestive of presence of subglacial meltwater and hence, a polythermal glacial regime; (3) at least nine erosional unconformities representing major ice advances have been found on the inner shelf; (4) the most intensive polythermal glaciations have occurred in late Eocene-early Oligocene; (5) no evidence of focused paleo- ice stream(s) draining Aurora Basin Complex prior to the middle Miocene was found in the study area.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost soils store between 1,330–1,580 billion tonnes of carbon (C), which may start to be released to the atmosphere if warming promotes widespread thaw. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding how rapidly this C may be released and what proportion will be released as the more powerful greenhouse gas, methane (CH4), rather than carbon dioxide (CO2). Central to answering these questions, is quantifying in situ rates of old, previously-frozen C release under aerobic conditions versus anaerobic conditions. To meet this aim, we investigated the amount and form (CH4 versus CO2) of previously-frozen C released in response to 1) forest fire-induced permafrost thaw (aerobic soil conditions) and 2) permafrost plateau collapse in peatlands which results in waterlogging (anaerobic conditions), in the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. We quantified in situ rates of CO2 and CH4 release, using a novel collar design to either include or exclude C released from deep soil layers, and collected samples for 14CO2 and 14CH4 analysis. Our 14CO2 results identified substantial rates of old C release from burnt forests where the organic horizon was thick and deep thaw was observed. In contrast, in the wetlands old C release was barely detectable as CO2 (<1%), and, although high CH4 fluxes were measured, a maximum of 1.5-2g m-2 yr-1 was derived from previously-frozen C. Furthermore, because peat accumulation increased substantially (>4 times), , thaw resulted in net C gain in the wetland. However, the high rate of CH4 release, albeit derived mainly from contemporary sources, means that permafrost plateau collapse can still represent a positive feedback to climate change in terms of global warming potential. Overall, our results indicate a much greater release of permafrost C under aerobic conditions, with little release of previously-frozen C as either CO2 or CH4 under anaerobic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Orogen-scale strike-slip faults present one the most important geodynamic processes affecting the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. In specific subtypes, faulting is virtually initiated along hot-to-cool boundaries, e.g. at such of hot granite intrusions or metamorphic core complexes to cool country rocks. Such fault zones are often subparallel to mountain ranges and expose a wide variety of mylonitic, cataclastic and non-cohesive fault rocks, which were formed at different structural levels of the crust and are stacked within each other (“telescoping”). Exhumation of rocks is, therefore, a common feature of such strike-slip faults implying major transtensive and/or transpressive processes accompanying pure strike-slip motion. The hot-to-cool thermal structure across the fault zone significantly influences the physical fault rock properties. One major question is how and where a major strike-slip initiates and further development. Here, we propose a model in which major continental exhumed strike-slip faults potentially evolve along rheologically weak zones such as plutons or margins of metamorphic complexes. As an example, we propose a model for the Ailao Shan-Red River (ASRR) fault, SE Asia, which initiated along the edge of a plutonic belt and evolved in response to India-Asia collision with four tectonic phases.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory studies of ripples and dunes show robust relations between bedform geometry and both fluid flow conditions and grain size. These empirical relations are derived at equilibrium – defined by the achievement of stationary bedform statistics under a given flow – and are utilized as both targets for theoretical models and for reconstructing paleoflow conditions from sedimentary deposits. In natural environments, however, the flow of water and wind is continuously varying, and bedform patterns adjust in response by redistribution of mass. Disequilibrium may arise whenever the timescale of changing flow is rapid compared to the timescale of bedform adjustment. We review and synthesize recent findings on bedform disequilibrium in three different systems: fluvial bedforms, wave and combined wave-current ripples, and eolian dunes. For all cases we argue that the bedform turnover time, which is the timescale to displace the sediment volume of a bedform, is the relevant timescale governing the adjustment of bed morphology to a changing flow. The mechanism of adjustment, however, is not universal. Formation and annihilation of defects occurs in all systems, and is the dominant adjustment mode for oscillatory flows where ripples are stationary. However, migrating bedforms in unidirectional river and eolian settings change their geometry primarily through collisional merger and calving. Further, the mechanisms of river bedform growth and decay are different, causing hysteresis in the response of bedform size to a flood pulse. Since the bedform turnover time is proportional to size, it appears likely that the largest dunes in rivers and deserts are always in disequilibrium – and hence their size does not reflect the present flow conditions. We discuss the consequences of fluid flow depth and sediment supply on the ability of bedforms to achieve equilibrium, and propose that there can be no equilibrium relation between flow and bedform size for eolian dunes. Finally, we outline potential signatures of bedform disequilibrium in the sedimentary record, and how this information may be used to provide a richer interpretation of paleoflows.",

            "abstract": "The dramatic expansion of C4 grasslands in northern India, Pakistan and and Nepal during the late Miocene has been well documented from carbon isotope changes in paleosols and marine sediments. This expansion is part of a trend in the late Miocene towards increasing tropical C4 savannah vegetation worldwide. The roles that evolution, global boundary conditions, and local factors played in this trend remain uncertain. The expansion of C4 grasses in India has been variously ascribed to uplift of the Tibetan plateau, changes in the Indian monsoon, declining atmospheric CO2 levels, and global cooling. However, the ultimate cause of this expansion remains unknown.\nHere we investigate the role that hydrologic change may have played in driving the expansion of C4 grasslands in India. We analyzed the molecular distribution of leaf-wax n-alkanes in the Bengal Fan and their carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition to determine the history of vegetation, aridity and hydroclimate associated with the expansion. Ocean Drilling Program sites 717 and 718 on the distal Bengal Fan preserve lipid molecules from terrestrial vegetation transported to the core site by deep-sea turbidites. We found that changes in the molecular distribution and hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial leaf wax n-alkanes precede changes in the carbon isotopic composition of these molecules. These data suggest that vegetation and hydroclimate changes preceded the expansion of C4 grasses, implying a more nuanced ecological and environmental trajectory. The hydrogen isotope data indicate a substantial enrichment in the δD of source water prior to the C4 transition. Some combination of increasing aridity and rainfall δD could lead to the observed δD changes. Comparison with soil carbonate δ18O suggests that changes in rainfall δD is the more likely cause, reflecting the moisture source, rainfall amount, or seasonality of rainfall. Overall, the timing of changes in molecular distribution and δD values compared to the C4 expansion suggests that the vegetation transition was complex and that hydroclimate played a major role in late-Miocene vegetation change in India.",

It has also been run experimentally on data from TRMM/TMI, Aqua/AMSR-E, GCOM-W1/AMSR2, and GPM/GMI. Future plans include operational processing of JPSS-1/ATMS, DMSP F-19/SSMIS, and GPM/GMI data. The inversion within MiRS follows a 1D-variational methodology, in which the fundamental physical attributes affecting the microwave observations are retrieved physically, including the profile of atmospheric temperature, water vapor, liquid and frozen hydrometeors, as well as surface emissivity and temperature. The community radiative transfer model (CRTM) is used as the forward and Jacobian operator to simulate the radiances at each iteration prior to fitting the measurements to within the noise level. The retrieved surface properties are then used to determine surface physical characteristics, including, when appropriate, cryospheric parameters such as sea ice concentration, ice age, and snow water amount, using pre-determined relationships that link emissivity and effective skin temperature to these parameters. We present a review of science improvements included in the recently released MiRS v11.1 that have led to higher quality atmospheric and surface parameter retrievals, with the improvements quantified by comparison with relevant atmospheric and surface reference data.",

            "abstract": "A lot of analysis revealed the relation between the variation of solar activity and climate over pole and high latitudes. Among them, Artic oscillation (AO) demonstrates a closely relationship with solar activity. Based on the F10.7cm solar radiant flux and NCEP reanalysis data sets from 1952 to 2011, we studied the impact of the variation of solar activity on the boreal winter climate over north hemisphere. Results show that solar activity closely related with the winter atmospheric circulation over East Asia. However, the relationship exhibits obviously differences between strong and weak solar activity periods. It suggests solar activity present an asymmetric influence on winter climate over East Asia. Further investigation indicates that the linkage between solar activity and East Asia winter climate is robust during active solar period but the connection is fairly weak during inactive phases. The more detail analysis reveals that the spacial characteristic of the atmospheric response to the solar variation is obviously different before and after later years 1970s. AO and F10.7cm flux appears a negative relation before 1978 but distinct positive relationship during the later years. During the period from 1952 to 1978, the variation of the solar activity is related to the sea surface temperature anomaly over Pacific and atmospheric zonal wind over tropical and low latitudes. On the other hand, it has a more closely relationship with temperature anomaly over Europe and Asian continent and the atmospheric circulation over mid-high latitudes during the time from 1979 to 2011. It is possibly caused by the climate condition transition in later 1970s and the solar radiant decadal variation influence on stratosphere and troposphere interaction.",

The recent explosion in centimeter resolution topographic data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) raises the possibility of mapping geomorphic offsets of active faults with unprecedented accuracy. Here we tested the technique to obtain high-resolution images and generate topographic data along the Altyn Tagh fault, main active strike-slip fault along the northern edge of Tibet. The existence of spectacular scarps, combined with the low level of instrumental seismicity and lack of well documented historical events requires especialy detailed studies of surface faulting. At several sites along the Altun segment of the fault we reconstruct well preserved offsets based on both 2D-orthophotos and 3D-views of the landscape. The results show that the UAV data provides centimeter resolution, allowing accurate mapping of past ruptures. We determine a co-seismic offset of 5.6 m for the last event south of Annanba. We also reconstruct cumulative offsets of 11±0.5 m, 22±1 m and 32±2 m. The horizontal offsets obtained suggest that last and penultimate events had similar slip amounts locally. The larger slip values deduced from the other offsets may also result from repeated 5-5.5 m co-seismic slip but more data is needed to confirm such a characteristic slip behavior. Clearly, UAV-based imagery shows great potential for high-resolution seismotectonic research and seismic hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "Some studies indicate that the fracture energy tends to increase with earthquake magnitude. In this research earthquake cycles along a pure strike slip fault are simulated with a rate- and state-dependent friction law to obtain the fracture energies at rupture nucleation points. We are trying to model a common continental strike-slip fault with the imposed slip rate at the deeper part of 0.015m per year. Velocity-weakening friction (a-b<0) region is set to 10-30km, which is the typical locked zone of continental earthquakes. Different normal stress (100, 200 and 400MPa) and different characteristic slip distance of friction L (0.01-0.2) are used in the simulation. The fracture energy at the rupture nucleation point for every case is calculated from the relation between shear stress and slip.\nThe simulation results show the fracture energy at the nucleation point is consistent with the theoretical expectation. The theoretical relationship between fracture energy and the amount of slip in the deep aseismic zone can be derived with fracture mechanics. In this theory, when the energy release rate at the tip of the aseismic slip zone exceeds fracture energy, an earthquake occurs. The energy release rate is proportional to the square of the amount of the deep aseismic slip during an interseismic period, which can be estimated from the recurrence interval Tr of earthquakes and the deep imposed slip rate Vpl.\nThe estimated equation will be used to calculate fracture energies in some actual faults and then examine its dependence on the magnitude of earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Brophy (2008) proposed that REE-SiO2 systematics could provide a method for discriminating between a melting and fractional crystallization origin for silicic magmas in intra-oceanic island arcs. Specifically, for liquid SiO2 contents in excess of 63% fractional crystallization and lower crustal amphibolite melting should lead to a positive and negative REE-SiO2 correlation respectively. A drawback to the melting modeling was the assumption of instantaneous equilibration between solids and melts (equilibrium melting). However, estimated rates of melt production coupled with solid state diffusion rates of REE all but ensure that melting actually occurs under partial disequilibrium conditions. A numerical method has been developed that permits the modeling of liquid trace element evolution for complex source rocks undergoing either combined congruent or incongruent melting. For a given source rock and melting history the input variables include the solid state trace element diffusivity and the duration of melting. Depending upon the input parameters it can model anything from equilibrium through partial disequilibrium to complete disequilibrium melting. The nature of melting and melt extraction is a critical factor in any such modeling. Recent work on lower crustal melting suggests that, in the absence of shear deformation, melt will accumulate until around 20-25% melting at which point it leaves the source region. In the presence of shear melting and melt extraction will occur in multiple cycles of melting with extraction occurring at 7-8%. Using the original amphibolite melting model of Brophy (2008) and REE diffusion coefficients ranging from 10-16 to 10-23 cm2/s , which fully encompasses the likely rate of diffusion at lower crustal temperatures (10-19 - 10-20 cm2/s), modeling has been carried out for the two end-member cases of a single batch melting event with extraction at 20-25% and multiple cycles of batch melting with extraction occurring at 7-8%. The results indicate that for both end member cases, melting still yields a negative REE-SiO2 correlation in the liquid, thus permitting REE-SiO2 systematics to continue to be an important method for discriminating a melting versus fractional crystallization origin for silicic magma.\nBrophy JG (2008) Contrib Mineral Petrol 156: 337-357",

Four regions were selected; in our selection, we tried to cover major aquifers, follow political boundaries, and exceed GRACE footprint (~0.20×106 km2) to minimize uncertainties. The selected regions are: (1) Northern Saudi Arabia and Jordan (area: 0.53×106 km2), (2) Southern Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emiratis (area: 0.97×106 km2), (3) Yemen (area: 0.45×106 km2), and (4) Oman (area: 0.32×106 km2). Results indicate: (1) Northern Saudi Arabia and Jordan area is experiencing large depletions (-8.76±0.94 mm/yr; -4.68±0.50 km3/yr) in GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) that is largely related to groundwater extraction as well as decrease in rainfall rates throughout the investigated period compared to the preceding period (average annual rainfall [AAR]: 2003-2013: 58 mm; 1979-2002: 103 mm), (2) Southern Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emiratis area is experiencing a moderate depletion (-2.73±1.0 mm/yr; -2.63±0.96 km3/yr) in TWS that might be related to groundwater/oil extraction as well as a moderate decrease in rainfall rates (AAR: 2003-2013: 61 mm; 1979-2002: 82 mm), (3) Yemen is experiencing a slight depletion (-0.82±0.30 mm/yr; -0.36±0.13 km3/yr) in TWS that might be related groundwater extraction, and (4) Oman is experiencing slight increase (+0.78±0.30 mm/yr; +0.25±0.09 km3/yr) in TWS that might be related an increase in rainfall rates. Our preliminary results are being further examined by: (1) extracting temporal variations in groundwater storage by integrating GRACE-derived TWS and TWS outputs of bias-corrected land surface models (e.g., CLM4.5, GLDAS), and (2) comparisons of our findings with relevant independent datasets (e.g., extraction, discharge, and recharge rates).",

In order to make proper use of the data, it is important to quantify intercalibration temporal and spatial variability and identify root causes. In this study, we present useful methods for characterizing intercalibration variability and investigating calibration dependence on geophysical parameters. We apply the methods to intercalibrate the constellation radiometers of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.\nWe discovered a pronounced signal with ~40-day period in GPM intercalibration. This 40-day signal is related to the variability of geophysical parameters including water vapor, surface wind speed (SWS), and sea surface temperature (SST). GPM intercalibration makes use of collocations between each radiometer in the constellation and the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) to compute offsets of each with respect to GMI. The position of these collocations varies cyclically based on the orbit of the constellation radiometer and GMI. Geophysical parameters vary accordingly, with this variability propagating into intercalibration in a manner that is not removed with the double difference method. The computed intercalibration offsets with respect to GMI show nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence on geophysical parameters even for the calm conditions (low water vapor, SWS) used for intercalibration. These results imply issues with the radiative transfer models and ancillary data representing geophysical fields.",

To understand the role of soil minerals and major cations in organo-mineral interactions, we applied STXM-NEXAFS spectroscopy at C, N, Al and Si K-edges, as well as Ca and Fe L-edges, to conduct submicron-level investigations of the associations of C and C forms with Ca, Fe, Al and Si in soil clay fraction of Ultisols and Andosols with contrasting mineralogy. Ultisols were under agricultural use receiving input of limestone and mushroom compost, whereas Andosols were under natural vegetation. The poorly crystalline minerals such as allophane and ferrihydrite were rich in Andosols, while Ultisols were dominated by vermiculite, illite and kaolinite. STXM analysis showed a high spatial correlation between C and Ca in the Utisols. The major Ca forms in agricultural Ultisols were organic Ca. A variety of C forms such as phenols, heterocyclic compounds, carboxylamides were found in Ca-rich “hot spots” in Ultisols. In contrast a relatively uniform distribution of C and C forms on mineral surfaces was observed in Andosols, revolutionizing our view of heterogeneous distribution of OM in natural soil. The C forms associated with minerals were aromatic and carboxyl C. These results demonstrates the importance of Ca containing organic compounds in soil C sequestration in agricultural Ultisols, and highlights the important role of the poorly-crystalline soil minerals in soil organic matter sequestration in Andosols.",

The concentration of most chemical compositions in summer are lower than those in winter, due to decreased emissions of biomass and coal burning for house heating. High temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions are favorable for secondary aerosol formation, resulting in higher concentrations of SO42- and NH4+ in summer. Non-dehydrated sugars are increased in summer because of the enhanced metabolism. Carbon preference index results indicate that n-alkanes at Mt. Hua are derived mostly by plant wax. Low Benzo(a)pyrene/Benzo(a)pyrene ratios indicate that mountain aerosols are more aged.\nConcentrations of biogenic (BSOA, the isoprene/pinene/caryophyllene oxidation products) and anthropogenic (ASOA, mainly aromatic acids) SOA positively correlated with temperature . However, a decreasing trend of BSOA concentration with an increase in RH was observed during the sampling period, although a clear trend between ASOA and RH was not found. Based on the AIM Model calculation, we found that during the sampling period an increase in RH resulted in a decrease in the aerosol acidity and thus reduced the effect of acid-catalysis on BSOA formation.\nSize distributions of K+ and NH4+ present as an accumulation mode, in contrast to Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are mainly existed in coarse particles. SO42- and NO3- show a bimodal pattern. Dehydrated sugars, fossil fuel derived n-alkanes and PAHs presented unimode size distribution, whereas non-dehydrated sugars and plant wax derived n-alkanes showed bimodal pattern. Most of the determined BSOA are formed in the aerosol phase and enriched in the fine mode except for cis-pinonic acid, which is formed in the gas phase and subsequently partitioned into aerosol phase and thus presents a bimodal pattern with a major peak in the coarse mode.",

However, predictions of future ice sheet response to climate change are limited by short observational time-series and the complexity of associated forcings and feedbacks. Here, we present new chronologic and multiproxy data from 7 marine sediment records from the outer to inner shelf down the axis of the Anvers Island Trough and into Palmer Deep that better constrain the timing and rate of ice retreat and improve understanding of the mechanisms driving deglaciation of this hypothesized paleo-ice stream. The retreat chronology is based on 16 CaCO3 (foraminifer and mollusk) and 45 ramped pyrolysis (acid-insoluble organic matter) AMS 14C dates. Radiocarbon dates from the laminated diatom ooze and mud facies immediately above the glacial diamicton indicate that deglaciation of the mid-Anvers Island Trough post-dated the Palmer Deep deglaciation by ~2000 uncorrected 14C years and that collapse of the mid-shelf system was rapid, if not instantaneous. The laminated facies, present throughout the suite of cores, is consistent with the calving bay reentrant model for deglaciation. However, this facies is limited (~15 couplets) on the mid-shelf and expanded (~127 couplets) on the inner-shelf, suggesting regional differences in calving bay duration. Planktic and benthic foraminifer isotopes, together with foraminifer and diatom assemblages, and biogeochemical data provide evidence for the presence of warmer nutrient-rich modified Circumpolar Deep Water throughout the Anvers Island Trough during deglaciation. The observed retreat complexity may relate to a hypothesized mid-shelf ice-dome system and requires additional geological and geophysical data to understand ice retreat patterns south and west of Palmer Deep. Such data will provide important new constraints for ice sheet models.",

These areas need the deep drillings to get into higher temperature for power energy. The first 20% high temperature areas are mostly located in the coastal or mountain regions. The government is interesting to develop these areas as the “New Energy Villages” so that they can not only become self-energy sufficient sites, but also to protect themself from being the loss of electricity and water during the typhoon and earthquake hazards. The multiple usages of hot water (such as the first power generation and then the hot spring utilization) have its merits.\nChina, in the other hand, is not within the present-day active tectonic zone. However, the recent Sino Probe Experiments (Deep Exploration in China) have mapped the Cetaceous plate boundaries in the coast of China. The heat is still possibly migrating to near the surface through the existing structures. For example, the Feng Shun Geothermal Power Station in north of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, used the 96 degree C hot water from a well of 800 m producing a small amount of 300 KW power since 1984. The Guangdong Province is located in the edge of Mesozoic South China Plate. Further in land, the Huang Mountain, one of the world heritage sites, is located at the boundary of another Mesozoic Yangtze River Plate. There is not a geothermal power plant; however, a number of hot springs are in a booming tour business at the foot hill of the mountain. The electricity has to come from a long way of net working. If China develops the local, small, but sufficient power plants by using the modern geothermal exploration and drilling techniques.

            "abstract": "We have designed, built and installed a small robotic coronagraph at the Winer Observatory in Sonoita, Arizona, in order to observe the sodium exosphere out to one-half degree around the Moon. We have observed every available clear night from our home base at Goddard Space Flight Center for several lunations in 2015, and thus have a long baseline of sodium exospheric calibrated images. We employ an Andover temperature-controlled 1.5 Å wide narrow-band filter centered on the sodium D2 line, and a similar 1.5 Å filter centered blueward of the D2 line by 5 Å. This filter would yield a sodium signal at least 24% of the scattered lunar light at first quarter. Exposures of 10 minutes are required to image the sodium corona at good signal to noise. Following each exposure pair, taking a 0.1 sec exposure with the open filter collects on- and off-band images of the lunar surface. An example of our resulting image of the sodium corona is shown in Figure 1, with the image of the moon's disk (taken subsequently to the occulted coronal image) superimposed on the occulting disk, thus showing the position and phase of the moon under the disk. We will compare our lunar model derived from these observations with the data from the UV spectrograph onboard the LADEE spacecraft.\nFigure 1. An image of the lunar sodium corona obtained on March 26, 2015 is shown with the lunar surface superimposed on the coronagraphic image. Using various sized occulting disks, depending on lunar phase, we observe the corona very close to the lunar surface with no scattered light.",

            "abstract": "The Polar satellite recorded two reconnection exhausts within 6 min on 1 April 2001 at a rather symmetric sub-solar magnetopause that displayed different out-of-plane signatures for similar solar wind conditions. The first case was reported by Mozer et al. [2002] and displayed a bipolar guide field supporting a quadrupole Hall field consistent with a single X-line. The second case, however, shows the first known example of a tripolar guide-field perturbation at Earth’s magnetopause reminiscent of the types of solar wind exhausts that Eriksson et al. [2014; 2015] have reported to be in agreement with multiple X-lines. A dedicated particle-in-cell simulation is performed for the prevailing conditions across the magnetopause. We propose an explanation in terms of asymmetric Hall magnetic fields due to a presence of a magnetic island between two X-lines, and discuss how higher resolution MMS observations can be used to further study this problem at the magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Despite over 50 years of satellite exploration beyond near-Earth space, only sparse in-situ observations have been made of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere (distances of less than 1 AU). In recent years, the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft was able to measure the bulk and thermal speeds of protons in the solar wind at distances of 0.3 – 0.5 AU. Using data from FIPS, we build upon the work of Gershman et al. (2012) and present a detailed study of the bulk velocity and thermal properties of the solar wind for the time period of March 2011 to March 2015. We compare and contrast the FIPS observations at 0.3 – 0.5 AU with measurements from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite at 1 AU. Of particular interest is the radial evolution of proton thermal speeds inside Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs), and quiescent solar wind. This study represents the most complete survey of solar wind plasma inside 0.5 AU since the Helios mission in the early 1980’s. Furthermore, our results provide a preview of the exciting science possible with the upcoming launches of Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus in 2018.",

            "abstract": "Airborne mineral dust directly and indirectly impacts on global climate, continental and marine biochemistry, human and animal health, agriculture, equipment, and visibility. Annual global dust emissions are poorly known with estimates differing by a factor of at least two. Local dust emission and deposition rates are even less quantified. Dust deposition rate is a key parameter, which helps to constrain the modeled dust budget of the atmosphere. However, dust deposition remains poorly known, due to the limited number of reliable measurements.\nSimulations and satellite observations suggest that coastal dusts contribute substantially to the total deposition flux into the Red Sea. Starting December 2014, deposition samplers, both the “frisbee” type, and passive samplers for individual particle scanning electron microscopy were deployed at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), along the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. Sampling periods of one month were adopted. The deposition rates range from 3 g m-2 month-1 for fair weather conditions to 23 g m-2 month-1 for high dust events. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of deposited dust samples show mineralogical compositions different from any of the parent soils, the former consisting mainly of gypsum, calcite, and smaller amounts of albite, montmorillonite, chlorite, quartz and biotite. The deposited dust samples on the other hand contain more gypsum and less quartz than the previously collected soil samples.\nThis presentation discusses the results from XRD, chemical analysis and SEM-based individual particle analysis of the soils and the deposited dust samples. The monthly dust accumulation rates and their seasonal and spatial variability are compared with the regional model predictions. Data from this study provide an observational basis for validating the regional dust mass balance along the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain.",

            "abstract": "The German-Brazilian cooperative aircraft campaign ACRIDICON-CHUVA (Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation, and Radiation Interactions and Dynamics of Convective Cloud Systems) on the German research aircraft HALO took place over the Amazon Basin in September/October 2014, with the objective of studying tropical deep convective clouds over the Amazon rainforest and their interactions with trace gases, aerosol particles, and atmospheric radiation. The aircraft was equipped with about 30 remote sensing and in-situ instruments for meteorological, trace gas, aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and solar radiation measurements. Fourteen research flights were conducted during this campaign.\nObservations during ACRIDICON-CHUVA showed high aerosol concentrations in the upper troposphere (UT) over the Amazon Basin, with concentrations after normalization to standard conditions often exceeding those in the boundary layer (BL). This behavior was consistent between several aerosol metrics, including condensation nuclei (CN), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and chemical species mass concentrations. These UT aerosols were different in their composition and size distribution from the aerosol in the BL, making convective transport of particles unlikely as a source. The regions in the immediate outflow of deep convective clouds were found to be depleted in aerosol particles, whereas enhanced aerosol number and mass concentrations were found in UT regions that had experienced outflow from deep convection in the preceding 24-48 hours. This suggests that aerosol production takes place in the UT based on volatile and condensable material brought up by deep convection. Subsequently, downward mixing and transport of upper tropospheric aerosol may be a source of particles to the BL, where they increase in size by the condensation of biogenic volatile organic carbon (BVOC) oxidation products. This may be an important source of aerosol particles in the Amazonian BL, where aerosol nucleation and new particle formation has not been observed.",

            "abstract": "Global or near-global fires like those that are thought to have occurred after the Chicxulub asteroid impact are associated with abrupt climate change and the K-Pg mass extinction event. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a three-dimensional coupled climate model with interactive chemistry, we have simulated the climate response to global fires assuming a burden of 70,000 Tg, as estimated from the K-Pg layer sediments by Wolbach et al. (1988). Soot aerosols are lofted by solar heating and remain in the atmosphere for about 6 years, warming the stratosphere by more than 240 K and suppressing completely solar radiation at the surface for 2 years. Global average land surface temperatures cool by -28 K after 3 years and ocean temperatures by -11 K after 4 years. Precipitation is reduced by 80 % for 5 years, and the ozone column is reduced by 80 % for 4 years. The tropical tropopause cold point disappears for a few years, leading to water vapor mixing ratios of > 1000 ppmv in the stratosphere. There is a rapid recovery around year 6, when the soot is removed by wet deposition as stratospheric water condenses and precipitates, but this is followed by a peak in the UV Index in the tropics of over 40 before stratospheric ozone recovers. Ocean temperature cools by more than -2 K to a depth of 300 m, and sea ice develops in the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Baltic Sea. Global fires, two years of darkness, extreme surface cooling, significant ocean cooling, increases in sea ice extent and a large short-term increase in UV Index would have been catastrophic for many life forms. This work is the first step in an effort to simulate the climatic effects of all of the aerosols and gases that may have been generated by the Chicxulub impact in a model that has been configured for late-Cretaceous conditions to help assess the role of the Chicxulub impact in the K-Pg extinction.",

            "abstract": "More observations of ice clouds are required to fill gaps in understanding of microphysical properties and processes. However, in situ observations by aircraft are costly and cannot provide long term observations which are required for a deeper understanding of the processes. Ground based remote sensing observations have the potential to fill this gap, but their observations do not contain sufficient information to unambiguously constrain ice cloud properties which leads to high uncertainties. For vertically pointing cloud radars, usually only reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity are used for retrievals; some studies proposed also the use of Doppler spectrum width.\nIn this study, it is investigated whether additional information can be obtained by exploiting also higher moments of the Doppler spectrum such as skewness and kurtosis together with the slope of the Doppler peak. For this, observations of pure ice clouds from the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC) in Alaska 2008 are analyzed. Using the ISDAC data set, an Optimal Estimation based retrieval is set up based on synthetic and real radar observations. The passive and active microwave radiative transfer model (PAMTRA) is used as a forward model together with the Self-Similar Rayleigh–Gans approximation for estimation of the scattering properties. The state vector of the retrieval consists of the parameters required to simulate the radar Doppler spectrum and describes particle mass, cross section area, particle size distribution, and kinematic conditions such as turbulence and vertical air motion. Using the retrieval, the information content (degrees of freedom for signal) is quantified that higher moments and slopes can contribute to an ice cloud retrieval. The impact of multiple frequencies, radar sensitivity and radar calibration is studied. For example, it is found that a single-frequency measurement using all moments and slopes contains already more information content than a dual-frequency measurement using only reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity. Eventually, the errors and uncertainties of the retrieved ice cloud parameters are investigated for the various retrieval configurations.",

Based on structural geology, low temperature chronology and fault-related fold theory, integrated with the latest surface geology, magnetic, seismic and drilling data, the paper well interpreted seismic reflection profiles, constrained the tectonic deformation time, analyzed the structural geometrics and kinematics, restored the structural evolution, discussed the formation mechanism, and provided some constraints on the eastward-growth of the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The southwestern Sichuan area was divided into three tectonic belts from northwest to southeast: the Longmenshan tectonic belt, Xiongpo tectonic belt and the Longquanshan tectonic belt. Each belt produced stratified deformation with the basement ductile shear layer and the Middle-Lower Triassic salt layer as the detachment fault.The tectonic deformation in front of the south segment of Longmenshan Mountains varies along the structural trend. Wedge structures developed in mid-depth of the north part of Gaojiachang－Sanhechang belt, while the shallow dominated by the combination of fault and fold. The deep and mid-shallow layer of the south part characterized by duplex structure and superposed wedge structures. The crustal shortening of south part is much larger than the north, and the shallow layer is larger than the deep, with maximum shortening of 14.5 km (38%). The tectonic history (deformation) experienced sea-land changes in the Late Triassic → the rise of the south segment of Longmenshan Mountains and formation of Longquanshan thrust belt in the Middle Jurassic → the formation of Xiongpo thrust belt during the Late Eocene and Miocene → the expansion of the south segment of Longmenshan Mountains since the Pliocene. Linking structural geometry and deformation mechanism of major structural belts in southwestern Sichuan Basin, we argue an eastward-growth pattern of the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Large quantities of terrigenous sediment have been injected into the mantle at subduction zones over geologic time. During subduction, the sediment on top of the downgoing slab is likely melted and incorporated into the mantle wedge peridotite. The sediment-metasomatized mantle wedge then enters the convecting mantle. After residing in the mantle for long time periods, the sediment-enriched mantle domain is returned to the surface in upwelling mantle plumes and melted beneath hotspots.\nThe Samoan hotspot provides a compelling case for sediment recycling from subduction zones to hotspots. Analyses of lavas from Samoa reveal Sr-isotopic ratios of up to 0.7205. The elevated Sr-isotopic ratios, together with unique trace element patterns similar to upper continental crust, provide powerful evidence that Samoan lavas host a component of recycled sediment. The most extreme Sr-isotopic ratio (0.7216) identified in a Samoan lava was measured in clinopyroxenes (cpx) phenocrysts separated from a lava with highly radiogenic Sr-isotopic ratios: Hundreds of visibly-heterogeneous cpx phenocrysts were pooled for a single Sr-isotopic analysis; this approach likely masked the full range of Sr-isotopic ratios sampled by individual cpx phenocrysts. For example, preliminary laser ablation ICP-MS analyses of zoned plagioclase from this lava reveal heterogeneous Sr-isotopic ratios that range above that found in the cpx. Melt inclusions hosted in cpx from the a lava with extreme high Sr-isotopic ratios promise another frontier for discovering even more extreme endmember compositions. Whole rock Sr-isotopic ratios correlate with silica in the suite of enriched lavas from Samoa, and the most enriched lavas have SiO2 up to ~61 wt.%. Cpx-hosted melt inclusions from a geochemically-enriched lava have SiO2 ranging from 65-68 wt.%. The inclusions may represent a new extreme EM2 mixing endmember sampled in diluted form in Samoan lavas.",

            "abstract": "The high-temperature, fluid-dominated Ngatamariki geothermal field is located in the central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), North Island, New Zealand, and is used to generate electricity via an 82 MW power plant. Injection wells have been in operation since June 2012. Geothermal stimulation and production may trigger microearthquakes by fluid flow through the reservoir. Close clustering of microseismic events’ hypocentres relative to the source-receiver distance results in many events having similar waveforms. We capitalize on this using a matched-filter detection method in which high-quality seismograms corresponding to a well-recorded earthquake (“templates”) are cross-correlated against continuous data to reveal additional earthquakes with similar characteristics. As in matched-filter detection studies elsewhere, we require that the sum of correlation coefficients across the network exceed a noise-based threshold in order to recognise a detection. The threshold is defined by R×MAD, where R is a scalar coefficient and MAD is the median absolute deviation of the correlation coefficient sum throughout the day. The R coefficient is a function of the recording environment, network geometry and time-varying noise characteristics, and we estimate it empirically using synthetic testing. By seeding the continuous data with scaled versions of representative templates, we examine how the amplitudes of detectable events are compared with correlation and detection efficiency. Synthetic testing yields a threshold for this geothermal region of R=7.1. Using this threshold, events with amplitudes as small as ~2% of the original templates’ amplitudes are detected with 95% confidence. The matched filter detection of microseismic events allows further interpretation of geologic structure at Ngatamariki and of the relationship between production, injection and seismicity.",

            "abstract": "A new high resolution Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM; Côté et al.) model version is currently developed at Environment Canada as part of the next operational High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS, Mailhot et al., 2010) with an horizontal grid-spacing of 2.5 km. At this resolution, the question of using or not a convective parameterization (CP) remains.\nContinental precipitation diurnal cycle is a critical aspect of numerical weather prediction: when no CP is applied, delayed precipitation is often seen even at 2 km grid-spacing (Xu et al. 2002) whereas the use of CP often show too early precipitation (Rio et al. 2009). Moeng et al. (2010) have shown that models with horizontal grid-spacing of the order of km are missing important part of subgrid-scale moisture vertical fluxes throughout the deep convective layer. However, CP were generally developed for lower resolution models with hypotheses (i.e. convective quasi-equilibrium, local compensating subsidence) that are not always valid at the km scale. New approaches are proposed to relax those constraints (e.g. Arakawa et al., 2011, Kuell and Bott, 2008).\nThe Kain-Fritsch CP (Kain and Fritsch, 1990, 1993) is already used in two GEM versions with grid-spacing of 25 and 10 km (Charron et al. 2012). It has been adapted for the HRDPS by decreasing the convective updraft radius, minimum depth and adjustment time scale, while increasing the triggering threshold. It has been tested over a Pan-Canadian domain for 20 summer cases of 48h simulations.\nIt will be shown that, when using the adapetd Kain-Fritsch CP, a reduction in diurnal cycle biases is seen, particularly for large precipitation events, while it doesn't degrade other surface skill scores, except for trace precipitation bias. A squall line case (see figure) will be presented against observations, to illustrate how the precipitation timing, intensity and structure is modified with the use of Kain-Fritsch and how it is sensitive to the different Kain-Fritsch parameters.",

E-mail klr324@psu.edu\nUnderstanding and projecting future sea-level changes poses nontrivial challenges. Sea-level changes are driven primarily by changes in the density of seawater as well as changes in the size of glaciers and ice sheets. Previous studies have demonstrated that a key source of uncertainties surrounding sea-level projections is the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to warming temperatures. Here we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple model of the Antarctic ice sheet over a hindcast period from the last interglacial period to the present. We apply and compare a range of (pre-) calibration methods, including a Bayesian approach that accounts for heteroskedasticity. We compare the model hindcasts and projections for different levels of model complexity and calibration methods. We compare the projections with the upper bounds from previous studies and find our projections have a narrower range in 2100. Furthermore we discuss the implications for the design of climate risk management strategies.",

            "abstract": "The description of storage and transport of both water and solved contaminants in catchments is very difficult due to the high heterogeneity of the subsurface properties that govern their fate. This heterogeneity, combined with a generally limited knowledge about the subsurface, results in high degrees of uncertainty. As a result, stochastic methods are increasingly applied, where the relevant processes are modeled as being random. Within these methods, quantities like the catchment travel or residence time of a water parcel are described using probability density functions (PDF). The derivation of these PDF's is typically done by using the water fluxes and states of the catchment. A successful application of such frameworks is therefore contingent on a good quantification of these fluxes and states across the different spatial scales.\nThe objective of this study is to use travel times for the characterization of an ca. 1000 square kilometer, humid catchment in Central Germany. To determine the states and fluxes, we apply the mesoscale Hydrological Model mHM, a spatially distributed hydrological model to the catchment. Using detailed data of precipitation, land cover, morphology and soil type as inputs, mHM is able to determine fluxes like recharge and evapotranspiration and states like soil moisture as outputs.\nUsing these data, we apply the above theoretical framework to our catchment. By virtue of the aforementioned properties of mHM, we are able to describe the storage and release of water with a high spatial resolution. This allows for a comprehensive description of the flow and transport dynamics taking place in the catchment. The spatial distribution of such dynamics is then compared with land cover and soil moisture maps as well as driving forces like precipitation and temperature to determine the most predictive factors. In addition, we investigate how non-local data like the age distribution of discharge flows are impacted by, and therefore allow to infer, local properties of the catchment.",

            "abstract": "Step-pools are common morphological units in steep catchments. They are characterized by channel-spanning steps created by boulders, with downstream pools due to the tumbling water flow. Assessing stability of steps and describing sediment transport trends in these channels remain partially an open issue. Sediment transport and bed morphology in steep streams interact in a complex, non-linear way that makes difficult to predict them both with a satisfactory degree of accuracy. Wide grain-size distribution, complex boundary conditions, coupling with hillslopes, various flow resistance components are only few of the reasons why sediment transport estimates in steep streams differ from measurements by orders of magnitude.\nIn this work we model bed morphology and sediment transport in step-pool channels with a reduced-complexity (RC) approach. We develop a 2-D cellular-automaton sandpile-like model in which entrainment, transport and deposition of particles are modeled at a grain scale. Intuitive rules, requiring few parameters, are implemented, based on physical principles applied in a stochastic way. Probability of entrainment and deposition of grains (and, as a consequence, particle travel distances and resting times) are set up as function of flow condition and bed topography. Sediment input is fed at the beginning of the channel at constant or intermittent rate.\nDespite its relative simplicity, our model yields realistic results in terms of sediment transport trends and particles travel distances. Phases of aggradation and degradation can be observed in the system even under a constant input. Sediment yield at the channel outlet shows intermittency as observed in natural streams. A stepped morphology is obtained in the simulations and the density of steps is inversely proportional to the width of the channel, as confirmed by previous studies. Our results encourage the development of RC approaches, as complementary tools to more sophisticated models: they provide a realistic description of complex morphological systems and help to better understand the physical principles that rule their dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Climate and base level changes in the Pleistocene are expected to influence the relative storage and transfer of different size fractions in a sediment routing system. We study mechanisms of sediment routing and dispersal and their relative influence on marine strata formation during the Pleistocene using continental shelf strata drilled during IODP Expedition 317 to Canterbury Basin, South Island of New Zealand. We use semi-quantitative mineralogy from bulk, sand (2-0.063 mm), silt (63-15 μm), and clay (<2 μm) size fractions, to reconstruct sediment dispersal paths from the Southern Alps to the ocean. Silt is composed of lithic fragments and individual mineral grains, and the results are not informative on silt dispersal paths. Instead, it compares to bulk mineralogy, reflecting overall variations in terrigenous input to the shelf. Sand and clay mineralogy suggest the variable influence of two dispersal paths to Canterbury shelf: one reflecting direct input from the more proximal fluvial basin (Waitaki Basin), and another southern coastal source. A change in the sand quartz:plagioclase ratio from Middle to Late Pleistocene strata suggests a shift in the mode of sand dispersal from along margin (southern) to across margin (Waitaki). This likely resulted from relatively long sand residence time within the Waitaki Basin during the Middle Pleistocene, amplifying the influence of the southern source. This southern influence is supported by clay mineralogy that shows higher content of smectite versus illite+chlorite during this period. In contrast, Late Pleistocene sand and clay composition mostly reflect the dominant bedrock within the Waitaki basin indicating enhanced transfer of sediment from the Basin. We argue that this change in sediment dispersal is related to the expansion of alpine glaciers in the Southern Alps during the Middle Pleistocene that led to higher glacigenic sediment fluxes and shorter residence time within the sediment routing system.",

A complete crustal cross section through the central part of the North Iberian Margin, representing the southern margin of the Bay of Biscay, is presented here from the interpretation of a high quality deep seismic reflection profile together with boreholes and well logs, acquired for oil and gas exploration purposes.\nThe studied segment of this margin includes a basement high so called Le Danois Bank, and the Asturian basin, one of the sedimentary basins developed during the Mesozoic extensional processes, which was subsequently inverted during the Alpine orogeny. Most of the compression seems to have taken place through uplift of the continental platform and slope and the formation of an accretionary wedge at the bottom of the slope, so it is still possible to elucidate both extensional and compressional features. The basin appears as an asymmetric bowl bounded by synsedimentary normal faults with a maximum thickness of about 6 s TWT, which has been estimated to be equivalent to about 7 km.\nDepth migration of the seismic profile has revealed the presence of a deeper trough, with a maximum thickness of 13. 5 km at its main depocenter, which closely resembles the sedimentary thickness proposed for other contemporaneous proximal basins. These results support the high degree of extension and the exhumation processes proposed for this margin, deduced from refraction velocities and from the upper crustal and mantle rocks dredged at the slopes of Le Danois High. They will bring new insights to, and further constraints on, geodynamical models for this margin, where the amount of shortening linked with Cenozoic compression and the role of the rift structure during the inversion still remain unclear.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst topography forms whenever ice-rich permafrost thaws and the ground subsides due to the volume loss when ground ice transitions to water. The Alaska Thermokarst Model (ATM) is a large-scale, state-and-transition model designed to simulate transitions between landscape units affected by thermokarst disturbance. The ATM uses a frame-based methodology to track transitions and proportion of cohorts within a 1-km2 grid cell. In the arctic tundra environment, the ATM tracks thermokarst-related transitions among wetland tundra, graminoid tundra, shrub tundra, and thermokarst lakes. In the boreal forest environment, the ATM tracks transitions among forested permafrost plateau, thermokarst lakes, collapse scar fens and bogs. The transition from one cohort to another due to thermokarst processes can take place if thaw reaches ice-rich ground layers either due to pulse disturbance (i.e. large precipitation event or fires), or due to gradual active layer deepening that eventually results in penetration of the protective layer. The protective layer buffers the ice-rich soils from the land surface and is critical to determine how susceptible an area is to thermokarst degradation. The rate of terrain transition in our model is determined by a set of rules that are based upon the ice-content of the soil, the drainage efficiency (or the ability of the landscape to store or transport water), the cumulative probability of thermokarst initiation, distance from rivers, lake dynamics (increasing, decreasing, or stable), and other factors. Tundra types are allowed to transition from one type to another (for example, wetland tundra to graminoid tundra) under favorable climatic conditions. In this study, we present our conceptualization and initial simulation results from in the arctic (the Barrow Peninsula) and boreal (the Tanana Flats) regions of Alaska.",

            "abstract": "Seperate characterization of plant water use and soil evaporation are critical to understanding ecohydrological dynamics of dryland ecosystems and for efficiently managing water in dryland agriculture. The application of stable isotopes as a tracer of these individual fluxes has been constrained by obtaining robust measurements of the isotopic composition of plant water use (δT) that may be scaled up to the ecosystem level. Of particular concern is the fact that the isotopic composition of plant transpiration is usually assumed to be equal to the isotopic composition of xylem water; the so-called steady-state assumption. However, our results and the findings of other published studies strongly suggest that steady state conditions are unrealistic for vegetation in dynamic natural environments. This talk focuses on the development of a simple framework for using relationships between plant transpiration and δT to partition ET at the landscape level. Our method uses a newly-derived empirical relationship between leaf conductance and isotopic fractionation during transpiration to solve a system of equations that can provide solutions to the fraction of total ET composed of bare soil evaporation and transpiration. We apply our method to a time series of evapotranspiration fluxes and near-surface water vapor isotopic composition at a field station in central Kenya and compare the results with partitioning obtained from both steady-state approaches and non-isotopic approaches for partitioning.",

This leads to infrasound generation for internal sources (e.g. quakes) and to seismic waves generations for atmospheric sources (e.g. meteor, impactor explosions, boundary layer turbulences). Both the atmospheric profile, surface density, atmospheric wind and viscous/attenuation processes are however greatly different, including major differences between Mars/Venus and Earth due to the CO2 molecular relaxation.\nWe present modeling results and compare the seismic/acoustic coupling strength for Earth, Mars and Venus. This modeling is made through normal modes modelling for models integrating the interior, atmosphere, both with realistic attenuation (intrinsic Q for solid part, viscosity and molecular relaxation for the atmosphere). We complete these modeling, made for spherical structure, by integration of wind, assuming the later to be homogeneous at the scale of the infrasound wavelength.\nThis allows us to compute either the Seismic normal modes (e.g. Rayleigh surface waves), or the acoustic or the atmospheric gravity modes. Comparisons are done, for either a seismic source or an atmospheric source, on the amplitude of expected signals as a function of distance and frequency. Effects of local time are integrated in the modeling. We illustrate the Rayleigh waves modelling by Earth data (for large quakes and volcanoes eruptions).\nFor Venus, very large coupling can occur at resonance frequencies between the solid part and atmospheric part of the planet through infrasounds/Rayleigh waves coupling. If the atmosphere reduced the Q (quality coefficient) of Rayleigh waves in general, the atmosphere at these resonance soffers better propagation than Venus crust and increases their Q.\nFor Mars, Rayleigh waves excitations by atmospheric burst is shown and discussed for the typical yield of impacts. The new data of the Nasa INSIGHT mission which carry both seismic and infrasound sensors will offer a unique confirmation in 2016-2017.\nWe conclude with the seismic/infrasounds coupling on Venus which make the detection from space of seismic waves possible through the perturbation of the infrared airglow by infrassounds.

            "abstract": "On November 5-11, China hosted the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Week in Beijing. To ensure good air quality during the APEC week, a series of strict emission control measures were taken in Beijing and surrounding provinces, which provide us with a great opportunity to examine the effectiveness of regional emission control. As important as emissions, meteorology can also significantly affect air quality in Beijing, so it’s meaningful to understand the impact of meteorology conditions in the APEC week. Besides, it’s important to study the impact of regional transport as its contribution to Beijing pollution levels is controversial. In this study, we investigate the impacts of emission control, meteorology and regional transport on the air quality during APEC week using a fully online coupled meteorology-chemistry model WRF-Chem. Compared to surface observations, the model has very good performance. The conclusions from this study will provide useful insights for government to control aerosol pollution in Beijing.",

            "abstract": "The LANL-UAF ice-ocean ecosystem model was developed to investigate how sea ice influences biogeochemical cycling in the arctic marine environment and predict how it will do so in the future. Sea ice is an integral component of arctic biogeochemical cycles. Rapidly changing sea ice conditions, such as thinning, increasing open water area and freshening impact C, N, and S cycles in multiple interacting ways. Here we discuss model results for chlorophyll, primary productivity, nutrients, and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the Arctic Ocean. We compare our results to observations and simulations from other Arctic biogeochemical models. Participation in several recent intercomparison studies provide context for interpretation of our own model results. Key seasonal features and spatial patterns of biogeochemical phenomena studied include pan-Arctic primary production, subsurface chlorophyll maxima, under-ice phytoplankton blooms, and relatively high seawater DMS concentrations following the retreating ice edge. Not surprisingly, in most all cases, the model’s success depends on how well the physical processes (e.g., vertical mixing, melt-water stratification) realistically distribute available nutrients. Further explanations for model-model and model-observation agreement/disagreement will be presented. While the model predicted high ice primary productivity recently recorded in the Bering Sea, the model shows no indication of extremely high seawater DMS recently observed at sea ice stations north of Svalbard. Preliminary model results from a high resolution version of our model, as part of the Regional Arctic System Model – Marine Biogeochemistry (i.e., RASM-mBGC) project, will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The High Arctic experiences prolonged periods of total darkness in the winter and continuous daylight in the summer, influencing the atmosphere and its composition in ways that are still not fully understood. Making atmospheric measurements in this remote region is challenging, particularly during polar night when solar-viewing instruments are not operational. By using infrared emission spectroscopy, which is independent of sunlight, we are able to document year-round the total column abundances of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3). Measurements made at two Arctic sites are presented in this study: the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL, Eureka, Nunavut, Canada, 80.05°N, 86.42°W) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility on the North Slope of Alaska (NSA, Barrow, Alaska, 71.19°N, 156.36°W). At both sites, Extended-range Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers (E-AERIs), are used to measure the absolute downwelling infrared emission from the atmosphere between 400 and 3000 cm-1. The E-AERI has a moderate resolution of 1 cm-1 and provides information about trace gases columns with high sensitivity to the lower troposphere. At PEARL, the instrument was installed in October 2008. In addition, a similar instrument, the University of Idaho’s Polar AERI (P-AERI) was installed at PEARL from March 2006 to June 2009. At NSA, the E-AERI has been operating since February 1998. Total columns of CO, CH4, N2O and O3 have been retrieved from 2006 to 2015 at PEARL and from 1998 to 2014 at NSA using the SFIT4 algorithm. These two datasets will be compared along with measurements made by high-resolution solar-viewing infrared spectrometers located at PEARL and at Poker Flat, Alaska (65.12°N, 147.47°W) to validate our results. These measurements will be used to present the annual, seasonal and diurnal variabilities of trace gases in the high Arctic at two different sites.",

            "abstract": "Iron isotope data from carbonatite rocks show the largest variability found in igneous rocks to date [1]. Thus, stable Fe isotopes are promising tracers for the interaction of carbonate and silicate magmas in the mantle, particularly because their fractionation is controlled by oxidation state and bonding environment. The interpretation of Fe isotope data from carbonatite rocks remains hampered, since Fe isotope fractionation factors between silicate and carbonate melts are unknown and inter-mineral fractionation can currently only be assessed by theoretical calculations [1;2].\nWe present results from equilibration experiments in three natrocarbonatite systems between immiscible silicate and carbonate melts, performed at 1200°C and 0.7 GPa in an internally heated gas pressure vessel at intrinsic redox conditions. The Fe isotope compositions of the silicate melt (sil.m.), quenched to a glass, and the carbonate melt (carb.m.), forming fine-grained quench crystals, were analysed by solution MC-ICP-MS.\nOur first data indicate a remarkable fractionation of Δ56Fesil.m.‒carb.m.= 0.29 ±0.07 ‰ near equilibrium. At short run durations, even stronger fractionation up to Δ56Fesil.m.‒carb.m. = 0.41 ±0.07 ‰ occurs, due to kinetic effects. Additionally, Δ56Fesil.m.‒carb.m. changes with bulk chemical composition, likely reflecting considerable differences between the studied systems in terms of the Fe3+/Fe2+-ratios in the two immiscible liquids. Our findings provide experimental support for a carbonatite genesis model, in which extremely negative δ56Fe values in carbonatites result from differentiation processes, such as liquid immiscibility [1]. This effect can be enhanced by disequilibrium during fast ascent of carbonatite magmas. Their sensitivity to chemical and redox composition makes Fe isotopes a potential tool for constraining the original compositions of carbonatite magmas.\n[1] Johnson et al. (2010) Miner.

            "abstract": "Meteor impacts are a very important seismic source for planetary seismology, since their locations and, in some cases, their occurence times can be accurately known from orbiters, tracking or optical observations. Their importance becomes greater in the case of a seismic experiment with one seismometer, as the SEIS (Seismic Experiment of Interior Structure) of the future Martian mission “InSight”, as the known location allows a direct inversion of differential travel times and wave forms in terms of structure.\nMeteor impacts generate body and surface seismic waves when they reach the surface of a planet. But when they explode into the atmosphere, due to ablation, they generate shock waves, which are converted into linear, seismic waves in the solid part and acoustic waves in the atmosphere. This effect can be modeled when the amplitude of Rayleigh and other Spheroidal normal modes is made with the atmospheric/ground coupling effects.\nIn this study, meteor impacts are modeled as seismic sources in a comparative analysis for the cases of Earth and Mars. Using the computed seismograms, calculated by the summation of the normal modes of the full planet (e.g. with atmosphere) the properties of the seismic source can be obtained. Its duration is typically associated to the radiation duration of shock waves until they reach the linear regime of propagation. These transition times are comparatively analyzed, for providing constraints on the seismic source duration on Earth and Mars.\nIn the case of Earth, we test our approach with the Chelyabinsk superbolide. The computed seismograms are used in order to perform the inversion of the source, by comparison with the data of the Global Seismographic Network. The results are interpreted and compared with other observations. In the case of Mars, equivalent sources are similarly modeled in different atmospheric, impact size and lithospheric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Adverse practices in alluvial surface mining (placer mining) can lead to shifts in sediment transport regimes of rivers. However, some placer mines are located in remote parts of river basins, which constrain data availability in mining impact assessments. One such mining area is the Zaamar Goldfield (Northern Mongolia) which stretches 60 km along the Tuul River. The area is located in the headwaters of the Lake Baikal Basin, and may impact the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Lake Baikal. Previous studies indicate that the mining industry in the Zaamar Goldfield loads the river system with considerable amount of contaminated sediments (heavy metals). Still, transport processes and possible changes in local to regional sediment transport need to be better understood. In this work, we use snapshot field measurements and various flow and transport modelling techniques to analyze (1) the impact of placer mining in the sediment delivery to the river system and (2) the dynamics of further sediment transport to downstream Tuul River. Our results indicate that surface mining operations and waste management have considerable impact on the sediment input from the landscape. Furthermore, dynamic in-channel storage of sediments can act as intermittent sources of mining sediments. These effects occur in addition to impacts of on-going changes in hydro-climatic conditions of the area. We hope that our methodology and results will aid in studying similar unmonitored and mining-affected river basins.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the roles, importance, and dynamics of tree non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) is currently an active area of research. The question of how the relationships between NSCs, growth, and mortality can be used to develop more accurate projections of forest dynamics is central to this research. To begin to address this question, we have asked an even more fundamental question: How much are trees allocating carbon to storage, in the form of NSCs, versus new growth? Ecological theory predicts that there should be trade-offs between different plant life history strategies provided that there are the carbon mass-balance constraints to enforce these trade-offs. Current data on tree NSCs lack the spatial and taxonomic extent required to properly address this question. Therefore, we established a network of forest inventory plots at ten sites across the eastern US and measured growth in adult trees using increment cores and repeat measures of diameter at breast height (DBH). Increment cores were also used to measure sapwood NSCs. We hypothesized that across the eastern US, shade tolerant species, e.g. Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) have the largest NSC reserves and that shade intolerant species have the lowest reserves. We also hypothesized that NSC reserves increase with temperature and precipitation, as with growth, and that within species NSC reserves increase with growth rate. Initial analyses of tree NSCs indicates that trees of intermediate shade tolerance, e.g. Red Oak (Quercus rubra) have the highest concentrations of sapwood NSCs, and among the highest growth rates. Across the entire study region, NSC concentrations are positively correlated with tree size and growth rate. Within species, NSC concentrations are also positively correlated with growth rate. Across functional groups healthy individuals have significantly higher sapwood NSC concentrations than visibly stressed individuals. There are also significantly lower NSC concentrations in sapwood of dead trees.",

Certainly precipitation and groundwater contribute to stream flow, and the hydrogeologic setting (i.e.., substrate, orientation of geological features, etc.) controls these interactions. Here we quantify the temporal patterns in groundwater gains to a stream and the mixing of stream and groundwater in riparian zones during summer baseflow recession in Gordon Gulch, Colorado. We use specific conductance and dissolved oxygen as natural tracers of stream and groundwater end-members to identify stream and groundwater mixing along a 1000 m reach. Beginning in June 2015, we collected data from the stream and 20 wells on an approximately weekly basis. Net stream flow gains to the stream range from <1% to >9%. The riparian wells are either consistently dominated by stream water or groundwater, or show varying dominance, with a few demonstrating a shift from stream water to groundwater dominance over this period. These results demonstrate that even in gaining streams, significant exchange of stream water and groundwater through the riparian aquifer is common, potentially fueling microbial activity in these zones.",

Godek\nDepartment of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, State University of New York College at Oneonta, New York 13820\nAbstract:\nEach year hurricanes impact thousands of people and over time changes in hurricane characteristics, such as intensity and frequency, have been identified. This study aims to examine changes in hurricane stage duration and track length of West Atlantic and eastern North Pacific hurricanes between 1980 and 2013. Category 2 through 5 hurricanes are analyzed as they evolved through the full life cycle of a hurricane (tropical depression to tropical storm to category). The NOAA National Ocean Service hurricane reanalysis datasets are used to identify 286 storms which are statistically analyzed by category for 1) temporal changes in stage duration with time and 2) temporal changes in stage track lengths with time. NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory daily mean composites of variables such as vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures are then examined to explain the temporal tendencies that may be related to climate change. Preliminary results indicate that category 2, 4 and 5 storms experienced an overall decrease in stage duration since 1980. For storms of these magnitudes, generally more rapid intensification to category has occurred over time. Contrarily, increased stage duration is detected for hurricanes that reached category 3 status, showing that these storms have strengthened more slowly with time. In all categories, a few unique cases occurred that exhibited stage durations greater than 1 standard deviation from the mean of the long term trend. These cases require further scrutiny for the environmental conditions that might explain the anomalous departures.\nKeywords: Hurricanes, West Atlantic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, Storm Tracks, Tropical Storm, Tropical Depression, Hurricane Stage",

            "abstract": "Riparian vegetation-geomorphic interactions are critical to the physical and biological function of riparian ecosystems, yet we lack a mechanistic understanding of these interactions and predictive ability at the reach to watershed scale. Plant functional groups, or groupings of species that have similar traits, either in terms of a plant’s life history strategy (e.g., drought tolerance) or morphology (e.g., growth form), may provide an expression of vegetation-geomorphic interactions. We are developing an approach that 1) identifies where along a river corridor plant functional groups exist and 2) links the traits that define functional groups and their impact on fluvial processes. The Green and Yampa Rivers in Dinosaur National Monument have wide variations in hydrology, hydraulics, and channel morphology, as well as a large dataset of species presence. For these rivers, we build a predictive model of the probable presence of plant functional groups based on site-specific aspects of the flow regime (e.g., inundation probability and duration), hydraulic characteristics (e.g., velocity), and substrate size. Functional group traits are collected from the literature and measured in the field. We found that life-history traits more strongly predicted functional group presence than did morphological traits. However, some life-history traits, important for determining the likelihood of a plant existing along an environmental gradient, are directly related to the morphological properties of the plant, important for the plant’s impact on fluvial processes. For example, stem density (i.e., dry mass divided by volume of stem) is positively correlated to drought tolerance and is also related to the modulus of elasticity. Growth form, which is related to the plant’s susceptibility to biomass-removing fluvial disturbances, is also related to frontal area. Using this approach, we can identify how plant community composition and distribution shifts with a change to the flow regime (e.g., as a result of dams or climate change) and as such, how the strength of the plant-geomorphic linkage may shift lateral to the stream and along the riparian corridor.",

By combining self-consistent polycrystal plasticity, inner-core formation models, and simulations of seismic measurements, we introduce a multi-scale self-consistent model that can reproduce observations of global seismic anisotropy of several percents and aligned with the Earth’s rotation axis. Necessary conditions for such model are an hexagonal-close-packed structure for the inner core Fe-alloy, 20% elastic anisotropy in the single crystal, plastic deformation by pyramidal slip, and large-scale flow induced by a low-degree inner-core formation model.

While participating in the Space Weather Research, Education and Development Initiative (SW REDI) Bootcamp and working as a Space Weather Analyst Intern, several innovative technologies and tools were integral to my learning and understanding of space weather analysis and forecasting. Two of the tools utilized in learning about space weather were the Integrated Space Weather Analysis System (iSWA) and the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI). iSWA, a web-based dissemination system, hosts many state‐of‐the‐art space weather models as well as real time space weather data from spacecraft such as Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Advanced Composition Explorer. As a customizable tool that operates in real-time while providing access also to historical data, iSWA proved essential in my understanding the drivers and impacts of space weather. DONKI was instrumental in accessing historical space weather events to understand the connections between solar phenomena and their effects on Earth environments. DONKI operates as a database of space weather events including linkages between causes and effects of space weather events. iSWA and DONKI are tools available also to the public. They not only enrich the space weather learning process but also allow researchers and model developers access to essential heliophysics and magnetospheric data.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayan orogen has been the key testing ground for geodynamic models of channel flow, the gravity-driven lateral flow of a layer of melt-weakened crust, since it was first proposed as an important tectonic process for the middle crust of large hot orogens. Over the last fifteen years, there has been a dedicated international effort to test field and analytical predictions of the channel flow model in the Himalaya, in particular discerning and comparing predictive characteristics of channel flow with that of a flow-absent critical Coulomb wedge. A range of structural, metamorphic and geological features of the Himalayan orogen are compatible with predictions from geodynamic models of channel flow. However, the longevity of flow, interaction with external critical Coulomb wedge processes, and overall amount of convergence accommodated by flow remain unresolved. Towards this end, documented tectonometamorphic discontinuities may record the complex interplay of channel flow and critical Coulomb wedge processes in time and space.\nRecent research in favour of preservation of a branch line of opposing-sense structures bounding the exposed middle crust of the Himalaya has been offered as evidence against active extrusion of a mid-crustal channel. Further, flow-absent wedge extrusion/duplexing has been proposed as a mechanism for producing the paired normal and thrust sense shear zones, the Himalaya’s inverted metamorphic sequence, and the tectonometamorphic discontinuities. Although duplexing shares geometric similarities with tunnelling channel flow, as a process it fails to explain the development and emplacement of Himalayan middle crust on rheological, structural and geological grounds.\nOutstanding questions that should drive discussion and future research: is evidence for a branch line compelling? Is evidence for channel flow active extrusion compelling? Are there along strike differences and how can these be explained in light of this discussion? Is duplexing a possible outcome of shortening a non-Coulomb layer?",

            "abstract": "Modeling Regime Shifts in the Logone floodplain (MORSL) is an ongoing interdisciplinary project at The Ohio State University studying the ecological, social and hydrological system of the region. This floodplain, located in Northern Cameroon, is part of the Lake Chad basin. Between September and October the floodplain is inundated by the overbank flow from the Logone River, which is important for agriculture and fishing. Fishermen build canals to catch fish during the flood’s recession to the river by installing fishnets at the intersection of the canals and the river. Fishing canals thus connect the river to natural depressions of the terrain, which act as seasonal ponds during this part of the year. Annual increase in the number of canals affect hydraulics and hence fishing in the region. In this study, the Bara region (1 km2) of the Logone floodplain, through which Lorome Mazra flows, is modeled using LISFLOOD-FP, a raster-based model with sub-grid parameterizations of canals. The aim of the study is to find out how the small-scale, local features like canals and fishnets govern the flow, so that it can be incorporated in a large-scale model of the floodplain at a coarser spatial resolution. We will also study the effect of increasing number of canals on the flooding pattern. We use a simplified version of the hydraulic system at a grid-cell size of 30-m, using synthetic topography, parameterized fishing canals, and representing fishnets as trash screens. The inflow at Bara is obtained from a separate, lower resolution (1-km grid-cell) model run, which is forced by daily discharge records obtained from Katoa, located about 25-km to the south of Bara. The model appropriately captures the rise and recession of the annual flood, supporting use of the LISFLOOD-FP approach. Predicted water levels at specific points in the river, the canals, the depression and the floodplain will be compared to field measured heights of flood recession in Bara, November 2014.",

            "abstract": "The Papoose Flat pluton in the White-Inyo Range, California, is one of the best examples of forceful magma emplacement at mid-crustal levels that is revealed by a highly strained aureole. A thermo-rheological 2-D model of the pluton and its aureole is proposed. We explored how the frequency of magma input, from instantaneous to continuous to the bottom of the laccolith, affects the ductile width of the aureole and the crystallinity of the pluton, which has implications for eruption of magma. We modeled these aspects at mid- and upper-crustal levels. The pluton was assumed to be 5 km thick in the middle and 13 km wide. Except for instantaneous growth, pluton was assumed to grow over 5 m.y. The aureole was assumed to have power-law rheology of quartz with dependence on H2O fugacity, which was calculated using the CORK equation (Holland & Powell, 1991)\nOur result shows that the bottom of the Papoose Flat pluton was emplaced at the brittle-ductile transition zone of the crust. The crustal rheology profile assisted the softening of rocks around the pluton. The simulated temperature and strength profiles confirm that ductile deformation was related to thermal weakening (Saint-Blanquat et al., 2001). Results of incremental growth calculations show that the pluton remains hot and only partially crystalline for millions of years when it grows by frequent input of small batches of liquid. At the mid-crustal level, the ductile region around the pluton is much wider and exists longer than at the shallow crustal level. Brittle rheology is dominant during the late stage growth at the shallow depth. When the pluton grows instantly or by only few episodes of large batches of input, the mobile part of the pluton is thin and the ductile aureole is narrower. High-frequency incremental growth by smaller magma batches produces a large volume of mobile magma that has the potential to induce internal magmatic layering that may be reflected in aligned acquired magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in upper parts of the pluton. By examing the chamber overpressure generated by injection of magma (Jellinek and DePaolo, 2003) and the overpressure related to magma buoyancy (Karlstrom et al, 2010), eruption during high-frequency magma input may be promoted by the magma buoyancy while an eruption during low-frequency input may be caused by injection of a large magma batch.",

            "abstract": "Comparing the cratering records of dwarf planet Ceres and the Saturnian satellite Rhea, offers a great opportunity in comparative planetology to fill the gaps of understanding of the cratering history of the two bodies. Both bodies show strong indications for a water-ice rich crust. For Ceres, the amount of ice in the crust is indeterminate. Early Dawn imaging data shows complex craters on Ceres which are smaller than those on the basaltic asteroid Vesta. The smallest complex craters on Ceres are similar in size (~10-15 km) to those on Rhea, which might indicate a rather high water-ice content in Ceres’ crust. The surface gravity on both bodies is almost equal, differing by only ~4%. Thus, regardless of their absolute values many variables required to relate projectile and crater size should be very similar on both bodies (surface gravity, strength to gravity transition, simple to complex transition, target density). The remaining variables such as projectile density and impact velocity are comparatively well known for Ceres but still in discussion for the Saturnian satellites. If the crater size-frequency distributions for craters >5 km from Rhea and Ceres are plotted together and are corrected for different projectile flux and exposure time, both records plot nearly on top of each other. This could indicate a common projectile population that impacted both bodies at nearly the same velocity. However, if the impacting projectile populations are very different, the impact velocity would have to compensate for such differences. Different ice temperatures may also play some role. Reducing the degrees of freedom increases the chance of understanding the projectile source and dynamics in the Saturnian system.

In June 1st, 2015, a cruise ship, Easter Star, capsized on Yangtze River in Hubei province with 442 died. What reason gives rise to such strong convection causing ship sunk? Based on the wind disasters of Hubei province happened in 1963-2015, this study analyzes their features bytime-series regression, and correlates them to global El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The compared results demonstrated that the wind disasters shown an increasing tendency. There are two peaks corresponding to the strongest ENSO peaks during the past 50 years; each peak lasts two-three years. The facts demonstrated an essential linear relation between the ENSO phenomena and wind disasters in Hubei province. 2015 Easter Star capsized happened at current El Niño event in 2014-2015. We also observed that the historical wind disasters appeared in seasonal variation. Over 90% events concentrated in spring and summer; very few events happened in autumn and winter. Moreover, the disasters depend on the geographic conditions. Most disasters concentrated in four zones, named as Xingshan-Baokang, Xuanen, Wufeng-Yichang, Jingzhou-Gongan, in which Xingshan and Changyang are the two most density of zones. Yangtze River provides an air flowing conduct for strong convective winds. It can be concluded that the strong convection causing 2015 Easter Star capsized is related to current global ENSO phenomenon.Keywords: ENSO, wind disaster, time-series regression analysis, Easter Star, Yangtze River, Hubei Province,",

A change in land use from cotton cropping systems to perennial grasses such as Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus giganteus (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. [Poaceae]) can significantly affect regional hydrologic cycle and water quality. Assessing the impacts of this potential land use change on hydrology and water quality enables the environmental assessment of feasibility to grow perennial grasses in this region to meet the U.S. national bioenergy target of 2022. The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was used in this study to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with switchgrass and Miscanthus on water and nitrogen balances in the upstream subwatershed of the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the THP, which contains 52% cotton land use. The APEX model was initially calibrated against observed streamflow and crop yield data. Since observed data on nitrogen loads in streamflow was not available for this subwatershed, we calibrated the APEX model against the SWAT-simulated nitrogen loads at the outlet of this subwatershed, which were obtained in a parallel study. The calibrated APEX model was used to simulate the impacts of land use change from cotton to Miscanthus and switchgrass on surface and subsurface water and nitrogen balances. Preliminary results revealed that the average (1994-2009) annual surface runoff decreased by 84% and 66% under the irrigated and dryland switchgrass scenarios compared to the baseline scenarios. Average annual percolation increased by 106% and 57% under the irrigated and dryland switchgrass scenarios relative to the baseline scenarios. Preliminary results also indicated Miscanthus and switchgrass appeared to be superior to cotton in terms of better water conservation and water quality, and minimum crop management requirements.",

            "abstract": "Reaction-transport modeling has been widely used to calculate methane hydrate content in continental margin sediments. Modeling accounts for sediment accumulation and compaction, pore water advection, and diffusion of dissolved methane. Methane is sourced in situ by microbial degradation of organic matter and/or is generated at depth and transported upward by pore water advection. Results are typically calculated as a function of depth only and at steady state. Modeling has successfully reproduced the depth distribution of methane hydrate observed in drill sites and has been applied to estimate the amount of hydrate in the global continental margin reservoir.\nA shortcoming of current approaches is that several key input parameters (e.g., sedimentation rate) are typically not well known a priori, while other parameters that control the solution (e.g., the depth distribution of microbial methane generation) are not uniquely determined by fitting observations. This study builds on earlier work by setting up a Monte Carlo inversion where the variability of uncertain model parameters is constrained by prior information and by the requirement of fitting observed methane hydrate contents. Monte Carlo sampling requires a fast reaction-transport modeling routine. The calculation used here obtains solutions in different depth intervals: the unknowns are the dissolved methane concentration where it is less than solubility, and hydrate content (or gas bubble volume fraction below the base of hydrate stability) where methane comes out of solution. The depths of the interfaces between these intervals are determined by requiring an equal mass flux of methane above and below each interface.\nRather than computing a single best-fit solution, the Monte Carlo inversion iteratively samples sets of input parameters that fit the depth distribution of methane hydrate observed at a drill site. This strategy allows for investigating trade-offs between modeling parameters, e.g., between upward methane transport by pore water advection and in situ microbial methane generation. The inversion can also be used to determine the depth distribution of microbial methane generation and to quantify its uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "One of the outstanding questions at Mars is how the surface water was lost. MAVEN, the newly arrived spacecraft at Mars, is dedicated to investigate how water can be lost via the upper atmosphere. The upper atmosphere is cold but the Mars gravity well is small meaning that light atoms can be lost through Jeans escape while heavier atoms such as O only need to gain a small amount of energy to escape. The critical region is at the exobase, the region (in altitude) at which the highly collisional atmosphere becomes collisionless. Below the exobase particles will collide frequently with the neutral atmosphere (which is ~10^5 orders of magnitude more dense than the charged ionosphere) and thermalize to the neutral temperature (~300 K at Mars). Thus, heating well below the exobase will be inefficient at enhancing escape as collisions will dominate and the heated particles will thermalize before escaping. The most efficient region to deposit energy is at and just above the exobase: low enough in altitude so that there are ample ions to heat but not so low that collisions dominate and prevent heated particles from escaping. For neutrals, recombination can for some species provide the escape energy while for ions plasma waves can efficiently deposit energy into them above the exobase. Using data from the MAVEN mission we can for the first time demonstrate that there are significant plasma waves close to the exobase that are heating the ions to high energies. Event studies will be presented demonstrating these plasma process close to the exobase and the implications to Mars’ escape rates will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the solar wind and the ionosphere of Venus forms an induced magnetosphere around the planet, which consists of regions near the planet and in its wake where magnetic pressure dominates the other pressure contributions. This induced magnetosphere and the ionosphere of Venus act as a barrier to the solar wind, leading to a bow shock with standoff distance very close the planet. Upstream of the bow shock, there is abundant wave activity generated by the shock or by the back-streaming ions and electrons from the shock. Previous studies found upstream waves with 1 Hz or lower frequencies, but Venus Express occasionally provides 128 Hz data that cover the regions up to the bow shock and allow us the search for and analyze higher frequency waves. Inside the magnetosheath and at the Venus ionopause, there are lightning-associated whistler waves detected from the 128 Hz data, which generally propagate along the magnetic field lines. Besides, there is another type of waves at such high frequencies which propagate quasi-perpendicular to the magnetic field and strongly associated with current sheets near the ionopause. They either occur at the center of a sharp current, or at the edge of a current. These waves may be generated from the free energy of currents at the ionopause and could lead to dissipation of those currents. In this paper, we perform statistical studies on the current-associated waves and examine their effects on current dissipation and on plasma heating. We examine waves at the bow shock in this higher frequency range.",

            "abstract": "In flume experiments muds flocculate in moving suspensions. Salinity enhances flocculation efficiency, but its absence will not prevent flocculation. The exact impact of salinity is subject to further experimental work. For a given mud composition there is a critical velocity (or shear stress) of sedimentation below which floccules transfer through the basal shear layer and travel as sand-size bedload particles. These bedload floccules form migrating ripples that are in size and geometry comparable to sand ripples. For various clays (illite, kaolinite, smectite) critical velocities of sedimentation are in the 20-25 cm/sec velocity window (5 cm flow depth). At higher velocities bedload particles are dense silt size (25-60 micron) clay composites, the coarse tail of the processed clay deposit. Once the critical velocity is reached (bed shear stress ~0.2 Pa) larger floccules appear in bedload that grow to a size of several hundred microns as velocity is lowered further.\nWhen clays are mixed with quartz silt, transport segregation occurs. Coarse silt (~15-63 microns) forms bedload ripples that travel over the flume bed at the same time as ripples that consist of flocculated clays. Fine silt (<15 microns) is integrated into clay floccules and travels separate from coarse silt. As ripples of either silt or clay migrate over the flume bed, they leave behind a thin veneer of sediment (a few particles thick), and over time a deposit results that consists of a random vertical succession of coarse silt laminae and clay rich laminae with scattered fine silt – a parallel laminated mud.\nThese experimental muds have direct counterparts in many ancient laminated shales from Precambrian to Tertiary. The ancient muds show the same segregation into coarse silt vs clay-rich laminae, and show scattered fine silt within clay rich layers. This strongly suggests that ancient laminated shales formed when bottom currents transported flocculated muds in bedload over the seabed.",

            "abstract": "Comparison of sea level and climate proxies shows fundamentally different causes and responses (periods, amplitudes, rates) for Myr scale sea-level changes in Hothouse, Cool Greenhouse, and Icehouse worlds. Peak warmth of the past 100 million years was achieved in the Hothouse intervals of the Cenomanian-Santonian (ca. 100-80 Ma) and early Eocene (56-50 Ma). Hothouse global average sea level falls of ~15 m are associated with d18O increases that reflect primarily high latitude cooling and may reflect the growth of small ice sheets in elevated regions of Antarctica. However, these purported Hothouse ice sheets are at or below the detection level of the d18O proxy (15 m ≤ 0.15‰), and it is possible that changes in groundwater storage (‘limnoeustasy’) could have caused these falls. Cool greenhouse (Campanian to Paleocene, middle to late Eocene) sea-level changes of 15-25 m were caused by growth and decay of small (25-35% of modern) ice sheets, pacing sea-level change on an apparent 2.4 Myr long eccentricity cycle, likely modulating 405 and 100 kyr cycles. Icehouse (past 33.8 Myr) sea-level and ice-volume changes were paced by the 1.2 Myr tilt cycle, with alternating states of 41 and 100 kyr dominance. Warm periods in the Icehouse displayed different sea-level responses. During the largely unipolar Icehouse of the Oligocene to early Miocene, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) was not permanently developed, with intervals of large-scale (~40-55 m sea level equivalent) growth and collapse. During peak warmth of the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO; ~17-15 Ma) ice volume changes were small (generally <20 m) and paced by the 100 kyr cycle. A permanent EAIS developed following 3 middle Miocene d18O increases (14.7, 13.8, and 13.2 Ma) that were largely cooling events associated with <40 m sea-level falls; the subsequent late Miocene EAIS displayed lower amplitude (~20-30 m) sea-level variations. Despite only moderate atmospheric CO2 levels (400±50 ppm), during the peak warmth interval of the Pliocene, sea levels were only 22±10 m above present (most likely 12-22 m) requiring loss of Greenland, West Antarctica, and small part of EAIS (likely the Wilkes Basin).",

            "abstract": "With rising demands for cleaner domestic energy resources, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques in unconventional hydrocarbon exploration have been extensively developed. However, the observation that some water wells have showed elevated concentrations of dissolved methane and other light hydrocarbons has caused public concern regarding unconventional energy extraction. In this contribution, we present noble gas data of production shale gases from the Barnett and Strawn Formations, as well as nearby groundwater samples in south-central Texas. The Barnett Shale located in the Fort Worth Basin at an average depth of ~2300 m is one of the most prominent shale gas plays in the U.S. This DOE-sponsored study explores the potential of noble gases for fingerprinting shale gas and thus, for identifying the sources of gas in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale, due either to natural hydrocarbon occurrences or potentially related to gas production from unconventional energy resources.\nA total of 35 groundwater samples were collected in Parker and Hood counties in areas where high amounts of methane (>10 mg/L) were detected in shallow groundwater. Two gas samples were also collected directly from groundwater wells where bubbling methane was present. Preliminary results show that He concentrations in water samples, in excess of up to three orders of magnitude higher than expected atmospheric values are directly correlated with methane concentrations. 3He/4He ratio values vary from 0.030 to 0.889 times the atmospheric ratio with the lowest, more pure radiogenic contributions being associated with highest methane levels. The presence of crustally-produced radiogenic 40Ar is also apparent in groundwater samples with 40Ar/36Ar ratios up to 316. A combined analysis of 40Ar/36Ar ratios from groundwater wells bubbling gas and that of shale gas suggests that the source of this methane is not the heavily exploited Barnett Shale, but rather, the Strawn Formation.",

            "abstract": "Innovative technologies in field experimentation have advanced the conceptual understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions, in particular at patch to reach scales. Up-scaling of this knowledge often requires generalisations in numerical models. Recent studies of the importance of small-scale processes and conditions at larger reach and catchment scales have sparked discussions to what degree common simplifications made in groundwater-surface water modelling may influence the ability to simulate interface processes realistically and contribute to informed decision making for river basin and aquifer management. In this paper, we address one specific question: Does increasing complexity improve the performance of groundwater-surface water models across the groundwater – surface water interface?\nA 3D model of the Tern River, UK, was developed to investigate groundwater flow paths, residence time distributions and groundwater-surface water exchange. The model was set up to test two comparative parameterisations: (1) homogeneous representation of the shallow subsurface and (2) heterogeneous subsurface geology utilising extensive core data and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys of the area and in particular the streambed interface. Both the models were compared for residence time distributions and development of preferential flow paths. The models were validated against continuous hydraulic head readings at piezometers and Distributed Temperature Sensors (DTS)-based information of groundwater-surface water exchange. The heterogeneous model predicted increased lateral flow and altered preferential flow paths around low conductivity structures and differences in residence times within the site that was controlled by the subsurface structure. The differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous subsurface models indicate that increased model complexity produced more accurate representation of the site conditions. In comparison, the homogenous model with simplified subsurface conditions failed to adequately represent interface exchange flow patterns and residence time distributions in the subsurface. Importantly, quantified residence time distributions in the model including heterogeneity helped to identify biogeochemical hotspots.",

CMEs can damage satellites, endanger astronauts, and affect powerlines on earth, so understanding and predicting CMEs is a priority. It is hypothesized that an incoming intense CME will push the particles in front, increasing the velocity of these particles. Due to conservation of momentum, it is proposed that the lighter elements will have a greater increase in velocity. Data was collected from the SWICS (Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer) instrument on the ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) satellite and SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) and analyzed. It was found that with an increase in the ratio of light elements to heavier elements, such as Helium to Oxygen, an intense CME is likely to occur a few days after. However, not all increases of Helium to Oxygen ratio were associated with a CME, especially if the CME was relatively weak. In addition, a 0.9976 correlation was found between the density of Helium particles and the ratio of Helium to Oxygen. It was found that an increase in velocity of Helium also leads to numerous increases in Helium to Oxygen ratio. These indicators may be used to forecast incoming CMEs.",

            "abstract": "Based on tectonic analysis on the well-exposed riverbed outcrops in the Guoshing area, central Taiwan, we elucidate the deformation structure pattern and its evolution during the upward propagation of a thrust sheet in fold-thrust belt. We mainly focused on a section of continuous outcrops about 1 km long in the hanging wall of the Shuangtung Fault, a major thrust fault in the western foothills of the Taiwan mountain belt. By detailed field investigation we established a local geological 3-D architecture of deformed strata, which is characterized by two to three duplex structures accompanied by multiple folds, which plunge exclusively toward the North. We conducted fault slip data and fracture analysis via Faultkin software. By further comparing the brittle fractures with fold structure, our results show that slickenside faulting occurred on multiple phase throughout the propagation of the thrust sheet on the hanging wall of the Shuangtung fault and that the multiple wave folding seemingly developed in the late stage during the exhumation of the thrust sheet. We are finally able to summarize the evolution of the deformation structures in Guoshing area as following: 1) one early syn-sedimentary faulting with NNW-SSE extension, 2) two phases of compressional thrusting events; one is early conjugate thrust system with E-W compression which may indicate the beginning of thrusting when the strata of this thrust sheet still kept horizontal at depth of about 4-6 km. Then, the hanging wall strata have been tilted through upward movement of the thrust sheet along the Shuangtung Fault. During this period, a late conjugate thrust system (with NNE to E-W compression) developed at the shallow depth of 2-4 km. 3) late stage strike-slip faulting, which often is found to cut across the thrust slickenside. We found that the late stage of slickenside faulting events is likely syn-folding with the multiple folds of the wave length of about 60-80 meters. Our observation and analysis also shows that parts of late stage thrust followed the pre-existing fractures developed in the earlier stages. However, whether the strata have experienced block rotation still needs further paleomagnetic study.",

One interpretation of this discovery is that the accessible Earth has a Sm/Nd ratio that is 5-7% higher than chondrites, which resulted from an early (20-30 Ma after accretion), catastrophic extraction of geochemically-enriched crust from the Earth’s mantle (Boyet and Carlson, Science, 2005). The location of this early-formed enriched reservoir is unknown (it is either hidden in the deep Earth or was lost to space by impact erosion), but is critical, as it hosts the equivalent of the modern continents’ budget of the radioactive heat-producing elements: U, Th and K. If the early-enriched reservoir is no longer in the Earth, there are profound implications for the geochemical and thermal evolution of the planet. First, the bulk silicate Earth would have a present-day 143Nd/144Nd of ~0.5130, and all modern terrestrial mantle and crustal reservoirs were ultimately derived from a non-chondric mantle with superchondritic Sm/Nd. Second, this composition matches the most frequently-occurring 143Nd/144Nd ratio (0.5130, PREMA) in ocean island basalts, including lavas with primitive 3He/4He, and suggests that large portions of the mantle sampled by OIB remain little-modified with respect to 143Nd/144Nd. Third, the modern continents were extracted from a previously depleted mantle, meaning that the modern mantle is pervasively depleted in highly incompatible elements, and that the mantle’s radiogenic heat production is 50% lower than in chondrite-based models. The new bulk silicate Earth composition therefore presents challenges for describing the thermal history of the planet, but may lead to a stable plate tectonic regime over time and could be more conducive to supporting a habitable world.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 9.0 Tohoku megathrust earthquake on 11 March 2011 is a great surprise to the scientific community due to its unexpected occurrence on the subduction zone of Japan Trench where earthquakes of magnitude ~7 to 8 are expected based on historical records. Slip distribution and kinematic slip history inverted from seismic data, GPS and tsunami recordings reveal two major aspects of this big event: a strong asperity near the hypocenter and large slip near the trench. To investigate physical conditions of these two aspects, we perform dynamic rupture simulations on a shallow-dipping rate- and state-dependent subduction plane with topographic relief. Although existence of a subducted seamount just up-dip of the hypocenter is still an open question, high Vp anomalies [Zhao et al., 2011] and low Vp/Vs anomalies [Yamamoto et al., 2014] there strongly suggest some kind of topographic relief exists there. We explicitly incorporate a subducted seamount on the subduction surface into our models. Our preliminary results show that the subducted seamount play a significant role in dynamic rupture propagation due to the alteration of the stress state around it. We find that a subducted seamount can act as a strong barrier to many earthquakes, but its ultimate failure after some earthquake cycles results in giant earthquakes. Its failure gives rise to large stress drop, resulting in a strong asperity in slip distribution as revealed in kinematic inversions. Our preliminary results also suggest that the rate- and state- friction law plays an important role in rupture propagation of geometrically complex faults. Although rate-strengthening behavior near the trench impedes rupture propagation, an energetic rupture can break such a barrier and manage to reach the trench, resulting in significant uplift at seafloor and hence devastating tsunami to human society.",

            "abstract": "During the winter months, the occurrence of rain-on-snow (ROS) events can impact snow stratigraphy via generation of large scale ice crusts, e.g., on or within the snowpack. The formation of such layers significantly alters the electromagnetic response of the snowpack, which can be witnessed using space-based microwave radiometers. In addition, ROS layers can hinder the ability of wildlife to burrow in the snow for vegetation, which limits their foraging capability. A prime example occurred on 23 October 2003 in Banks Island, Canada, where an ROS event is believed to have caused the deaths of over 20,000 musk oxen. Through the use of passive microwave remote sensing, ROS events can be detected by utilizing observed brightness temperatures (Tb) from AMSR-E. Tb observed at different microwave frequencies and polarizations depends on snow properties. A wet snowpack formed from an ROS event yields a larger Tb than a typical dry snowpack would. This phenomenon makes observed Tb useful when detecting ROS events. With the use of data retrieved from AMSR-E, in conjunction with observations from ground-based weather station networks, a database of estimated ROS events over the past twelve years was generated. Using this database, changes in measured Tb following the ROS events was also observed. This study adds to the growing knowledge of ROS events and has the potential to help inform passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals or snow cover properties in polar regions.",

            "abstract": "We quantify systematic variations in morphological characteristics of global transform faults and investigate their dependence on spreading rate, local magma supply, and other tectonic variables. Detailed analyses were conducted on 78 transform faults where high-resolution multibeam bathymetry data are available. The investigated transform systems span a wide range of spreading rate and local magma supply, including examples from the East Pacific Rise, Juan de Fuca Ridge, Chile Rise, Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, Southeast Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, American-Antarctic Ridge, Southwest Indian Ridge, and other systems. The analyses revealed systematic global and local variations in transform morphological characteristics: (1) The average transform age offset and depths shows a moderate increase with decreasing spreading rate: 1.0 Ma and 3.6 km (s = 0.21 km), 1.5 Ma (s = 0.9 Ma) and 3.8 km (s = 0.12 km), 2.2 Ma (s = 1.7 Ma and 4.5 km (s = 0.14 km), and 5.3 Ma (s = 3.5 Ma) and 4.8 km (s = 0.20 km) for the fast, intermediate fast, slow, and ultraslow ridges, respectively, corresponding to average transform length of 111 km (s = 75 km), 81 km (s = 73 km), 71 km (s = 40 km), and 92 km (s = 49 km), respectively. (2) Morphological “hooks”, i.e., axial morphological highs that curve around a ridge-transform intersection, appear to be most distinctive in regions of relatively robust magma supply, especially at fast and intermediate fast ridges. (3) In contrast, “nodal basins” usually develop at the ridge-transform intersection of relatively slow spreading systems and low magma supply. The depth of the nodal basin appears to moderately increase with decreasing spreading rate with an average depth of 3.8 km (s = 0.5 km) for the investigated systems. Thus the calculated values of average transform fault depth, ridge-transform intersection depth, and age-offset of the investigated systems all appear to increase with decreasing spreading rate. However, the observed relatively large values of standard deviations, as well as multiple examples of transform systems with major morphological and geophysical anomalies, suggest the additional influence of local magma supply and other tectonic variables. We are currently conducting geodynamics models to investigate the mechanisms controlling these systematic variations.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation cover in the tropics is limited by moisture availability. Since transpiration from forests is generally greater than from grasslands, the sensitivity of precipitation in the Amazon to large-scale deforestation has long been seen as a critical parameter of climate-vegetation interactions. Most Amazon deforestation experiments to date have been performed with interactive land-atmosphere models but prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs). They reveal a strong reduction in evapotranspiration and precipitation, and an increase in global air surface temperature due to reduced latent heat flux. We performed large-scale tropical deforestation experiments with three Earth system models (ESMs) including interactive ocean models, which participated in the FP7 project EMBRACE. In response to tropical deforestation, all models simulate a significant reduction in tropical precipitation, similar to the experiments with prescribed SSTs. However, all three models suggest that the response of global temperature to the deforestation is a cooling or no change, differing from the result of a global warming in prescribed SSTs runs. Presumably, changes in the hydrological cycle and in the water vapor feedback due to deforestation operate in the direction of a global cooling. In addition, one of the models simulates a local cooling over the deforested tropical region. This is opposite to the local warming in the other models. This suggests that the balance between warming due to latent heat flux decrease and cooling due to albedo increase is rather subtle and model-dependent. Last but not least, we suggest using large-scale deforestation as a standard biogeophysical experiment for model intercomparison within the CMIP6 framework.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: The area of eastern coastal provinces of China is one of the most developed regions in China. Previous studies of PM2.5 pollution were mainly focused on the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Bejing-Tianjing-Heibei (BTH) region, which are respectively located in the north and south of this study area. In this study, we treated this area as a whole. Based on hourly PM2.5 concentrations of 55 cities located in this area and meteorological fields in China, we investigated the spatial and temporal variabilities of PM2.5 concentrations over the study area, and analyzed the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and weather conditions. We found that the PM2.5 pollution did not only occur in the traditional focused regions, i.e., YRD and BTH, but also happened in the whole area. During winter, there were 49 cities with their mean concentrations exceeding the China’s national standard (75 μg/m3), in which 12 cities’ concentrations were greater than 150 μg/m3. The 12 cities are located in the southwest of Hebei and the west of Shandong provinces, including Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Handan, Liaocheng, etc. The PM2.5 pollution in December was more serious than the other two months. In December, there were about one third of the whole 55 cities with their monthly mean concentrations exceeding 150μg/m3. From December to February, except in the north area of BTH, the mean concentrations had a decreasing trend. Inspecting into the weather conditions, we found that there were strong relationship between the high PM2.5 pollution and the weather condition. Generally, high PM2.5 pollution is corresponding to a stable weather condition, and low PM2.5 concentration is corresponding to a fast moving of cold anticyclone, indicating that the emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors in most area are too high that once the weather condition becomes stable, the pollution comes, specially in the south of Heibei and the west of Shandong areas. We also found that there were strong impacts of air pollution from the BTH to the YRD along with the movement of cold anticyclone. This study gives a full insight into the PM2.5 pollution in the area of eastern coastal provinces of China during winter, which would be helpful to forecast and control the PM2.5 pollution in this area.\nKeywords: PM2.5; Winter; Eastern coastal provinces; Weather condition",

Predominantly, these programs focus on the sequestration of greenhouse gasses in vegetation and soils, generating offset credits for projects which demonstrate considerable storage. However, it is widely known that biogeophysical interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, such as latent and sensible heat flux, albedo radiative forcing, and surface roughness, can in many cases outweigh the influence of greenhouse gas storage on global and local climate. Surface albedo, in particular, has attracted attention in the context of these frameworks because it has been shown to influence the overall climate benefits of high-latitude forest growth through tradeoffs between carbon sequestration and radiative forcing from seasonal snow cover albedo. Here we review a methodology for pricing albedo-related radiative forcing through the use of an integrated assessment model, present the results under several emissions and social preference scenarios, and describe the implications that this pricing methodology may have on forest land management in the Northeastern United States. Additionally, we investigate the consequences of projected decreased winter precipitation on the net climate benefits of snow albedo throughout the state of New Hampshire, USA.",

Drilling is the most direct method to characterise the nature of these sediments, but the drilling is very expensive, and provide information at only a few locations. In north Sumatra, an IODP drilling is programmed to take place in July-August 2016. We have performed seismic full waveform inversion of 12 km long offset seismic reflection data acquired by WesternGeco in 2006 over a 35 km zone near the subduction front in the 2004 earthquake rupture zone area that provide detailed quantitative information on the characteristics of the incoming sediments. We first downward continue the surface streamer data to the seafloor, which removes the effect of deep water (~5 km) and brings out the refraction arrivals as the first arrivals. We carry out travel time tomography, and then performed full waveform inversion of seismic refraction data followed by the full waveform inversion of reflection data providing detailed (10-20 m) velocity structure. The sediments in this area are 3-5 km thick where the P-wave velocity increases from 1.6 km/s near the seafloor to more than 4.5 km/s above the oceanic crust. The high velocity of sediments above the basement suggests that the sediments are highly compacted, strengthened the coupling near the subduction front, which might have been responsible for 2004 earthquake rupture propagation up to the subduction front, enhancing the tsunami. We also find several thin velocity layers within the sediments, which might be due to high pore-pressure fluid or free gas. These layers might be responsible for the formation of pseudo-decollement within the forearc sediments that acts as a conveyer belt between highly compacted subducting lower sediments and accreted sediments above. The presence of well intact sediments on the accretionary prism supports this interpretation. Our results provide first hand information about the sediments properties, which will be ground toothed by drilling.",

Ultra-slow spreading centers are thought to have very thin crust and a paucity of magmatism due to cooler mantle conditions. However, the suggestion that gabbro-cored oceanic core complexes (OCCs), volcanic deposits, and multiple layers of hydrothermal vents are widespread in the MCSC and other ultra-slow spreading centers has led to questions about the relationship between seafloor spreading rates and magmatism. To investigate this further, we conducted the CaySEIS experiment, with five wide-angle seismic refraction lines parallel and perpendicular to the neovolcanic zone. This analysis is based on two east-west oriented 100-km-long seismic refraction lines, which were each occupied by 18 ocean bottom seismometers. Line 2 lies across the central MCSC and an OCC called Mt. Dent. Line 3 crosses the northern end of the MCSC near the Oriente Transform Zone. With the wide-angle OBS data we can image the seismic velocity structure of Mt. Dent and distinguish between two models of OCCs – either Mt. Dent is composed of mostly gabbro with peridotite lenses identified by a low velocity gradient, or it is composed of mostly peridotite with gabbroic bodies identified by a constant velocity gradient. The crustal structure of both lines gives more insight into the asymmetry of the MCSC and the style of seafloor spreading to the east vs. the west. The 2-D velocity models reveal Mt. Dent has thick crust of 8 km with a low velocity gradient, supporting the magmatic gabbroic origin of OCCs. The surrounding crust to the west of the MCSC is highly variable, with areas of very thin crust. The crust to the east of the MCSC has an approximately constant thickness of 4 km. The development of OCCs may contribute to the crustal heterogeneity of ultra-slow spreading centers.",

The development, over the last two decades, of analytical methods for measuring very precisely U-series nuclides (especially, 234U, 230Th and 226Ra) in environmental samples has opened up new scientific applications in Earth Surface Sciences. Here, we propose to present the potential of U activity ratios in surface waters as geochemical tracer and chronometer of water transfers at a watershed scale. This will be illustrated from studies performed at different scales, with the analysis of U activity ratios in surface waters from small watersheds (Strengbach and Ringelbach watersheds in the Vosges Mountain, France) but also from watersheds of much more regional extension (e.g., the Upper Rhine basin or the Ganges basin).\nThese various studies show that variations of U activity ratios in surface waters are mainly associated with 234U-238U fractionations occurring during the water transfer within the bedrock, which intensity depends on two main parameters: the petro-physical characteristics of the aquifer, principally the geometry of water-rock interfaces and the duration of the water-rock interactions. This readily explains why different U activity ratios (UAR) can be observed in the different aquifers of a continental hydrosystem and hence why UAR can be used to trace the source of river waters. For a hydrological system developed on a substratum marked by fairly homogeneous petro-physical characteristics, the main parameter controlling the UAR in waters draining such a system would be the duration of the water-rock interactions. Variations of UAR in stream or spring waters of such a system can therefore be modeled using simple reactive transport model, which allows the estimation of both the dissolution rate of the bedrock and the residence time of the waters within the aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Lake Tulane is a relatively deep (~23 m) solution lake in south-central Florida. Its depth and location on a structural high, the Lake Wales Ridge, enabled continuous lacustrine sediment accumulation over the past >60,000 years. Pollen in the lake sediments indicate repeated major shifts in the vegetation community, with six peaks in Pinus (pine) abundance that coincide with the most intense cold phases of Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles and the Heinrich events that terminate them. Alternating with Pinus peaks are zones with high relative percentages of Quercus (oak), Ambrosia (ragweed), Lyonia (staggerbush) and Ceratiola (rosemary) pollen, genera that today occupy the most xeric sites on the Florida landscape. This suggests the pollen record indicates the Pinus phases, and therefore Heinrich Events, were wetter than the intervening Quercus phases. To test the connection between Heinrich Events and precipitation in Florida, we analyzed the carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δD) isotope signatures of plant biomarkers extracted from the Lake Tulane sediment core as proxies of paleohydrology. The δ13C of plant biomarkers, such as n-alkanes and terpenoids, are determined, in part, by changes in water-use efficiency (WUE = Assimilation/Transpiration) in plant communities, which changes in response to shifts in mean annual precipitation. Plant δ13C values can, therefore, provide a rough indication of precipitation changes when other factors, such as plant community, are relatively stable throughout time. Paleohydrology is also recorded in the δD of plant leaf waxes, which are strongly controlled by precipitation δD. In this region, precipitation δD is negatively correlated with rainfall amount (i.e. the “amount” effect) and positively correlated with aridity. Thus, the δ13C and δD signatures of molecular plant biomarkers provide relative indicators of precipitation change, and when combined, provide a test of our hypothesis that vegetation changes in this region are driven by changes in aridity.",

            "abstract": "The volumetric properties of multi-component carbonate liquids are required to extend thermodynamic models that describe partial melting of the deep mantle (e.g. pMELTS; Ghiorso et al., 2003) to carbonate-bearing lithologies. Carbonate in the mantle is an important reservoir of carbon, which is released to the atmosphere as CO2 through volcanism, and thus contributes to the carbon cycle. Although MgCO3 is the most important carbonate component in the mantle, it is not possible to directly measure the 1-bar density and compressibility of MgCO3 liquid because, like other alkaline-earth carbonates, it decomposes at a temperature lower than its melting temperature. Despite this challenge, Liu and Lange (2003) and O’Leary et al. (2015) showed that the one bar molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility of the CaCO3 liquid component could be obtained by measuring the density and sound speeds of stable liquids in the CaCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary system at one bar. In this study, this same strategy is employed on SrCO3- and BaCO3-bearing alkali carbonate liquids. The density and sound speed of seven liquids in the SrCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary and three liquids in the BaCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary were measured from 739-1367K, with SrCO3 and BaCO3 concentrations ranging from 10-50 mol%. The density measurements were made using the double-bob Archimedean method and sound speeds were obtained with a frequency-sweep acoustic interferometer. The molar volume and sound speed measurements were used to calculate the isothermal compressibility of each liquid, and the results show the volumetric properties mix ideally with composition. The partial molar volume and compressibility of the SrCO3 and BaCO3 components are compared to those obtained for the CaCO3 component as a function of cation field strength. The results reveal a systematic trend that allows the partial molar volume and compressibility of the MgCO3 liquid component to be estimated.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 7 years we made use of the long-term research site at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in central Maryland to study the fluxes of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in three small first-order mid-Atlantic coastal plain watersheds. One watershed is entirely forested, one watershed is primarily agriculture with a forested stream buffer, and one watershed is mixed land use but contains a beaver produced wetland pond. Our initial goals were to assess watershed Hg yields in the mid-Atlantic and to establish a baseline prior to implementation of Hg emissions controls. All three studied watersheds produced relatively high yields of Hg, with the greatest yield coming from the forested watershed. Our initial evaluation of three watersheds showed that MeHg production and flux could also be high, but varied dramatically among watersheds and across years and seasons.\nDuring each year we observed episodic MeHg production in the spring and sometimes during prolonged high-flow storm events in the fall. The observed spring maxima of MeHg release coincided with development of anoxia in riparian groundwater. MeHg accumulation in riparian groundwater began once nitrate was depleted and either iron accumulation or sulfate depletion of groundwater began. We propose the presence of nitrate was modulating MeHg production through the suppression of sulfate and iron reducers and perhaps methanogens. As sulfate is not limiting in any of the watersheds owing to the sediments marine origin, we hypothesize the depletion of nitrate allows sulfate reducing bacteria to now utilize available carbon. Although wetlands are generally thought of as the primary zones of MeHg production in watersheds, shallow riparian groundwaters very close to the stream appear to play that role in SERC Coastal Plain watersheds. We hypothesize that the balance between nitrate, sulfate and other microbial electron acceptors in watersheds is a major control on MeHg production. Land management practices that change upset this balance by changing nitrate load and carbon quality will undoubtedly impact the cycling of Hg.",

            "abstract": "The geological cycling of carbon ties together the sedimentary reservoirs with Earth's biosphere and climate. Perturbations to this coupled system are recorded in the carbon isotopic composition of marine limestones (δ13Ccarb). In the past decade numerous intervals of large-amplitude oscillations in δ13Ccarbhave been identified, with a variety of explanations proposed for individual events. Yet, when data spanning the past ~1 Ga are viewed as a whole, it is clear that large-scale oscillations are a common feature of the carbon isotopic record. The ubiquity of oscillations suggests that they may share a single origin rather than having many disparate causes.\nHere we present a simple two-box model of the geological carbon cycle exhibiting such oscillations: the Carbon-Cycle Oscillator. Analogous to a damped mass-spring system, the burial fluxes of carbonate and phosphate in the model act like friction, whereas P supply and Corg burial act like the restoring force of the spring. When the sensitivities of P supply and Corg burial to the sizes of the C and P reservoirs, respectively, increase above a critical threshold, the model exhibits oscillations upon perturbation.\nWe suggest that intervals with large oscillations in bulk ocean-atmosphere δ13C are characterized by a greater sensitivity of the C:P burial-ratio and ALK:P weathering-ratio to the state of the ocean-atmosphere carbon pool. In addition, moderating of the slope of that dependence in general can account for the observed decrease in the amplitude of oscillations over the past billion years. We hypothesize that factors with a unidirectional trajectory during Earth history (e.g. increased oxygenation of the deep ocean, and evolution of pelagic calcifiers) led to a decrease in the Earth System's gain and increase in its resilience over geologic time, even in the face of continuing perturbations from the solid Earth and extraterrestrial realms.",

Enhanced La Niña-like conditions and cooler SSTs characterized the middle Holocene (~8.O to 4.0 ka) waters off northern California and in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Terrestrial records suggest that winters in the western US were generally dry, although wetter intervals attributed to winter precipitation beginning at ~5.5 ka are documented in coastal Oregon and Washington and in the northern Great Basin. Proxy studies suggest that the North American Monsoon (NAM) intensified beginning at ~7.5 ka, coinciding with warming Gulf of California SSTs coupled with a more northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). If monsoonal precipitation spread northward into the eastern Great Basin and the western Rockies of Colorado, it is possible that wetter intervals of the middle Holocene in Nevada, Utah, and western Colorado may reflect increases in both summer and winter precipitation.\nEl Niño event frequency and intensity began increasing between 4.0 and 3.0 ka, when modern ocean-atmosphere dynamics appear to have been established along the California coastal margin. Effects included cool, wet winters, enhanced spring coastal upwelling that extended into the summer, and higher September-October SSTs corresponding with the end of the coastal upwelling season. Winters became wetter in both the coastal and interior regions of the western US, while spring and summers generally became drier. The intensity of NAM precipitation also declined due to a more southerly mean position of the ITCZ. By ~3.0 cal ka the modern climatology of the margins of eastern North Pacific was established, resulting in intensification of the northwest-southwest precipitation dipole and the development of distinct Pacific Decadal Oscillation cycles.",

We show that both the Percus-Yevick pair functions and the bicontinuous model have tails in the correlation functions that are distinctly different from the traditional exponential correlation functions. The methodologies of using ground measurements of grain size distributions and correlation functions to obtain model parameters are addressed.\nThe DMRT theory has been extended to model the backscattering enhancement. We developed the methodology of cyclical corrections beyond first order to all orders of multiple scattering. This enables the physical modeling of combined active and passive microwave remote sensing of snow over the same scene. The bicontinuous /DMRT is applied to compare with data acquired in the NoSREx campaign, and the model results are validated against coincidental active and passive measurements using the same set of physical parameters of snow in all frequency and polarization channels.\nThe DMRT is a partially coherent approach that one accounts for the coherent wave interaction only within few wavelengths as represented by phase matrix. However, the phase information of field is lost in propagating the specific intensity via RT and this hinders the use of DMRT in coherent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis, including InSAR, PolInSAR and Tomo-SAR. One can alternatively calculate the scattering matrix of the terrestrial snowpack above ground by solving the volume integral equations directly with half space Green’s function. The scattering matrix of the snowpack is computed for each realization giving rise to the speckle statistics. The resulting bistatic scattering automatically includes the backscattering enhancement effects. Tomograms of the snow pack are constructed and compared using back-projection and frequency and angular correlation functions. The co-pol phase differences of the scattered wave are also computed by modeling the snowpack as densely packed spheroids with distinct orientation preferences within different layers of snow pack.",

            "abstract": "Ooids are concentrically laminated carbonate grains, occurring in a limited number of modern shallow marine and lacustrine settings. Oolitic sedimentary rocks (oolite) are common in the geological record, particularly in the Precambrian, and subsequent to some mass extinction events. Despite their significance, controversy remains about processes that form and shape ooids. Abiotic models typically favour carbonate precipitation in suspension in supersaturated, agitated water while biotic models emphasise microbial benthic contribution to ooid carbonate precipitation in relatively low turbulence waters. While various interpretations of ooids in the geological record have been made, the ongoing formation debate, together with post-depositional diagenesis, hinders our ability to interpret and utilize ooids to reconstruct Earth’s past environments and biodiversity. Recently, Neoproterozoic oolitic carbonates have been shown to preserve C-isotopic records of environmental change and carbon cycle anomalies. This prompts the question whether molecular organic biosignatures can be found in well-preserved oolite. Here, lipid biomarker analysis and Illumina sequencing of modern ooids at Pigeon Cay, the Bahamas, revealed colonization of ooids by biofim-producing α-proteobacteria and diatoms, sulfate-reducing bacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs, as well as some cyanobacteria, in calm waters adjacent to the surf zone. These were comparable to communities associated with microbially-cemented grapestones. Relict lipids bound within ooid carbonate were also dominated by bacterial fatty acids, hydroxy acids and hopanoids. This indicates that a common, bacteria-dominated, microbial community is directly involved in carbonate precipitation of ooids and grapestones, likely by autotrophic metabolism and organomineralization of biofilms. Analysis of oolites as old as Jurassic in age revealed the preservation of hydrocarbons, as well as appreciable amounts of fatty acids, and emphasises the potential utility of oolites to preserve organic biosignatures. Further comparison of biomarkers from ooids from different environmental conditions and preservation state will provide insight into syngenetic molecular signals of environmental conditions and biological diversity in ancient oolite.",

            "abstract": "In the context of energy demand side management (DSM), energy storage solutions are needed to store energy during high production periods and recover energy during high demand periods. Among currently studied solutions, storing energy in the subsurface through heat pumps and/or exchangers (thermal energy storage) is relatively simple with low investment costs. However, the design and functioning of such systems have strong interconnections with the geology of the site which may be complex and heterogeneous, making predictions difficult. In this context, local temperature measurements are necessary but not sufficient to model heat flow and transport in the subsurface. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) provides spatially distributed information on the temperature distribution in the subsurface. In this study, we monitored, with 4D ERT combined with multiple hydrological measurements in available wells, a short-term heat storage experiment in a confined alluvial aquifer. We injected heated water (ΔT=30K) during 6 hours with a rate of 3 m³/h. We stored this heat during 3 days, and then we pumped it back to estimate the energy balance. We collected ERT data sets using 9 parallel profiles of 21 electrodes and cross-lines measurements. Inversion results clearly show the ability of ERT to delimit the thermal plume growth during injection, the diffusion and decrease of temperature during storage, and the decrease in size after pumping. Quantitative interpretation of ERT in terms of temperature estimates is difficult at this stage due to strong spatial variations of the total dissolved solid content in the aquifer, due to historical chloride contamination of the site. However, we demonstrated that short-term heat storage in alluvial aquifer is efficient and that ERT combined with hydrological measurements is a valuable tool to image and estimate the temperature distribution in the subsurface. Moreover, energy balance shows that up to 75% of the energy can be easily recovered with an adapted strategy in the context of DSM.",

            "abstract": "The thermospheric wind response to a major geomagnetic storm event on March 17, 2013 has been studied using the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). The model results have also been compared with neutral wind measurements to investigate dynamic changes of winds during the storm and their recover after the storm. The model shows that the storm-time winds are greatly enhanced and become mostly westward at middle and low latitudes. There is a significant UT dependence and north-south asymmetry in the wind response to the storm although the storm occurred near March equinox. The TIEGCM also shows that the recover of neutral winds after the storm depends on local time and location. Daytime winds at middle and low latitudes recover faster than at other times and locations. The recover of winds takes about 12-18 hours, which is relatively faster than the recover of thermospheric temperature and composition and ionospheric electron densities that lasts for more than a day. The physical processes that drive the storm-time changes in winds and determine the recover have also been studied.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to study the effect of Earth directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the ionosphere in 2011, and to see if sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) monitors could be used to predict whether a CME was geoeffective. A CME is a cloud of highly energized particles ejected from the Sun. It is hypothesized that a strong CME will affect the ionosphere, and this might be observed in certain data sets. Data was taken from two SID monitors in Vienna receiving transmissions from Norway and France from February through July, 2011. This data was then analyzed relative to the kinetic energy of Earth directed CMEs that occurred during the same time period. The Earth directed CME data was taken from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) device on NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). A correlation was found between CME kinetic energy and SID energy, with the maximum correlation at a 6 day lag of the SID data. The 6 day delay accounts for the travel time for the CME to reach Earth. Though the impact of the CME on the ionosphere was observed retrospectively, the research indicates that CMEs may be identified using SID monitors alone.",

            "abstract": "“Big Data” are becoming increasingly common in many fields. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will collect data over the 30 years, using consistent, standardized methods across the United States. These freely available new data provide an opportunity for increased understanding of continental- and global scale processes such as changes in vegetation structure and condition, biodiversity and landuse. However, while “big data” are becoming more accessible and available, working with big data is challenging. New and potentially unfamiliar data types and associated processing methods, required to work with a growing diversity of available data take time and resources to learn. Analysis of these big datasets may further present a challenge given large file sizes, and uncertainty regarding best methods to properly statistically summarize and analyze results. Finally, resources that support learning these concepts and approaches, are distributed widely across multiple online spaces and may take time to find.\nThis presentation will overview the development of NEON’s collaborative University-focused online education portal. It will also cover content testing, community feedback and results from workshops using online content. Portal content is hosted in github to facilitate community input, accessibility version control. Content includes 1) videos and supporting graphics that explain key concepts related to NEON and related big spatio-temporal and 2) data tutorials that include subsets of spatio-temporal data that can be used to learn key big data skills in a self-paced approach, or that can be used as a teaching tool in the classroom or in a workshop. All resources utilize free and open data processing, visualization and analysis tools, techniques and scripts.

            "abstract": "Improving the ability of global climate models to properly represent high cirrus clouds is instrumental to furthering our ability to predict future climate. The extensive geographic coverage associated with high cirrus causes these clouds to have a strong impact on Earth’s radiation budget and the distribution of atmospheric water vapor. The influence on the radiation budget is greatest in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). Here we present work using two separate observational platforms to assess the treatment of high cirrus clouds in the NSF/DOE Community Earth System Model’s atmospheric model, CAM5. In this work CAM5 is coupled with a sectional microphysics model, CARMA. The CFMIP Observations Suite Package (COSP) utilized in our study mimics satellite retrieval algorithms and returns cloud products from the model that can be directly compared to satellite retrievals. The two observational data sets used in this comparison are a set of in situ observations from the ATTREX 3 field mission that took place over the Western Pacific in early 2014 and the long running CALIPSO observations. Based on these comparisons between simulations and data we have made a number of model adjustments to better represent water vapor and thin cirrus clouds near the tropopause. The results of those improvements are presented here.",

            "abstract": "Natural colloids, often defined as entities with sizes < 1.0 μm, have attracted much research attention because of their ability to facilitate the transport of contaminants in the subsurface environment. However, due to their small size and generally low concentrations in field samples, quantification of mobile colloids, especially the smaller fractions (< 0.45 µm), which are operationally defined as dissolved, is largely impeded and hence the natural colloidal pool is greatly overlooked and underestimated. The main objectives of this study are to: (1) develop an experimentally and economically efficient methodology to quantify natural colloids in different size fractions (0.1-0.45 and 0.45-1 µm); (2) quantify mobile colloids including small colloids, < 0.45 µm particularly, in different natural aquatic samples. We measured and generated correlations between mass concentration and turbidity of colloid suspensions, made by extracting and fractionating water dispersible colloids in 37 soils from different areas in the U.S. and Denmark, for colloid size fractions 0.1-0.45 and 0.45-1 µm. Results show that the correlation between turbidity and colloid mass concentration is largely affected by colloid size and iron content, indicating the need to generate different correlations for colloids with constrained size range and iron content. This method enabled quick quantification of colloid concentrations in a large number of field samples collected from freshwater, wetland and estuaries in different size fractions. As a general trend, we observed high concentrations of colloids in the < 0.45 µm fraction, which constitutes a significant percentage of the total mobile colloidal pool (< 1 µm). This observation suggests that the operationally defined cut-off size for “dissolved” phase can greatly underestimate colloid concentration therefore the role that colloids play in the transport of associated contaminants or other elements.",

            "abstract": "Reducing nutrient pollution of surface and coastal waters in the U.S. and elsewhere remains a major environmental and engineering challenge for the 21st century. In the case of the Chesapeake Bay restoration, we still lack scientific proof that previous watershed-based management actions have been effective at reducing nonpoint-source nutrient loads from the land to this estuary in accordance with restoration goals. While the conventional wisdom is that implementation of best management practices (BMP’s) has turned the against nutrient pollution, we examined long-term (1986-present) nitrate-N trends in streams and major tributaries of the Upper Potomac River Basin (UPRB) and found that: 1) dramatic reductions in annual discharge-weighted nitrate-N concentrations and yields across the UPRB can be almost universally attributed to reductions in atmospheric N deposition as opposed to on-the-ground management actions such as implementation of BMP’s; 2) observed water quality changes comport with a modified kinetic N saturation model (MKNSM); 3) the MKNSM can separate the nitrate-N yield that is responsive to atmospheric deposition from a “legacy” yield; and 4) N saturation from atmospheric N deposition appears to be an inherently reversible process across most of the landscape. These unanticipated region-wide water quality benefits can be attributed to NOx emission controls brought about by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (and subsequent U.S. NOX control programs) and reflect one of a very few water quality “success stories” in the Chesapeake Bay restoration; the results have important ramifications for the 2017 “mid-point assessment” that is part of the latest Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement.",

            "abstract": "Global mean sea level rise was largely linear over the 20th century; however, according to global satellite altimetry, the rate of rise has increased from approximately 1.6 to 3.4 mm/year. It is clear that this eustatic sea level rise has been predominantly caused by thermal expansion of ocean water (i.e., it is a manifestation of an increase in the average annual global temperature). Future projections of increased global temperatures, among others, introduce additional contributions (e.g., land ice loss and changes in land water storage) resulting in higher sea level rise that can only be accommodated by accelerations in the rate of the rise. Increased temperatures lead to changes in evapotranspiration rates, precipitation rates and patterns, etc. As the sea level changes the Earth experiences many other directly or indirectly related processes (e.g., population growth and migration, local variation in subsidence, etc.). Proper assessment of the local, regional and global impacts of relative sea level rise should include as many of these linear and nonlinear processes as possible. This presentation will explain our approach to understanding the relationships between these processes and their impacts to better equip adaptation strategies and enhance coastal resiliency.\n",

Traditionally, the AMS inlet samples directly from the air, but, nebulization of aqueous samples can also be used to produce aerosols for analysis with the AMS. Typical nebulizers require tens to hundreds of milliliters of solution, limiting this technique to large samples. Here, we demonstrate a micro-nebulizer that requires only small volumes (tens of microliters) of sample for chemical analysis with an AMS. With this technique, ultra-sonic vibrations are passed through a water reservoir. Samples loaded onto a thin film stretched over this reservoir are nebulized and transferred to the AMS with a carrier flow of clean air. We characterize this technique by exploring the elemental ratios, aerosol component ratios, and mass spectra for standards and filters. We also compare AMS data collected using standard on-line techniques with our offline analysis, demonstrating the applicability to filter samples collected from field sites and chamber studies. This technique is especially promising for the analysis of small environmental samples, such as filters collected in remote locations and rainwater samples.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in Global Forest Carbon\n There are 11.3 E9 global hectares of biologically productive surface, of which approximately 4E9 are forested. The terrestrial biosphere reservoir contains carbon in organic compounds in vegetation living biomass (450 to 650 PgC, IPCC AR5 ). Houghton et al (2009) give 385 - 650 GtC, of which 70 ~90% is forest. Using 80%, that gives a range of 360 ~ 520 (IPCC) or 308 ~ 520 (Houghton) GtC in Earth's forests. The IPCC values give a forest carbon global density range of 90 ~ 130 tC/ha. Assuming that 360 and 520 GtC are two independent samples from our uncertainty on the global forest carbon pool, we may ballpark this uncertainty as\nSTD(global forest carbon pool) ~ [½(160)2 [GtC]2]½= 113 E9 [tC].\nIf Xi,…XN have average variance s2 and average covariance c then VAR(SXi) = s2N + N(N-1)c, and:\n1) 28.3 = s(2.5E-10 + r)½.\nwhere s is the root of the average variance of forest carbon in [t/ha], and r = c/s2 is the \"global correlation\".  r is equal to the average correlation over all pairs of hectares if the variances per hectare are constant, but r £ 1 holds in any case.\nUncertainty accounting.\nIf r = 0, then (1) entails that s = 1.8 E6 tC, which is not defensible. Suppose an uncertainty requirement for carbon monitoring systems stipulates that the standard deviation per hectare should not exceed 10% of the mean. With a mean of 110 tC/ha, s = 11, and substitution in (1) would give r½ = 2.6, which is impossible. If r = 1, then s = 28.3 which is 26% of the mean. In this case it can be shown that the error in the estimate in any hectare is perfectly correlated with errors in every other hectare: removing the uncertainty in ONE hectare on the Earth would remove uncertainty in ALL hectares. Neither r = 0, r = 1 are reasonable. Uncertainty accounting requires consistent estimates of global forest carbon uncertainty, uncertainty in hectare-wise estimates and global correlation. Consistent estimates do not exist at present. This research charts a course.\n",

            "abstract": "We developed an experimental realtime subseasonal excessive heat outlook and monitoring system (SEHOMS) based on the detection of heat events in dynamical forecasts and reanalyses. Our definition of a heat event takes into account both the challenges of subseasonal forecasting and the effects of heat stress on human physiology e.g., the dependence of heat impacts on duration, geographical location and timing of the heat event. The prototype outlook system focuses on forecast lead time week-2 and uses the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) reforecast conducted at ESRL and the NCEP-GEFS operational realtime ensemble forecasts. The prototype monitoring system, on which we base forecast verification, provides a dual output. The first product uses the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis; the second monitoring product is based on the day-1 forecast from the GEFS reforecast and from the operational GEFS realtime forecast. In this presentation we first show results from the prototype forecasting and monitoring system. We then compare these results with forecasts from the SEHOMS in which we gradually add reforecasts obtained from the S2S database (NCEP – Climate forecast System and ECMWF models). Finally we discuss the possibility of expanding the SEHOMS to week-3 and week-4 based on results from the CFS, ECMWF model, and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble system (NMME).",

            "abstract": "Debris flows generate seismic waves as they travel downslope and can grow in size and destructive potential by entraining sediment along their paths. Recent observations from the Chalk Cliffs monitoring site in central Colorado show there is a systematic relation between the magnitude of seismic waves and both (1) the amount of erodible sediment beneath the flow, and (2) the density of the flow. Specifically, we observed that the spectral power of debris-flow induced ground motion increased by two orders of magnitude after a 34-cm layer of bed sediment was eroded from a bedrock channel. We also observed that high-density (sediment-rich) debris-flow surges generate about two orders of magnitude greater spectral power than low-density (water-rich) surges of similar thickness. These observations lead us to the hypothesis that the recorded ground motions are generated primarily by the impacts of grains on bedrock sections of the channel. This hypothesis is supported by ball drop tests which showed that impacts on deformable loose bed sediment in the channel (if present) generate negligibly small surface waves compared to impacts on bedrock. We thus expect debris-flow induced ground motion to increase as sediment entrainment exposes bedrock in channel, and as the flow density (and number of grains) increase. We explored the connection between ground motions and debris-flow entrainment/density by adapting a model from fluvial seismology [Tsai et al., GRL, 2012]. We used the adapted model to estimate rates of sediment entrainment and the density of flows over bare bedrock channels. Our estimates of sediment entrainment compared favorably with previous direct measurements of entrainment rates at the site. Estimates of flow density are sufficiently accurate to distinguish between three density levels: low (<1200 kg/m3), medium (1200-1600 kg/m3), and high (<1600 kg/m3). Although more testing is needed, these initial results suggest the approach may be a new indirect way to obtain rare field constraints of debris-flow entrainment rate and flow density.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation plays a key role in barrier islands dynamics by moderating the effects of storms and sea level through sand stabilization and trapping. Vegetation establishment and growth are qualitatively known to depend on environmental factors that vary with elevation and distance from the shoreline, but we lack an adequate characterization of the spatial distribution of barrier island vegetation in relation to topographic determinants. In this study, we develop and apply remote sensing techniques to extend local field observations to larger scales and explore the relations between vegetation density and topography. We use hyperspectral and Lidar data from Hog Island (VA) to address the following questions: 1) Can we map dune vegetation species and density distributions using hyperspectral remote sensing? 2) Can we use LiDAR data to estimate canopy properties (Leaf Area Index, LAI)?, and 3) What are the relations between vegetation presence and topographic properties as they result from two-way ecogeomorphic interactions? Our results show that whereas mapping dune vegetation species using hyperspectral remote sensing is challenging, optical and LiDAR data can be successfully used to characterize overall vegetation density. A comparison between LAI and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), both estimated from remote sensing data, shows a coherent relationship and the spatial distributions of estimated LAI and NDVI agree with the fractional vegetation cover observed in the field. The results also suggest that cover density increases with distance from the shoreline. In the foredune area, vegetation is more sparse than other areas while it is densest on the back side of dunes. Analysis of NDVI and LAI from remote sensing observations can thus provide characterizations of topography and vegetation properties at the island scale, which will assist in shedding light on the interactions between vegetation and sediment dynamics that give rise to coastal dune systems.",

            "abstract": "Accuracy of spatial gradients derived from wave field data recorded on a “geodetic” seismic array depends on the spatial distribution of array elements, signal-to-ambient-noise ratio, site amplitude statics, and instrument calibration. Application of the wave gradients in wave gradiometry additionally requires an accurate estimate of the wave field at the test location that is, in turn, subject to the same sources of noise, compounding inaccuracy in estimates of wave apparent velocity, amplitude changes, and direction. The spatial distribution of array elements can be controlled for a particular array design to yield potentially accurate spatial gradients. However, dense, large N arrays naturally alleviate problems with site statics, instrument calibration, and incoherent noise when the inverse problem is posed such that wave gradients and the wave field at the test location become the unknowns; both the wave gradients and test wave field become averages of the data over the array, reducing the effect of noise. A Taylor’s series expansion of the wave field around any test point within the array becomes possible, even at those places that do not contain an array element. The resulting wave gradiometry parameters improve proportional to the number of array elements used. This method is used to examine the wave field using data from a 180 m x 300 m dense array associated with a 3D controlled source seismic experiment in southeastern Ohio demonstrating the complexity of the wavefield due to scattering in near-surface structure. The method is also used to analyze teleseismic P waves from the Long Beach, California, NodalSeismic array.",

            "abstract": "During the last few decades earthquakes as sources of strong perturbations in the ionosphere have been reported by many researchers, and in the last few years the seismo-ionosphere coupling has been more and more discussed (e.g., Calais and Minster, 1998, Phys. Earth Planet. Inter., 105, 167–181; Afraimovich et al., 2010, Earth, Planets, Space, V.62, No.11, 899-904; Rolland et al., 2011, Earth Planets Space, 63, 853–857). Co-volcanic ionospheric perturbations have come under the scrutiny of science only in recent years but observations have already shown that mass and energy injections of volcanic activities can also excite oscillations in the ionosphere (Heki, 2006, Geophys. Res. Lett., 33, L14303; Dautermann et al., 2009, Geophys. Res., 114, B02202).\nThe ionospheric perturbations are induced by acoustic and gravity waves generated in the neutral atmosphere by seismic source or volcano eruption. The upward propagating vibrations of the atmosphere interact with the plasma in the ionosphere by the particle collisions and excite variations of electron density detectable with dual-frequency receivers of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In addition to co-seismic ionospheric disturbances (CID) observations, ionospheric GNSS measurements have recently proved to be useful to obtain ionospheric images for the seismic fault allowing to provide information on its’ parameters and localization (Astafyeva et al., 2011, Geophys. Res. Letters, 38, L22104).\nThis work describes how the GNSS signals can be used for monitoring of natural hazards on examples of the 9 March 2011 M7.3 Tohoku Foreshock and April 2015 M7.8 Nepal earthquake as well as the April 2015 Calbuco volcano eruptions. We also show that use of high-resolution GNSS data can aid to plot the ionospheric images of seismic fault.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change induces rapid large scale changes in the far Northern regions of the globe, which include the thickening of the active layer of arctic and subarctic soils. Active layer depth, in turn, drives many changes to the hydrology and geochemistry of the soil, making an understanding of this layer essential to boreal forest and arctic tundra ecology. Because the structure of plant communities can affect the thermal attributes of the soil, they may drive variations in active layer depth. For instance, trees and tussocks create shade, which reduces temperatures, but also hold snow, which increases temperature through insulation; these aspects of vegetation can increase or decrease summer thaw. The goal of this project is to investigate correlations between the degree of heterogeneity of active layer depths, organic layer thickness, and aboveground vegetation to determine how these facets of Northern ecosystems interact at the ecosystem scale. Permafrost thaw and organic layer depths were measured along 20m transects in twenty-four boreal forest and tundra sites in Alaska. Aboveground vegetation along these transects was characterized by measuring tree diameter at breast height (DBH), tussock dimensions, and understory biomass. Using the coefficient of variation as a measure of heterogeneity, we found a positive correlation between thaw depth variability and tussock volume variability, but little correlation between the former and tree DBH variability. Soil organic layer depth variability was also positively correlated with thaw depth variability, but weakly correlated with tree and tussock heterogeneity. These data suggest that low vegetation and organic layer control the degree of variability in permafrost thaw at the ecosystem scale. Vegetation can thus affect the microtopography of permafrost and future changes in the plant community that affect vegetation heterogeneity will drive corresponding changes in the variability of the soil.",

Its primary goal is to act as an airborne simulator of the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument aboard the yet to be launched ICESat-2 satellite. It is, therefore, imperative that MABEL is flown throughout the year to better understand how ATLAS will perform on different seasonal surface types. In 2014 were we able, for the first time, to obtain summer sea-ice data over the Beaufort Sea, using the MABEL instrument. This is of great importance to the testing and development of surface classification algorithms for ICESat-2, as summer sea-ice is characterized by far more surface type variability than during the rest of the year. This added complexity must be accounted for in the summer surface classification algorithms. Here, we will describe how surface classification parameters are obtained for the summer campaign and how they differ from the previous spring campaign. We will address the ability of MABEL to resolve small-scale surface characteristic changes, with particular emphasis on the detection of leads and melt ponds, which are very important in freeboard and sea-ice extent estimates. Mission success permitting, we will also present sea-ice classification results from the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar (SIMPL), which is currently (August, 2015) being flown over Greenland and the Arctic.",

Inside thunderstorms, RREA are thought to be involved in the creation of extraordinarily bright bursts of gamma rays, called Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), and long duration production of gamma rays (called gamma-ray glows or thunderstorm ground enhancements (TGEs)). However, Chilingarian has proposed that some electric fields inside thunderstorms may not be strong enough or have large enough spatial extent to result in significant avalanche multiplication by RREA to make a glow. High-energy electrons and gamma rays would still be present by a modification of the spectra (MOS) of cosmic-ray air showers. MOS and RREA glows have both been detected many times from the ground but distinguishing between the two is difficult since differing count rates can be the result of either these two distinct production models or attenuation due to various source distances. We will present GEANT4 models showing how these spectra differ as a function of source distance as well as discuss the differences in their gamma ray/electron signature in ground-based, gamma-ray detectors. These models will be compared to measurements made with instruments already in place in Mexico and Japan.",

            "abstract": "Climate literacy certainly requires a basic understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change, and this has motivated our community to focus on ever better ways to communicate this knowledge. This has been very worthwhile. But continuing to dwell on refuting climate myths that seem impossible to put to rest has often kept us mired in the framing of those who reject the science and seek to stall action. Moving past misconceptions and barriers may require added emphasis on responses to climate change. Research focused on the American public has revealed a broader acceptance of the reality of climate change than many people think. In particular, there is broad support for solutions, such as clean energy, even among those who say they do not accept that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. This presents an opportunity to open a side door to understanding that avoids unproductive confrontation with ideological barriers. Research is also revealing effective models for behavioral change that tap into social norms. Leapfrogging basic science arguments and going straight to solutions that most agree on can help us clear some of the barriers to understanding and the hurdles to action.",

            "abstract": "Rather than deriving from a single distribution and uniform persistence structure, hydroclimatic data exhibit significant trends and shifts in their mean, variance, and lagged correlation through time. Consequentially, observed and reconstructed streamflow records are often characterized by features of interannual variability, including long-term persistence and prolonged droughts. This study examines the effect of these features on the operating performance of water supply reservoirs. We develop a Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) model that can incorporate a regime-shifting climate variable. We then compare the performance of operating policies—designed with and without climate variable—to quantify the contribution of interannual variability to standard policy sub-optimality. The approach uses a discrete-time Markov chain to partition the reservoir inflow time series into small number of ‘hidden’ climate states. Each state defines a distinct set of inflow transition probability matrices, which are used by the SDP model to condition the release decisions on the reservoir storage, current-period inflow and hidden climate state. The experimental analysis is carried out on 99 hypothetical water supply reservoirs fed from pristine catchments in Australia—all impacted by the Millennium drought. Results show that interannual hydroclimatic variability is a major cause of sub-optimal hedging decisions. The practical import is that conventional optimization methods may misguide operators, particularly in regions susceptible to multi-year droughts.",

            "abstract": "Deployment of environmental sensors assemblies based on cheap platforms such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino have gained much attention over the past few years. While they are more attractive due to their ability to be controlled with a few programming language choices, the configuration task can become quite complex due to the need of having to learn several different proprietary data formats and protocols which constitute a bottleneck for the expansion of sensor network. In response to this rising complexity the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has sponsored the development of the IEEE 1451 standard in an attempt to introduce a common standard. The most innovative concept of the standard is the Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) which enables transducers to self-identify, self-describe, self-calibrate, to exhibit plug-and-play functionality, etc.\nWe used Python to develop an IEEE 1451.0 platform-independent graphical user interface to generate and provide sufficient information about almost ANY sensor and sensor platforms for sensor programming purposes, automatic calibration of sensors data, incorporation of back-end demands on data management in TEDS for automatic standard-based data storage, search and discovery purposes. These features are paramount to make data management much less onerous in large scale sensor network. Along with the TEDS Creator, we developed a tool namely HydroUnits for three specific purposes: encoding of physical units in the TEDS, dimensional analysis, and on-the-fly conversion of time series allowing users to retrieve data in a desired equivalent unit while accommodating unforeseen and user-defined units. In addition, our back-end data management comprises the Python/Django equivalent of the CUAHSI Observations Data Model (ODM) namely DjangODM that will be hosted by a MongoDB Database Server which offers more convenience for our application. We are also developing a data which will be paired with the data autoloading capability of Django and a TEDS processing script to populate the database with the incoming data. The Python WaterOneFlow Web Services developed by the Texas Water Development Board will be used to publish the data. The software suite is being tested on the Raspberry Pi as end node and a laptop PC as the base station in a wireless setting.",

            "abstract": "The Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) is a joint effort between USGS and the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). OFDA leads and coordinates disaster responses overseas for the U.S. government and is a unique stakeholder concerned with volcano disaster risk reduction as an international humanitarian assistance donor. One year after the tragic eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in 1985, OFDA began funding USGS to implement VDAP. VDAP’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property and limit the economic impact from foreign volcano crises, thereby preventing such crises from becoming disasters. VDAP fulfills this mission and complements OFDA’s humanitarian assistance by providing crisis response, capacity-building, technical training, and hazard assessments to developing countries before, during, and after eruptions.\nDuring the past 30 years, VDAP has responded to more than 27 major volcanic crises, built capacity in 12+ countries, and helped counterparts save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars in property. VDAP responses have evolved as host-country capabilities have grown, but the pace of work has not diminished; as a result of VDAP’s work at 27 volcanoes in fiscal year 2014, more than 1.3 million people who could have been impacted by volcanic activity benefitted from VDAP assistance, 11 geological policies were modified, 188 scientists were trained, and several successful eruption forecasts were made.\nVDAP is developing new initiatives to help counterparts monitor volcanoes and communicate volcanic risk. These include developing the Eruption Forecasting Information System (EFIS) to learn from compiled crisis data from 30 years of VDAP responses, creating event trees to forecast eruptions at restless volcanoes, and exploring the use of unmanned aerial systems for monitoring. The use of these new methods, along with traditional VDAP assistance, has improved VDAP’s ability to assist counterparts with preparing for eruptions.",

The NASA GISS Research Scanning Polarimeter, a multi-angle, multi-spectral polarimeter measured the upwelling polarized radiances from a B200 aircraft over a period of several weeks and over a distance of several hundred kilometers. A new algorithm based on optimal estimation that can retrieve aerosol microphysical properties using highly accurate radiative transfer and Mie calculations is presented. First, results for synthetic simulated data are discussed. The algorithm is then applied to real data collected during TCAP to retrieve the aerosol microphysical state vector and corresponding uncertainty for the aerosols that were encountered. Simultaneous measurements were also made by the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL2), which provided extinction and backscatter profiles. The RSP-retrieved microphysical properties are compared to the extinction and backscatter products, and to the HSRL2-retrieved microphysical products.",

            "abstract": "The glaciated coastal St. Elias Range in Alaska is a primary site to examine climate-tectonic interactions. Work has primarily focused on the Bering-Bagley and Malaspina-Seward ice fields, utilizing detrital and bedrock zircon and apatite geochronology to examine local exhumation and glacial erosion (Berger et al., 2008; Enkelmann et al., 2009; Headly et al., 2013). These studies argue for specific regions of tectonically focused or climatically widespread glacial erosion. Analyzed zircon and apatite grains are sand size, however glacial erosion favors the production of finer-grained sediments. This study focuses on the geochemical provenance of the silt-size fraction (15-63μm) of surface sediments collected throughout the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) seaward of the Bering and Malaspina glaciers to test if the exhumation patterns observed in zircon and apatites are also applicable for the silt size fraction. Onshore bedrock Al-normalized elemental data were used to delineate sediment sources, and a subset of provenance-applicable elements was chosen. Detrital thermochronologic data suggest that sediment produced by the Bagley/Bering system is derived from bedrock on the windward side with input from the Chugach Metamorphic Complex (CMC) underlying the Bagley only during glacial surge events (Headly et al., 2013). Geochemical observations of GOA silt deposited during the 1994-95 surge event confirm input of CMC sediment (elevated in Cr, Ni, Sc, Sr, depleted in Hf, Pb and Rb relative to Kultieth and Poul Creek formations). We also observe a windward-side sediment source (Kultieth and Poul Creek). It is hypothesized that the sediment carried by the Malaspina is primarily from CMC rock underlying the Seward ice field mixed with Yakataga formation rock that underlies the Seward throat (Headly et al., 2013). Geochemical observations of GOA silt support this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The amount of dust transported by dust devils (DDs) is subject to large uncertainties because the dust emission mechanisms in DDs are not yet well understood. Reducing this uncertainty is essential to estimate the contribution of DDs to the global dust budget and to study their impact on climate and the environment. Here, large-eddy simulation coupled with a dust emission scheme is used to investigate DD dust entrainment. DDs are identified from the simulations using various threshold values for pressure drop and vorticity in the DD center. The results show that DD dust lifting can be largely explained by convective turbulent dust emission. DD dust entrainment varies strongly between individual DDs even for similar atmospheric conditions, but the maximum emissions are determined by atmospheric stability. By relating DD emission and counts to Richardson number, we propose a new and simple method to estimate regional and global DD dust transport. The method is applied to results of regional model simulations for Australia, thus providing an estimate of the contribution of DDs to the Australian dust budget.",

            "abstract": "Gridded uncertainty maps of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emissions are a new data product that is currently in the process of being completed and published. This work is based on the relatively new assessment of the uncertainty associated with the mass of FFCO2 emissions (2014, Tellus B, 66, 23616, doi:10.3402/tellusb.v66.23616). The new data product was created to be paired with the long-used, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), emission year 1751-present, one degree latitude by one degree longitude (1x1) mass of emissions data product (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp058/ndp058_v2013.html). Now, data users will have FFCO2 emission information that represents both mass and uncertainty, each of which varies in both time and space.\nThe new data product was constructed by examining the individual uncertainties in each of the input data sets to the gridded mass maps and then combining these individual uncertainties into an overall uncertainty for the mass maps. The input data sets include a table of the mass of FFCO2 emissions by country and year, the one degree geographic map of emissions which includes changing borders on an annual time scale and ties the mass of emissions to location, and the one degree population proxy used to distribute the mass of emissions within each country. As the three input data sets are independent of each other, their combination for the overall uncertainty is accomplished by a simple square root of the sum of the squares procedure.\nThe resulting uncertainty data product is gridded at 1x1 and exactly overlays the 1x1 mass emission maps. The default temporal resolution is annual, but a companion product is also available at monthly time scales. The monthly uncertainty product uses the same input data sets, but the mass uncertainty is scaled as described in the monthly mass product description paper (2011, Tellus B, 63:309-327, doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00530.x). The gridded uncertainty maps cover emission year 1950 to 2012. The start year is determined by the mass uncertainty study which began its analysis in 1950. The end year reflects the latest emission year in the current CDIAC data set; as new years are added to the CDIAC data set, the uncertainty map time series can also be extended.",

            "abstract": "Climatic changes have resulted in increasing air temperatures across the Arctic. This may increase anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter to methane (CH4) in wetlands and increase plant growth and thereby production of substrate. Little is known about how seasonal variations in dissolved CH4 in soil water, substrate availability, and the effect of warming affect arctic wetland dynamics of CH4 production and emission.\nIn 2013 we established two experiments in a fen at Disko Island, W Greenland; one with year round warming by open-top chambers and removal of shrubs, and one with removal of the aerenchymatous sedge Carex aquatilis ssp. stans. Throughout the growing season 2014 we measured how the treatments affected CH4 emissions, dissolved CH4 in the soil water, and substrate availability.\nEcosystem CH4 emissions peaked at August 5th 2014 (7.5 μmol m-2 h-1) without coinciding with time of highest concentrations of dissolved CH4 or acetate indicating a decoupling between production and emission of CH4. The peak in dissolved CH4 concentration, at ten cm depth (1368 ppm, September 18th 2014), followed the peak in concentration of acetate in the same depth (0.30 ppm, August 30th 2014) highlighting the importance of this substance as a substrate for methanogenesis.\nC. aquatilis ssp. stans accounted for 60% and 77% of the ecosystem CH4 emissions in areas of the fen with water table above and below soil surface showing the importance of the presence of this species to serve as a pipe for CH4 emission which is bypassing the upper soil zone and potential methane oxidation.\nThroughout the season, warming increased the air temperature at soil surface by on average 0.89°C and occasionally warming and shrub removal increased soil temperature in 2 and 5 cm depth, but there was no effect of the treatments on the CH4 emissions indicating that this wetland is quite resilient towards future climate change.",

            "abstract": "In recent years the technique of cross-correlating the ambient seismic noise wavefield at two seismometers to reconstruct empirical Green’s Functions for the determination of Earth structure has been a powerful tool to study the Earth’s interior without earthquake or man-made sources. However, far less attention has been paid to using auto-correlations of seismic noise to reveal body wave reflections from interfaces in the subsurface. In principle, the Green's functions thus derived should be comparable to the Earth’s impulse response to a co-located source and receiver. We use data from a dense seismic array (Dense Array for Northern Anatolia - DANA) deployed across the northern branch of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in the region of the 1999 magnitude 7.6 Izmit earthquake in western Turkey. The NAFZ is a major strike-slip system that extends ~1200 km across northern Turkey and continues to pose a high level of seismic hazard, in particular to the mega-city of Istanbul. We construct reflection images for the entire crust and upper mantle over the ~35 km by 70 km footprint of the 70-station DANA array. Using auto-correlations of vertical and horizontal components of ground motion, both P- and S-wave velocity information can be retrieved from the wavefield to constrain crustal structure further to established methods. We show that clear P-wave reflections from the crust-mantle boundary (Moho) can be retrieved using the autocorrelation technique, indicating topography on the Moho on horizontal scales of less than 10 km. Offsets in crustal structure can be identified that seem to be correlated with the surface expression of the fault zone in the region. The combined analysis of auto-correlations using vertical and horizontal components will lead to further insight into the fault zone structure throughout the crust and upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "This study contributes a diagnostic assessment of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) search on a set of water resources problem formulations with different configurations of constraints. Unlike constraints in classical optimization modeling, constraints within MOEA simulation-optimization represent limits on acceptable performance that delineate whether solutions within the search problem are feasible. Constraints are relevant because of the emergent pressures on water resources systems: increasing public awareness of their sustainability, coupled with regulatory pressures on water management agencies. In this study, we test several state-of-the-art MOEAs that utilize restricted tournament selection for constraint handling on varying configurations of water resources planning problems. For example, a problem that has no constraints on performance levels will be compared with a problem with several severe constraints, and a problem with constraints that have less severe values on the constraint thresholds. One such problem, Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) portfolio planning, has been solved with a suite of constraints that ensure high reliability, low cost variability, and acceptable performance in a single year severe drought. But to date, it is unclear whether or not the constraints are negatively affecting MOEAs’ ability to solve the problem effectively. Two categories of results are explored. The first category uses control maps of algorithm performance to determine if the algorithm’s performance is sensitive to user-defined parameters. The second category uses run-time performance metrics to determine the time required for the algorithm to reach sufficient levels of convergence and diversity on the solution sets. Our work exploring the effect of constraints will better enable practitioners to define MOEA problem formulations for real-world systems, especially when stakeholders are concerned with achieving fixed levels of performance according to one or more metrics.",

            "abstract": "The Greenhouse gas Laser Imaging Tomography Experiment (GreenLITE) combines real-time differential Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) measurements with a lightweight web-based data acquisition and product generation system to provide autonomous 24/7 monitoring of CO2. The current GreenLITE system is comprised of two transceivers and a series of retro-reflectors that continuously measure the differential transmission over a user-defined set of intersecting line-of-site paths or “chords” that form the plane of interest. These observations are first combined with in situ surface measurements of temperature (T), pressure (P) and relative humidity (RH) to compute the integrated CO2 mixing ratios based on an iterative radiative transfer modeling approach. The retrieved CO2 mixing ratios are then grouped based on observation time and employed in a sparse sample reconstruction method to provide a tomographic- like representation of the 2-D distribution of CO2 over the field of interest. This reconstruction technique defines the field of interest as a set of idealized plumes whose integrated values best match the observations. The GreenLITE system has been deployed at two primary locations; 1) the Zero Emissions Research and Technology (ZERT) center in Bozeman, Montana, in Aug-Sept 2014, where more than 200 hours of data were collected over a wide range of environmental conditions while utilizing a controlled release of CO2 into a segmented underground pipe, and 2) continuously at a carbon sequestration test facility in Feb-Aug 2015. The system demonstrated the ability to identify persistent CO2 sources at the ZERT test facility and showed strong correlation with an independent measurement using a LI-COR based system. Here we describe the measurement approach, algorithm design and extended study results.",

We systematically analyzed seismic records from 2001 through 2014 to identify repeating earthquakes with highly correlated waveforms occurring along the subduction zone of the Cocos plate. Using the correlation coefficient (cc) and spectral coherency (coh) of the vertical components as selection criteria, we found a set of 214 sequences whose waveforms exceed cc≥95% and coh≥95%. Spatial clustering along the trench shows large variations in repeating earthquakes activity. Particularly, the rupture zone of the M8.1, 1985 earthquake shows an almost absence of characteristic repeating earthquakes, whereas the Guerrero Gap zone and the segment of the trench close to the Guerrero-Oaxaca border shows a significantly larger number of repeating earthquakes sequences. Furthermore, temporal variations associated to stress changes due to major shows episodes of unlocking and healing of the interface. Understanding the different components that control the location and recurrence time of characteristic repeating sequences is a key factor to pinpoint areas where large megathrust earthquakes may nucleate and consequently to improve the seismic hazard assessment.",

Pre-glacial drainage networks were substantially altered and landscapes left after retreat of the ice featured both deeply incised glacial meltwater channels and areas of internal drainage disconnected from regional base level. The evolution of these glacially-shaped landscapes toward integrated fluvial networks is evident from comparison of areas with different amounts of time since their most recent glaciation.

            "abstract": "Land surface models perform poorly for interannual variability in carbon and water fluxes, resulting in considerable uncertainty when estimating the land-carbon sink or making future projections. While many aggregated variables (e.g. growing season length, annual precipitation, growing season temperature, and phenology among others) have been suggested as predictors for the variability of annual sums in carbon fluxes, their explanatory power remains limited and uncertainties remain as to the relative contribution of each. Recent results suggest that the annual count of hours where evapotranspiration (ET) is larger than its 95th percentile (denoted as \"good hours\") is highly correlated with the annual variability of ET and gross primary production (GPP) in an ecosystem model (Fatichi and Ivanov, 2014). This suggests that the occurrence of favourable conditions driven by short-term weather fluctuations have a strong influence on the annual carbon budget.\nHere we analyse data from 8 forest sites of the AmeriFlux network, each having at least 8 years of continuous measurements. We show that for ET and all carbon fluxes (GPP, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange), counting “good hours/days” (i.e., hours/days when the flux exceeds a high percentile) correlates well with the respective annual sums (with correlations generally larger than 0.8). By exploiting this relationship and classifying hours/days as good or not good, interannual variability in ET and carbon fluxes can be predicted well by climate variables. We explore the implications of our results for understanding the dominant processes responsible for interannual variability in carbon and water fluxes.\n",

According to the Second Climate Change National Assessment, since the mid-1970s, the average temperature has been rising with rate of 0.43 ° C / 10 years, which is more than two times higher than the rate of global warming.\nIn the Altai region, the rate of temperature change is higher than the average for Russia with an annual surface air temperature increase equal to 1.8°C the 20th century. The maximum value of this increase the past 50 years (1963-2013) was found in the intermountain basins of Altai (+ 2.6°C) mainly due to the winter and spring warming with changes in the summer season being considerably smaller. This warming is accompanied with negative tendencies in annual precipitation over the entire Altai Krai. The mountain ranges of Altai are called the \"water tower\" of Northern Eurasia. The northward flow of numerous rivers streaming down from these ranges in the Basin of the Ob and the Irtysh Rivers is formed by melting of Altai glaciers and snowfields. Since the middle of the 19th century the largest glaciers in the Altai have retreated by 1.5-2 km and the thickness of their tails decreased by 50-70 m. The reduction of mountain glaciers poses a threat of depletion of water flow to major agricultural regions downstream affecting human activity and even the drinking water availability.\nPermafrost in the Altai Mountains is actively degraded (thawing), which represents a danger for infrastructure (first of all for roads and pipelines) and increases risk of catastrophic events (landslides, mudflows). Continued warming could contribute to a significant reduction of water resources, biodiversity and other negative processes in the region.\nThe reported study was partially supported by the Russian Foundation for Baseline Research (project No. 15-45-04450).",

            "abstract": "Methane plays a critical role in the radiation balance and chemistry of the atmosphere. Globally, landfill methane emission contributes about 10–19% of the anthropogenic methane burden into the atmosphere. In the United States, 18% of annual anthropogenic methane emissions come from landfills, which represent the third largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions, behind enteric fermentation and natural gas and oil production. One uncertainty in estimating landfill methane emissions is the fraction of methane oxidized when methane produced under anaerobic conditions passes through the cover soil. We developed a simple stoichiometric model to estimate methane oxidation fraction when the anaerobic CO2 / CH4 production ratio is known, or can be estimated. The model predicts a linear relationship between CO2 emission rates and CH4 emission rates, where the slope depends on anaerobic CO2 / CH4 production ratio and the fraction of methane oxidized, and the intercept depends on non-methane-dependent oxidation processes. The model was tested using carbon dioxide emission rates (fluxes) and methane emission rates (fluxes) measured using the eddy covariance method over a one year period at the Turkey Run landfill in Georgia, USA. The CO2 / CH4 production ratio was estimated by measuring CO2 and CH4 concentrations in air sampled under anaerobic conditions deep inside the landfill. We also used a mass balance approach to independently estimate fractional oxidation based on stable isotope measurements (δ13C of methane) of gas samples taken from deep inside the landfill and just above the landfill surface. Results from the two independent methods agree well. The model will be described and methane oxidation will be discussed in relation to wind direction, location at the landfill, and age of the deposited refuse.",

            "abstract": "The 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake caused $300 million in damage to private and commercial properties. Previous studies indicate areas underlain by deposits with low average shear-wave velocity to 30 m depth (Vs30) can experience extensive structural damage during earthquakes. Thus, Vs30 is considered a predictor of the influence of local geology on strong shaking from earthquakes. The goal of our study was to evaluate Vs30 at six accelerograph stations in the City and County of Napa and in the City of Vallejo. We used active seismic sources and 4.5-Hz sensors recorded on 120 channels to investigate the shallow velocity structure. Geophones and shots were spaced at 3 m along each profile, which ranged in length from 85 to 260 m. We used a 226-kg accelerated weight-drop and a seisgun to generate P and Rayleigh waves for P-wave tomography and MASW, and we used a 3.5-kg sledgehammer and block to generate S and Love waves for S-wave tomography and MALW. One of the six accelerographs was housed inside Napa Fire Station #3, where the local surface geology consists of late Pleistocene to Holocene alluvium and alluvial fan deposits. The average Vs30 determined from MASW (Rayleigh waves) is 312 m/s, and the average Vs30 from MALW (Love waves) is 340 m/s, with an average velocity difference of about 8% between the two methods. These average values are both slightly less than the average Vs30 of 375 m/s determined from S-wave tomography, which suggests the three methods are complimentary and can be useful in evaluating site response. The 0.42g median horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA) recorded at Napa Fire Station #3 indicates the area experienced strong shaking during the Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake, consistent with expectations for a site with relatively low average Vs30.",

Obtaining sufficient data to accurately represent soil and aquifer characteristics can require unique approaches that evolve with added site knowledge. At Riverton, the primary source of uranium mill tailings remaining from ore processing was removed but contaminant plumes have persisted longer than predicted by groundwater modeling. What are the primary mechanisms controlling plume persistence? DOE is conducting new characterization studies to assist our understanding of underlying biogeochemical and hydrogeological mechanisms affecting secondary sources.\nA variety of field sampling techniques are being sequentially employed including augering, trenching, pore water sampling, and installing multi-level wells. In August 2012, vadose zone soil samples from 34 locations and groundwater from 103 boreholes were collected with Geoprobe ® direct push rods. Lower than expected uranium concentrations in composited shallow soils indicated the need for more focused and deeper samples. In May 2014, soil samples containing evaporites were collected along the bank of the Little Wind River; elevated uranium concentrations in evaporite minerals correlated with plume configurations and reflect contaminated groundwater discharge at the river. In September 2014, hand anger samples collected by the river and oxbow lake also indicated the presence of organic rich zones containing elevated uranium (>50 mg/kg). Subsequent samples collected from five backhoe trenches in May 2015 revealed a highly heterogeneous vadose zone composed of clay, silt, sand and cobbles containing evaporites and organic rich zones which may interact with groundwater plumes.\nPlans for August 2015 include sonic drilling to obtain continuous cores from the surface down to the base of the surficial aquifer with multi-level monitoring wells constructed in each borehole to assess vertical variation in groundwater chemistry. Temporary well-points will be installed adjacent to the river to assess geochemical and flow controls in the area of plume stagnation. Analyses include critical element speciation (C, S, Fe, and U), microbes, isotopes, diffusivity and flow characteristics. These activities support a dramatically improved understanding of plume persistence.",

            "abstract": "One of the backbones of numerical weather prediction is the assimilation of all available observations into models to achieve initial conditions close to reality. The assimilation idea also revolutionized climate research with reanalysis becoming the most important dataset for the last century. Recently, paleo-climatologist began developing new methodologies with the intention to assimilate sparse and temporally averaged proxy information instead of satellite data and instrumental observations. Here, we present the first paleo-reanalysis covering the period 1600 to 2005. Early instrumental temperature and surface pressure observations, temperature indices derived from historical documents and temperature and moisture sensitive tree-ring proxies were assimilated into an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model using a Kalman-filtering technique. The resulting paleo-reanalysis combines the advantage of traditional reconstruction methods of being as close a possible to observations with the advantage of climate models of being physically consistent and having 3-dimensional information about the state of the atmosphere through time and for various variables. Moreover, it makes no stationarity assumptions, has temporally constant variability and offers error estimates. Using direct and indirect climate observation, climate forcings and models together, we will present the probably best supported northern hemisphere temperature evolution of the past 400 years, as well as spatial imprints of the 1790ies droughts and the 1815 Tambora eruption.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is a populated island with a majority of residents settled in the western plains where soils are suitable for rice cultivation. Rice is not only the most important commodity, but also plays a critical role for agricultural and food marketing. Information of rice production is thus important for policymakers to devise timely plans for ensuring sustainably socioeconomic development. Because rice fields in Taiwan are generally small and yet crop monitoring requires information of crop phenology associating with the spatiotemporal resolution of satellite data, this study used Landsat-MODIS fusion data for rice yield modeling in Taiwan. We processed the data for the first crop (Feb–Mar to Jun–Jul) and the second (Aug–Sep to Nov–Dec) in 2014 through five main steps: (1) data pre-processing to account for geometric and radiometric errors of Landsat data, (2) Landsat-MODIS data fusion using using the spatial-temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, (3) construction of the smooth time-series enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), (4) rice yield modeling using EVI2-based crop phenology metrics, and (5) error verification. The fusion results by a comparison bewteen EVI2 derived from the fusion image and that from the reference Landsat image indicated close agreement between the two datasets (R2 > 0.8). We analysed smooth EVI2 curves to extract phenology metrics or phenological variables for establishment of rice yield models. The results indicated that the established yield models significantly explained more than 70% variability in the data (p-value < 0.001). The comparison results between the estimated yields and the government’s yield statistics for the first and second crops indicated a close significant relationship between the two datasets (R2 > 0.8), in both cases. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) used to measure the model accuracy revealed the consistency between the estimated yields and the government’s yield statistics. This study demonstrates advantages of using EVI2-based phenology metrics (derived from Landsat-MODIS fusion data) for rice yield estimation in Taiwan prior to the harvest period.",

Most of the research published concerns inclined granular flows over bumpy and flat rigid base, while only few of them focus on fully developed steady flows over an erodible bed. This kind of flows are important to understand the dynamics of complex phenomena such as dense snow-avalanches and rock-avalanches, whose rheology is still ambiguous and not well defined.\nWe report on laboratory investigations regarding uniform flows of identical particles over a loose bed in a rectangular chute. Accurate measurements were carried out through imaging techniques based on the Voronoï diagrams to track each particle composing the flow. Additionally, direct methods were tested to assess the stresses exerted by the flow at the lateral walls.\nWe present detailed profiles of the mean velocity, solid concentration, and granular temperature for a large set of flow-rates and widths, for which the uniformity and steadiness of the flow are accurately checked. Vertical and transversal structures are highlighted, and the role of the boundary conditions on the uniformity of the flow is emphasized. Concerning the lateral confinement, an increasing role of the instantaneous collisions is observed by enlarging the channel at different flow-rates. Finally a new device intended to measure the shear stresses at the side-walls is discussed.",

In this initial effort, we combined VIIRS products with a recent algorithm (Lee et al., 2005) that can resolve vertical distribution of downwelling solar irradiance at two separate bands (EVIS: 400-700 nm and EIR: 700-2000 nm), and examined the heat transfer and its effects on the upper oceanic thermal structure in the operational RTOFS-Global. Our near-term future goals include: coupling of a global ocean biogeochemical model (Gregg, 2008) to the operational RTOFS-Global; and validation of free runs with VIIRS-derived ocean color products. This will eventually lead to the end-point goal, building data assimilative lower trophic ecosystem components in the context of “setting/updating baselines of daily marine ecosystem processes.” Assimilation of VIIRS data will provide a unique and timely opportunity to establish a path toward ecological forecasting through biogeochemical analyses and forecasts. This proposed effort fully aligns with NOAA’s ecological forecasting roadmap’s objectives to: establish the infrastructure capability for operational biogeochemical modeling; quantify forecast accuracy and utility; identify gaps; and prioritize improvements in ecological products and services.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the frictional slip behavior under more realistic condition, we conducted stick-slip experiments using large-scale biaxial friction apparatus at the NIED in Tsukuba, Japan. We used two rectangular metagabbro blocks as specimen, whose contacting area was 1.5 m long and 0.1 m wide. The experiments were repeatedly conducted with same pair of specimens, which means the fault surface evolved with the frictional slip. We successively conducted a set of three experiments under the condition of constant normal stress of 6.7 MPa and loading rate of 0.01 mm/s. All wear materials were collected after each experiment. To artificially accelerate fault evolution from one stage to the next, we applied fast loading with long slip displacement between a set of three experiments As a result, we obtained three sets of the experimental result in different evolutional stages I, II and III; one and two fast-loading processes mentioned above were performed before the experimental sets in Stage II and III, respectively. In all experiments, we observed many stick-slip events, the number of which tended to increase with the maturity of the fault. Local strain array also showed slow propagation of shear stress drop, which would be derived from slow slip, before the main rupture. We found that the time and location, in which slow slip started to propagate, depend on the stage of fault evolution. In Stage I, both the temporal and spatial distribution of the slow slip were mono-modal, whereas various occurrence times were observed in Stage II and III. The occurrence locations in Stage I and II look consistent with the initial local frictional strength, which was estimated from accumulation rate of the local shear stress divided by the local normal stress before the first slip event in each experiment; the slow slips started to propagate from the location where the initial frictional strength is local minimum. On the contrary, we cannot find such clear relationship in Stage III, though the occurrence locations are mostly limited in a central part of the fault. These results suggest that the fault surface evolution may increase complexity of the slow slip behavior.",

This large uncertainty is partially a result of our incomplete understanding of the ability of particles to form cloud droplets under atmospherically relevant supersaturations. One objective of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Green Ocean Amazon Project (GoAmazon2014/5) is to understand the influence of the emission from Manaus, a tropical megacity, on aerosol size, concentration, and chemical composition, and their impact on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectrum.\nThe GoAmazon2014/5 study was an international campaign with the collaboration efforts from US, Brazil and Germany. During the intensive operation period, in the dry season (Sep. 1st – Oct. 10th, 2014), aerosol concentration, size distributions, and CCN spectra, both under pristine conditions and inside the Manaus plume, were characterized in-situ from the DOE Gulfstream-1 (G-1) research aircraft and German HALO aircraft during 4 coordinated flights on Sep. 9th, Sep. 16th, Sep 21st and Oct. 1st, 2014. During those four flights, aerosol number concentrations and CCN concentrations at two supersaturations (0.25% and 0.5%) were measured by condensation particle counters (CPCs) and a DMT dual column CCN counter onboard both G-1 and HALO. Aerosol size distribution was also measured by a Fast Integrated Mobility Spectrometer (FIMS) aboard the G-1 and is compared with the size distribution from Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer – Airborne (UHSAS-A, DMT), which were deployed both on the G-1 and the HALO. Good agreement between the aerosol properties measured from the two aircraft has been achieved. The vertical profiles of aerosol size distribution and CCN spectrum will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Shale gas development by hydraulic fracturing is believed by many to have the potential to transform the world’s energy economy. The propensity of this technique to cause significant environmental impact is strongly contested and lacks evidence. Fugitive methane (CH4), potentially mobilized during well drilling, the complex extraction process and/or leaking well seals over time is arguably the greatest concern. Advanced understanding of CH4 mobility and fate in the subsurface is needed in order to assess risks, design suitable monitoring systems and gain public trust. Currently knowledge on subsurface CH4 mobilization and migration at scales relevant to shale gas development is lacking. Consequently a shallow aquifer controlled CH4 release experiment is being conducted at the Borden aquifer research facility (an unconfined, unconsolidated silicate sand aquifer) in Ontario, Canada. During the experiment, 100 m3 of gas phase CH4 was injected into the saturated zone over approximately 60 days through 2 inclined sparging wells (4.5 and 9 m depth) at rates relevant to natural gas well casing vent flows. The gas mobility and fate is being comprehensively monitored temporally and spatially in both the saturated and unsaturated zones considering; aqueous chemistry (including stable isotopes), soil gas characterization, surface efflux, geophysics (GPR and ERT), real time sensors (total dissolved gas pressure, soil moisture content, CH4 and CO2), mineralogical and microbiological characterization before, during and after injection. An overview of this unique study will be given including experimental design, monitoring system configuration and preliminary results. This multidisciplinary study will provide important insights regarding the mechanisms and rates for shallow CH4 migration, attenuation and water quality impacts that will inform baseline groundwater monitoring programs and retrospective forensic studies.",

The various point and nonpoint sources introduce an excess of nutrients into the river. This excess induces eutrophication that results in an inhabitable environment for aquatic life and is expected to be exacerbated due to climate change. Adaptive measures must be evaluated based on predictions of climate variation impacts on eutrophication and ecosystem processes in the Jordan River. A Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) model was created to analyze the data results acquired from a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study conducted on the Jordan River. Eutrophication is modeled based on levels of phosphates and nitrates from point and nonpoint sources, temperature, and solar radiation. It will simulate the growth of phytoplankton and periphyton in the river. This model will be applied to assess how water quality in the Jordan River is affected by variations in timing and intensity of spring snowmelt and runoff during drought in the valley and the resulting effects on eutrophication in the river.",

One area of attention is salinity in the river, which influences the entire food web, including sea and marsh grasses, juvenile crustaceans and fishes, wading birds and migratory waterfowl, marine mammals and other predator animals. It is expected that elevated ocean levels will increase the salinity of the estuarine waters, leading to deleterious effects on dependent species of the river biology. The objective of the modeling and analysis was: 1) to establish baseline conditions of salinity for the lower St. Johns River; and 2) to examine future conditions of salinity, as impacted by sea-level rise. Establishing baseline conditions entailed validation of the model for present-day salinity in the lower St. Johns River via comparison to available data. Examining future conditions entailed application of the model for sea-level rise scenarios, with comparison to the baseline conditions, for evaluation of sea-level rise impacts on salinity. While the central focus was on the physics of sea-level rise impacts on salinity, some level of salinity-biological assessment was conducted to identify sea-level rise/salinity thresholds, as related to negatively impacting different species of the river biology.",

            "abstract": "The rupture process of experimental faults is investigated here by monitoring nano-seismic events (NSE) during slip in a rotary shear apparatus. Our experimental faults are made of two rock blocks with one to four miniature 3D accelerometers that are glued to the stationary block at distance of ~ 2 cm from the fault surface. Accelerations in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 200 kHz are recorded in slip-parallel (x), slip-transverse (y), and slip-vertical (z) directions. We conducted a series of 45 experiments on diorite and dolomite samples in two loading styles: classical velocity controlled loading, and power-density loading, in which the power-density (shear stress times slip velocity) is selected, and stick-slip events develop spontaneously according to the experimental fault response. The 3D accelerometer data were recorded at 106 samples/s, with acceleration resolution of 10 mV/g in recoding range of +/- 5 V.\nThe experiments were conducted at slip-velocity of 0.001-0.8 m/s and slip distance up to 1.38 m. The accelerometer observations revealed tens to hundreds of NSEs per slip in both loading styles; peak acceleration ranged from 1g to over 500g. A typical stick-slip with tens of NSEs in Fig. 1, shows: (1) An initial NSE at ~59.72 s (green) that coincides with a small stress drop (~10%, red); (2) Simultaneous macroscopic slip initiation (blue); (3) A swarm of NSEs occur as the fault slips, each NSE lasts 1-2 milliseconds; and (4) Details of the initial NSE are shown in Fig. 2. Based on waveform cross-correlation between frequency band from 20 kHz to 70kHz, we identify several groups of NSE clusters, and apply empirical Green’s function method to analyze event source spectra based on Brune-type source model. These NSEs are indicators of rupture propagation during the experimental fault slip.",

            "abstract": "Despite major advancements in modeling of the climate system, incorporating vegetation dynamics into climate models is still at the initial stages making it an ongoing research topic. Only few of GCMs participating in CMIP5 simulations included the vegetation dynamics component. Consideration for vegetation dynamics is even less common in RCMs. In this study, RegCM4.3.4-CLM4-CN-DV, a regional climate model synchronously coupled with a land surface component that includes both Carbon-Nitrogen (CN) and Dynamic-Vegetation (DV) processes is used to simulate and project regional climate over West Africa. Due to its unique regional features, West Africa climate is known for being susceptible to land-atmosphere interactions, enhancing the importance of including vegetation dynamics in modeling climate over this region. In this study the model is integrated for two scenarios (present-day and future) using outputs from four GCMs participating in CMIP5 (MIROC, CESM, GFDL and CCSM4) as lateral boundary conditions, which form the basis of a multi-model ensemble. Results of model validation indicates that ensemble of all models outperforms each of individual models in simulating present-day temperature and precipitation. Therefore, the ensemble set is used to analyze the impact of including vegetation dynamics in the RCM on future projection of West Africa’s climate. Results from the ensemble analysis will be presented, together with comparison among individual models.",

            "abstract": "Many states are already experiencing the costly impacts of extreme climate and weather events. The occurrence, frequency and intensity of these events may change under future climates. Preparing for these changes takes time, and state government agencies and communities need to recognize the risks they could potentially face and the response actions already undertaken. The States at Risk: America’s Preparedness Report Card project is the first-ever study that quantifies five climate-change-driven hazards, and the relevant state government response actions in each of the 50 states.\nThe changing characteristics of extreme heat, drought, wildfires, inland and coastal flooding were assessed for the baseline period (around year 2000) through the years 2030 and 2050 across all 50 states. Bias-corrected statistically-downscaled (BCSD) climate projections (Reclamation, 2013) and hydrology projections (Reclamation, 2014) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under RCP8.5 were used.\nThe climate change response action analysis covers five critical sectors: Transportation, Energy, Water, Human Health and Communities. It examined whether there is evidence that the state is taking action to (1) reduce current risks, (2) raise its awareness of future risks, (3) plan for adaptation to the future risks, and (4) implement specific actions to reduce future risks for each applicable hazards.\nResults from the two analyses were aggregated and translated into a rating system that standardizes assessments across states, which can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical audiences. The findings in this study not only serve as a screening tool for states to recognize the hazards they could potentially face as climate changes, but also serve as a roadmap for states to address the gaps in response actions, and to improve climate preparedness and resilience.",

            "abstract": "One of the surprising observations by Mariner 10 during its March 1974 flyby of Mercury was the detection of intense bursts of energetic particles in Mercury’s magnetosphere in association with substorm-like magnetic field reconfigurations. A full understanding of where, when, and how such particle bursts occur was not possible from the limited Mariner 10 data. The MESSENGER mission to Mercury has provided a wealth of new data about energetic particle phenomena. With observations from MESSENGER’s Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS), as well as data arising from energetic electrons recorded by the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) and Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) instruments, recent work has greatly extended our record of the acceleration, transport, and loss of energetic electrons at Mercury. The combined data sets include measurements from a few keV up to several hundred keV in electron kinetic energy and have permitted relatively good spatial and temporal resolution for many events. We focus here on the detailed nature of energetic electron bursts measured by the GRNS system, and we place these events in the context of solar wind and magnetospheric forcing at Mercury. Our examination of data at high temporal resolution (10 ms) during the period March 2013 through October 2014 supports strongly the view that energetic electrons are accelerated in the near-tail region of Mercury’s magnetosphere and are subsequently “injected” onto closed magnetic field lines on the planetary night side. The electrons evidently fill the plasma sheet volume and drift rapidly eastward toward the dawn and pre-noon sectors, at time executing multiple complete drifts around the planet to form “quasi-trapped” populations.",

            "abstract": "The 3-D structure of forest and shrub canopies can be mapped using diverse technologies, with the most advanced being lidar and interferometric radar. Other approaches include various modes of interpretation of multi-angle imagery, high-resolution stereo photogrammetry, plant identification, delineation, and measurement from high-resolution panchromatic imagery, and image texture metrics. While active remote sensing will revolutionize mapping of canopy structure, there are currently limitations. High precision lidar will remain limited geographically until the launch of NASA's innovative Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation to the International Space Station in 2019 but even this mission will not see high latitude boreal forest, taiga, or shrubs in tundra because of the orbit. Radar-based methods must be calibrated using high quality data. Imagery from passive imagers acquired at a range of scales therefore has much value if it can be used to provide structure data at broader geographic and temporal scales. Here we report on canopy mapping at scales from 0.5 m to 250 m using high-resolution panchromatic imagery from satellite imagers and NASA’s Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR), respectively. MISR-based 250 m aboveground biomass maps for the southwestern U.S. were assessed against the radar-derived North American Carbon Program National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000, showing good agreement (R2=0.80, RMSE=31 Mg ha-1 for the validation data set; and 0.76 and 18 Mg ha-1, respectively, for 1013 random points). For Oregon forests the best and worst cases were R2=0.90, RMSE=42 Mg ha-1 and R2=0.78, RMSE=62 Mg ha-1, respectively. For improved validation, the CANAPI algorithm was used to interpret high-resolution panchromatic imagery. In Sierra National forest, California, canopy cover estimates agreed well with those from field inventory (R2=0.92, RMSE=0.03). Height estimates gave R2=0.94 and relative RMSE=0.25 m for the range 3 m - 60 m, vs. lidar estimates. In Alaskan Arctic tundra, CANAPI estimates of shrub parameters for 26 sites of 250 m × 250 m yielded R2=0.83 for fractional cover, R2=0.81 for mean crown radius, and R2=0.54 for total number of shrubs, vs. field measurements. CANAPI also allows the generation of canopy maps as well calibration/validation data, with some limitations.",

            "abstract": "Degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) that has been stored in permafrost is a key concern under warming climate because it could provide a positive feedback. Studies and conceptual models suggest that SOC degradation is largely controlled by the decomposability of SOC, but it is unclear exactly what portions of SOC are susceptible to rapid breakdown and what mechanisms may be involved in SOC degradation. Using a suite of analytical techniques, we examined the dynamic consumption and production of labile SOC compounds, including sugars, alcohols, and small molecular weight organic acids in incubation experiments (up to 240 days at either –2 or 8 °C) with a tundra soil under anoxic conditions, where SOC respiration and iron(III) reduction were monitored. We observe that sugars and alcohols are main components in SOC accounting for initial rapid release of CO2 and CH4 through anaerobic fermentation, whereas the fermentation products such as acetate and formate are subsequently utilized as primary substrates for methanogenesis. Iron(III) reduction is correlated to acetate production and methanogenesis, suggesting its important roles as an electron acceptor in tundra SOC respiration. These observations corroborate strongly with the glucose addition during incubation, in which rapid CO2 and CH4 production is observed concurrently with rapid production and consumption of organics such as acetate. Thus, the biogeochemical processes we document here are pertinent to understanding the accelerated SOC decomposition with temperature and could provide basis for model predicting feedbacks to climate warming in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Fracture and fault networks in the upper oceanic crust influence the circulation of hydrothermal fluids and heat transfer between crust and ocean. These fractures form by extensional stresses, with a predominant orientation parallel to the ridge axis, creating porosity- and permeability-derived anisotropy that can be measured in terms of seismic velocity. These properties change as the crust ages and evolves through cooling, alteration and sedimentation. The rate at which these changes occur and their effects on oceanic crustal structure and hydrothermal flow patterns are currently not well constrained. The NERC-funded OSCAR project aims to understand the development of upper oceanic crust, the extent and influence of hydrothermal circulation on the crust, and the behavior of fluids flowing in fractured rock. We show P-wave velocity models centered on DSDP/ODP Hole 504B, located ~200 km south of the Costa Rica Rift, derived from data acquired during a recent integrated geophysics and oceanography survey of the Panama Basin. The data were recorded by 25 four-component OBSs deployed in a grid, that recorded ~10,000 full azimuthal coverage shots fired by a combined high- and low-frequency seismic source. Both reflection and refraction data are integrated to reveal the seismic velocity structure of the crust within the 25 km by 25 km grid. The down-hole geological structure of 6 Ma crust at 504B comprises 571.5 m of extrusive basalts overlying a 209 m transition zone of mixed pillows and dikes containing a clear alteration boundary, which grades to >1050 m of sheeted dikes. Our model results are compared with this lithological structure and other previously published results to better understand the nature of velocity changes within seismic layer 2. The data provide a 3D framework, which together with analysis of the S-wave arrivals and particle motion studies, constrain estimates of the seismic anisotropy and permeability structure of the upper oceanic crust as it ages.",

They are often located at headwater catchments critical for water supplies, but ecohydroclimate data in these regions are sparse. Such evidence may be crucial for assessing climate alterations in these sensitive ecosystems. As part of a global effort led by the Tropical Montane Cloud Forest Research Coordination Network (Cloudnet - http://cloudnet.agsci.colostate.edu), we aim to extend the network of tropical montane forest sites and establish robust protocols for measuring key ecohydroclimatic parameters, including fog interception, windblown rain, throughfall, leaf wetness, and micrometeorological conditions. Specific recommendations for standardized protocols include (1) rain and fog collectors uniquely designed to separately quantify fog interception from direct rain inputs, even in windy conditions, (2) trough-style throughfall gages that collect 40 times the area of a typical tipping bucket gage with added features to reduce splash-out, (3) clusters of leaf wetness sensors to differentiate frequency and duration of wetness caused by rain and fog on windward and leeward exposures, and (4) basic micrometeorological sensors for solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind. At sites where resources allow for additional measurements, we developed protocols for quantifying soil moisture, soil saturation, and plant water uptake from both roots and leaves (i.e. foliar absorption), since these are also important drivers in these systems. Participating sites will be invited to contribute to a global meta-analysis that will provide new insights into the ecohydrology of cloud-affected tropical montane forests.",

            "abstract": "Annually, terrestrial vegetation absorbs more than 10 times the amount of carbon released by human activities, but the degree to which this contributed to net removal of carbon from the atmosphere depends on how much carbon uptake is allocated to long-lived pools. A significant fraction of carbon taken up by forests is allocated to wood where it is effectively removed from the atmosphere for the duration of the tree’s life. In this study we derive forest biomass for the Upper Midwest USA from historical records of tree distribution and size and compare it to published values for old growth forests and also modern forest biomass in the same region. Our estimates of pre-settlement biomass are lower than small scale studies in the published literature. Despite this, we find substantial losses in forest biomass since European settlement, often associated with the loss of large, long lived conifers. The mean life span of tree species in pre-industrial forests was greater than on the modern landscape and that this change is strongly influenced by the loss of long lived, late successional tree species like Tsuga canadensis. Regrowth of forest cleared during the expansion of Europeans across the North American continent had led to net carbon sequestration over the past century. However, because land use change and subsequent land use policies have not permitted the recovery of long lived, late successional species, it is unclear whether pre-industrial forest carbon stocks will recover.\nFigure: Maps showing the biomass-weighted mean of maximum potential tree lifespan across the study area.

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of collisional transfer of intensity due to line mixing has an increasing importance for atmospheric monitoring. From a theoretical point of view, all relevant information about the collisional processes is contained in the relaxation matrix where the diagonal elements give half-widths and shifts, and the off-diagonal elements correspond to line interferences. For simple systems such as those consisting of diatom-atom or diatom-diatom, accurate fully quantum calculations based on interaction potentials are feasible. However, fully quantum calculations become unrealistic for more complex systems. On the other hand, the semi-classical Robert-Bonamy (RB) formalism, which has been widely used to calculate half-widths and shifts for decades, fails in calculating the off-diagonal matrix elements. As a result, in order to simulate atmospheric spectra where the effects from line mixing are important, semi-empirical fitting or scaling laws such as the ECS and IOS models are commonly used. Recently, while scrutinizing the development of the RB formalism, we have found that these authors applied the isolated line approximation in their evaluating matrix elements of the Liouville scattering operator given in exponential form. Since the criterion of this assumption is so stringent, it is not valid for many systems of interest in atmospheric applications. Furthermore, it is this assumption that blocks the possibility to calculate the whole relaxation matrix at all. By eliminating this unjustified application, and accurately evaluating matrix elements of the exponential operators, we have developed a more capable formalism. With this new formalism, we are now able not only to reduce uncertainties for calculated half-widths and shifts, but also to remove a once insurmountable obstacle to calculate the whole relaxation matrix. This implies that we can address the line mixing with the semi-classical theory based on interaction potentials between molecular absorber and molecular perturber. We have applied this formalism to address the line mixing for Raman and infrared spectra of molecules such as N2, C2H2, CO2, NH3, and H2O. By carrying out rigorous calculations, our calculated relaxation matrices are in good agreement with both experimental data and results derived from the ECS model.",

            "abstract": "Tablet computers widely used in recent years. The performance of the tablet computer is improving year by year. Some of them have performance comparable to the personal computer of a few years ago with respect to the calculation speed and the memory size. The convenience and the intuitive operation are the advantage of the tablet computer compared to the desktop PC. I developed the iPad application of the numerical simulation of the seismic wave propagation. The numerical simulation is based on the 2D finite difference method with the staggered-grid scheme. The number of the grid points is 512 x 384 = 196,608. The grid space is 200m in both horizontal and vertical directions. That is the calculation area is 102km x 77km. The time step is 0.01s. In order to reduce the user waiting time, the image of the wave field is drawn simultaneously with the calculation rather than playing the movie after the whole calculation. P and S wave energies are plotted on the screen every 20 steps (0.2s). There is the trade-off between the smooth simulation and the resolution of the wave field image. In the current setting, it takes about 30s to calculate the 10s wave propagation (50 times image updates). The seismogram at the receiver is displayed below of the wave field updated in real time. The default medium structure consists of 3 layers. The layer boundary is defined by 10 movable points with linear interpolation. Users can intuitively change to the arbitrary boundary shape by moving the point. Also users can easily change the source and the receiver positions. The favorite structure can be saved and loaded. For the advance simulation, users can introduce the random velocity fluctuation whose spectrum can be changed to the arbitrary shape. By using this application, everyone can simulate the seismic wave propagation without the special knowledge of the elastic wave equation. So far, the Japanese version of the application is released on the App Store. Now I am preparing the English version.",

            "abstract": "Nevada has the second largest output of geothermal energy in the United States (after California) with 14 major power plants producing over 425 megawatts of electricity meeting 7% of the state’s total energy needs. A number of wells, particularly older ones, have shown significant temperature and pressure declines over their lifetimes, adversely affecting economic returns. Production declines are almost universal in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. BetaZi (BZ) is a proprietary algorithm which uses a physiostatistical model to forecast production from the past history of O&G wells and to generate “type curves” which are used to estimate the production of undrilled wells. Although BZ was designed and calibrated for O&G, it is a general purpose diffusion equation solver, capable of modeling complex fluid dynamics in multi-phase systems. In this pilot study, it is applied directly to the temperature data from five Nevada geothermal fields. With the data appropriately normalized, BZ is shown to accurately predict temperature declines. The figure shows several examples of BZ forecasts using historic data from Steamboat Hills field near Reno. BZ forecasts were made using temperature on a normalized scale (blue) with two years of data held out for blind testing (yellow). The forecast is returned in terms of percentiles of probability (red) with the median forecast marked (solid green). Actual production is expected to fall within the majority of the red bounds 80% of the time. Blind tests such as these are used to verify that the probabilistic forecast can be trusted. BZ is also used to compute and accurate type temperature profile for wells that have yet to be drilled. These forecasts can be combined with estimated costs to evaluate the economics and risks of a project or potential capital investment. It is remarkable that an algorithm developed for oil and gas can accurately predict temperature in geothermal wells without significant recasting.",

            "abstract": "Cyanobacteria blooms have become a major problem worldwide in aquatic ecosystems that receive excessive runoff of limiting nutrients from terrestrial drainage. Such blooms often are considered harmful because they degrade ecosystem services, threaten public health, and burden local economies. Owing to changing agricultural land-use practices, Lake Erie, the most biologically productive of the North American Great Lakes, has begun to undergo a re-eutrophication in which the frequency and extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs) has increased. Continued climate change has been hypothesized to magnify the HAB problem in Lake Erie in the absence of new agricultural management practices, although this hypothesis has yet to be formally tested empirically. Herein, we tested this hypothesis by predicting how the frequency and extent of potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms will change in Lake Erie during the 21st century under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment climate projections in the region. To do so, we used 80 ensembles of climate projections from 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (moderate reduction, RCP4.5; business-as-usual, RCP8.5) to drive a spatiotemporally explicit watershed-hydrology model that was linked to several statistical predictive models of annual cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Erie. Owing to anticipated increases in precipitation during spring and warmer temperatures during summer, our ensemble of predictions revealed that, if current land-management practices continue, the frequency of severe HABs in Lake Erie will increase during the 21st century. These findings identify a real need to consider future climate projections when developing nutrient reduction strategies in the short term, with adaptation also needing to be encouraged under both greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in the absence of effective nutrient mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "High frequency optical water quality sensors were used to determine the influence of land use and seasonality on storm nutrient loads at nine stream sites in the North East Water Resources Network (NEWRnet). S::can spectrolysersTM were used to measure UV-Visible absorbance spectra at sub-hourly intervals in streams with primarily forested, urban, and agricultural watersheds. Calibrations for nitrate (NO3) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were developed for in-situ spectrophotometer measurements using multivariate statistical techniques applied to absorbance spectra and laboratory measurements. Calibrations were evaluated for predictive power and compared to assess applicability across multiple land uses and geographical areas. Calibrations were applied to sub-hourly absorbance spectra to determine NO3 and DOC loads for all storms in 2014 and 2015 for which data were available. Hydrographs were partitioned into direct runoff and baseflow components using a digital filter technique. In addition, the amount of biodegradable DOC (BDOC) was determined for a subset of samples and related to spectrophotometer measurements to determine influences of land use on BDOC content during storms. Comparing NO3 and DOC export per watershed area to storm runoff shows that storm severity, storm frequency, and land use have strong influences on regional NO3 and DOC storm export. This study highlights the value of high frequency continuous stream monitoring for land use and watershed management, particularly in the context of storm event loading.",

            "abstract": "The Siple Coast ice streams are regions of ice that move significantly faster than surrounding ice. Their fast velocities are facilitated by a water-saturated bed, while the bed of the adjacent regions is frozen. The transition between these two regimes takes place in the ice stream margin, where the fast flow transitions to the slow flow of the surrounding regions, resulting in locally high shear stresses and heat dissipation rates. Previous research has shown that this can lead to the formation of temperate ice in the ice stream margin and to outward migration of this margin. Typically, the transition between the frozen and temperate bed is modelled as a no slip to free slip transition. However, this assumption introduces singular stresses at the transition point and neglects the possibility that high stresses or residual water films on the subtemperate side of the bed can lead to subtemperate sliding, as has been observed in other glaciological settings. In this study, we investigate how subtemperate sliding affects the formation of temperate ice in ice stream margins and the migration of these margins. By analysing the boundary layer structure in the margin, we derive asymptotic solutions for the migration speed and quantify its dependence on properties that are available in continental-scale ice sheet models.",

However, one of the most critical point is data interpretation considering planetary surfaces, as Mercury, where the changes in spectral characteristics are induced by the high temperatures conditions (Helbert et al., 2013).\nThe aim of this work is to interpret the experimental thermal emissivity spectra with an innovative approach: simulating IR spectra of the main mineral families that compose the surface of Mercury, focusing on pyroxenes (Sprague et al., 2002), both at room and high temperature, exploiting the accuracy of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations, by means of CRYSTAL14 code (Dovesi et al., 2014). The simulations will be compared with experimental emissivity measurements of planetary analogue samples at temperature up to 1000K, performed at Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) by Institute of Planetary Research (DLR, Berlin). Results will be useful to create a theoretical background to interpret HT-IR emissivity spectra that will be collected by the Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (MERTIS), a spectrometer developed by DLR that will be on board of the ESA BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) scheduled for 2017.

By some estimates, these woodlands now occupy up to ten times the area of their original distribution in 1860. Piñon-juniper woodlands are often found within or replacing sagebrush ecosystems, and their encroaching on these habitats puts many species that depend on them at risk. In addition, the canopies are denser and taller than their sagebrush counterparts, increasing the threat of larger and more intense wildfires. If and when fires do occur in these areas, the introduction and expansion of other invasive species such as cheatgrass can follow. Land managers can use methods such as prescribed fire and mastication to control pinon-juniper woodlands, but a comprehensive presence dataset does not yet exist. To assist fire and land managers in identifying these areas of potential fire risk, we are using the multispectral and panchromatic bands of WorldView-2 data to create a high resolution map of pinon-juniper woodlands in the Western United States.",

            "abstract": "Sea salt aerosol is the dominant aerosol component in unpolluted Polar Regions, particularly in the sea ice zone. In the lower latitude liquid ocean, wave action and bubble bursting is thought to be the main mechanism for sea salt aerosol production. However there is growing evidence that in the Polar Regions, particularly near sea ice, that the sublimation of wind lofted salty snow may be a dominant source of sea salt aerosol. An extensive set of aerosol sizing and compositional measurements was made at sea ice location near Ross Island, Antarctica during two field measurement campaigns – a summer campaign in 2014 and late winter campaign in 2015. Sizing measurements from both open and closed path aerosol instruments, and compositional measurements from an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer suggest that there is a significant enhancement in both super and sub micron aerosol associated with high wind events and blowing snow in the boundary layer. While the composition of this aerosol indicates that it is primarily of marine origin, the ratios of the major sea salt ions suggest that processing in the snow pack significantly modifies the aerosol. This alternate sea salt aerosol production mechanism could have significant impact on the modeling of tropospheric halogen chemistry and on the interpretation of sea salt-based proxies in the ice core record.",

            "abstract": "We explore the problem of morphodynamic evolution of carbonate tidal channels, bounded seaward by the ocean and shoaling landward, as observed in coastal lagoons and estuaries. Governing model equations are the conservation of mass and momentum for the flow, and the conservation of sediment mass in the water column and in the bed deposit. We model carbonate accumulation in terms of a specified depth-dependent carbonate “production rate” based on modern rates of carbonate accumulation rate. We further assume that 1) there is no input of clastic sediments to the system, 2) cementation processes are slow when compared to carbonate accumulation, 3) there is an absence of particles in the silt/mud range, and 4) we treat the carbonate sediments as non-cohesive particles. Governing equations are integrated with finite volume for unsteady, two-dimensional, depth averaged shallow-water flow over arbitrary topography. This method is known to capture sharp fronts accurately. We use Roe’s approximate Riemann solver for the computation of fluxes at the interfaces between one finite volume and the other. For second order accuracy we implement MUSCL (Monotone Upstream Scheme for Conservation Laws) and a predictor-corrector time stepping scheme. We validate the model at field scale by comparing the numerical results with field data collected in the Bahamas channels. The comparison is presented in terms of flow velocities, bed profiles and grain size distributions of the bed surface. Finally, we use the validated model to explore how different rates of sea level rise will affect the morphodynamic evolution of the tidal channels under different “production rate” scenarios, e.g. constant, depth dependent.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the characteristics of H2O/OH-absorption bands is critical for understanding their abundance and adherence to remotely observed surfaces. Our goal is to experimentally measure the spectra of anhydrous minerals in thin section and as powders to distinguish between internal H2O, surface adsorbed H2O, adsorbed OH, and OH that was formed as a result of irradiation. From these spectra, we are developing a model that will allow us to better deconvolve the abundance of adsorbed H2O and internally bound OH-/H2O in these materials. With this model, we aim to be able to remove the effects of terrestrial adsorbed H2O, thus enabling us to use the dry spectra to model these materials in the regoliths of airless bodies found in the inner solar system. To complete this task, we created un-mounted thin sections of two ordinary chondrite meteorites (Kilabo – LL6 and Gao-Guenie – H5) and eight ultramafic and banded rocks collected at the Stillwater Intrusion to serve as analogs for the Earth’s moon. These rocks host an abundance of three key mineral series of interest: olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. We conducted EDS scans of each rock to create an elemental map and assess the specific mineral composition of phases in each sample. Transmittance spectra of each thin section were also collected from the visible through mid-IR range using the FTIR microscope to characterize bound water in each sample. These thin sections will be heated up to ~1000°C in a vacuum to remove any internal water and will be measured in transmission for a second time to determine their true anhydrous spectral baseline. Subsets of the samples have been powdered and will be measured under ultra-high vacuum conditions at temperatures ranging from ~293K to 650K to examine the spectral parameters for adsorbed terrestrial water on each sample. Ultimately, these powdered samples will be used for space weathering experiments to examine the nature of the OH- bands induced by irradiation.",

            "abstract": "The Middle East is a very complex region combining several tectonic regimes, which are linked together. Density heterogeneity of the upper mantle, which is related to temperature and compositional variations, is one of the principal factors governing tectonic processes. Therefore, a comprehensive density model of the upper mantle is a key for understanding of these processes. Here we use seismic, gravity and tomography data to construct a 3D density model of the lithosphere and upper mantle and to identify main factors responsible for density variations. At the first stage we use a recent crustal model (Stolk et al., 2013) to estimate gravity effect of the crust and to remove it from the observed fields. As a result, the residual mantle gravity anomalies and residual topography are calculated. In addition we remove the impact of deep density variations below 325 km as estimated by a recent instantaneous dynamic model of the mantle (Kaban et al., 2014). We invert the residual fields jointly with seismic tomography data to image density distribution within the crust and upper mantle. The inversion technique accounts for the fact that the residual gravity and residual topography are controlled by the same factors but in a different way, e.g. depending on depth and wavelength. This provides a possibility for remarkably better vertical resolution of the resulting density model. As the initial approximation, we employ the seismic tomography model of Schaeffer and Lebedev (2013). Velocity variations are converted to density by applying mineral physics constrains. This model is adjusted in the inversion to fit both residual mantle gravity and topography. The obtained density variations are very significant; their amplitude somewhere exceeds 60 kg/m3 relative to a reference model. The most pronounced decrease of the mantle density corresponds to the Gulf of Aden spreading axis, the Red sea and the Afar zone. The maximum density of the upper mantle is associated with the continental collision zones, in particularly to the northeast from the Zagros fold belt and especially under South Caspian.",

            "abstract": "Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, is totally dependent on groundwater for its municipal and industrial water supply. Water is drawn from a network of shallow wells in an alluvial aquifer along the Tuul River. Evidence, however, suggests that current water use and especially the projected water demand from a rapidly growing urban population, is not sustainable from existing water sources. In response, the Mongolia Ministry of Environment and the Mongolian Fresh Water Institute requested technical assistance on groundwater modeling through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Scientists from the USGS-SD Water Science Center provided a workshop to Mongolian water experts on basic principles of groundwater modeling using MODFLOW. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together representatives from the Government of Mongolia, local universities, technical experts, and other key stakeholders to build in-country capacity in hydrogeology and groundwater modeling. A preliminary steady-state groundwater flow model was developed to simulate groundwater conditions in the Tuul River Basin and for use in water use decision-making. The model consisted of 2 layers, 226 rows, and 260 columns with uniform 500 meter grid spacing. The upper model layer represented the alluvial aquifer and the lower layer represented the underlying bedrock, which includes areas characterized by permafrost. Estimated groundwater withdrawal was 180 m3/day, and estimated recharge was 114 mm/yr. The model will be modified and updated by Mongolian scientists as more data are available. Ultimately the model will be used to assist managers in developing a sustainable water supply, for current use and changing climate scenarios. A key to success was developing in-country technical capacity and partnerships with the Mongolian University of Science and Technology, Mongolian Freshwater Institute, a non-profit organization, UNESCO, and the government of Mongolia.",

We will try to reveal the genetic mechanism of the iron deposit¢s in this paper.\nOrebodys mainly occur along the boundary of diorite and metalimestone in the Xishimen iron deposit. Some orebodys intruded into diorites or limestones. There are vesicles in some massive ores. Magnetite from the lower part of orebody occur between diopside and tremolite as an intersititial minerals. Magnetites from upper part of the orebody are eqilibrium with calcite, apatite, Talc, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Magnetites coexisting with dioposide, tremolite and phlogopite have more than 15000 ppm TiO2, and riched in SiO2. However, magnetites coexisting with calcite, talc and sulfides have 200 ppm- 400 ppm TiO2, and poored in SiO2. Magnetites coexisting with talc have highest Al2O3, MgO, and MnO. Magnetites coexisting with calcite and sulfide have lowest Al2O3, MnO and MgO.\nTrace element analysis results of magnetite show that magnetite coexisting with dioposide, tremolite and phlogopite are riched in Ti and Ta, and depleted Nb and Y. Magnetite coexisting with calcite, talc and sulfide are usually have poor positive or no anomaly of Ti and Ta, and have poor positive anomaly of Nb, Hf, and Y. The analysis results of Fe isotope for ores and rocks in Xishimen iron deposit show that there is a negative correlation relationship between altitude and the value of Fe isotope. The heavy Fe isotopes of ores are richer in the lower part than in the upper part.\nThe origin processes of Xishimen iron deposit are: (1) mafic-intermediate magma riched in iron reacted with limestone, and make the “iron magma” formation; (2) Fluids are added into the metallogenic system continuously, and “iron magma” was getting less density; (3) “iron magma” bearing fluids uplifting along magma conduit because of fluid superpressure; (4) The textures, and mineral assemblages, content of minerals and iron isotope of ores change systematicly in the conduit. The model of Magmatic conduit melt-fluid metallogenic system is suitable for Xishimen iron deposit's origin.",

            "abstract": "We present a new methodology to characterize Martian valley networks and to understand their origin in terms of key underlying erosion processes. We use high resolution Mars image data to classify diagnostic geometric properties of valley networks in terms of five independent parameters. The minimum valley width, valley aspect ratio and branching angle are related to the dynamics of fluvial or glacial erosion and interactions between these flows with Mars’ topography. The stream order and fractal dimension are statistical measures of valley network complexity. Applied to 45 channel networks on Earth, an empirical principal component analysis algorithm distinguishes features related to glaciers, sub-glacial channels and varied fluvial systems in a way that is consistent with predictions from theoretical scaling analyses. Applying our method to Mars, we expand our analysis to include topography produced by lava flows and we identify features reliably related to erosion by wet- and dry-bottomed glaciers and by surface runoff, as well as features related to the emplacement of lava flows. Interestingly, we also identify a class of valley network with a mechanical origin that is not clearly associated with Earth-like fluvial or glacial processes. Significantly, the spatial distribution of valley networks related to glacial and fluvial processes varies with latitude and longitude, as well as with geological age with implications for the evolution of Mars’ average climate over time, the likelihood of periodic ice ages, and for the nature and time-variability of the planet’s hydrological cycle. We also explore ways to apply the same methodology to build understanding of the surface processes underlying the formation of the enigmatic channel networks on Titan",

            "abstract": "Rapid environmental change, a rise in maritime activities and resource development, and increasing engagement by non-Arctic nations are key to major shifts underway in Arctic social-environmental systems (SES). These shifts are triggering responses by policy makers, regulators and a range of other actors in the Arctic Ocean region. Arctic science can play an important role in informing such responses, in particular by (i) providing data from sustained observations to serve as indicators of change and major transitions and to inform regulatory and policy response; (ii) identifying linkages across subsystems of Arctic SES and across regions; (iii) providing predictions or scenarios of future states of Arctic SES; and (iv) informing adaptation action in response to rapid change. Policy responses to a changing Arctic are taking a multi-faceted approach by advancing international agreements through the Arctic Council (e.g., Search and Rescue Agreement), global forums (e.g., IMO Polar Code) or private sector instruments (e.g., ISO code for offshore structures). At the regional level, co-management of marine living resources involving local, indigenous stakeholders has proven effective. All of these approaches rely on scientific data and information for planning and decision-making. Examples from the Pacific Arctic sector illustrate how such relevant data is currently collected through a multitude of different government agencies, universities, and private entities. Its effective use in informing policy, planning and emergency response requires coordinated, sustained acquisition, common standards or best practices, and data sharing agreements – best achieved through data co-management approaches. For projections and scenarios of future states of Arctic SES, knowledge co-production that involves all relevant stakeholders and specifically addresses major sources of uncertainty is of particular relevance in an international context.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming at high latitudes is changing the productivity and function of Canadian boreal forests. Several recent studies have implicated drought stress as the major cause of declining photosynthetic rates and increasing tree mortality in these regions. To investigate the effects of a changing climate on Canadian boreal forests, we analyzed Landsat Thematic Mapper time series (1984-2011) at 46 sites. The study sites ranged in size from 3,500 to 15,000 square kilometers and spanned the entire range of ecoregions and disturbance regimes in the Canadian boreal forest east of the Rocky Mountains. Our results suggest a divergent response of these forests to recent climate warming, with declines in peak-summer vegetation indices (VIs) observed in the dry regions of western and central Canada and increasing VI trends observed in more humid eastern regions. Further, we show a strong relationship between the timing of disturbance and the magnitude and direction of VI trends in disturbed forests. Positive trends are associated with disturbances that happened at the beginning of (or prior to) the Landsat time series and negative trends are associated with disturbances that occurred in the latter part of the time series. Taken together, these two effects explain the major modes of variability in VI trends in Canadian boreal forests. Future decreases in springtime water availability related to climate change and associated changes to fire regimes have potentially large implications for carbon and water budgets in this geographically extensive and important biome.",

            "abstract": "The Early Jurassic separation of Antarctica from Africa plays an important role in our understanding of the dispersal of Gondwana. Previously proposed reconstruction models often contain overlaps and gaps in the restored margins that reflect difficulties in accurately delineating the continent-ocean boundary (COB) and determining the amount and distribution of extended continental crust. This study focuses on the evolution of the African margin adjacent to the Mozambique Basin and the conjugate margin of Antarctica near the Riiser Larsen Sea. New satellite-derived gravity data have been used to trace the orientations and landward limits of fracture zones in the study area. A 3-D gravity inversion has produced a crustal thickness model that reliably quantifies the extent and amount of stretched crust. Information on crustal thickness along with the identification of fracture zones reveal the COBs that are located significantly closer to the coasts of Africa and Antarctica than previously recognized. Correlation of both fracture zone azimuths and the identified COBs over the conjugate margins suggest Antarctica began drifting away from Africa at approximately 171 Ma in a roughly SSE direction. Of several scenarios examined, the Beira High is most likely oceanic and may be a conjugate feature of the southern Astrid Ridge. An areal-balancing method that involves restoring the crust to a uniform pre-rift thickness has been used to perform the non-rigid reconstruction for both non-volcanic and volcanic margin with magmatic underplating. Based on the results, Africa underwent extension of 65-105 km while Antarctic crust was stretched by 90-190 km. Both margins reveal a trend of increasing extension from east to west. Various models tested to determine the direction of extension during rifting suggest that Antarctica underwent a counter-clockwise rotation with respect to Africa between 186-171 Ma prior to the onset of seafloor spreading.",

Within the French Critical Zone program CRITEX, we have proposed to develop a prototype called “Chemical House”, applying the “lab on field” concept to one of the stream of the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory.\nThe Orgeval catchment (45 km2) is part of the Critical Zone RBV (“Réseau des bassins versants”) network. It is a typical temperate agricultural catchment that has been intensively monitored for the last 50 years for hydrology and nutrient chemistry. Agricultural inputs and land use are also finely monitored making Orgeval an ideal basin to test the response of the Critical Zone to agricultural forcing. Geology consists of a typical sedimentary basin of Cenozoic age with horizontal layers of limestones, silcrete and marls, covered by a thin loamy layer. Two main aquifers are present within the catchment: the Brie and the Champigny aquifers. Mean runoff is 780 mm/yr.\nThe Chemical House is a fully automated lab and installed directly along the river, which performs measurement of all major dissolved elements such as Na, Cl, Mg, Ca, NO3, SO4 and K every half hour. It also records all physical parameters (Temperature, pH, conductivity, O2 dissolved, Turbidity) of the water every minute. Orgeval Chemical House started to measure river chemistry on June 12, 2015 and has successfully now recorded several months of data. We will present the architecture of the Chemical House and the first reproducibility and accuracy tests made during the summer drought 2015 period. Preliminary results show that the chemical house is recoding significant nychtemeral (day/night) cycles for each element. We also observe that each element has its own behaviour along a day. First results open great prospects.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ) in the upper ocean are commonly associated with poor ventilation and storage of respired carbon, potentially linked to atmospheric CO2 level. Iodine to calcium ratios (I/Ca) in recent planktonic foraminifera suggest that values less than ~2.5 mmol/mol indicate the presence of an OMZ. We apply this proxy to estimate past dissolved oxygen concentrations in the currently well oxygenated Southern Ocean, which played a critical role in carbon sequestration during glacial times. A down-core planktonic I/Ca record from South of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) shows that minimum O2 concentrations in the upper ocean fell below 1.5 ml/l during the last two glacial periods, indicating the development of a persistent glacial OMZ at the heart of the carbon engine of our climate system. New estimates of past ocean oxygenation variability may assist in resolving mechanisms responsible for the much-debated ice age atmospheric CO2 decline.",

            "abstract": "In most studies, climate change is approached by focusing on the evolution between a fixed current baseline and the future, emphasizing stronger warming as we move further from the current climate. Under climate conditions that are continuously evolving, human systems might have to constantly adapt to a changing target. We propose here an alternative approach, and consider indicators of the pace of temperature change and its effects on temperature distributions estimated from projections of an ensemble of 18 General Circulation Models. The pace is represented by a rate defined by the difference between two subsequent 20-year periods. Under the strongest emission pathway (RCP 8.5), the warming rate strongly increases over the twenty-first century, with a maximum reached before 2080. Whilst northern high-latitudes witness the highest temperature rise, all other latitudes highlight at least a doubling in the warming rate compared to the current period. The spatial extent of significant shifts in annual temperature distributions between two subsequent 20-year periods is projected to be at least four times larger than in the current period. They are mainly located in tropical areas, such as West Africa and South-East Asia. The fraction of the world population exposed to these shifts grows from 8% to 60% from around 2060 onwards, i.e. reaching 6 billions people. In contrast, low mitigation measures (RCP 6.0) are sufficient to keep the warming rate similar to current values. Under the medium mitigation pathway (RCP 4.5), population exposure to significant shifts drops to negligible values by the end of the century. Strong mitigation measures (RCP 2.6) are the only option that generates a global return to historical conditions regarding our indicators. Considering the pace of change can bring an alternative way to interact with climate impacts and adaptation communities.",

            "abstract": "The ability to determine volcanic ash plume characteristics from seismic and/or infrasonic records would enable increased accuracy in volcanic monitoring during times of low visibility. During May-June 2015 a field deployment of 6 infrasound sensors, 2 seismometers, multiple cameras, and 10 Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) stations were deployed around Sakurajima Volcano in Japan. During one month of observations (13 May to 10 June) hundreds of explosive eruptions were observed with plume heights reaching 4.3 km above the vent. The plumes varied in duration, ash content, and physical form. The resulting explosions exhibited a variety of infrasound waveforms including the classic long-period N shape as well as events with a mixture of high and low frequencies. For a subset of larger events, peak pressures ranged from 16 to 741 Pa at a distance of 3.6 km from the vent. The seismic signals are long period and emergent with no clear P or S-waves, although high frequency ground-coupled airwaves are visible in conjunction with the infrasonic record of some of the explosive eruptions. Peak ground displacements on the vertical component ranged from 2.1 to 183 um for the same subset of events. Volcanic lightning was both visually observed and recorded on the LMA stations. One of the goals of this project to determine if there are intrinsic relationships between ash plume characteristics, such as initial velocity or acceleration, ash grain size, texture, and composition, seismic and infrasound waveforms, and the presence and type of volcanic lightning. The rich variety of observations provides a good opportunity to determine such relationships.",

            "abstract": "Coasts are dynamic systems that are continuously transforming over different temporal and spatial scales as a result of geomorphologic and oceanographic drivers. Tropical and extratropical storms have the potential to alter coastlines with a myriad of effects including storm-driven overwash. Barrier islands are examples of coastlines which are especially susceptible to impacts from storms, depending on characteristics such as surge, waves, and the geometry of the island. On the event scale, the effects of overwash processes may result in damage or loss to property, infrastructure and habitat. On the decadal scale, overwash can be considered a continuous process that reshapes barrier morphology, and drives changes in the backshore environment by altering dune elevations and contributing to barrier island migration. Long-term management assessments and planning should account for overwash processes when examining impacts to coastal environments.\nThis study implements a Bayesian Network to relate barrier island morphology and hydrodynamic drivers to predict event-driven and long-term morphologic change. The network is trained with a variety of data for Assateague Island, MD/VA, including remote sensing and numerical modeling. The network is tested on its ability to predict morphologic variables including ocean-facing shorelines, dunes, overwash deposits and back-barrier shoreline changes. The model provides a better understanding of the interactions between coastal processes that influence the vulnerability of barrier islands, and identifies which processes and timescales can be predicted with statistical skill versus those that must be treated as random processes whose variance must be quantified. This allows for the evaluation of long-term and storm-driven morphologic changes under various scenarios that can be used by coastal managers and policy makers to make more informed decisions regarding monitoring, sustainability and restoration activities.",

            "abstract": "In polar regions and under stable stratification, models present large biases that are dependent upon the parameterizations used for the surface and the boundary layer (Holtslag et al., 2013). However, no intercomparison study focuses on very stable stratification as the first three GABLS intercomparison cases dealt with moderately stable conditions. The goal of the new GABLS-4 intercomparison is to study real-time diurnal cycles over the Antarctic Plateau, focusing on the boundary layer characteristics and the coupling with the surface. The intercomparison uses observations collected at the Dome-Concordia (Dome-C) Research Station in Antarctica during the summer, and in particular the observations acquired on the 45-m tower. This site was chosen for its homogeneous surface with a low conductivity as snow and on a flat topography. Three types of numerical simulations were intercompared : 15-day offline land-snow model (LSM) runs ,30 hours runs of single column model (SCM) and 24 hours of large eddy simulations (LES). A large variability in surface fluxes was highlighted in all the types of simulations with variations around 30 W/m² during daytime and nighttime which is about 100% of the ensemble mean value. After a rapid overview of the main outcomes of the intercomparison of the two first types of simulations, we focus on the LES results. In total, 7 different LES models participated to this intercomparison. First, we show how the results are sensitive to the horizontal and vertical resolution used for this case and that horizontal resolution of 5m and vertical resolution of 2m are not sufficient to correctly reproduce the features occurring at night. Then, we characterize the turbulence separating the daytime regime and the nighttime regime. In particular, we highlight the existence of different relationship between the turbulent kinetic energy and the Richardson Number depending on the time of the day.",

            "abstract": "Excess nutrient loading, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, to surface waters is a common and significant problem throughout the United States. While pollution remediation efforts are continuously improving, the most effective treatment remains to limit the source. Appropriate timing of fertilizer application to reduce nutrient losses is currently a hotly debated topic in the Northeastern United States; winter spreading of manure is under special scrutiny. We plan to evaluate the loss of phosphorous to surface waters from agricultural systems under varying seasonal fertilization schemes in an effort to determine the impacts of fertilizers applied throughout the year.\nThe Cayuga Lake basin, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, is a watershed dominated by agriculture where a wide array of land management strategies can be found. The evaluation will be conducted on the Fall Creek Watershed, a large sub basin in the Cayuga Lake Watershed. The Fall Creek Watershed covers approximately 33,000 ha in central New York State with approximately 50% of this land being used for agriculture. We plan to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to model a number of seasonal fertilization regimes such as summer only spreading and year round spreading (including winter applications), as well as others. We will use the model to quantify the phosphorous load to surface waters from these different fertilization schemes and determine the impacts of manure applied at different times throughout the year.\nMore detailed knowledge about how seasonal fertilization schemes impact phosphorous losses will provide more information to stakeholders concerning the impacts of agriculture on surface water quality. Our results will help farmers and extensionists make more informed decisions about appropriate timing of manure application for reduced phosphorous losses and surface water degradation as well as aid law makers in improving policy surrounding manure application.",

            "abstract": "In the Mono Basin, CA, fine sand, silt, and volcanic ash deposited in Pleistocene Lake Russell is exposed on the margin of Mono Lake, and on Paoha Island in the lake. The silt records the Mono Lake Excursion (MLE: Denham and Cox, 1971) and several tens of thousands of years of paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV: Denham and Cox, 1971; Liddicoat, 1976; Lund et al., 1988). The sediment is believed to be an accurate recorder of PSV because the MLE has the same signal at widely separated localities in the basin (Denham, 1974; Liddicoat and Coe, 1979; Liddicoat, 1992) with the exception at wave-cut cliffs on the southeast side of the lake (Coe and Liddicoat, 1994). Magnetite, titanomagnetite, and titanomaghemite are present in the sediment (Denham and Cox, 1971; Liddicoat, 1976; Liddicoat and Coe, 1979), which is glacial flour from the adjacent Sierra Nevada (Lajoie, 1968). X-rays of the sediment and lineation measurements show patterns of normal bedding with layers aligned such that the minimum axes are within 5-10 degrees of normal bedding, with 10 percent foliation and 1 percent lineation (Coe and Liddicoat, 1994).\nWe explore reasons for the difference in part of the PSV record at the wave-cut cliffs beyond the interpretation of Coe and Liddicoat (1994) that paleomagnetic field strength is a controlling factor. Possibilities include the sedimentation rate – at localities on the margin of Mono Lake the rate is about 60 percent less than at the wave-cut cliffs – and lithology of the sediment. At Mill Creek on the northwest side of Mono Lake, the non-magnetic sediment fraction is coarser-grained than at the wave-cut cliffs by a factor of about two, and there is a similar difference in the total inorganic carbon (TIC) percentage by weight for the two localities. (Spokowski et al., 2011) Studies of the sediment at two localities in the basin where the Hilina Pali Excursion (Teanby et al., 2002) might be recorded (Wilson Creek and South Shore Cliffs; Liddicoat and Coe, 2013) and at an extension of the PSV record of Lund et al. (1988) show a similar pattern to the grain size distribution and TIC percentage described above. Additional measurements of the TIC in the sediments from both sides of Mono Lake for the intervals recording the possible HPE and PSV extension of Lund et al. (1988) are in progress and will be presented.",

Global mean tropospheric OH differs by as much as 50% between various global models, for reasons that are not understood. We use neural networks (NN), trained using archived model output from global models, to quantify the factors that cause differences in tropospheric OH between any two models, both globally and on a regional scale. This is done by inputting 3-D OH precursor fields from one model into the chemical mechanism of the other model (represented by the trained NN) to quantify the impact of each precursor field on OH. The NN framework also allows the impact of various chemical mechanisms to be assessed. Here, we apply NNs to output from eight chemical transport models (CTMs) that participated in the POLARCAT Model Intercomparison Project (POLMIP). The primary cause of OH variation is the CTM treatment of J(O1D), O3, CO, and CH4; we will show tables and figures documenting why OH differs between each pair of models. Finally, we will outline chemical fields that must be archived for a similar analysis to be conducted for other model intercomparison projects.",

The new model is based on almost all (except for a few very old and publically unavailable profiles) deep sounding reflection/refraction seismic proﬁles with a total length of more than 23,000 km. The database includes the depth to Moho, thickness and average P wave velocity of four crustal layers (sediments, upper crust, middle crust, and lower crust), and Pn velocity. We analyze the crustal structure in different tectonic units of the North China Craton. The thickness of sediments correlates strongly with the tectonic setting. It ranges from near-zero to 2 km in the northern and southern orogenic belts, 3–4 km in the central parts of the craton, to more than 6 km in the Ordos basin and the North China Plain. The Moho depth and the thickness of the crystalline crust increase from east to west. The Moho depth varies from 30-32 km along the eastern coast up to 54 km under the western block; Pn velocities range from 7.9 to 8.1 km/s. The upper crust with an average Vp of 6.2-6.3 km/s increases in thickness from 16 km in the east to 22 km in the west. In the eastern block, the thickness of the middle crust is 10-12 km with an average Vp~6.5-6.7 km/s. In the western block, the thickness of the middle crust changes from 13 km in the west to 23 km in the east. The thickness of the lower crust (Vp~ 6.9-7.0 km/s) in most of the eastern block is only 0-2 km, probably due to partial melting of the lower crust in the northern block and delamination in the southern block. In the western block, the lower crust is up to 6 km thick. We illustrate results by a series of maps, which demonstrate strong crustal heterogeneity.",

Digital representations of rock from CT images and physics modeling based on these pore structures provide the opportunity to further advance our quantitative understanding of fluid flow, geomechanics, and geochemistry, and the emergence of coupled behaviors. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized production of custom parts with complex internal geometries. For the geosciences, recent advances in 3D printing technology may be co-opted to print reproducible porous structures derived from CT-imaging of actual rocks for experimental testing. The use of 3D printed microstructure allows us to surmount typical problems associated with sample-to-sample heterogeneity that plague rock physics testing and to test material response independent from pore-structure variability. Together, imaging, digital rocks and 3D printing potentially enables a new workflow for understanding coupled geophysical processes in a real, but well-defined setting circumventing typical issues associated with reproducibility, enabling full characterization and thus connection of physical phenomena to structure.\nIn this talk we will discuss the possibilities that these technologies can bring to geosciences and present early experiences with coupled multiscale experimental and numerical analysis using 3D printed fractured rock specimens. In particular, we discuss the processes of selection and printing of transparent fractured specimens based on 3D reconstruction of micro-fractured rock to study fluid flow characterization and manipulation. Micro-particle image velocimetry is used to directly visualize 3D single and multiphase flow velocity in 3D fracture networks.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution proxy reconstructions are essential to assess the rate and magnitude of anthropogenic global warming. High-resolution pollen records are being critically examined for the production of accurate climate reconstructions of the last millennium, often as extensions of tree-ring records. Past climate inference from a sedimentary pollen record depends upon the stationarity of the pollen-climate relationship. However, humans have directly altered vegetation, and hence modern pollen deposition is a product of landscape disturbance and climate, unlike in the past with its dominance of climate-derived processes. This could cause serious bias in pollen reconstructions.\nIn the US Midwest, direct human impacts have greatly altered the vegetation and pollen rain since Euro-American settlement in the mid-19th century. Using instrumental climate data from the early 1800s from Fort Snelling (Minnesota), we assessed the bias from the conventional method of inferring climate from pollen assemblages in comparison to a calibration set from pre-settlement pollen assemblages and the earliest instrumental climate data. The pre-settlement calibration set provides more accurate reconstructions of 19th century temperature than the modern set does. When both calibration sets are used to reconstruct temperatures since AD 1116 from a varve-dated pollen record from Lake Mina, Minnesota, the conventional method produces significant low-frequency (centennial-scale) signal attenuation and positive bias of 0.8-1.7 oC, resulting in an overestimation of Little Ice Age temperature and an underestimation of anthropogenic warming. We also compared the pollen-inferred moisture reconstruction to a four-century tree-ring-inferred moisture record from Minnesota and Dakotas, which shows that the tree-ring reconstruction is biased towards dry conditions and records wet periods relatively poorly, giving a false impression of regional aridity. The tree-ring chronology also suggests varve chronology problems.\nIt remains to be explored how widespread this landscape disturbance problem is when conventional pollen-based inference methods are used, and consequently how seriously regional manifestations of global warming might have been underestimated with traditional pollen-based techniques.",

            "abstract": "One of the most important issues in developing accurate ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) is the effective use of limited regional site information in developing a site effects model. In modern empirical GMPE models site effects are usually characterized by simplified parameters that describe the overall near-surface effects on input ground-motion shaking. The most common site effects parameter is the time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30), which has been used in the Next Generation Attenuation-West (NGA-West) and NGA-East GMPEs, and is widely used in building code applications. For the NGA-East GMPE database, only 6% of the stations have measured VS30 values, while the rest have proxy-based VS30 values. Proxy-based VS30 values are derived from a weighted average of different proxies’ estimates such as topographic slope and surface geology proxies. For the proxy-based approaches, the uncertainty in the estimation of Vs30 is significantly higher (~0.25, log10 units) than that for stations with measured VS30(0.04, log10 units); this translates into error in site amplification and hence increased ground motion variability.\nWe introduce a new VS30 proxy as a function of the site fundamental frequency (fpeak) using the NGA-East database, and show that fpeak is a particularly effective proxy for sites in central and eastern North America We first use horizontal to vertical spectra ratios (H/V) of 5%-damped pseudo spectral acceleration (PSA) to find the fpeak values for the recording stations. We develop an fpeak-based VS30 proxy by correlating the measured VS30 values with the corresponding fpeak value. The uncertainty of the VS30 estimate using the fpeak-based model is much lower (0.14, log10 units) than that for the proxy-based methods used in the NGA-East database (0.25 log10 units). The results of this study can be used to recalculate the VS30 values more accurately for stations with known fpeak values (23% of the stations), and potentially reduce the overall variability of the developed NGA-East GMPE models.",

            "abstract": "The Mejillones Peninsula lies directly above the seismogenic zone, which marks the shallow coupled part of the Nazca and South America plates. In this peninsula uplifted abrasion platforms and normal faults constitute spectacular evidences for Quaternary tectonics. In this contribution we presented new data about the age of marine abrasion platforms and fault slip rates based on cosmogenic nuclides ages, tephra geochronology and OSL ages. We mapped the net offset related to two regional scale normal faults (Mejillones Fault and Caleta Herradura Fault), which control the topography of the Mejillones Peninsula. In general we observed that the altitude of the abrasion platforms is strongly influenced by normal fault offset and that slip rate varies systematically with respect to the strike of the normal faults. In fact along-strike variation in the amount of normal-fault slip along these two faults has determined the present position of marine abrasion platforms preserved in two north-south regional scale horst structures. We determined that Quaternary slip variation along strike of the Mejillones Faults increase northward and a tip-point-fault can be identified in the central part of the Mejillones Peninsula. At the same latitude the Caleta Herradura Fault displaces identical stratigraphic markers than the Mejillones Fault and the net-fault slip is similar to the northern section of the Mejillones Fault. It indicates that normal fault offset is transferred from one structure to the other and that both faults are interlink structures producing near the same amount of E-W finite extension across this Peninsula. Analytical modeling shows that upper plate extension is promoted during the propagation of subduction earthquakes beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. The uplift of the peninsula is counterbalanced during the interseismic and coseismic phase of subduction earthquake cycle depending on the extent of earthquake ruptures down-dip of the plate interface.",

            "abstract": "One of the most valuable sources of data is Landsat imagery when in-situ data is absent. The Landsat satellite observations are also among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the water body changes of the two biggest lakes of Hispaniola Island for the past 30 years, using remote sensing techniques when there are no in-situ measurements available.\nLake Azuei in Haiti and Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic both have been changing constantly in their quality and quantity. Unexpected growth of the two lakes has been observed since 2003, leaving the area with many ecological and socio-economic complications affecting thousands of local peoples’ lives during the past 12 years. Such phenomena are expected to be due to the influence of climate change on the lakes. One of the main key components to investigate this hypothesis is first to detect and map the patterns of changes of the lakes over time.\n100 Landsat 4-5 TM and 192 Landsat 7-ETM+ scenes acquired from 1984 to 2014 were analyzed to investigate the surface area changes for each lake. Almost 60% of the images are fully or partially cloudy which makes it difficult to picture the full extent of the lakes and consequently calculate their surface area. Moreover, 65% of images have gaps due to the failure of the ETM+ scan line corrector (SLC) since 2003 which adds to the problem.\nTo solve this problem, we developed an algorithm to identify and classify clouds and cloud shadows using blue and Thermal bands; remove them from the scene and then detect water body using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) using Green and NIR bands.\nThe next step was to fill the gaps which were created after removing clouds and stripes from the scenes. Toward this end, we decided to complete each image using the previous or next available image.\n95% of the images have been processed and surface area has been calculated for both lakes. Using the algorism we conducted enabled us to map the spatiotemporal changes of both lakes for 30 years. Having such results gives us the ability to start the hydrological studies and further investigate the correlation of such phenomena with climate change.",

            "abstract": "Assessing snow depths across the Arctic has proven to be extremely difficult due to the variability of snow depths at scales from metres to 100’s of metres. New Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology provides the possibility to obtain centimeter level resolution imagery (~3cm), and to create Digital Surface Models (DSM) based on the Structure from Motion method. However, there is an ongoing need to quantify the accuracy of this method over different terrain and vegetation types across the Arctic. In this study, we used a small UAS equipped with a high resolution RGB camera to create DSMs over a 1 km2 watershed in the western Canadian Arctic during snow (end of winter) and snow-free periods. To improve the image georeferencing, 15 Ground Control Points were marked across the watershed and incorporated into the DSM processing. The summer DSM was subtracted from the snowcovered DSM to deliver snow depth measurements across the entire watershed. These snow depth measurements were validated by over 2000 snow depth measurements. This technique has the potential to improve larger scale snow depth mapping across watersheds by providing snow depth measurements at a ~3 cm . The ability of mapping both shallow snow (less than 75cm) covering much of the basin and snow patches (up to 5 m in depth) that cover less than 10% of the basin, but contain a significant portion of total basin snowcover, is important for both water resource applications, as well as for testing snow models.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation states of modern-day terrestrial environments are broadly constrained, though we are at the earliest stages of directly quantifying redox states during the first 700 million years. Redox states are constrainable through a combination of high temperature laboratory experiments, analyses of detrital Hadean zircon, and younger well-studied zircons and their host rocks. The redox state of the solid earth and the biosphere are believed to be interwoven: how might we exploit this to probe for the existence of possible biosphere-lithosphere interactions on the early Earth? Some insight comes from the investigation of \"modern-day\" zircon-bearing rocks and the new application of techniques that allow us to directly probe element valence as a proxy for magma redox state (XANES). Other insights are possible through the study of young ~400 Ma (S)edimentary- and (I)gneous-type granitoids from Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB), where the magma chemical properties in the former may be influenced by the assimilation of sedimentary material containing organic matter. We observe that zircons from LFB S-type granitoids formed under more reducing conditions when compared to LFB zircon formed in I-type granitoids. This observation, while reflecting 9 granitoids and 289 analyses of zircons where over 400 different plutons have been identified, is consistent with the incorporation of (reduced) organic matter in the former and highlights one possible manner in which life may influence the composition of igneous minerals. The chemical properties of rocks or igneous minerals such as zircon may extend the search for ancient biological activity to the earliest period of known igneous activity, which dates back to ~4.4 billion years ago. If organic matter was incorporated into Hadean sediments that were then buried and melted, then these biological remnants could imprint a chemical signature within the subsequent melt and the resulting crystal assemblage, including zircon.",

            "abstract": "The southern United States, with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, the subtropical jet, and common tropical cyclone pathways, frequently experiences widespread episodes of heavy rainfall. Within these climatologically frequent rainy periods, however, are truly extreme precipitation episodes. Using observations, analyses, operational ensemble forecasts, and numerical simulations, the multi-scale processes responsible for extreme rainfall in the southern US will be examined in this presentation. At the synoptic scale, these episodes are generally characterized by a pattern supporting persistent forcing for ascent, but mesoscale convective organization is crucial to the occurrence and distribution of extreme precipitation. Furthermore, in subtropical environments with modest vertical wind shear, the latent heating in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) often produces vortices that outlive the MCS that produced them. Similarly, convective processes can support the maintenance of remnant tropical cyclones after landfall. These situations are particularly favorable for long-lived, widespread heavy precipitation. Ensemble-based diagnostics and numerical model experiments will be used to quantify the respective roles of large-scale, convective, and orographic processes, along with their predictability, in recent episodes of extreme precipitation in the southern US, including those occurring in Texas and Oklahoma in May and June of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Climate change studies predict an increase both in seasonal and interannual rainfall variability. The impact of such variability on vegetation composition and ecosystem processes is not well understood. Using satellite data or model simulations, previous studies have reported mixed responses of tree cover to interannual rainfall variability in the tropic (i.e., neutral, positive, or negative). The underlying mechanisms behind such patterns, however, are still unclear. This study uses satellite data and develops a new mechanistic model to investigate the response of tree cover to increasing interannual rainfall variability along Kalahari Transect in Southern Africa. This model accounts for the competition between trees and grasses in access to soil water, fire-induced disturbance, and a demographic bottleneck in tree recruitment. Both satellite data and model results show an increase in tree cover with increasing interannual rainfall fluctuations in dry environments (i.e., mean annual rainfall, MAP<700 mm) but a decrease in tree cover in wet environments (i.e., MAP>700 mm). In dry environments, an increase in interannual rainfall variability disfavors grasses with shallow roots, thereby reducing fire-induced mortality in tree seedlings and opening windows of opportunity for tree recruitment (i.e., indirect effects). In wet environments, an increase in interannual rainfall variability leads to more instances of mass flow below the rooting zone of tree seedlings and thus reduces tree recruitment rate (i.e., direct effects). This study highlights the importance of accounting for the direct effects of rainfall variability on trees and the indirect effects mediated by tree-grass interactions to better understand how tree cover respond to increase in rainfall variability along rainfall gradients.",

            "abstract": "The Somali Basin, found between the Horn of Africa and Madagascar was formed during the rifting of East and West Gondwana. Understanding the evolution of the basin has historically been hindered by enigmatic seafloor fabric and an apparent paucity of magnetic anomaly data. Recent iterations of satellite gravity data have revealed nearly complete fracture zones as well as a distinct extinct spreading ridge within the basin. Through a thorough compilation of available Somali Basin shiptrack profiles, we have been able to successfully model and interpret magnetic anomalies with exceptional detail. This complication is unrivaled in completeness and provides unprecedented insight into basin formation. Using this high quality data, we have interpreted magnetic anomalies M0r (120.8 Ma) to M24Bn (152.43 Ma) about the extinct ridge. The interpreted Somali Basin spreading rate and spreading direction, through anomaly M15n (135.76 Ma), are similar to those observed in the neighboring coeval Mozambique Basin. This similarity suggests that East Gondwana separated from West Gondwana as a cohesive unit, and that the internal rifting of East Gondwana began later around 135 Ma. Our magnetic anomaly interpretations have been combined with additional magnetic interpretations from around the Indian Ocean to build a regionally consistent plate model of Gondwana breakup and early Indian Ocean formation. This plate model will be crucial for future efforts unraveling a precise history of East Gondwana fragmentation and constraining the formation of the Enderby Basin offshore East Antarctica and Bay of Bengal offshore East India.",

            "abstract": "Management goals for the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons include improving the condition of sandbars by the implementation of controlled floods. However, in this system that has been perturbed into fine-sediment deficit by an upstream dam, it is uncertain whether sand supply from tributaries is sufficient to support repeated sandbar building, since dam operations typically export sand. We report on a closed sand budget constructed from flux and morphologic measurements for a 50-km segment of Marble Canyon over a 3-year period. The results provide insight into the location and dynamics of sand-storage locations and places recent changes in sand storage in context with historic measurements of bed elevation.\nThe 2009-2012 study period included the largest annual water releases from Glen Canyon Dam since 1998. The measurements of sand flux and repeat morphologic measurements both indicate that these releases evacuated on the order of 300,000 m3 of sand, approximately equivalent to 20% of the total sand flux for the period. The pattern of sand storage change was different between eddies, where sandbars that are of management interest occur, and the main channel. Among eddies, deposition and erosion were approximately balanced and net change was negligible. Nearly all of the net sand evacuation was the result of erosion from the main channel. We estimate that a minimum of 250,000 m3 of sand remained in storage within eddies. Thus, if the high release volumes continued, sand evacuation would likely have been much larger. This is consistent with the measurements of sand flux, which did not indicate a decline in the rate of evacuation until the dam release rate was reduced.\nComparisons between the recent measurements of bed elevation with measurements made in the late 1990's indicate that the 2011 scouring event did not cause greater scour than occurred in the mid-1990s.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring techniques capable of deep subsurface detection are desirable for early warning and leakage pathway identification in geologic carbon storage formations. This work investigates the feasibility of a leakage detection technique based on pulse testing, which is a traditional hydrogeological characterization tool. In pulse testing, the monitoring reservoir is stimulated at a fixed frequency and the acquired pressure perturbation signals are analyzed in the frequency domain to detect potential deviations in the reservoir’s frequency domain response function. Unlike traditional time-domain analyses, the frequency-domain analysis aims to minimize the interference of reservoir noise by imposing coded injection patterns such that the reservoir responses to injection can be uniquely determined. We have established the theoretical basis of the approach in previous work. Recently, field validation of this pressure-based, leakage detection technique was conducted at a CO2-EOR site located in Mississippi, USA. During the demonstration, two sets of experiments were performed using 90-min and 150-min pulsing periods, for both with and without leak scenarios. Because of the lack of pre-existing leakage pathways, artificial leakage CO2 was simulated by rate-controlled venting from one of the monitoring wells. Our results show that leakage events caused a significant deviation in the amplitude of the frequency response function, indicating that pulse testing may be used as a cost-effective monitoring technique with a strong potential for automation.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is increasing temperatures, altering precipitation regimes and causing earlier growing seasons, particularly at northern latitudes. Such changes in local environmental conditions have the potential to affect biogeochemical cycling including the exchange of greenhouses gases between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere. In addition to the effects of these environmental controls, animals such as migratory geese also influence biogeochemical cycles through grazing, trampling and delivering nutrient-rich fecal matter. In this work we aimed to quantify how local environmental conditions and the presence of grazing interact as drivers of emissions of three key greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O, in coastal wetlands of the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta. We explored the magnitude of emissions across gradients of soil temperature and water table depth, and across vegetation types related to the presence of grazing, ranging from no vegetation through grazed and ungrazed vegetation. We also investigated emissions from grazed areas using experimental manipulations of the timing of grazing and advancement of the growing season.\nWe found that local environmental conditions and use by grazers exert interacting controls on emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 were positively related to soil temperature and CH4 emissions were inversely related to water table depth, but the relationship varied by vegetation type. Net emissions of CO2 were greatest in ungrazed vegetation types (6.62 umols CO2 m-2 sec-1; p=0.0007) whereas CH4 emissions were greatest in the grazed vegetation (122.56 nmols CH4 m-2 sec-1; p=0.037). Flux of N2O was less than 1 nmol N2O m-2 sec-1 across all landscape positions under typical grazing and temperature conditions, but emissions were stimulated to over 10 nmols m-2 sec-1 when grazing occurred early relative to a typical season. Our results indicate that environmental conditions and the presence of migratory herbivores are both important controls on gas fluxes. Future climate change may alter regional gas flux and biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks both via direct environmental drivers and through climate-driven changes to populations or habits of grazers that also exert important controls on biogeochemical cycling in this region.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of turbulent heat fluxes is important for water resources planning and management, irrigation scheduling, and weather forecast. Land surface models (LSMs) can be used to simulate turbulent heat fluxes over large-scale domains. However, the application of LSMs is hindered due to the high uncertainty in model parameters and state variables.\nIn this study, a dual-pass ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) approach is developed to estimate turbulent heat fluxes. Initially, the common land model (CoLM) is used as the LSM (open-loop), and thereafter the ensemble Kalman filter is employed to optimize the CoLM parameters and variables. The first pass of the DA scheme optimizes vegetation parameters of CoLM (which are related to the leaf stomatal conductance) on a weekly-basis by assimilating the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data. The second pass optimizes the soil moisture state of CoLM on a daily-basis by assimilating soil moisture observations from Cosmic-ray instrument. The ultimate goal is to improve turbulent heat fluxes estimates from CoLM by optimizing its vegetation parameters and soil moisture state via assimilation of LST and soil moisture data into the proposed DA system.\nThe DA approach is tested over a wet and densely vegetated site, called Daman in northwest of China. Results indicate that the CoLM (open-loop) model typically underestimates latent heat flux and overestimates sensible heat flux. By assimilation of LST in the first pass, the turbulent heat fluxes are improved compared to those of the open-loop. These fluxes become even more accurate by assimilation of soil moisture in the second pass of the DA approach. These findings illustrate that the introduced DA approach can successfully extract information in LST and soil moisture data to optimize the CoLM parameters and states and improve the turbulent heat fluxes estimates.",

            "abstract": "We are using Dawn spacecraft data to create a geologic map of the Ac-H-3 Dantu Quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres. The quadrangle is located between 21-66˚N and 90-180˚E and includes the following dominant features: 1) the central and northern portion of the 124.6 km diameter impact crater Dantu; 2) crater chains and/or grooves oriented in an east-west direction; 3) a portion of the 84 km diameter impact crater Gaue, whose ejecta blanket covers the SW corner of the quadrangle.\nDantu is a complex impact crater showing terraces, a central pit structure, concentric fractures, and smooth deposits on the crater floor. The materials interpreted to be ejecta deposits of Dantu show low crater frequencies and dominate the southern half of the quadrangle. These deposits appear to be relatively bright and correspond to parts of the #2 high albedo region observed by (1) with the HST indicating different composition and/or material properties than the surroundings. The east-west striking crater chains and grooves are mainly found in the southern half of the quadrangle. They seem to be connected to the crater chains found in Ac-H-4 Ezinu, the neighboring quadrangle to the east, and are potentially related to ballistic ejecta emplacement (see 2). Further work will be focused on Dantu crater and its complex interior and exterior.\nThe current geologic map is based on Framing Camera (FC) image mosaics derived from Approach (~1.3 km/px) and Survey (~400 m/px) data as well as digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from stereo imagery. In the course of the mission, we will incorporate mosaics from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (~140 m/px, Fall 2015) and Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (~35 m/px, Spring 2016) phases.

In fact, it is very much the same in every direction. However, sometimes when there is sudden, heavy wind from the sun, the excited top air can be different and changing, becoming more or less filled up, in many directions---especially if you look at toward the top and the right of the ball of rock on which we all live. Some of the excited top air becomes suddenly filled up in one big area. Near there, there are also parts of the the excited top air that start changing in many very small places. These small changing areas sometimes make it hard to talk between space and the ground. We studied this happening on days on and around day 17 of third month of 2015 when the wind from the sun hit the ball of rock on which we all live very hard. We used things that talk from space to the ground in an area around school up to several hundred 5280 feet away. We made pictures of the changing excited top air, especially the small changing places, and looked for when they did and didn't make for good talking from space to the ground. We studied these pictures to learn when and why this sometimes happens and sometimes it doesn't. We are excited to share what we learned with you.",

In particular, some of them have tried to connect convective organization with theories of critical phenomena and statistical physics.\nIn this contribution, we analyse, from the perspective of critical phenomena, idealised and realistic runs of the Met Office Unified Model. The idealized run is 4km with a squared domain lateral size of 576 km with periodic lateral boundary conditions and 40 days with 3D Smagorinsky mixing and explicit convection. The other cases are real studies of organized convection with different level of aggregation with domains in the Indian ocean and the West Pacific ocean around the equator with lateral boundaries forced from ECMWF analyses.\nOur study focuses on, on the one hand, the relationship between water vapour, precipitation and rainfall extremes. This transition is still not well characterized and previous work have found contradictory results between real data and models, as well as for different water vapour observables. We find differences between idealized and realistic runs with different aggregation levels. We try to explain such findings and investigate the effects of observational uncertanties in these relationships. On the other hand, we look at different statistical properties of clouds and precipitation, such as the energy distribution of convective clusters and study its scaling properties in time and space, including any dependence in the state of aggregation of the run.",

Despite their importance, croplands are poorly represented in the current version of the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)/ Noah land-surface modeling system, resulting in significant surface temperature and humidity biases across agriculture- dominated regions of the United States. This study aims to improve the WRF weather forecasting and regional climate simulations during the crop growing season by enhancing the representation of cropland in the Noah-MP land model. We introduced dynamic crop growth parameterization into Noah-MP and evaluated the enhanced model (Noah-MP-Crop) at both the field and regional scales with multiple crop biomass datasets, surface fluxes and soil moisture/temperature observations. We also integrated a detailed cropland cover map into WRF, enabling the model to simulate corn and soybean field across the U.S. Great Plains. Results show marked improvement in the Noah-MP-Crop performance in simulating leaf area index (LAI), crop biomass, soil temperature, and surface fluxes. Enhanced cropland representation is not only crucial for improving weather forecasting but can also help assess potential impacts of weather variability on regional hydrometeorology and crop yields. In addition to its applications to WRF, Noah-MP-Crop can be applied in high-spatial-resolution regional crop yield modeling and drought assessments",

            "abstract": "Throughout the desert regions of the globe, annually to seasonally resolved proxy records of temperature and aridity that extend the short observational record are sparse. For the African-Arabian desert belt, proxy records of temperature are virtually absent in reconstructions of continental-scale temperature variability during the past millennia. Here we present a new reconstruction of temperature from the African-Arabian desert belt back to 1750 CE, derived from bimonthly analysis of the Sr/Ca-temperature proxy in a northern Red Sea Porites coral (Ras Umm Sidd, Sinai, Egypt). The annual average coral Sr/Ca record is significantly correlated with land surface temperature throughout the eastern Sahara and the Arabian Desert during the last century. The coral Sr/Ca record is also significantly correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) in the Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, but not with Indian Ocean SST. Correlation with sea level pressure (SLP) fields identifies the advection of relatively cold continental air from southeastern Europe toward the Middle East and northeastern Africa as physical mechanism that controls temperature variability at interannual timescales. We combined the Sr/Ca record with a previously reported δ18O record from the same coral, and generated an annually resolved reconstruction of seawater δ18O. Correlation of the annual seawater δ18O reconstruction with SLP and 850 hPa geopotential height fields identifies the advection of relatively dry desert air from the eastern Sahara toward the northern Red Sea as physical mechanism that controls seawater δ18O variability at interannual timescales. This regional mechanism is associated with large-scale SLP anomalies of opposite sign throughout the Northern Hemisphere subtropics and the Arctic. The most striking feature of the seawater δ18O reconstruction is an abrupt regime shift toward fresher conditions in northern Red Sea surface waters between 1850 and 1855 CE. Because of the region’s hyperaridity, local precipitation changes can be excluded as potential cause. We use reconstructed SLP fields back to 1750 CE to study the role of changes in atmospheric circulation at the end of the Little Ice Age as potential cause for the abrupt freshening of northern Red Sea surface waters at that time.",

            "abstract": "We present in situ LA-ICPMS data on platinum group element (PGE) and chalcophile element (namely Cu, Ag, Te, Au, Pb) systematics in sulfides from partially serpentinized peridotites of the St. Elena ophiolite, Costa Rica. PGE are strong indicators of primary mantle processes, though their behavior during low temperature alteration processes such as serpentinization is not well understood. St. Elena sulfides are dominantly pentlandites that coexist with Fe-Ni alloys and native Cu. This indicates extremely low fO2 and fS2 conditions likely established during the early stages of serpentinization. We observe extremely variable PGE-Re concentrations in the sulfides, (e.g. [Os] = 2 – 100,000 times primitive mantle, PM). Low [Os] sulfides have high Pd/Os, which in turn correlates positively with Cu concentrations, suggesting Pd enrichment through Cu-rich fluids (e.g. Schwarzenbach et al., 2014, CMP) as opposed to melt-rock reaction. Sulfide PM-normalized PGE-Re patterns are dominated by strong Pt depletions (e.g., Pt/Pd = 0.80-0.0009). Occasional Pt enrichments over Pd and Ru (or Rh) in a PM-normalized pattern (~5% of the sulfide population) often correlate with Te and/or Au enrichments. Pt enrichment was also observed in a composite pentlandite-awaruite, suggesting possible exsolution of Pt from sulfides under extremely low fS2 conditions. Pb concentrations do not correlate with other chalcophiles or PGE. Pb ranges from 0.01-31.64 ppm with the majority of sulfides <5 ppm, and an average concentration of 2.77 ppm (n=64). Assuming that this Pb concentration is representative of mantle sulfides, this implies that Pb is not dominantly held in sulfides in the upper mantle. Combination of in situ and bulk rock PGE analyses will be used to distinguish the effects of primary magmatic signatures (e.g., melt depletion, melt-rock interaction) and secondary processes such as serpentinization on the PGE-Re and chalcophile element systematics of these sulfides.",

            "abstract": "Landslides have many negative economic and societal impacts, including the potential for significant loss of life and damage to infrastructure. Slope stability assessment can be used to guide decisions about the management of landslide risk, but its usefulness can be challenged by high levels of uncertainty in predicting landslide occurrence. Prediction uncertainty may be associated with the choice of model that is used to assess slope stability, the quality of the available input data, or a lack of knowledge of how future climatic and socio-economic changes may affect future landslide risk. While some of these uncertainties can be characterised by relatively well-defined probability distributions, for other uncertainties, such as those linked to climate change, there is no agreement on what probability distribution should be used to characterise them. This latter type of uncertainty, often referred to as deep uncertainty, means that robust policies need to be developed that are expected to perform adequately under a wide range of future conditions. In our study the impact of deep uncertainty on slope stability predictions is assessed in a quantitative and structured manner using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and the Combined Hydrology and Stability Model (CHASM). In particular, we use and combine several GSA methods including the Method of Morris, Regional Sensitivity Analysis and CART, as well as advanced visualization tools. Our example application is a slope in the Caribbean, an area that is naturally susceptible to landslides due to a combination of high rainfall rates, steep slopes, and highly weathered residual soils. Rapid unplanned urbanisation and changing climate may further exacerbate landslide risk in the future. Our example shows how we can gain useful information in the presence of deep uncertainty by combining physically based models with GSA in a scenario discovery framework.",

            "abstract": "Water supply planning in many major world cities faces several challenges associated with but not limited to climate change, population growth and insufficient land availability for infrastructure development. Long-term plans to maintain supply-demand balance and ecosystem services require careful consideration of uncertainties associated with future conditions. The current approach for London’s water supply planning utilizes least cost optimization of future intervention schedules with limited uncertainty consideration. Recently, the focus of the long-term plans has shifted from solely least cost performance to robustness and resilience of the system. Identifying robust scheduling of interventions requires optimizing over a statistically representative sample of stochastic inputs which may be computationally difficult to achieve. In this study we optimize schedules using an ensemble of plausible scenarios and assess how manipulating that ensemble influences the different Pareto-approximate intervention schedules. We investigate how a major stress event’s location in time as well as the optimization problem formulation influence the Pareto-approximate schedules. A bootstrapping method that respects the non-stationary trend of climate change scenarios and ensures the even distribution of the major stress event in the scenario ensemble is proposed. Different bootstrapped hydrological scenario ensembles are assessed using many-objective scenario optimization of London’s future water supply and demand intervention scheduling. However, such a “fixed” scheduling of interventions approach does not aim to embed flexibility or adapt effectively as the future unfolds. Alternatively, making decisions based on the observations of occurred conditions could help planners who prefer adaptive planning. We will show how rules to guide the implementation of interventions based on observations may result in more flexible strategies.",

            "abstract": "The storage and flux of terrestrial carbon (C) is one of the largest and most uncertain components of the global C budget, the vast majority of which is held within the biomass of the world’s forests. However, the spatial distribution and quantification of forest C remains difficult to measure on a large scale. Remote sensing of forests with airborne LiDAR has proven to be an extremely effective method of bridging the gap between data from plot-level forestry mensuration and landscape-scale C storage estimates, but the standard method of assessing forest C is typically based on national or regional-scale allometric equations that are often not representative on the local-scale. Improvement of these measurements is necessary in order for collaborative multi-national carbon monitoring programs such as REDD implemented by the UNFCCC to be successful in areas, such as tropical forests, with tree species that have insufficiently documented allometric relationships. The primary goal of this study is to set forth a pipeline for precise non-destructive monitoring of C storage by: 1) determining C storage on 15 1/10th ha plots in a 25.6 ha Virginia temperate forest using the recently updated national allometric equations from Chojnacky et. al 2014, 2) comparing these estimates to non-destructively determined individual tree biomass using several semi-automated approaches of three-dimensionally analyzing the point cloud from a high-precision Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), and 3) creating a predictive model of forest C storage by fusing airborne LiDAR data to the plot-level TLS measurements. Our findings align with several other studies, indicating a strong relationship between allometrically-derived C estimates and TLS-derived C measurements (R2=0.93, n=30) using relatively few individuals, suggesting the potential application of these methods to species that are understudied or are without allometric relationships. Voxel based C storage was estimated on the plot level and used to develop a model of C storage on the whole-forest scale. The proposed pipeline has the potential to significantly reduce labor costs associated with destructive sampling and simplify the process of detailed C monitoring, while improving the quality and quantity of data retrieved.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable debate on the origin, age, and paleoclimatic setting of Late Quaternary deposits within the basement complex of the Sinai Peninsula. Our research in Wadi Feiran focused on documenting the sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry and chronology of Late Quaternary deposits in the Feiran (lat. 28.706 N; long. 33.665; elevation: 715 to 772 m a.m.s.l) and Tarfa (lat. 28.692 N; long. 33.933 E; elevation: 1160 to 1244 m a.m.s.l) oases. Sequence stratigraphy, analysis of remote sensed images, and groundwater levels in these two areas indicate that the investigated deposits are structurally-controlled as they are found in areas with anomalously elevated groundwater levels and upstream from shear zone/wadi intersections. Sediments are largely arenaceous upstream and transition downstream to marly successions. We infer that these sediments were not deposited in lake settings because of the absence of shorelines and associated littoral, sublittoral and deeper water facies, and the presence of rhizoliths, secondary calcite veins and gastropods, all of which suggest deposition in a spring or wetland environment. A short hydrologic residence time and/or deposition in an open water system is supported by the lack of correlation (R = 0.08) between δ18O and δ13C values in carbonate deposits. Our findings are consistent with deposition of sediments by alluvial, fluvial and paludal processes under variable hydrologic conditions and higher water table conditions. Quartz extracts from these sediments yielded optically stimulated luminescence ages between ca. 27 and 11 ka and place these wetter conditions during the last glacial period and extend the “greening” of North Africa further eastward. Our findings are consistent with models which identify the wet periods in the Late Quaternary in the Sinai Peninsula and in North Africa as being glacial periods.",

Energy crises, water shortages and food security are crucial worldwide problems. The nexus of energy, water and food has received more and more attention in the past decade. Energy, water and food are closely interrelated; water is required in energy development such as electricity generation; energy is indispensable for collecting, treating, and transporting water; both energy and water are crucial inputs for food production. Changes of either of them can lead to substantial impacts on other two resources, and vice versa. Effective decisions should be based on thorough research efforts for better understanding of their complex nexus. Rapid increase of population has significantly intensified the pressures on energy, water and food. Addressing and quantifying their interactive relationships are important for making robust and cost-effective strategies for managing the three resources simultaneously. In addition, greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted in energy, water, food production, consequently making contributions to growing climate change. Reflecting environmental impacts of GHGs is also desired (especially, on the quality and quantity of fresh water resources). Thus, a socio-economic model is developed in this study to quantitatively address the complex connections among energy, water and food production. A synthetic problem is proposed to demonstrate the model’s applicability and feasibility. Preliminary results related to integrated decisions on energy supply management, water use planning, electricity generation planning, energy facility capacity expansion, food production, and associated GHG emission control are generated for providing cost-effective supports for decision makers.",

Land ecosystems can sequester approximately one third of annual anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, dynamics of land sink is one of the key components to determine the future atmospheric CO2 concentration and accordingly surface temperature. The accuracy of predicted surface temperature will largely depend on the uncertainty of predicted land carbon uptake. Unfortunately, the uncertainties of future land sink predicted by Earth System Models (ESMs) involved in CMIP5 turned out to be very large. The spread of the land carbon uptake within a specific Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario was larger than those variation between the four scenarios. Moreover, predicted soil carbon stocks by the end of this century extended to a wide range. Quantifying the uncertainties in predicted vegetation carbon and identifying the causes for the uncertainties will help improve ESMs’ performance and give the priorities for model development. In this study, we investigated uncertainties in projections of vegetation carbon by twelve CMIP5 ESMs during the twenty-first century and explored the sources of uncertainties across the models. We found that the predicted changes of vegetation carbon by the end of this century varied quite much across the ESMs under the RCP8.5 scenario, from declining of 190 Pg C to increasing of 320 Pg C. These changes of vegetation carbon can be attributed mostly to the changes in carbon residence time, rather than net primary productivity. We further investigated model’s differences in their responses of vegetation carbon to temperature, precipitation and CO2 among the ESMs. Our results have the potential to help improve CMIP5 ESMs for more reliable predictions.",

            "abstract": "Carefully constrained studies in model landscapes demonstrate the existence of pedogenic thresholds, where small changes in external forcing lead to large changes in soil properties. One important threshold defines the relationship between water balance, the availability of nutrient cations, and soil pH. Across rainfall gradients, the loss of alkali and alkaline earth cations occurs abruptly at a critical water-balance. At this threshold, the removal of exchangeable base cations by leaching outstrips their production from weathering, causing a drop in soil pH. This leaching threshold has never been characterized at a global scale, in part because of the tremendous sampling effort required to overcome the confounding effects of rock chemistry, soil age, and topography outside of carefully constrained environmental gradients. We compile an extensive database of soil pH measurements to show that there is a mean global leaching threshold near an annual water balance of zero. Where evaporative demand exceeds precipitation, soil pH is buffered near values of 8.1, but where precipitation exceeds evaporative demand, soil pH rapidly collapses to values near 5.0. Deviations from the threshold can be explained in terms of climatic variability, soil age, and rock chemistry. Regions with arid climates and acid soil pH correspond to zones of intense, periodic leaching (e.g. strongly monsoonal climates), or to highly weathered continental surfaces that have permanently lost their stock of cations (e.g. Australia). Regions with humid climates and neutral soil pH correspond to young landscapes, or to soils derived from base-rich rock (e.g. the Pacific Rim volcanic belt). These results demonstrate that the leaching threshold is a dominant feature of the Earth’s surface, with the potential to affect both natural and human-dominated ecosystems. For instance: the leaching threshold might impose a step-function on the terrestrial response to CO2 fertilization, the capacity of soils to stabilize carbon, and the effect of nitrate addition on soil pH. While these responses may manifest differently in regions that deviate from the threshold, outliers from the global pattern show how variation in climate, soil age, and rock chemistry can modify soil properties, and hence ecosystem function.",

The sole instrument onboard is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which will use a photon-counting detection method to measure range from the satellite to the Earth’s surface with green (532-nm wavelength) laser light. Combining these measurements with precise knowledge of the position and orientation of the ATLAS instrument in orbit will yield elevation measurements to ±88° latitude around the globe. In this presentation, we provide an overview of the ICESat-2 data products with a particular focus on the Global Geolocated Photon Cloud. With two redundant lasers, operated one at a time, ATLAS sends laser pulses toward the Earth 10,000 times per second, and the outgoing beam is split into three pairs of two beams, to increase spatial coverage and enable determination of local surface slopes. Geolocation algorithms in the ground-based science data processing system will produce a latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal elevation for each photon that is returned to ATLAS, yielding a photon point cloud. These data will incorporate a suite of geophysical corrections, and the product will also provide a coarse surface classification (land ice, sea ice, ocean, land, inland water), along with initial signal-vs-noise discrimination. While higher-level, surface-specific science data products will provide the most precise estimates of surface elevation by aggregating the geolocated photons to reduce noise, we expect that this lower-level data product – which provides most of the inputs to the higher-level products – will be of interest to the general community.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigated changes in the precipitation characteristics for China from 1960 to 2012 based on a recent daily precipitation dataset of 666 climate stations and robust non-parametric trend detection techniques. We divided all precipitation events into four non-overlapping categories: light, moderate, heavy and very heavy based on percentile thresholds. We then established the trends for annual total and precipitation of different intensity categories, and examined their regional and seasonal variations. The results show that there was little change in annual total precipitation for entire China, but distinctive regional patterns existed. In general precipitation increased in the west and decreased in east. Precipitation of different intensities in general changed in the same direction as the mean, but heavy and very heavy precipitation events in general had higher rates of change than mean precipitation. The exception was the southeast region, where despite the slight decrease in mean precipitation, heavy and very heavy precipitation still increased significantly. In addition, we used multiple regression models to explore the contribution of changes of frequency and intensity to total precipitation change, and the contributions of changes of precipitation at different intensities to total precipitation change. For western China, total precipitation change was associated more with frequency change, whereas in eastern China intensity contributed more. For precipitation amount, moderate, heavy and very heavy precipitation all contributed to the total change, with little contribution from light precipitation change. For frequency, changes in light and moderate precipitation frequency dominated the total change, with very little contributions from heavy and very heavy precipitation frequency change. In addition, we examined the linkage between summer precipitation in eastern China and the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), found that the northern decrease and southern increase in summer precipitation was likely caused by the weakening of EASM over the study period.",

            "abstract": "For much of the first 20 years of Kīlauea’s 1983–present Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō eruption, deformation was characterized by subsidence at the volcano's summit and along both the East Rift Zone (ERZ) and Southwest Rift Zone (SWRZ). At the end of 2003, however, Kīlauea’s summit began a 4-year period of inflation due to a surge in magma supply to the volcano. In 2006, the SWRZ also experienced atypical inflation, which was last observed in 1981-82 during a series of dike intrusions. To investigate the active magma sources and their interactions with faulting in the SWRZ during 2006, we integrate contemporary geodetic data from InSAR and GPS with double-couple fault-plane solutions for volcano-tectonic earthquakes and Coulomb stress modeling. According to the rate of deformation measured in daily GPS data, two distinct periods can be defined, spanning January to 15 March 2006 (period 1) and 16 March to 30 September 2006 (period 2). Geodetic models suggest that, during period 1, deformation, due to pressurization of magma in a vertical prolate-spheroidal conduit, in the south caldera area. In addition, a major seismic swarm occurred in both the SWRZ and ERZ. Our preliminary results also suggest that, during period 2, magma was still overpressurizing the same prolate-spheroid but a subhorizontal sill also intruded further to the southwest in the seismic SWRZ (SSWRZ). The beginning of period 2 also corresponds to a switch from subsidence to inflation of the SWRZ. Faulting in the upper ERZ is primarily strike-slip, with no obvious change in FPS orientation between periods 1 and 2. In contrast, faulting in the upper SSWRZ occurs as dip-slip motion on near-vertical faults. SSWRZ FPS show a mix of orientations including NW- and NE-striking faults, which along with relative earthquake locations, suggest a series of right-stepping fault segments, particularly during period 2. Calculated Coulomb stress changes indicate that faulting in the upper SSWRZ may result from stresses produced by inflation of the geodetically modeled sources described above, in particular the prolate spheroid located in the south caldera area. In contrast, earthquakes in the ERZ are generally inhibited by the geodetically modeled sources, suggesting that another process may be responsible for faulting along the ERZ.",

            "abstract": "Trace element abundances in Earth's core were established during core–mantle differentiation and metal–silicate equilibration processes early in the planet's history. The core has been suggested as a possible reservoir in which the presence of nominally lithophile elements can explain the observance of non-chondritic ratios of some of these elements in surface rocks (e.g. Nb/Ta, Th/U and Mg/Si)[1-2]. Additionally, several of these elements (U, Th and K) are long-lived sources of radiogenic heat and could be important for explaining the geomagnetic field early in Earth’s history. Based on their metal–silicate partitioning behavior at near ambient conditions, it is frequently assumed that uranium and other strongly lithophile elements are present in the core at only trivial abundances. However, core formation took place at a variety of conditions, reaching pressures and temperatures well above those in which most metal–silicate partitioning measurements were obtained[3]. Here we report metal–silicate partitioning data of lithophile elements such as U and Mg, as well as partially siderophile elements Si and S, at conditions more relevant to metal segregation and core formation in a magma ocean. Laser heated diamond anvil methods were used to obtain pressures of 30-70 GPa and temperatures up to 5200 K. FIB/EM methods were used to section the recovered samples and measure the quenched metal and silicate melt compositions. We find that even strongly lithophile elements such as U and Mg partition measurably into the metal phase under extreme P-T conditions.\n",

            "abstract": "Using the ForTraCC tracking algorithm and geostationary infrared observations, our group examined the trajectories and evolution of precipitating clouds from a decade of satellite data. This analysis captured millions of storms across the globe, yielding robust statistics on evolution. While the majority of storms are short-lived and small, as a whole their movements trace out features of the global atmospheric circulation. Even on short time scales, the spatiotemporal pattern of phenomena such as the ITCZ and the midlatitude storm tracks become apparent. Like their spatial structure, the evolution of individual storm properties over their life cycle can also be aggregated over extended time periods to understand how long storms live and the mechanisms of their development, both on regional and global scales. The location and intensity of storms are predicted to shift even under conservative climate change scenarios. Thus, it is important to identify the present-day structure, statistics, and development properties of bulk atmospheric of storm clouds that contribute to the water cycle. In our presentation, we will show (1) the climatological structure, (2) statistical distributions of their properties, and (3) the life cycle characteristics of aggregated storms on regional and global scales. By utilizing long-term, multi-satellite data, we will present the most comprehensive study of satellite-based storm spatial structure and evolution.\nTo accomplish this, we take a multi-sensor approach by integrating satellite observations to gain deeper insights into how other properties evolve over the lifecycle of the storms, both globally and across specific atmospheric features. Using infrared data, we found storm properties to be non-linear across different seasons and regions, but still highly regular; building on this work, we will examine their evolution by merging observations from precipitation relevant satellites, such as Cloudsat, TRMM, and GPM. Additionally, we will show our statistical distribution model of storm properties and compare with theoretical distributions. This observation-based work will compliment existing modeling studies of the hydrological cycle and atmospheric circulation.",

            "abstract": "Ice shelves fringe ~75% of Antarctica’s coastline, nourished by numerous terrestrial glacier systems. The ice-shelf disintegrations in recent decades and the observed thinning trends have revealed their susceptibility to the atmospheric and oceanic changes in the climate warming context. The buttressing effect of an ice shelf constrains the ice discharge of its upstream land ice, thus regulating the contribution to sea level of the terrestrial glaciers. The important role of ice shelves in stabilizing the upstream glacier flow dynamics is emphasized by the rapid accelerations and thinning of the tributary glaciers in response to the collapses of the northern Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctic Peninsula. However, this buttressing effect is determined by the stress balance conditions of an ice shelf, which is further affected by the ice-shelf geometric configurations. The ice shelves confined by fjords, islands, promontories or seabed topographic highs exert greater buttressing effects than those less confined by the lateral or basal shear stresses. This research aims to assess the influences of different ice-shelf configurations on upstream flow dynamics in response to large ice-shelf retreat events. By using remotely sensed imagery acquired by multiple satellite missions, we derived the time series surface velocity records for the Larsen B glacier-ice shelf system in Antarctic Peninsula during 1995 – 2015 and for the Mertz glacier-ice shelf system in East Antarctica during 1997 – 2015, respectively. The former was well confined in the embayment, while the latter is unconfined by lateral margins. We compared the different temporal variation patterns in flow dynamics between these two sites before and after their large retreating events, i.e. the collapse event of Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 and the large calving event of Mertz Ice Shelf in 2010. The surface velocity profiles reveal the less sensitivity of upstream responses to the front retreat for the Mertz Ice Shelf.",

            "abstract": "With the growth in computing power over the last 30 years, earth system modeling codes have become increasingly data-intensive. As an example, it is expected that the data required for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR6) will increase by more than 10x to an expected 25PB per climate model. Faced with this daunting challenge, developers of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) have chosen to change the format of their data for long-term storage from time-slice to time-series, in order to reduce the required download bandwidth needed for later analysis and post-processing by climate scientists. Hence, efficient tools are required to (1) perform the transformation of the data from time-slice to time-series format and to (2) compute climatology statistics, needed for many diagnostic computations, on the resulting time-series data. To address the first of these two challenges, we have developed a parallel Python tool for converting time-slice model output to time-series format. To address the second of these challenges, we have developed a parallel Python tool to perform fast time-averaging of time-series data. These tools are designed to be light-weight, be easy to install, have very few dependencies, and can be easily inserted into the Earth system modeling workflow with negligible disruption. In this work, we present the motivation, approach, and testing results of these two light-weight parallel Python tools, as well as our plans for future research and development.",

            "abstract": "Vertical profiles of mean flow and turbulence statistics have been already studied over several vegetation types, leading to a thorough characterization of turbulent field properties within and above the canopy space in spite of high complexity of the processes. However, only few studies investigated the influence of slow canopy seasonal structural changes on turbulent flow, and the few available datasets are usually limited to measurements before and after foliage growth. Seasonal variations of foliage density play a crucial role increasing canopy roughness and, consequently, determining the degree of coupling between vegetation and the atmosphere. Therefore, the study of turbulent transport processes along with a regular monitoring of foliage growth are required both to parameterize higher order closure models and to improve the prediction of bulk aerodynamic properties during the canopy developing period.\nThe aim of this study was to follow the continuous evolution of turbulent statistics from budbreak to fully developed foliage in a hedgerow vineyard in the North East of Italy. Synchronous measurements from a vertical profile of five sonic anemometers on a 5 m tower have been collected at 20 Hz from beginning of April to mid of July 2015. In the same period, detailed measurements of Leaf Area Density (LAD) profile and canopy architecture were performed at regular intervals (ca. weekly) around the tower. Mean flow, scaled turbulence statistics (σw/u*, σu/u*) profiles and turbulent kinetic energy budget correlate with canopy development and determine the degree of coupling between lower atmosphere and the canopy space. Peculiar geometrical structure of the hedgerow vineyard also imposes a strong directional behaviour of mean flow inside the canopy.\nThe knowledge of the evolution of turbulent flow around growing canopies is necessary to fully understand and model mass and energy exchanges of natural and managed vegetation.",

            "abstract": "We examine the regional water cycle in Iowa during the IFloodS campaign period, April-June 2013. The period had exceptionally large rainfall accumulations and rainfall was distributed over an unusually large number of storm days. We utilize high-resolution radar rainfall fields; precipitable water from a network of GPS measurements; vertically-integrated water vapor flux derived from GPS precipitable water, WSR-88D VAD wind profiles, and radiosonde humidity profiles. We show that heavy rainfall is relatively weakly correlated to precipitable water and precipitable water change, with a somewhat stronger correlation to differential water vapor flux in the north-south direction. Thermodynamic properties tied to the vertical distribution of water vapor play an important role in determining heavy rainfall distribution, especially for periods of strong southerly water vapor flux. We examine interrelationships among southerly water vapor flux, low-level jet frequency and rainfall accumulations. It is found that the magnitude of southerly water vapor flux is considerably higher in wet years and lower in dry years. The low-level jet frequency, however, does not exhibit strong interannual variability; the frequency and diurnal cycle are similar for wet and dry years. The finding from the IFloodS period that the relative humidity in the lower atmosphere plays an important role in rainfall amount under strong southerly water vapor flux conditions is consistent with that from a multi-year analysis.",

The majority of these parks were established in order to help preserve our natural heritage, including wildlife, forests, and the beauty of landscapes formed from thousands of years of geologic/geomorphologic processes. Whilst being able to enjoy the tranquility of nature, tourists are being robbed of a more in-depth experience as a result of the lack of a geologic background. One such location that attracts a large number of summer tourists is the perimeter trail in Ouray, Colorado. Located in the Southwestern portion of Colorado, Ouray is situated in the beautiful San Juan Mountain range along the “Million Dollar Highway.”\nThe Perimeter trail is a six-mile trail loop that circles the city of Ouray. The city is a very popular place for summertime tourism because of its unparalleled scenery. Ouray is situated in an area that is riddled with textbook angular unconformities, metasedimentary, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks. In the study area, The San Juans have been beautifully sculpted by an array of major faulting events, glacial activity and volcanics.\nWith the understanding that technology is ever expanding, we think there is no better way to experience the Perimeter Trail than to have an interactive application that will be both educational as well as interesting. This application is a non-technical way of looking at the geology and geomorphology of the perimeter trail. Additionally, a paper brochure shows the most noteworthy points of interest. The brochure contains a brief geologic history of the San Juan Mountains accompanied with annotated photographs to illustrate the complex geology/geomorphology encountered on the trail.\nThe application is based on an interactive three-dimensional map, which can be zoomed to various scales. The app hosts a locational service that uses the phone’s GPS to communicate location of the hiker on the trail. This project developed a simple, yet effective application that will not only guide hikers along the trail, but also aid in educating the thousands of tourists that visit the area yearly.",

            "abstract": "It has recently been recognized that impact ejecta can lead not only to prompt secondary craters, but projectiles that reimpact the target body or nearby companions after an extended period, producing so-called sesquinary craters [1]. Here we examine sesquinary cratering on the moons of Mars (cf. [2] for Phobos).\nWe model the impact that formed Voltaire, the largest crater on Deimos, and explore the orbital evolution of resulting ejecta across 500 years using four-body physics and particle following. The bulk of mass transfer to Phobos occurs in the first 100 years after impact, while reaccretions of ejecta to Deimos continue out to the 104 year timescale as predicted by [3]. In the velocity range capable of reaching Phobos, 25-42% of ejecta mass reaccretes to Deimos and 12-21% impacts Phobos. Mass flux to Mars is <10%.\nThe time-averaged flux of Deimos material to Phobos can be as high as 11% of the background direct-to-Phobos impactor flux, a relatively minor contribution. However the ejecta mass reaccreted to Deimos from a Voltaire-sized impact is comparable to the expected direct-to-Deimos mass accumulated between Voltaire-size events. We find that the characteristic impact velocity of sesquinaries is an order of magnitude smaller than those of background (heliocentric) hypervelocity impactors and will likely result in different crater morphologies. A Voltaire-sized impact could feasibly resurface large parts of the moon, erasing the previous geological record. Dating the surface of Deimos may be more challenging than previously suspected. Deimos craters have been characterized as containing large amounts of fill due to sediment deposition [4]; our results suggest this fill to be sesquinary, as opposed to suborbital, in nature, which may also have implications for the smoothness of the Deimos surface.\n[1] Zahnle et al., 2008, Icarus.

            "abstract": "Current college students attended school during a decade in which many school districts banned cellphones from the classroom or even from school grounds. These students are used to being told to put away their mobile devices and concentrate on traditional classroom activities such as watching PowerPoint presentations or calculating with pencil and paper. However, due to a combination of parental security concerns and recent education research, schools are rapidly changing policy and embracing mobile devices for ubiquitous learning opportunities inside and outside of the classroom. Consequently, many of the next generation of college students will have expectations of learning via mobile technology.\nWe have developed a range of digital geology resources to aid mobile-based geoscience education at college level, including mapping on iPads and other tablets, “crowd-sourced” field projects, augmented reality-supported asynchronous field classes, 3D and 4D split-screen virtual reality tours, macroscopic and microscopic gigapixel imagery, 360° panoramas, assistive devices for inclusive field education, and game-style educational challenges. Class testing of virtual planetary tours shows modest short-term learning gains, but more work is needed to ensure long-term retention.\nMany of our resources rely on the Google Earth browser plug-in and application program interface (API). Because of security concerns, browser plug-ins in general are being phased out and the Google Earth API will not be supported in future browsers. However, a new plug-in-free API is promised by Google and an alternative open-source virtual globe called Cesium is undergoing rapid development. It already supports the main aspects of Keyhole Markup Language and has features of significant benefit to geoscience, including full support on mobile devices and sub-surface viewing and touring.\nThe research team includes: Heather Almquist, Stephen Burgin, Cinzia Cervato, Filis Coba, Chloe Constants, Gene Cooper, Mladen Dordevic, Marissa Dudek, Brandon Fitzwater, Bridget Gomez, Tyler Hansen, Paul Karabinos, Terry Pavlis, Jen Piatek, Alan Pitts, Robin Rohrback, Bill Richards, Caroline Robinson, Jeff Rollins, Jeff Ryan, Ron Schott, Kristen St. John, and Barb Tewksbury.

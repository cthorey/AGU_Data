            "abstract": "Discharge is one of the most important parameters for describing the dynamic status of glaciers. In recent years, observations from satellite sensors and in-situ stations have been combined to provide this critical data. However, over the regions with little or no in-situ data, such as Novaya Zemlya, satellite remote sensing technique becomes the only option. Without the in-situ ice thickness data, the absolute glacier discharge could not be obtained. An alternative way would be to combine the ice velocity and elevation change to estimate the discharge change.\nIn order to obtain the ice flow velocity, Landsat 7 ETM+ and SAR offset-tracking of eight L-band ALOS PALSAR data are performed for these fast-moving glaciers spanning from 2007 to 2010. Envisat RA-2 radar altimetry data are used to estimate glacier elevation changes from 2002 to 2010 using collinear method (Lee et al., RSE, 2013) over eight different locations. All of the altimetry time series reveal decreasing elevation changes until year 2007, and then increasing elevation changes. This change in trends also agrees with the mass change time series obtained from GRACE. Snow depth and temperature anomalies from ERA-interim are also examined to explain change in mass variation rates. However, since all of the Envisat altimetry stations are located upstream of the glaciers, we attempt to extrapolate Envisat-derived elevation changes along the glacier streams with an aid of ICESat altimetry that passes exactly along the glacier stream. Estimated discharge changes along the glacier stream will be compared with an existing approach using ice thickness derived from ice flow velocity.",

            "abstract": "In summer 2012 the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Project (DC3) field campaign investigated a number of severe thunderstorms over the Central U.S. and their impact on the upper tropospheric (UT) – lower stratospheric (LS) composition and chemistry. In addition, during DC3 some of the largest and most destructive wildfires in New Mexico and Colorado state history were burning, influencing the air quality in the DC3 thunderstorm inflow and outflow region. Besides three instrumented aircraft platforms measuring a variety of trace species in-situ and remotely (e.g. CO, O3, SO2, NOx, VOC, CN, and black carbon), dense networks of ground-based instruments (e.g. radar and lightning) complemented the airborne measurements. Satellite measurements (e.g. GOES, MODIS, and GOME-2) and model forecasts (e.g. WRF-Chem and FLEXPART) were used to monitor the rapid development of the thunderstorms (which frequently developed huge anvils with overshooting tops) and the spread of smoke plumes in the vicinity of the storms. In-situ probing of fresh and aged (12-24 h) anvil outflows showed injection of lightning-produced NOx and wildfire emissions into the UTLS. Vertical cross sections of lidar and Doppler radar measurements supported these observations and gave detailed information on dynamical processes within and in the vicinity of the storms. Besides very strong updrafts in the storm core, surrounding downdrafts caused a direct in-mixing of O3-rich LS air masses into the boundaries of the anvil outflow. The wrapping of O3-rich LS air masses around and below the anvil outflow was also a prominent feature in several storms. The in-situ probing of the aged anvil outflow showed a pronounced influence on the UT composition and chemistry with average O3 enhancements in the range of 20-50 nmol mol-1 and evidence of new particle formation. A 10-year global climatology of H2O data from Aura-MLS confirms that the Central U.S. is a preferred region for convective injection into the LS.",

            "abstract": "Both the National Research Council Decadal Survey and the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report stressed the need for the comprehensive and innovative evaluation of climate models with the synergistic use of global satellite observations in order to improve our weather and climate simulation and prediction capabilities. The abundance of satellite observations for fundamental climate parameters and the availability of coordinated model outputs from CMIP5 for the same parameters offer a great opportunity to understand and diagnose model biases in climate models. In addition, the Obs4MIPs efforts have created several key global observational datasets that are readily usable for model evaluations. However, a model diagnostic evaluation process requires physics-based multi-variable comparisons that typically involve large-volume and heterogeneous datasets, making them both computationally- and data-intensive.\nIn response, we have developed a novel methodology to diagnose model biases in contemporary climate models and implementing the methodology as a web-service based, cloud-enabled, provenance-supported climate-model evaluation system. The evaluation system is named Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer (CMDA), which is the product of the research and technology development investments of several current and past NASA ROSES programs. The current technologies and infrastructure of CMDA are designed and selected to address several technical challenges that the Earth science modeling and model analysis community faces in evaluating and diagnosing climate models. In particular, we have three key technology components: (1) diagnostic analysis methodology; (2) web-service based, cloud-enabled technology; (3) provenance-supported technology. The diagnostic analysis methodology includes random forest feature importance ranking, conditional probability distribution function, conditional sampling, and time-lagged correlation map. We have implemented the new methodology as web services and incorporated the system into the Cloud. We have also developed a provenance management system for CMDA where CMDA service semantics modeling, service search and recommendation, and service execution history management are designed and implemented.",

            "abstract": "Iron minerals play an important role in the dynamics of nutrients and soil carbon in tropical ecosystems. Because soils often experience fluctuations between oxic and anoxic conditions (redox fluctuations) the pool of reactive Fe(III) phases is under continuous flux. The oxidation of soluble Fe(II) during oxic conditions can generate Fe(III) phase of variable crystallinity with potentially different susceptibility to Fe(III) reduction during subsequent anoxic periods. We hypothesize that the coupled rates of iron reduction and carbon mineralization will respond to differences in the frequency of redox shifts and the length of the oxic and anoxic periods (Tao(oxic) and Tao(anoxic). To test this, we subjected soil from the upper 15 cm of the Bisley watershed in the Luquillo critical zone observatory (LCZO), Puerto Rico, to five redox fluctuations scenarios. The treatments included either a fixed anoxic period of 6 d with oxic periods of 8, 24, and 72 h (3 treatments); or a fixed anoxic period of 2 d with oxic periods of 8 or 24 h (2 treatments). Results from a preliminary experiment indicated iron reduction rates increased when the oxic period was decreased below 10 h. We are completing analysis of the full dataset from the experiment above and will present Fe(II) concentrations and gas phase concentrations (CO2 emissions). Results from this experiment will further constrain the type of redox dynamics that influence soil Fe reduction and carbon mineralization.",

            "abstract": "Here, we present analysis of a new 1900-2014 rainfall record for the Greater Horn of Africa with high station density (CenTrends), and evaluate potential climate change “hot spots” in Tanzania. We identify recent (1981-2014) downward trends in Tanzanian rainfall, use CenTrends to place these in a longer historical context, and relate rainfall in these regions to decadal changes in global sea surface temperatures (SSTs). To identify areas of concern, we consider the potential food security impacts of the recent rainfall declines and also rapid population growth. Looking forward, we consider what the links to SSTs might mean for rainfall in the next several decades based on SST projections.\nIn addition to CenTrends, we use a variety of geographic data sets, including 1981-2014 rainfall from the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPSv2.0), simulated crop stress from the USGS Geospatial Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (GeoWRSI) model, NOAA Extended Reconstructed SSTs (ERSST v4), SST projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and land cover and population maps from SERVIR, WorldPOP, and CIESIN’s Gridded Population of the World.\nThe long-term CenTrends record allows us to suggest an interesting dichotomy in decadal rainfall forcing. During the March to June season, SSTs in the west Pacific appear to be driving post-1980 rainfall reductions in northern Tanzania. In the 2000s, northern Tanzania’s densely populated Pangani River, Internal Drainage, and Lake Victoria basins experienced the driest period in more than a century. During summer, negative trends in southern Tanzania appear linked to a negative SST trend in the Nino3.4 region. Since the SST trend in the west (east) Pacific appears strongly influenced by global warming (natural decadal variability), we suggest that water resources in northern Tanzania may face increasing challenges, but that this will be less the case in southern Tanzania.",

Herein, selected results are presented of the chemical and the physical properties and effects of the Manaus urban plume. The susceptibility of cloud-aerosol-precipitation interactions as well as regional air quality to present-day and future pollution in the tropics is the focus.",

            "abstract": "Dominant climatic factors controlling the lifetime peak intensity of typhoons are determined from six decades of Pacific typhoon data. We find that upper ocean temperatures in the low-latitude northwestern Pacific (LLNWP) and sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific control the seasonal average lifetime peak intensity by setting the rate and duration of typhoon intensification, respectively. An anomalously strong LLNWP upper ocean warming has favored increased intensification rates and led to unprecedentedly high average typhoon intensity during the recent global warming hiatus period, despite a reduction in intensification duration tied to the central equatorial Pacific surface cooling. Continued LLNWP upper ocean warming as predicted under a moderate (i.e., RCP 4.5) climate change scenario is expected to further increase the average typhoon intensity by an additional 14% by 2100.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring land subsidence due to coal mining is a function of several controlling factors, including: depth of the mine, stratigraphy, presence or absence of faults, thickness of mineral seam, mining method used, and hydrogeological conditions. Numerical modeling, e.g., finite element modeling (FEM), provides a comprehensive tool to simulate three-dimensional deformation at specific locations. The basis of the FEM is the representation of a body or a structure by an assemblage of subdivisions called finite elements, which requires the availability of site specific environmental and physical characteristics. The lack of availability of the necessary data leads to large uncertainties in subsidence estimates. With the use of InSAR, many of the needed controlling parameters for improving mine subsidence rate estimates can be identified. Coupling InSAR with FEM can further improve subsidence rate estimates through additional analysis yielding information on the relative importance of various controlling parameters contributing to the mine subsidence, the key mechanisms of failure associated with these parameters, and the surface expressions of these processes. In this contribution, we show that utilizing InSAR and FEM leads to an overall enhanced understanding of mine behavior, including the physical mechanisms that lead to mine subsidence through understanding the rheological behavior of the material over the mine in response to wide range of physical and environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Water at the ice-bed interface controls the rate at which Antarctica’s glaciers and ice streams flow towards the ocean, but a calibrated, quantitative link between ice flow and subglacial hydrology remains elusive, largely due to a lack of suitable observations. Active subglacial lakes, which fill and drain on sub-decadal timescales, can be indirectly observed via surface displacements. On ice streams, these lakes potentially alter ice motion by sequestering and episodically releasing up to cubic kilometers of subglacial meltwater generated in the upstream catchment. Here, we use five years (2010-2015) of continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) data on the Whillans and Mercer ice streams, West Antarctica, to observe cascading subglacial floods and their impact on ice flow. These connected events caused two years of enhanced ice flow, with episodic velocity fluctuations of nearly 4% correlated to lake drainage evolution, and an eleven-month disruption of the tidally-paced stick-slip cycle that dominates regional ice motion. Our continuous, long-term observations allow assessment of inherent dynamic ice-stream variability and indicate that episodic processes may bias typical campaign-style observations. Unbiased observations of coupled subglacial-glacial dynamics are fundamental for understanding past and future ice sheet evolution as subglacial hydrological processes likely control large-scale oscillations of ice-stream motion.",

            "abstract": "How the solar corona is heated to temperatures of over 1 MK, while the photosphere below is only ~ 6000 K remains one of the outstanding problems in all of space science. Solving this problem is crucial for understanding Sun-Earth connections, and will provide new insight into universal processes such as magnetic reconnection and wave-particle interactions. We use a systematic technique to analyze the properties of coronal heating throughout the solar corona using data taken with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our technique computes cooling times of the coronal plasma on a pixel-by-pixel basis and has the advantage that it analyzes all of the coronal emission, including the diffuse emission surrounding distinguishable coronal features. We have already applied this technique to 15 different active regions, and find clear evidence for dynamic heating and cooling cycles that are consistent with the 'impulsive nanoflare' scenario. What about the rest of the Solar corona? Whether the quiet Sun is heated in a similar or distinct manner from active regions is a matter of great debate. Here we apply our coronal heating analysis technique to quiet Sun locations. We find areas of quiet Sun locations that also undergo dynamic heating and cooling cycles, consistent with impulsive nanoflares. However, there are important characteristics that are distinct from those of active regions.",

Mineralogy and radiogenic isotope chemistry using strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) have been able to constrain sources of dust but are not sufficient to distinguish among important potential source areas in the Southern Hemisphere. The K/Ar isotope system can improve our ability to infer dust provenance because it can discriminate between sources that have similar crustal residence ages but different subsequent tectonothermal histories. To assess K/Ar ages as a provenance tool, we measured radiogenic argon concentrations of samples from potential dust sources such as glaciogenic sediments in Patagonia and New Zealand. Provenance ages from Patagonian sediments cluster around 70 Ma with a range from 33.2 ± 0.4 Ma to 120 ± 3 Ma, and those from New Zealand sediments cluster around 160 Ma with a range from 125 ± 1 Ma to 191 ± 2 Ma, showing that K/Ar geochronology can discriminate between these two source areas and improve upon previous provenance studies.\nIn addition, as a proof of concept we made a case study of a sedimentary time series from core TN057-6 on the Agulhas Ridge in the southeast Atlantic Ocean as well as a set of Holocene and glacial samples from four cores along the SE African margin. We found that K/Ar provenance ages of the <5μm terrigenous material from TN057-6 are best explained as the result of mixing of sediments transported from Patagonia and Africa-derived sediments delivered by the Agulhas Current. The K/Ar method was also able to show different sediment provenance between glacial and interglacial times, with a dominant Patagonian signature during glacial intervals. Ongoing work aims to characterize additional Southern Hemisphere dust sources, including the ice-free regions of Antarctica, and apply the K/Ar provenance tool to dust in Antarctic ice cores.",

            "abstract": "Interactions between precipitation and forest canopy elements (bark, leaves, and epiphytes) control the quantity, spatiotemporal patterning, and the chemical concentration, character and constituency of precipitation to soils. Canopy epiphytes are an element that exerts a range of storm-related hydrological and biogeochemical effects due to their diversity of morphological traits and nutrient acquisition mechanisms. We reviewed and evaluated the state of knowledge regarding epiphyte interactions with precipitation partitioning (into interception loss, throughfall, and stemflow) and the chemical alteration of net precipitation fluxes (throughfall and stemflow). As epiphyte species are quite diverse, this review categorized findings by common paraphyletic groups: lichens, bryophytes, and vascular epiphytes. Of these groups, vascular epiphytes have received the least attention and lichens the most. In general, epiphytes decrease throughfall and stemflow and increase interception loss. Epiphytes alter the spatiotemporal pattern of throughfall and increase the overall latent heat fluxes from the canopy. Epiphytes alter biogeochemical processes by impacting the transfer of solutes through the canopy; however, the change in solute concentration varies with epiphyte type and chemical species. We discuss several important knowledge gaps across all epiphyte groups. We also explore innovative methods that currently exist to confront these knowledge gaps and past techniques applied to gain our current understanding. Future research addressing the listed deficiencies will improve our knowledge of epiphyte roles in water and biogeochemical processes coupled within forest canopies—processes crucial to supporting microbe, plant, vertebrate and invertebrate communities within individual epiphytes/epiphyte assemblages, host trees, and even the forest ecosystem as a whole.",

            "abstract": "We present here a study of the impact of one Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) upon the atmospheric vertical dynamics based on 7Be measurements in near ground air, using both numerical and conceptual. In late September 2002, an unprecedented SSW event occurred in the southern hemisphere (SH), causing changes in the tropospheric circulation, ozone depletion and weakening of the polar jet in the mesosphere. There is an observational evidence suggesting that anomalies in the stratosphere play an important role in driving tropospheric weather producing tropospheric changes that can persists for up to 60 days in NH and up to about 90 days in the SH, as observed after the 2002 SSW (Thompson et al., 2005). Radioactive environmental techniques for tracing large-scale air-mass transport have been applied in studies of atmospheric dynamics for decades and they are becoming more and more precise due to the improvement of the instrumental sensitivity and associated modeling. Temporal variations of the cosmogenic 7Be concentration in the near-surface atmosphere can provide information on the air mass dynamics, precipitation patterns, stratosphere-troposphere coupling and cosmic ray variations. The present study is based on an analysis of 7Be concentration measured in near-ground air in the city of Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil between 1987 and 2009. Using a simplified tropospheric 7Be model deposition based on a two-layer transport model, Pacini (2011) reported that the occurrence of strong downward air flux leave an imprint of the 3D motion of air masses to the near-ground air 7Be data in the studied region. In this work, we have further developed the two-layer model by adding one more layer: the lower stratosphere (LS). In normal conditions, the contribution of the LS 7Be to the near-ground isotopic variability would be very small. On the other hand, stratospheric source can be crucial for the SSW event, indicating that a strong stratospheric air intrusion happened after the SSW and induced a downward flux of stratospheric aerosols from the LS to the ground level lasting several months after the SSW peak, showing that its tropospheric consequences can be much larger than it is usually considered.",

            "abstract": "A reconstruction of the position of the North Pacific Jet Stream (NPJ) over the past 500 years is evaluated in relation to dry and wet extremes in California and extremes of Sierra Nevada fire activity. This work represents a unique combination of independent annually-resolved paleoclimate and paleoecological reconstructions in the region. Results indicate that fire and precipitation extremes are both closely linked with NPJ winter position, with characteristic wet/low fire and dry/high fire NPJ spatial features in the Pacific adjacent to western North America. These features are in turn evaluated in 21st century climate model scenarios using transient integrations over the past millennium, the instrumental period, and the 21st century. The reconstruction of NPJ position is driven by an analog process that employs independent paleoclimate field reconstructions to select model states closest to the reconstructions; it is thus logically and scientifically most consistent to use comparable models to evaluate the future in relation to the past. Initial results indicate that relatively wet/low fire regional conditions are reasonably possible in the later 21st century under a high greenhouse gas forcing regime (RCP 8.5), even though temperatures rise significantly. Related hydroclimate research reconstructs a precipitation index for the Hawai'ian Islands (HI-precip) over the past 500 years. A northeastern Pacific sea level pressure index reconstructed using the analog process is employed as the driving variable in a calibration against HI-precip. Initial reconstruction results indicate significant bicentennial spectral power, which includes a long-term drying trend that began around 1850 and continues into the first decades of the 21st century. Related statistical downscaling of climate model output for HI-precip to the end of the 21st century suggests the possibility of continued drying under RCP 8.5.",

This can be seen in coronal x-ray emission of sunspot active regions, as those are notably brighter than the rest of the corona. Fisher et al, using the Yohkoh Soft X-Ray Telescope (SXT) found a linear relationship between luminosity and total unsigned magnetic flux (neither positive or negative). However, for some active regions of the same magnetic flux, luminosity varied by up to an order of magnitude. In this study using Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), we examined active regions of the same magnetic flux to compare the luminosity and a variety of other parameters. We compared luminosity with area, total unsigned flux, total vertical electric current, new vertical current, area-average twist, net-vertical-current twist, age, Differential Emission Measure (DEM), and length of neutral line in magnetic field to determine the source of the variation in luminosity found by Fisher. We found that spatially averaged signed shear angle and magnetic area are highly correlated and may require further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Accurate grouping of meteorites that represent specific planetary bodies is paramount to understanding early planetary processes, such as accretion and differentiation. Most iron meteorite groups represent the cores of differentiated planetesimals, and therefore hold insights into the timing and mechanisms of core formation and crystallization. Molybdenum isotopic compositions have been shown to vary between meteorite groups due to nucleosynthetic heterogeneities, and, thus, can be used as a genetic tracer [1]. Where isotopic differences can be resolved among iron meteorites purported to be from the same group, it is possible to reject genetic linkages. However, implicit in the use of Mo as a genetic tracer is the assumption of intra-group homogeneity, which does not hold true for Os isotopes, for example [2]. High neutron fluence due to cosmic ray exposure (CRE) has been shown to modify Os isotopic compositions [2]. We report deviations of 95Mo, normalized to 98Mo/96Mo to correct for instrumental mass bias, between iron meteorites of the same group. For instance, in group IVB, Tlacotepec has a 95Mo/96Mo ratio that is ~30 ppm lower than that of most other IVB iron meteorites. Molybdenum-95 is correlated with 189Os and 190Os in each of the three iron meteorite groups examined here, indicating that Mo isotopes are also modified by CRE. Because 95Mo has the largest neutron capture cross section and resonance integral of the Mo isotopes, the likely nuclear reaction is: 95Mo(n,γ)96Mo. The correlation between 95Mo and 189Os or 190Os can be used to correct the Mo isotopes to a pre-exposure composition, as has been done for W isotopes [e.g., 3]. The pre-exposure 95Mo for the IAB complex, IVB, and IIIAB iron meteorite groups is calculated as the y-intercept of each of the slopes defined by the correlation of 95Mo with 189Os.

We present the impacts of anthropogenic perturbations in the form of sulfur dioxide on the oxidation systems of α- and β-pinene. An oxidative flow reactor simulated atmospheric aging by OH oxidation on the order of days, and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-CIMS) was utilized to identify gas-phase oxidation products and changes to the ensemble system as a function of the SO2 perturbation. Results show that the SO2 perturbation impacted the oxidation systems of α- and β-pinene, and that these perturbations affected the oxidation systems of α- and β-pinene differently. Bulk analysis comparing the perturbed system to the unperturbed system indicated a change in oxidation pathway or mechanism leading to an ensemble of products with a lesser degree of oxygenation, on the order of a 30% decrease in the bulk oxidation state and a 10% decrease in the bulk O:C ratio for both BVOC systems. Increasing the relative humidity in the oxidative flow reactor was found to dampen the impact of the perturbation. Experiments involving other anthropogenic emissions, such as NOx, as well as other pairs of BVOC structural isomers, were conducted to investigate if changes in the oxidation system were due to the BVOC structure or the specific anthropogenic pollutant.",

In an asymmetric configuration, it is unclear if there is a simple principle to determine the orientation of the x-line. The close deployment of MMS spacecraft cluster and the equipped capability of high-time resolution provide an invaluable chance to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of reconnection diffusion region [Denton et al. J. Geophys. Res. 117, A09201 (2012)], and maybe to accurately deduce the x-line orientation at Earth's magnetopause. In parallel to this observational effort, this work contains the theoretical foundation and prediction. We used three- and two- dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations to study this fundamental problem. A spatially localized perturbation is employed to induce a single x-line, that has sufficient freedom to choose its orientation in three-dimensional systems. The effect of ion to electron mass ratio is investigated, and the x-line appears to bisect the magnetic shear angle across the current sheet in the large mass ratio limit. The deviation from the bisection angle in the lower mass ratio limit can be explained by the physics of tearing instability [JGR, accepted. arXiv:1504.03300]. The local physics control of the x-line orientation studied in this slab geometry could potentially interplay with global geometrical effects to determine the location of reconnection at Earth's magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage into geological formations has significant potential for mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. An increasing emphasis on the commercialization and implementation of this approach to store CO2 has led to the investigation of the physical processes involved and to the development of system-wide mathematical models for the evaluation of potential geologic storage sites and the risk associated with them. The sub-system components under investigation include the storage reservoir, caprock seals, and the above zone monitoring interval, or AZMI, to name a few. Diffusive leakage of CO2 through the caprock seal to overlying formations may occur due to its intrinsic permeability and/or the presence of natural/induced fractures. This results in a potential risk to environmental receptors such as underground sources of drinking water. In some instances, leaking CO2 also has the potential to reach the ground surface and result in atmospheric impacts. In this work, fluid (i.e., CO2 and brine) flow above the caprock, in the region designated as the AZMI, is modeled for a leakage event of a typical geologic storage system with different possible boundary scenarios. An analytical and approximate solution for radial migration of fluids in the AZMI with continuous inflow of fluids from the reservoir through the caprock has been developed. In its present form, the AZMI model predicts the spatial changes in pressure – gas saturations over time in a layer immediately above the caprock. The modeling is performed for a benchmark case and the data-driven approach of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) Expansion is used to quantify the uncertainty of the model outputs based on the uncertainty of model input parameters such as porosity, permeability, formation thickness, and residual brine saturation. The recently developed aPC approach performs stochastic model reduction and approximates the models by a polynomial-based response surface. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis was performed with Sobol indices based on the aPC technique to determine the relative importance of these input parameters on the model output space.",

            "abstract": "Both primary magmatism and metamorphism of ophiolite sequences are difficult to date, due in large part to the fact that the majority of lithologies present tend to contain very low concentrations of radioactive elements. As a result, researchers are often forced to process large amounts of material to search for accessory phases like zircons in gabbro, or to employ geochronometers that often yield multiply interpretable results (e.g., 40Ar/39Ar glaucophane or phengite), or to rely on indirect evidence for inferring ages. Here, we introduce two new options for chronometery of metamorphosed ophiolites: 40Ar/39Ar neptunite and 232Th/208Pb joaquinite. The best known locality for these rare minerals is the New Idria serpentinite diapir, found within the southern Diablo Range of the Coast Range Province of California. Here, both the joaquinite and neptunite chronometers record indistinguishable dates that we interpret to be the crystallization age of the phases during diapir ascent, based on the demonstrated low temperature history of the diapir as whole and the agreement of dates from chromonometers that almost certainly have different closure temperatures. This age is generally inferred to be coincident with the timing of the passage of the Mendocino Triple Junction and associated initiation of the San Andreas fault in this area. We propose that the mean40Ar/39Ar neptunite plateau date of 12.375 ± 0.082 Ma and corroborating 232Th/208Pb joaquinite date (12.08 ± 0.59 Ma) may represent a high-precision constraint on the timing of this event. We also report a second application of these chronometers to samples from the Yarlung suture, which formed at the time of initial India-Eurasia collision in southern Tibet. Here, both chronometers record indistinguishable dates of ca. 52 Ma, which we also interpret as the crystallization age. This age is consistent with most previously published estimates for the timing of the India-Eurasia collision.",

            "abstract": "Although the large-scale tectonic features of the Himalayan wedge are now thought to be understood, e.g. spatio-temporal distribution of deformation across the orogen is still unknown. For instance, it has been favored that crustal shortening dominantly accommodates along the toe of the wedge and that the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) forms the direct surface expression of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). The oblique convergence of NW-Himalaya, provides a unique opportunity to detect important differences in deformation patter compared to the arc-perpendicular convergence in Nepal and further east.\nThe following observation provide a key for understanding the location of the main decoupling horizon and where strain is accommodated between the under thrusting India and the Himalayan wedge.\n(a) In the NW-Himalaya segments of the MFT grow arc-parallel in contrast to the strongly undulating trend of the MBT resulting in a strongly curved topographic front.\n(b) Majority of Holocene shorting is accommodated along the out-of-sequence thrust, e.g. Jwalamukhi-Thrust, that is located in the center of the Sub-Himalaya and probably only minor parts of the total shortening is accommodated along the MFT.\n(c) We observed top-to-west thrust ramps that are uplifting early tertiary Subathu and Dhramsala formation within the footwall of the here north-south trending segment of the MBT. This pattern of deformation strongly suggest that the Sub-Himalaya is more strongly connected and effected by the under-thrusting of India rather than triggered by deformation of the Himalayan Wedge, behaving here as regit indentor.\n(d) Low temperature thermochronology transects across the Dhauladar Rangeindicate continuous uplift and fault displacement with rates in the range of 1-2 mm/yr along the MBT-fault zone hanging wall since the late Miocene. In summary these deformation pattern demonstrates that MBT and MFT developed independently from each other and that deformation within Sub-Himalaya is decoupled from growth of Himalayan wedge. Therefore we would suggest that rather the MBT is directly linked with the MHT forming the main decoupling horizon rather than the MFT, as it is usually proposed.",

            "abstract": "Alteration of olivine-bearing rocks by fluids is one of the most pervasive geochemical processes on the surface of the Earth. Serpentinized and/or carbonated ultramafic rocks often exhibit characteristic textures on many scales, from polygonal mesh textures on the grain-scale to onion-skin or kernel patterns on the outcrop scale. Strong disequilibrium between pristine ultramafic rocks and common geological fluids such as water and carbon dioxide leads to rapid reactions and coupled mechanical and chemical feedbacks that manifest as characteristic textures. Textural evolution during metasomatic reactions can control effective reaction rates by modulating dynamic porosity and therefore reactant supply and reactive surface area. We run hydrostatic experiments on thermally cracked dunites saturated with carbon dioxide bearing brine at 15 MPa confining pressure and 150°C to explore the evolution of physical properties and reaction textures as carbon mineralization takes place in the sample. Compaction and permeability reduction are observed throughout experiments. Rates of porosity and permeability changes are sensitive to pore fluid chemistry. After reaction, samples are imaged in 3-dimension (3D) using a dual-beam FIB-SEM. Analysis of the high resolution 3D microstructure shows that permeable, highly porous domains are created by olivine dissolution at a characteristic distance from pre-existing crack surfaces while precipitation of secondary minerals such as serpentine and magnesite is limited largely to the primary void space. The porous dissolution channels provide an avenue for fluid ingress, allow reactions to continue and could lead to progressive hierarchical fracturing. Initial modeling of the system indicates that this texture is the result of coupling between dissolution-precipitation reactions and the local stress state of the sample.",

            "abstract": "The prediction skill of tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) Reforecast Version-2 is evaluated. The GEFS captures the seasonality of TC genesis (TCG) reasonably well over the Atlantic. The performance of the model varies over different basins, and quantitative errors are found in the spatial distribution of TCGs. The biases in TC tracks are largely attributed to the biases in the TCG and the the large-scale steering flows. Analyzing the genesis potential index (GPI) shows that the biases in the monsoon trough and subtropical high induce the TC biases in the western North Pacific, while the southward displacement of the ITCZ leads to errors in TCG over the eastern North Pacific. The over-prediction of TCGs near the West African coast is associated with the hyperactive tropical easterly waves over the African continent. The diabatic heating rate (Q1) field in the GEFS forecasts suggests a much deeper and stronger convection than in the ERA-Interim, which can be attributed to the deficiency of model cumulus scheme. The study suggests that the better prediction of the large-scale circulation and synoptic-scale waves can help improve the TC forecasts.",

We implement two size bin distributions: 1) a 4-bin approach, where each bin is delimited using an isolog approach and every size group has equal ranges in logarithmic scale according to the diameter of the dust particles, and 2) a 12-bin approach with each bin defined according to an isogradient method, where the size ranges are dependent on the dry deposition velocity of dust particles. Increasing the number of the transported dust size bin improves the representation of the physical properties of dust particles that belong on the same group. Thus, more size bins minimize the error and improve the simulation of atmospheric processes. The emission, deposition and transport of dust are evaluated combined for each experiment to determine the impact of dust size bin partition. The radiative effects of dust over the area are also discussed and evaluated with the CALIPSO Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) pure dust product.

As the moon gradually covers different heights of chromosphere and corona, the time lapse spectra would provide high hight-resolution information about the line formation starting at very close proximity to the solar limb. The flash spectrum will be recored with a slit-less spectrograph consisting of a transmission grating of 300 lines/mm, blazed at 5000 Å, and an 135 mm f/3.5 telephoto lens. Based on earlier such instruments, the system’s efficiency is expected to be about 60% at 5303 Å (Fe XIV emission line) and 20% at 6374 Å (Fe X emission line) (Voulgaris, 2010). We shall place the grating before the telephoto lens on a wedge shaped. The full range of the visible spectrum, from 3900 Å to 6700 Å will be projected on the CCD sensor of the digital camera. The resolution of the spectrograph is expected to be 0.5 Å/pixel at 5215 Å. The diameter of the Sun would corresponded to 275 pixels or 6.87′′/pixel. By turning the grating, the direction of the ruling shall be set parallel to the direction of the last visible elongated crescent of the Sun; which will play the role of the “slit” in the slitless spectrograph. The spectrograph will be mounted on a solar tracker to observe the sun during TSE.",

            "abstract": "Sonic anemometers are the principal instruments used in micrometeorological studies of turbulence and ecosystem fluxes. Recent studies have shown the most common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer and structural shadowing; there is no consensus describing a true correction. We introduce a novel Bayesian analysis with the potential to resolve the three-dimensional (3-D) correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted simultaneously vertical and horizontal. The analysis creates a geodesic grid around the sonic anemometer, defines a state variable for the 3-D correction at each point, and assigns each a prior distribution based on literature with ±10% uncertainty. We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to update and apply the 3-D correction to a dataset of 20-Hz sonic anemometer measurements, calculate five-minute standard deviations of the Cartesian wind components, and compare these statistics between vertical and horizontal anemometers. We present preliminary analysis of the CSAT3 anemometer using 642 grid points (±4.5° resolution) from 423 five-minute periods (8,964,000 samples) collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013. The 20-Hz data was not equally distributed around the grid; half of the samples occurred in just 8% of the grid points. For populous grid points (weighted by the abundance of samples) the average correction increased from prior to posterior (+5.4±10.0% to +9.1±9.5%) while for desolate grid points (weighted by the sparseness of samples) there was minimal change (+6.4±10.0% versus +6.6±9.8%), demonstrating that with a sufficient number of samples the model can determine the true correction is ~67% higher than proposed in recent literature. Future adaptions will increase the grid resolution and sample size to reduce the uncertainty in the posterior distributions and more precisely quantify the 3-D correction.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the timing and magnitude of shallow groundwater recharge is critical for determining water balance and analyzing aquifer sensitivity for water resource planning. We analyzed data from six hydrometeorological monitoring stations using HYDRUS 1D to achieve physically based estimates of water-table recharge in various glaciated terrains in Indiana (USA). The models simulated runoff, root-water uptake, and flow through heterogeneous soil profiles to quantify water flux at the water table. Calibration by inverse modeling of data collected in 2013 yielded optimized hydraulic parameters that allowed accurate simulation of observed soil moisture (root mean square error was generally within 3%). The model validation period confirmed accurate simulation of soil moisture as well as correspondence between modeled recharge and observed water-table fluctuations. Additional modelling over a three-year study period indicated that diffuse water-table recharge in the region can be reasonably approximated as 35% of precipitation, but interannual and monthly variability can be significant depending on the glacial setting and pedological development. Soil parent material and horizon characteristics have a strong influence on average annual recharge primarily through their control on Ks, with clay-rich till parent materials producing values as low as 16% and coarse-grained outwash parent materials producing values as high as 58% of precipitation. The combined modelling and monitoring data reveal distinct seasonality of recharge, with most recharge occurring in the winter (seasonal mean of all sites was 66% of precipitation) and lesser but interannually stable amounts in the spring (44%), summer (13%), and autumn (16%). This ongoing research underscores the value of combining vadose zone characterization with hydrometeorological monitoring to more effectively represent how surface energy and moisture budgets influence the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of atmospheric parameters at ground level are fundamentally essential for hazard warning, meteorological forecasting and for various applications in agriculture, hydrology, transportation and more. The accuracy of existing instruments, however, is often limited as a result of technical and practical constraints. Existing technologies such as satellite systems cover large areas but may experience lack of precision at near surface level. On the other hand, ground based in-situ sensors often suffer from low spatial representativity. In addition, these conventional monitoring instruments are costly to implement and maintain.\nAt frequencies of tens of GHz, various atmospheric hydrometeors affect microwave beams, causing perturbations to radio signals. Consequently, commercial wireless links that constitute the infrastructure for data transport between cellular base stations can be considered as a built in environmental monitoring facility (Messer et al., Science, 2006). These microwave links are widely deployed worldwide at surface level altitudes and can provide measurements of various atmospheric phenomena. The implementation costs are minimal since the infrastructure is already situated in the field. This technique has been shown to be applicable for 2D rainfall monitoring (e.g. Overeem et al., PNAS, 2013; Liberman et al., AMT, 2014) and potentially for water vapor observations (David et al., ACP, 2009; Chwala et al., Atmos. Res., 2013). Moreover, it has been recently shown that the technology has strong potential for detection of fog and estimation of its intensity (David et al., JGR-Atmos., 2013; David et al., BAMS, 2014).\nThe research conducted to this point forms the basis for the initiation of a research project in this newly emerging field at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Cornell University.\nThe presentation will provide insights into key capabilities of the novel approach. The potential to monitor various atmospheric phenomena using current and future planned frequencies of cellular network infrastructure will be introduced.\n  ",

Numerous studies of the southern annular mode and the budget of zonal-mean momentum have sought to understand the timescales and causes of variability, as well as trends associated with climate change. This raises a question: when does taking the zonal mean give you the wrong answer?\nTo address this question we employ the CESM-Large Ensemble, a 30-member, fully coupled set of simulations, suitable for assessing both the forced response and natural variability of the climate system. We find that in DJF, 20th century trends associated with the ozone hole are uniform with longitude and height, and far exceed the natural variability of the system. In contrast, the JJA circulation and its trends have a longitudinal structure that is obscured by zonal averaging. The consequence is that a significant regional deceleration of the jet stream predicted for the coming century, presumably driven by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, is completely eliminated in the zonal mean.",

However, experimental data to verify these model predictions, especially on a global scale, are scarce. In this paper, we employ accelerometer measurements of total mass density from the GOCE satellite near 275 km during 2010-2012 to provide some observational insights into the problem. These data are filtered to isolate variability at horizontal scales in the range of 160-600 km, which we presume are mainly due to gravity waves, and which are quantified in terms of root-mean-squared (RMS) density variability. Applying linear regression analysis, distinct variations in longitude-averaged RMS values are found with respect to F10.7 (interpreted in terms of molecular dissipation of upward-propagating waves), Ap (interpreted in terms of waves sources related to magnetic activity), and seasonal-latitudinal variations (interpreted in terms of lower-atmosphere wave sources). After removal of these dependencies in the longitude-mean RMS values, the resulting residuals are analyzed to reveal latitude-longitude structures that might lead to identification of tropospheric wave sources (e.g., tropical convection, extreme topography). All of these results are analyzed in light of the aforementioned numerical model predictions.",

Ocean Tracks (\nhttp://oceantracks.org\n), which incorporates design principles based on a broad range of research findings in fields such as cognitive science, visual design, mathematics education and learning science, focuses on optimizing students’ opportunities to focus their cognitive resources on viewing and comparing data to test hypotheses, while minimizing the time spent on downloading, filtering and creating displays.\nOcean Tracks allows students to display the tracks of elephant seals, white sharks, Bluefin tuna, albatross, and drifting buoys along with sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-A, bathymetry, ocean currents, and human impacts overlays. A graphing tool allows students to dynamically display parameters associated with the track such as speed, deepest daily dive and track tortuosity (curviness). These interface features allow students to engage in investigations that mirror those currently being conducted by scientists to understand the broad-scale effects of changes in climate and other human activities on ocean ecosystems. In addition to supporting the teaching of the Ocean and Climate Literacy principles, high school curriculum modules facilitate the teaching of content, practices and cross-cutting concepts in the Framework for K-12 Science Education. Undergraduate modules currently under development support the teaching of content related to marine productivity, ocean circulation and upwelling, animal-environment interactions, ocean ecosystems, and human impacts.",

            "abstract": "As the demand of groundwater as a source of energy has increased in recent years, the Upper Carbonate Aquifer beneath the City of Winnipeg is heavily utilized for cooling and heating. Majority open loop systems discharge thermal wastewater into the aquifer and increase the groundwater temperature. A numerical model was developed to study the impact of a geothermal system with multiple wells located in the Tuxedo area on groundwater temperature. Analysis was performed using SEAWAT with GUI Visual MODFLOW. Surface elevation, model boundary and wells locations were developed using ArcGIS. The model was run in steady state flow for static water level calibration and in transient mode for calibration using data of a pumping test. Preliminary investigation with three years simulation predicts a 600 m by 660 m area of temperature increase. Groundwater temperature in production wells will increase 0.5°C within 2 years and 1°C within 3 years. Factors that influence the temperature changes and its distribution in the groundwater are production flow rate, recharge flow rate, groundwater flow, return water distribution into recharge wells, distance between production wells and recharge wells, spacing between recharge wells, and layout of geothermal pumping wells. The simulated and observed temperature increase is mainly caused by higher production rate for cooling than for heating. The result from this study will strongly contribute knowledge in the development of a 3D numerical model of the Upper Carbonate Aquifer beneath the City of Winnipeg to investigate the impact of geothermal systems to the groundwater temperature.",

            "abstract": "Two storm periods were selected by the Geospace Environment Modeling Ionospheric Outflow focus group for community collaborative study because of its high magnetospheric activity and extensive data coverage: the September 27 - October 4, 2002 corotating interaction region event and the October 22 - 29 coronal mass ejection event. During both events, the FAST, Polar, Cluster, and other missions made key observations, creating prime periods for data-model comparison. The GEM community has come together to simulate this period using many different methods in order to evaluate models, compare results, and expand our knowledge of ionospheric outflow and its effects on global dynamics. This paper presents Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) simulations of these important periods compared against observations from the Polar TIDE, Cluster CODIF and EFW instruments. Emphasis will be given to the second event. Density and velocity of oxygen and hydrogen throughout the lobes, plasma sheet, and inner magnetosphere will be the focus of these comparisons. For these simulations, the SWMF couples the multifluid version of BATS-R-US MHD to a variety of ionospheric outflow models of varying complexity. The simplest is outflow arising from constant MHD inner boundary conditions. Two first-principles-based models are also leveraged: the Polar Wind Outflow Model (PWOM), a fluid treatment of outflow dynamics, and the Generalized Polar Wind (GPW) model, which combines fluid and particle-in-cell approaches. Each model is capable of capturing a different set of energization mechanisms, yielding different outflow results. The data-model comparisons will illustrate how well each approach captures reality and which energization mechanisms are most important. Inter-model comparisons will illustrate how the different outflow specifications affect the magnetosphere. Specifically, it is found that the GPW provides increased heavy ion outflow over a broader spatial range than the alternative models, improving comparisons in some regions but degrading the agreement in others. This work will also assess our current capability to reproduce ionosphere-magnetosphere mass coupling.",

            "abstract": "The legacy approach to automated detection and determination of hypocenters is arrival time stacking algorithms. Examples of such algorithms are the associator, Binder, which has been in continuous use in many USGS-supported regional seismic networks since the 1980s and the spherical earth successor, GLASS 1.0, currently in service at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center for over 10 years. The principle short-comings of the legacy approach are 1) it can only use phase arrival times, 2) it does not adequately address the problems of extreme variations in station density worldwide, 3) it cannot incorporate multiple phase models or statistical attributes of phases with distance, and 4) it cannot incorporate noise model attributes of individual stations. Previously we introduced a theoretical framework of a new associator using a Bayesian kernel stacking approach to approximate a joint probability density function for hypocenter localization. More recently we added station- and phase-specific Bayesian constraints to the association process. GLASS 2.0 incorporates a multiplicity of earthquake related data including phase arrival times, back-azimuth and slowness information from array beamforming, arrival times from waveform cross correlation processing, and geographic constraints from real-time social media reports of ground shaking. We demonstrate its application by modeling an aftershock sequence using dozens of stations that recorded tens of thousands of earthquakes over a period of one month. We also demonstrate Glass 2.0 performance regionally and teleseismically using the globally distributed real-time monitoring system at NEIC.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence due to groundwater extraction was recently mentioned as one of the most urgent threats to sustainable development in the latest UNESCO IHP-VIII (2014–2020) strategic plan. Although advances have been made in understanding, monitoring, and predicting subsidence, the influence of differential vertical compaction, horizontal displacements, and hydrostratigraphic and structural features in groundwater systems on localized near-surface ground ruptures is still poorly understood. The nature of ground failure may range from fissuring, i.e., formation of an open crack, to faulting, i.e., differential offset of the opposite sides of the failure plane. Ground ruptures associated with differential subsidence have been reported from many alluvial basins in semiarid and arid regions, e.g. China, India, Iran, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United States. These ground ruptures strongly impact urban, industrial, and agricultural infrastructures, and affect socio-economic and cultural development. Leveraging previous collaborations, this year the UNESCO Working Group on Land Subsidence began the scientific cooperative project M3EF3 in collaboration with the UNESCO International Geosciences Programme (IGCP n.641;\nwww.igcp641.org\n) to improve understanding of the processes involved in ground rupturing associated with the exploitation of subsurface fluids, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge regarding sustainable groundwater management practices in vulnerable aquifer systems. The project is developing effective tools to help manage geologic risks associated with these types of hazards, and formulating recommendations pertaining to the sustainable use of subsurface fluid resources for urban and agricultural development in susceptible areas. The partnership between the UNESCO IHP and IGCP is ensuring that multiple scientific competencies required to optimally investigate earth fissuring and faulting caused by groundwater withdrawals are being employed.",

            "abstract": "Decision makers’ responses to local risks and expected changes to a community from circumstances like natural hazards, human developments, and demographic changes can greatly affect social and environmental outcomes in a community. Translating physical data based in disciplines like engineering and geosciences into positive outcomes for communities can be challenging and often results in conflict that appears to pit “science” against “the public.” Scientists can be reluctant to offer recommendations for action based on their work, often (and often correctly) noting that their role is not to make value judgments for a community – particularly for a community that is not their own. Conversely, decision makers can be frustrated by the lack of guidance they receive to help translate data into effective and acceptable action. The solution posed by this submission, given the goal of co-production of knowledge by scientists and decision makers to foster better community outcomes, is to involve the community directly by integrating social scientific methods that address decision making and community engagement to the scientist-decision maker interaction. Specifically, the missing dataset in many scientist-decision maker interactions is the nature of community priorities. Using scientifically valid methods to rigorously collect and characterize community priorities to help recommend tradeoffs between different outcomes indicated by the work of physical and natural scientists can bridge the gap between science and action by involving the community in the process. This submission presents early work on US preferences for different types of social and environmental outcomes designed to integrate directly with engineering and physical science frameworks like Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Impact Statements. Cardinal preference data are based on surveys of US adults using tools like the Analytical Hierarchy Process, budget allocation, and ranking.",

That is to say, many of the most intense storms did not have extreme rain rates, compared with a subset of strong storms that had more moderate 40 dBZ echo tops, but had very heavy rainfall produced in large measure by warm rain processes in the lowest several kilometers.\nWe expand the database examined by that paper in two ways. One, instead of determining the maximum rainfall rate only on a 5 X 5 km pixel scale, we search through the TRMM database for significant areas covered by rainfall rates > 20 mm/h. Two, we expand the area of analysis to the higher latitudes covered by the GPM core satellite (65 N - 65 S), although we must accept the limitation that the first 18 months of data do not represent a true “climatology” of rare events.",

            "abstract": "Stress drops, observed to be magnitude invariant, are a key characteristic used to describe natural earthquakes. Theoretical studies and lab experiments indicate that dynamic weakening, such as thermal pressurization, may be present on natural faults. At first glance, these two observations seem incompatible, since larger events may experience greater weakening and should thus have lower final stresses. We hypothesize that dynamic weakening can be reconciled with magnitude-invariant stress drops due to larger events having lower average prestress when compared to smaller events. The additional weakening would allow the final stresses to also be lower, but the stress drops may be similar.\nTo explore this hypothesis, we study long-term earthquake sequences on a rate-and-state fault segment with enhanced dynamic weakening due to thermal pressurization using a fully dynamic simulation approach. Our seismogenic segment has uniform friction properties. Our results show that such models can explain both the stress drop magnitude invariance and observationally inferred breakdown energy increase for a range of event sizes. Smaller events indeed have larger initial stresses than medium-sized events, and we get roughly constant stress drops for events spanning up to five orders of magnitude in moment. These events also have increases in breakdown energy consistent with observations. We are working toward quantifying the robustness of these findings by exploring a range of fault properties, including the efficiency of dynamic weakening. Note, however, that our largest, segment-spanning events tend to have much larger stress drops, possibly due to being contained by velocity-strengthening regions of the models rather than arresting due to insufficient prestress. An important next step is to consider models of heterogeneous faults that eliminate model-spanning events and may extend the magnitude-invariant stress drops to the largest events simulated.",

Driven by policy decisions made in the next decade, future landscape changes will also interplay with climate change, with multi-decadal effects that are currently poorly understood. While existing national and global land cover trajectories will play an important role in understanding these future impacts, they do not allow for investigation of many issues of interest to regional stakeholders, such as local zoning and suburban sprawl, the development of a regional food system, or varying rates of natural lands protection. Existing land cover trajectories also do not usually provide the detail needed as input drivers for earth system models, such as disaggregated vegetation types or harmonized time series of infrastructure management.

The LVT is designed to deform disk-shaped samples (~4 mm in diameter) in torsion at lower-crustal to upper-mantle pressure and temperature conditions. Conceptually, the LVT complements and is similar in design to the Rotational Drickamer Apparatus (RDA) (Yamakazi & Karato, 2001), which deforms smaller samples at higher pressures.\nAs part of our recent development efforts, benchmarking experiments were performed on Carrara marble. Samples were deformed in torsion at a strain rate of ~5 x 10-5 s-1 to moderate shear strains (γ ≤ 10) under lower crustal conditions (800°C, 2 GPa confining pressure). Microstructural observations from optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) show evidence for relict grain elongation and alignment; an increase in calcite twin density; and grain size reduction concurrent with recrystallized grain nucleation. Microstructural observations are comparable to data obtained from previous studies at lower pressure (e.g. Barnhoorn et al., 2004), confirming that the LVT provides reliable microstructural results.",

Key questions relate to the fact how do those anomalies set up or how does spatial and altitudinal structure evolve. In-situ registrations of electron density from the Langmuir probe onboard three Swarm satellites are used to study the spatial and temporal evolution of nighttime plasma density enhancements. The study introduces the normalized density difference index $I_{NDD}$ to provide global estimates of the phenomenon. The advantage of the index is, that it provides relative values and can be used for further comparison with external missions and exhisting ionospheric models (like IRI). With proposed index, we find signatures the Weddell Sea Anomaly and mid-latitude nighttime summer anomaly in the ionosphere. The study provides evidence that occurrence of the WSA and MSNA is not limited to the local summer conditions but tends to occur in remaining seasons. Analyzed annual trends and spatial pattern of $I_{NDD}$ suggest that observed anomalies evince similarity with the behaviour of the equatorial ionosphere.\nMulti-instrumental analysis based on the Swarm data provide better insight into the WSA phenomenon and should help to acquire full understanding of responsible processes.",

We discuss the evolution of these MIRs in the outer heliosphere and heliosheath and show the effects they have in the LISM. These effects include the production of weak shocks which affect the pitch angle distributions of galactic cosmic rays and generate plasma wave emissions. CIRs can also merge and form large structures which have similar effects in the LISM and we show the evolution of these features.",

            "abstract": "The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission is unique because it provides highly accurate column integrated estimates of terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations. Major limitations of GRACE-based TWS observations are related to their monthly temporal and coarse spatial resolution (around 330 km at the equator), and to the vertical integration of the water storage components. These challenges can be addressed through data assimilation. To date, it is still not obvious how best to assimilate GRACE-TWS observations into a land surface model, in order to improve hydrological variables, and many details have yet to be worked out. This presentation discusses specific recent features of the assimilation of gridded GRACE-TWS data into the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) Catchment land surface model to improve soil moisture and shallow groundwater estimates at the continental scale. The major recent advancements introduced by the presented work with respect to earlier systems include: 1) the assimilation of gridded GRACE-TWS data product with scaling factors that are specifically derived for data assimilation purposes only; 2) the assimilation is performed through a 3D assimilation scheme, in which reasonable spatial and temporal error standard deviations and correlations are exploited; 3) the analysis step uses an optimized calculation and application of the analysis increments; 4) a poor-man’s adaptive estimation of a spatially variable measurement error. This work shows that even if they are characterized by a coarse spatial and temporal resolution, the observed column integrated GRACE-TWS data have potential for improving our understanding of soil moisture and shallow groundwater variations.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, analysis of near-relativistic (~27 keV - 300 keV) electron events at 1 AU have highlighted two transport eff ects which require explanation. Firstly, several events feature delayed electron arrival with respect to solar radio and hard x-ray emission, and secondly, the peak-flux spectrum of electrons at 1 AU does not match the predicted spectrum from hard x-ray observations. We analyse several near-relativistic electron events observed via both RHESSI hard x-ray observations at the Sun and in-situ measurements from the Wind/3DP detector at 1 AU. Numerical simulations of electron transport outwards from the Sun are made, which take the electron injection time and peak-flux spectrum from RHESSI data, and the flux subsequently passing 1 AU is calculated. We consider the e ffects of adiabatic focusing and pitch angle di ffusion on the particle transport, and a momentum and distance dependent form of the parallel mean free path for electrons is employed. The simulated lightcurves, peak-flux spectrum, pitch angle distribution, and delay times are then compared with Wind observations. We find that, for higher energy electrons (>40 keV), the simulated flux matches well with observations, showing that stochastic pitch angle scattering is able to explain apparent delayed particle injection at the Sun. The lower energy observations, however, remain unmatched by models, which predict much more impulsive events at Earth than are observed. We also fi nd that pitch angle scattering is too weak to vary the peak-flux spectrum su\u000efficiently, thus requiring further exploration.",

            "abstract": "Arctic marine carbonate chemistry and rates of air-sea CO2 exchange are anticipated to be affected by current changes in sea-ice structure and extent, freshwater inputs, ocean circulation patterns, and the seasonality of phytoplankton blooms. This study examines how such changes will impact rates of air-sea CO2 exchange in northern Baffin Bay, Nares Strait, and the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. This complex oceanographic region includes the North Water polynya; one of the most biologically productive areas in the Arctic Ocean, and the convergence site of the warm West Greenland Current with cold exported Arctic waters. Continuous measurements of atmospheric and surface seawater CO2 (pCO2) were collected onboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen during its 2013 and 2014 summer cruises. Surface seawater pCO2 displayed considerable variability (145 – 389 ppm), but never exceeded atmospheric concentrations. Calculated CO2 fluxes ranged from 0 to -45 mmol m-2 day-1 (oceanic uptake), and were estimated using the Sweeney et al. (2007) parameterization with in-situ wind speed measurements. Ancillary measurements of chlorophyll a reveal low productivity in surface waters during mid-summer with isolated sub-surface blooms. This is likely the result of nutrient limitation within the highly stratified polar mixed layer (PML). Measurements of stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) and total alkalinity were used to estimate freshwater inputs (sea-ice melt vs. meteoric water) to the PML. These and in-situ observations of sea ice cover were used to interpret seawater pCO2 variations. Surface waters influenced by sea-ice melt exhibit lower pCO2 than those influenced by meteoric water. The results of this investigation shed light on the future role of this region as a summertime sink of atmospheric CO2.",

            "abstract": "While sea ice has continued to decline, vegetation productivity increases have declined particularly during spring in Alaska as well as many parts of the Arctic tundra. To understand the processes behind these features we investigate spring climate variations that includes temperature, circulation patterns, and snow cover to determine how these may be contributing to spring browning.\nThis study employs remotely sensed weekly 25-km sea ice concentration, weekly surface temperature, and bi-weekly NDVI from 1982 to 2014. Maximum NDVI (MaxNDVI, Maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Time Integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI), Summer Warmth Index (SWI, sum of degree months above freezing during May-August), atmospheric reanalysis data, dynamically downscaled climate data, meteorological station data, and snow water equivalent (GlobSnow, assimilated snow data set). We analyzed the data for the full period (1982-2014) and for two sub-periods (1982-1998 and 1999-2014), which were chosen based on the declining Alaska SWI since 1998.\nMaxNDVI has increased from 1982-2014 over most of the Arctic but has declined from 1999 to 2014 southwest Alaska. TI-NDVI has trends that are similar to those for MaxNDVI for the full period but display widespread declines over the 1999-2014 period. Therefore, as the MaxNDVI has continued to increase overall for the Arctic, TI-NDVI has been declining since 1999 and these declines are particularly noteworthy during spring in Alaska. Spring declines in Alaska have been linked to increased spring snow cover that can delay greenup (Bieniek et al. 2015) but recent ground observations suggest that after an initial warming and greening, late season freezing temperature are damaging the plants. The late season freezing temperature hypothesis will be explored with meteorological climate/weather data sets for Alaska tundra regions.\n",

            "abstract": "Many areas of the world (e.g. the Middle East and North Africa countries) are deficient in observation networks and hydrogeological data needed for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) design. Therefore, diagnostic analytical approaches are appropriate for feasibility studies of MAR. It was found that the common assumption of aquifer thickness uniformity often does not hold, especially in mountainous watersheds. However, the only practical result available for non-uniform aquifers was developed for well hydraulics applications (point sinks or sources) by Hantush (1962), while the recharge zones may cover large areas on the scale of kilometers, such as temporarily filled impoundments (natural and engineered reservoirs in wadis, depressions, trenches, etc.) or perennial streams accepting massive treated wastewater discharge.\nTo address these important, but overlooked MAR problems in sloping aquifers, a set of new closed-form analytical solutions for water table elevations were obtained. Interestingly, the 2D groundwater flow equation acquires the advection-dispersion equation form in these cases. The quadratures in closed-form solutions obtained by the Green’s function method converge rapidly. These models account for both shapes and orientations of sources with respect to the direction of the aquifer base gradient. Qualitatively, solutions in sloping aquifers have an important trait: the mounding is limited in time and space, unlike in aquifers with a horizontal base. Aquifers with the greater slopes have the lesser potential of waterlogging from the rising water table and different storage characteristics (height and volume of locally stored water). Computational aspects of these solutions for MAR analyses are illustrated by example utilizing regional aquifer properties near Az Zarqa River, Jordan.

            "abstract": "Forest canopy alters rainfall reaching the surface by redistributing it as throughfall. Throughfall is critical to watershed ecological variables (soil moisture, stream water discharge/chemistry, and stormflow pathways) and controlled by canopy structural interactions with meteorological conditions across temporal scales. This work introduces and applies multiple correspondence analyses (MCAs) to a range of meteorological thresholds (median intensity, median absolute deviation (MAD) of intensity, mean wind-driven droplet inclination angle, and MAD of wind speed) for an example throughfall problem: identification of interacting storm conditions corresponding to temporal concentration in relative throughfall beyond the median observation (≥73% of rain). MCA results from the example show that equalling or exceeding rain intensity thresholds (median and MAD) corresponded with temporal concentration of relative throughfall across all storms. Under these intensity conditions, two wind mechanisms produced significant correspondences: (1) high, steady wind-driven droplet inclination angles increased surface wetting; and (2) sporadic winds shook entrained droplets from surfaces. A discussion is provided showing that these example MCA findings agree well with previous work. Meteorological threshold correspondences to temporal concentration of relative throughfall at our site may be a function of heavy T. usneoides coverage. Applications of MCA within other forests may provide useful insights to how temporal throughfall dynamics are affected for drainage pathways dependent on different structures (leaves, twigs, branches, etc.).",

            "abstract": "The European Water Framework Directive (EWFD) aims to achieve a good chemical status for the groundwater bodies in Europe by the year 2015. Despite the effort to reduce the nitrate pollution from agriculture within the last two decades, there are still many groundwater aquifers that exceed nitrate concentrations above the EWFD threshold of 50 mg/l. Viticulture is seen as a major contributor of nitrate leaching and sowing of a green cover was shown to have a positive effect on lowering the nitrate loads in the upper 90 cm of the soil. However, the consequences for nitrate leaching into the subsoil were not yet tested. We analyzed the nitrate concentrations and pore water stable isotope composition to a depth of 380 cm in soil profiles under an old vineyard and a young vineyard with either soil tillage or permanent green cover in between the grapevines. The pore water stable isotopes were used to calibrate a soil physical model, which was then used to infer the age of the soil water at different depths. This way, we could relate elevated nitrate concentrations below an old vineyard to tillage processes that took place during the winter two years before the sampling. We further showed that the elevated nitrate concentration in the subsoil of a young vineyard can be related to the soil tillage prior to the planting of the new vineyard. If the soil is kept bare due to tillage, a nitrate concentration of 200 kg NO3--N/ha is found in 290 to 380 cm depth 2.5 years after the installation of the vineyard. The amount of nitrate leaching is considerably reduced due to a seeded green cover between the grapevines that takes up a high share of the mobilized nitrate reducing a potential contamination of the groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle in that they store ~45% of terrestrial C and constitute the largest component of the terrestrial land C sink. Despite the central importance of tropical forests to the global C cycle, knowledge of their ecosystem-level C cycles remains limited, hampering scientific and societal efforts to quantify C budgets across the tropics and to model tropical forest- climate interactions. A particularly important knowledge gap is how C stocks and fluxes vary over the course of tropical forest regrowth following stand-clearing disturbances. To advance understanding of pantropical patterns of the C dynamics of forest recovery, we have compiled a new database, the Tropical Forest C database (TropForC-db), which is the largest and most comprehensive database on ground-based measurements of C stocks and flows throughout the tropics and contains data on disturbance history. This database contains 3,478 records from 788 stands in 163 geographically distinct areas, making it the largest and most comprehensive database on ground-based measurements of C stocks and flows in tropical forest ecosystems. Using TropForC-db, we provide descriptive statistics on C stocks and fluxes for tropical forests subsetted by age class and, when possible, by disturbance and climate history. Furthermore, we show that the rate of biomass accumulation in regenerating tropical forests is jointly shaped by climate and disturbance history. Specifically, forest regeneration is fastest in plantations and slowest following cultivation or grazing, and its rate decreases with increasing precipitation seasonality. We expect that TropForC-db will prove useful for model evaluation and for quantifying the contribution of tropical forests to the global C cycle.",

Our detailed fieldwork across this fault shows that it is marked by a sharp contact between the Yuli forearc metasediments and the Tailuko belt marbles and schists. As the boundary is approached from the eastern Yuli belt a moderate to strong slaty cleavage becomes phyllitic, with anastomosing S-C fabrics and local boudinage of stronger quartzites, subarkoses and graywackes. These fault rocks are characterized by abundant stretched lenticular quartz veins, locally intercalated with thin elongated meta-conglomerates. Across the fault to the west are massive marbles, layered quartz mica schists, chlorite schists, and meta-chert.\nRegional Ar dating of fine fraction of white micas in these rocks yields ages of ~1 to 16 Ma (Tsao, 1996). Ar ages of biotite in mylonitic Tananao schists range from 3.0-4.1 Ma (Wang, 1998). We separated and dated very fine-grained phyllitic folia of the phyllites and phyllonites approaching the fault zone, and find ages even younger than this. Our preliminary step heating experiments show age spectra with reproducible age steps less than 1 Ma. These spectra climb to ages as old as found by others, 12 to 14 Ma, demonstrating multiple age populations. However, our separates concentrating the youngest fabric-forming micas demonstrate that recrystallization during faulting persisted to the Middle Pleistocene. Thus differential movement between these belts probably played a critical role in driving the uplift and exhumation of these rocks.",

            "abstract": "High-frequency, ordinary (O) mode electromagnetic waves incident on a magnetized plasma near the upper hybrid resonance can excite magnetic field aligned density striations associated with both turbulence and electron heating. We have used Vlasov simulations, which combine low noise and high resolution of all areas of phase space, in one spatial and two velocity dimensions to study the induced turbulence in the presence of striations near the upper hybrid resonance, where the O-mode pump is mode converted to large amplitude upper hybrid oscillations trapped in a striation. We were able to correlate the evolution of stationary electron and ion oscillations with the onset of turbulence, and the heating of electrons in the striation with large amplitude, short wavelength electron Bernstein waves. These Bernstein waves excite stochastic electron heating when the normalized gradients of their electric field exceed the electron gyroradius, breaking the drift approximation, and causing particle orbits in phase space to diverge exponentially, rapidly increasing the electron temperature by several thousand Kelvin.

However, students who begin their higher education at community colleges often face barriers to developing the skills needed for higher-level STEM careers, including basic training in mathematics, programming, analytical problem solving, and cross-disciplinary communication. As part of the Business Higher Education Forum’s Undergraduate STEM Interventions in Industry (USI2) Consortium, we are developing a summer bridge program for students in STEM fields transferring from community college to senior (4-year) colleges at the City University of New York. Our scientific research on New York City climate change resilience will serve as the foundation for the bridge program curriculum. Students will be introduced to systems thinking and improve their analytical skills through guided problem-solving exercises using the New York City Climate Change Resilience Indicators Database currently being developed by the CUNY Environmental Crossroads Initiative. Students will also be supported in conducting an introductory, independent research project using the database. The interdisciplinary nature of climate change resilience assessment will allow students to explore topics related to their STEM field of interest (i.e. engineering, chemistry, and health science), while working collaboratively across disciplines with their peers. We hope that students that participate in the bridge program will continue with their research projects through their tenure at senior colleges, further enhancing their academic training, while actively contributing to the study of urban climate change resilience. The effectiveness of this approach will be independently evaluated by NORC at the University of Chicago, as well as through internal surveying and long-term tracking of participating student cohorts.",

            "abstract": "Silicate garnets are key phases not only because of their petrological importance in thermobarometry and oxybarometry, but also due to the intriguing relationship between their structure and physico-chemical properties. Natural silicate garnets can accommodate a variety of divalent and trivalent cations in their crystal structure and form many solid solutions. While most major cations in garnet occur in only a single oxidation state (Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Si4+), iron occurs as both Fe2+ and Fe3+.\nSkiagite garnet (Fe2+3Fe3+2Si3O12) contains iron in two oxidation states and as a component in peridotitic garnet, it can be used as a redox sensor to determine mantle ƒO2 from Fe3+/∑Fe. With increasing pressure/depth the Fe3+/∑Fe ratio increases due to the higher solubility of Fe3+ in garnet, hence expanding the stability field of skiagite. At greater depth skiagite garnet is expected to accommodate an excess of Si, forming a solid solution with the iron majorite endmember (Fe4Si4O12). Studying the high-pressure behavior and redox relations of Fe-bearing silicate garnet can therefore provide important insight into the chemical composition and physical properties of the Earth’s mantle.\nSingle-crystals of skiagite-majorite solid solution were synthesized at 9.5 GPa and 1100 °C in a multianvil apparatus and found to have the composition Fe2+3(Fe2+0.234(2)Fe3+1.53(1)Si0.234(2))Si3O12. We performed a room temperature investigation of the equation of state up to 100 GPa using synchrotron single crystal XRD at ESRF, Grenoble. Fitting the data to a 3rd order BM EoS gives K0 = 166(3) GPa with K`=3.8(1) and V0 = 1606.9(8) Å3. In the pressure range between 50 and 60 GPa the overall unit cell volume drops by about 4 % and we observe a collapse of about 7 % in FeO6 octahedral volume. Synchrotron Mössbauer source spectra at ambient pressure show two doublets assigned to dodecahedral Fe2+ and octahedral Fe3+ that remain essentially unchanged up to 50 GPa. However at ~52 GPa the hyperfine parameters of Fe3+ change due to an inferred spin-pairing transition. The presentation will discuss the implications of these observations for Fe-bearing garnets in the upper mantle and transition zone.",

Discontinuities in the radar reflective interface relate to degradation of the layered mesas. This work uses the extent of the reflective interface to map the previous extent of the layered mesas, which we believe constitutes the remnants of a large ice sheet formed in the Late Amazonian.

            "abstract": "Variability of the mid latitude ionosphere and thermosphere during the 2009 and 2013 sudden stratosphere warmings (SSWs) is investigated in the present study using a combination of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations and model simulations. The simulations are performed using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) and Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (IPE) model. Both the COSMIC observations and TIME-GCM simulations reveal perturbations in the F-region peak height (hmF2) at Southern Hemisphere mid latitudes during SSW time periods. The perturbations are ~20-30 km, which corresponds to 10-20% variability in hmF2. The TIME-GCM simulations and COSMIC observations of the hmF2 variability are in overall good agreement, and the simulations can thus be used to understand the physical processes responsible for the hmF2 variability. The simulation results demonstrate that the mid lattiude hmF2 variability is primarily driven by the propagation of the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M2) into the thermosphere where it modulates the field aligned neutrals winds, which in-turn raise and lower the F-region peak height. The importance of the thermosphere neutral winds on generating the ionosphere variability at mid latitudes during SSWs is supported by IPE simulations performed both with and without the neutral wind variability. Though there are subtle differences, the consistency of the behavior between the 2009 and 2013 SSWs suggests that variability in the Southern Hemisphere mid latitude ionosphere and thermosphere is a consistent feature of the SSW impact on the upper atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem process models require detailed information on ecosystem states and canopy properties to properly simulate the fluxes of carbon (C), water and energy from the land to the atmosphere and assess the vulnerability of ecosystems to perturbations. Current models fail to adequately capture the magnitude, spatial variation, and seasonality of terrestrial C uptake and storage, leading to significant uncertainties in the size and fate of the terrestrial C sink. By and large, these parameter and process uncertainties arise from inadequate spatial and temporal representation of plant traits, vegetation structure, and functioning. With increases in computational power and changes to model architecture and approaches, it is now possible for models to leverage detailed, data rich and spatially explicit descriptions of ecosystems to inform parameter distributions and trait tradeoffs. In this regard, spectroscopy and imaging spectroscopy data have been shown to be invaluable observational datasets to capture broad-scale spatial and, eventually, temporal dynamics in important vegetation properties. We illustrate the linkage of plant traits and spectral observations to supply key data constraints for model parameterization. These constraints can come either in the form of the raw spectroscopic data (reflectance, absorbtance) or physiological traits derived from spectroscopy. In this presentation we highlight our ongoing work to build ecological scaling relationships between critical vegetation characteristics and optical properties across diverse and complex canopies, including temperate broadleaf and conifer forests, Mediterranean vegetation, Arctic systems, and agriculture. We focus on work at the leaf, stand, and landscape scales, illustrating the importance of capturing the underlying variability in a range of parameters (including vertical variation within canopies) to enable more efficient scaling of traits related to functional diversity of ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Modeling global change requires accurate representation of terrestrial carbon (C), energy and water fluxes. In particular, capturing the properties of vegetation canopies that describe the radiation regime are a key focus for global change research because the properties related to radiation utilization and penetration within plant canopies provide an important constraint on terrestrial ecosystem productivity, as well as the fluxes of water and energy from vegetation to the atmosphere. As such, optical remote sensing observations present an important, and as yet relatively untapped, source of observations that can be used to inform modeling activities. In particular, high-spectral resolution optical data at the leaf and canopy scales offers the potential for an important and direct data constraint on the parameterization and structure of the radiative transfer model (RTM) scheme within ecosystem models across diverse vegetation types, disturbance and management histories. In this presentation we highlight ongoing work to integrate optical remote sensing observations, specifically leaf and imaging spectroscopy (IS) data across a range of forest ecosystems, into complex ecosystem process models within an efficient computational assimilation framework as a means to improve the description of canopy optical properties, vegetation composition, and modeled radiation balance. Our work leverages the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn;\nhttp://www.pecanproject.org/\n) ecoinformatics toolbox together with a RTM module designed for efficient assimilation of leaf and IS observations to inform vegetation optical properties as well as associated plant traits. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the radiation balance of ecosystems will provide a better constraint on model projections of energy balance, vegetation composition, and carbon pools and fluxes thus allowing for a better diagnosis of the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems in response to global change.",

Thus it is a material of interest to investigate the high-pressure phase behavior of aragonite-group minerals. SrCO3 is a common component of natural carbonates and knowing its physical properties at high pressures is necessary to properly model the thermodynamic properties of complex carbonates, which are major crustal minerals but are also present in the deep Earth [Brenker et al., 2007] and control carbon cycling in the Earth’s mantle. The few available high-pressure studies of SrCO3 disagree regarding both pressure stability and structure of the post-aragonite phase [Lin & Liu, 1997; Ono et al., 2005; Wang et al. 2015]. To clarify such controversies we investigated the high-pressure behavior of synthetic SrCO3 by Raman spectroscopy. Using a diamond anvil cell we compressed single-crystals or powder of strontianite (synthesized at 4 GPa and 1273 K for 24h in a multi anvil apparatus), and measured Raman scattering up to 78 GPa. SrCO3 presents a complex high-pressure behavior. We observe mode softening above 20 GPa and a phase transition at 25 - 26.9 GPa, which we interpret due to the CO3 groups rotation, in agreement with Lin & Liu [1997]. The lattice modes in the high-pressure phase show dramatic changes which may indicate a change from 9-fold coordinated Sr to a 12-fold-coordination [Ono, 2007]. Our results confirm that the high-pressure phase of strontianite is compatible with Pmmn symmetry.\n",

In particular it is still unclear how cold pools can potentially die and what is the role of surface heat fluxes vs. turbulent entrainment on their life cycle and characteristics. We here investigate the role f surface heat fluxes on the life cycle and characteristics of cold pools using the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) over an oceanic and continental surface. Using a novel cold pool tracking algorithm and several experiments on surface heat fluxes interaction with cold pools, we show that surface heat fluxes are an important contributor to the life cycle and characteristics of cold pools. Sensible heat flux especially tends to kill cold pools, to reduce their buoyancy anomaly compared to the environment and also to reduce the gust front velocity. Cold pools are also smaller because of surface sensible heating. Sensible heat flux contribution is stronger over the ocean because of the reduced inertia of land surfaces which tends to rapidly track the temperature anomalies induced by the falling unsaturated downdrafts.",

            "abstract": "Cyclones are a crucial component of the Arctic climate system, acting as a key mechanism by which the atmosphere redistributes energy and moisture from lower latitudes. In the central Arctic Ocean (CAO), cyclone activity reaches its peak in summer, which has previously been related to cyclogenesis along the Eurasian continent. The seasonal presence of strong horizontal temperature gradients along the Arctic coastline (the Arctic frontal zone or AFZ) has also been suggested as a source of summer cyclones for the CAO; however, this hypothesis has always been considered as a part of larger studies and has not yet been closely examined with focused research.\nThis study incorporates data from NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and a cyclone detection and tracking algorithm to critically evaluate the relationship between the summer AFZ and cyclone activity in the CAO. By analyzing both individual cyclones and monthly fields of cyclone characteristics, we find that the AFZ is not a region of cyclogenesis, but rather cyclone intensification for systems forming on the leeward side of several Siberian mountain ranges. As they propagate into the CAO, these cyclones experience greater deepening when the horizontal temperature gradients of the AFZ are stronger. On a broader scale, we show that the intensity of the summer AFZ has a positive correlation with mid-tropospheric Eady growth rate, cyclone intensity, cyclone frequency, and total precipitation in the CAO during summer. This relationship remains even when controlling for variability in large-scale circulation (the seasonally varying Northern Annular Mode). Taken as a whole, these findings demonstrate the importance of the summer Arctic frontal zone as an intensifier of energy and moisture cycles for the Arctic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The dramatic decrease of Arctic sea-ice has led to a new Arctic sea-ice paradigm and to increased commercial activity in the Arctic Ocean. NOAA’s mission to provide accurate and timely sea-ice forecasts, as explicitly outlined in the National Ocean Policy and the U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region, needs significant improvement across a range of time scales to improve safety for human activity. Unfortunately, the sea-ice evolution in the new Arctic involves the interaction of numerous physical processes in the atmosphere, ice, and ocean, some of which are not yet understood. These include atmospheric forcing of sea-ice movement through stress and stress deformation; atmospheric forcing of sea-ice melt and formation through energy fluxes; and ocean forcing of the atmosphere through new regions of seasonal heat release. Many of these interactions involve emerging complex processes that first need to be understood and then incorporated into forecast models in order to realize the goal of useful sea-ice forecasting.\nThe underlying hypothesis for this study is that errors in simulations of “fast” atmospheric processes significantly impact the forecast of seasonal sea-ice retreat in summer and its advance in autumn in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). We therefore focus on short-term (0-20 day) ice-floe movement, the freeze-up and melt-back processes in the MIZ, and the role of storms in modulating stress and heat fluxes. This study uses a coupled ocean-atmosphere-seaice forecast model as a testbed to investigate; whether ocean-sea ice-atmosphere coupling improves forecasts on subseasonal time scales, where systematic biases develop due to inadequate parameterizations (focusing on mixed-phase clouds and surface fluxes), how increased atmospheric resolution of synoptic features improves the forecasts, and how initialization of sea ice area and thickness and snow depth impacts the skill of the forecasts. Simulations are validated with measurements at pan-Arctic land sites, satellite data, and recent ocean field campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Microbial iron(III) reduction is often coupled to carbon mineralization, resulting in net CO2 efflux from the soil profile. Recent reports of iron reduction in upland ecosystems suggests this process is not limited to flooded soils and sediments. However, quantifying ecosystem-scale iron reduction rates is challenging because the intermittent anoxia (low-oxygen) that facilitates iron reduction varies spatially throughout the landscape. To approach this challenge, we have measured the soil iron reduction potential using localized passive redox sensors across four climate gradients ranging from <600 mm y-1 to >4000 mm y-1 rainfall on soils derived from Hawaiian basalt aged 0.3 to 4,100 ky. At each site we installed ten iron metal-rods with a uniform surface coating of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide. The rods were pushed into the soil to a depth of 90 cm and left in place for 14 d. Extracted rods were washed and imaged to quantify the fraction of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide coating that was dissolved. In addition, we have characterized the iron mineral composition from surface and sub-surface horizons at similar sites using Mössbauer spectroscopy. Our results suggest that when annual rainfall exceeds 1800 – 2000 mm y-1, iron reduction is a common feature within the soil profile, regardless of soil age. In addition, we find that the pedogenesis of iron minerals proceeds along distinct trajectories above and below this iron reduction threshold.",

            "abstract": "The river upstream of watersheds in Taiwan is very steep, where soil and rock are often unstable so that the river watershed typically has the attribute of high sand yield and turbid runoff due to the excessive erosion in the heavy rainfall seasons. If flood water overflows the river bank, it would lead to a disaster in low-altitude plains. When flood retards or recesses, fine sediment would deposit.\nOver recent decades, many landslides arise in the Zengwen river watershed due to climate changes, earthquakes, and typhoons. The rocks and sands triggered by these landslides would move to the river channel through surface runoff, which may induce sediment disasters and also render an impact on the stability and sediment transport of the river channel.\nThe risk of the sediment disaster could be reduced by implementing dredging works. However, because of the nature of the channel, the dredged river sections may have sediment depositions back; thus, causing an impact on flood safety. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of dredged works from the perspectives of hydraulic, sediment transport, and flood protection to achieve the objective of both disaster prevention and river bed stability.\nWe applied the physiographic soil erosion-deposition (PSED) model to simulate the sediment yield, the runoff, and sediment transport rate of the Zengwen river watershed corresponding to one-day rainstorms of the return periods of 25, 50, and 100 year. The potential of sediment deposition and erosion in the river sections of the Zengwen river could be simulated by utilizing the alluvial river-movable bed two dimensional (ARMB-2D) model. The results reveal that the tendency for the potential of river sediment deposition and erosion obtained from these two models is agreeable. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the efficiency of sediment deposition reduction, two quantized values, the rate of sediment deposition reduction and the ratio of sediment deposition reduction were utilized.\nAccording to the simulation results obtained from the PESD and ARMB-2D models, the river sections with severe sediment depositions and high efficiency of sediment deposition reduction will be referred to as the dredging-to-be areas.",

            "abstract": "The Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP) and the Tauride Mountains form part of the Anatolian plate. Westward escape of the Anatolian plate along large-scale strike-slip faults in response to Arabia-Eurasia collision is accommodated by extension and slab retreat in the Aegean domain. The CAP is currently characterized by NE-SW extension, which was suggested to have started in the latest Miocene, similarly timed to an acceleration of slab retreat in the Hellenic subduction zone.\nUplift of the CAP and its southern Tauride margin occurred within this context, and uplift of the Central Tauride Mountains occurred after ~7 Ma, as evidenced by marine deposits currently exposed at 1.5-2 km altitude. By the latest Miocene to Pliocene, the presence of an eroding topography is indicated by conglomeratic fluvial deposits in the Adana, Cilicia and Antalya basins.\nWithin the framework of the Continental Dynamics–Central Anatolian Tectonics project, we aim at further constraining the onset of CAP and Tauride uplift. Latest Oligocene to Pliocene lacustrine deposits on the CAP (i.e. N of the Tauride Mountains) were sampled for carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis. The combination of δ13C and δ18O values forms a proxy for paleoenvironment, and δ18O values form a proxy for the development of an orographic barrier between the Mediterranean Sea and the CAP. Age constraints were obtained from magnetostratigraphy and 40Ar/39Ar dating, as well as published mammal associations. The δ18O values in combination with geologic observations suggest that the onset of uplift occurred after ~6.5 Ma. A 3-4‰ drop of δ18O values by 5 Ma indicates the presence of an orographic barrier and therefore the uplift of the Tauride Mountain belt. Based on our stable isotope data from well-dated sections, we conclude that a significant part of the uplift of the Tauride Mountains took place soon after their emersion.",

            "abstract": "Encroachment of human development onto river floodplains creates a need to stabilize rivers and provide flood protection. Structural interventions, such as levees, often perturb hydrologic and sediment regimes and thus can initiate morphological responses. An understanding of how human activities affect river morphodynamics and trigger channel change is needed to anticipate future river responses and facilitate effective restoration. This study examines approximately 66 km of the Snake River, WY, USA, and links sediment transport processes to channel form and behavior by developing a morphological sediment budget that spans both a natural, unconfined reach and a reach confined by artificial levees. Sediment transport rates are inferred from the morphological sediment budget and a bed mobility study is used to estimate entrainment thresholds that allow us to link the hydrological regime during the sediment budget period to the observed channel changes. Results indicate that lateral constriction by levees triggers a positive feedback mechanism by incising the bed, focusing flow energy, thus increasing transport capacity, and leading to armoring of the bed. In other systems, armoring promotes widening of the channel but in this case levees prevent widening and the channel instead migrates across the braidplain rapidly, producing further erosion of bars and vegetated islands that is expressed as negative net volumetric changes and increased sediment transport rates. Furthermore, decreased slopes and reduced discharges due to dam regulation in the upstream unconfined reach cause gravel sheets to stall on bars and in other areas of storage, creating a spatial discontinuity in sediment conveyance downstream, and thus contributing to the sediment deficit within the leveed reach.",

            "abstract": "A gamut of studies exist which posit that small scale conversion of forests to urban, pasture or cropland can trigger an increase in regional cloudiness and rain. Several of these studies, pertaining to early stages of Amazonian deforestation, attribute this phenomenon to heightened thermal triggering resulting from small-scale (a few kilometers) patchy deforestation. But it is not clear if this phenomenon can be extrapolated to contemporary (tens of kilometers) or future scales of deforestation.\nHere, we have carried out the first long-time period study of the effects of changing scales of Amazonian deforestation on regional cloudiness and precipitation using satellite observations made by GOES and TRMM. We have analyzed observations made over the deforested areas in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. We find a shift in the regional hydroclimatic regime over the three decades of deforestation - from spatially uniform cloudiness to dominant cloudiness in the downwind half of the deforested domain. This result is not consistent with a thermal triggering mechanism because thermal triggering would only explain the uniform cloud cover observed during the early stages of deforestation. To further investigate the mechanism, we have also carried out numerical simulations. We found that surface roughness gradients caused by contemporary large scales of deforestation can explain this observed transition. This transition is climatologically important for this region because it affects the observed spatial distribution of precipitation, which has become dominant in the downwind half of the deforested domain in contemporary times. The new mechanism identified here should be accounted for in planning for future land-use change in the Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake locations are a first-order observable which form the basis of a wide range of seismic analyses. Currently, the ANSS catalog primarily contains published single-event earthquake locations that rely on assumed 1D velocity models. Increasing the accuracy of cataloged earthquake hypocenter locations and origin times and constraining their associated errors can improve our understanding of Earth structure and have a fundamental impact on subsequent seismic studies. Multiple-event relocation algorithms often increase the precision of relative earthquake hypocenters but are hindered by their limited ability to provide realistic location uncertainties for individual earthquakes. Recently, a Bayesian approach to the multiple event relocation problem has proven to have many benefits including the ability to: (1) handle large data sets; (2) easily incorporate a priori hypocenter information; (3) model phase assignment errors; and, (4) correct for errors in the assumed travel time model. In this study we employ bayseloc [Myers et al., 2007, 2009] to relocate earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United States from 1964-present. We relocate ~11,000 earthquakes with a dataset of ~439,000 arrival time observations. Our dataset includes arrival-time observations from the ANSS catalog supplemented with arrival-time data from the Reviewed ISC Bulletin (prior to 1981), targeted local studies, and arrival-time data from the TA Array. One significant benefit of the bayesloc algorithm is its ability to incorporate a priori constraints on the probability distributions of specific earthquake locations parameters. To constrain the inversion, we use high-quality calibrated earthquake locations from local studies, including studies from: Raton Basin, Colorado; Mineral, Virginia; Guy, Arkansas; Cheneville, Quebec; Oklahoma; and Mt. Carmel, Illinois. We also add depth constraints to 232 earthquakes from regional moment tensors. Finally, we add constraints from four historic (1964-1973) ground truth events from a verification database. We (1) evaluate our ability to improve our location estimations, (2) use improved locations to evaluate Earth structure in seismically active regions, and (3) examine improvements to the estimated locations of historic large magnitude earthquakes.",

In Brazil, flashfloods and landslides were responsible for 74% of the deaths related to natural disasters in 1991-2010 period. In this sense, climate change could be considered a threat which can further increase these numbers, if actions of adaptation and reducing vulnerability are not taken. To evaluate Brazil's vulnerability hotspots to these disasters, two vulnerability indexes were developed using three sets of variables: (1) climate, with IPCC climate extreme indexes; (2) environmental, including land use, drainage systems, relief map, slope, road density and hydrography variables; (3) socioeconomic, including Gini coefficient, HDI (Human Development Index), housing conditions and poverty-related index. The variables were normalized on a scale between 0 to 1 and related using Map Algebra technique (ArcGIS). As part of the effort to contribute to the elaboration of the Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to contribute to the assessment of impacts on strategic country’s issues, simulations at higher resolution were carried out using Eta-20km RCM (Regional Climate Model) nested with two global climate models: HadGEM ES and MIROC 5 (INPE Brazilian National Institute for Space Research). For the baseline period of 1961-1990, the vulnerability indexes were adjusted by an iterative process, which was validated by comparing it to the Brazilian National Disasters Data. The same indexes found at baseline were used to estimate the vulnerability until the end of the XXI century, using the 4.5 and 8.5 IPCC/AR5 RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios. The results indicate a large increase in Brazil’s vulnerability to landslides mainly in coastal zone, southern states, high lands of southeast states, and along the Amazon River due to climatic aspects only, not considering other factors such as increase in population size, etc. Flashfloods vulnerability, on the other hand, increases mostly in the south/southeast regions, the northeast coastal zone and parts of the Amazon basin.\nFunded by: Ministry of Science and Technology of Brazil and the United Nations Development Program in Brazil.",

The on going DECC tall tower network consists of three sites, and an eastern background site in Ireland. The GAUGE project includes instruments at two additional tall tower sites, a high-density measurement network over agricultural land in eastern England, a ferry that performs near-daily transects along the east coast of the UK, and a research aircraft that has been deployed on a campaign basis. Together with data collected by the GOSAT satellite, these data represent the GAUGE/DECC GHG measurement network that is being used to quantify UK GHG fluxes. As part of the wider GAUGE modelling efforts, we have derived methane flux estimates for the UK and northwest Europe using the UK Met Office NAME atmospheric transport model and a novel hierarchical Bayesian “trans-dimensional” inversion framework. We will show that our estimated fluxes for the UK as a whole are largely consistent between individual measurement platforms, albeit with very different uncertainties. Our novel inversion approach uses the data to objectively determine the extent to which we can further refine our national estimates to the level of large urban areas, major hotspots or larger sub-national regions. In this talk, we will outline some initial findings of the GAUGE project, tackling questions such as: At what spatial scale can we effectively derive greenhouse gas fluxes with a dense, multi-platform national network? Can we resolve individual metropolitan areas or major hotspots? What is relative impact of individual stations, platforms and network configurations on flux estimates for a country of the size of the UK? How can we effectively use multi-platform observations to cross-validate flux estimates and determine likely errors in model transport?",

Because microbes from these environments have proven elusive in culturing efforts, we performed culture independent analysis among different microbial communities found at these hydrothermal vents. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and Illumina sequencing of small subunit ribosomal gene amplicons were used to characterize community members and identify samples for shotgun metagenomics. Used in combination, these methods will better elucidate the composition and characteristics of the bacterial communities at these hydrothermal vent systems.\nThe overarching goal of this study is to evaluate and compare taxonomic and metabolic diversity among different communities of microbial mats. We compared communities collected on a fine scale to analyze the bacterial community based on gross mat morphology, geography, and nearby vent effluent chemistry. Taxa richness and evenness are compared with rarefaction curves to visualize diversity. As well as providing a survey of diversity this study also presents a juxtaposition of three methods in which ribosomal small subunit diversity is compared with T-RFLP, next generation amplicon sequencing, and metagenomic shotgun sequencing.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical cyclones play a paramount role in Earth’s climate through meridional energy transport from the equator to the poles, as well as through cloud and precipitation formation by providing a majority of observed precipitation in the midlatitudes. The warm conveyor belt is a poleward airstream of ascending moisture that rises from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere. It is responsible for transporting a preponderant amount of water vapor present in an extratropical cyclone, with nearly 100% efficiency at precipitating all transported moisture. The community’s understanding of marine extratropical cyclones and their synoptic dynamics originates from the Shapiro and Keyser Model, but there is less understanding of the mesoscale evolution of the cloud and precipitation structures within an extratropical cyclone and its warm conveyor belt.\nThis research aims to better understand extratropical cyclone and warm conveyor belt evolution on the mesoscale using a specific case study. In late November 2006, a marine extratropical cyclone formed east of Florida in the Atlantic Ocean, travelling parallel to the eastern seaboard for nearly a week. Model analysis showed the presence of a strong warm conveyor belt associated with the cyclone. Given that the system remained in nearly the same longitudinal position, it was observed multiple times by NASA’s Afternoon-Train (A-Train) satellite constellation. CloudSat radar reflectivity profiles and ECMWF-AUX thermodynamic fields show a transition from stratiform to convective precipitation along the northern edge of the conveyer belt, with larger vertical instability and isolated higher rain rates. Examination of the storm scale context indicates this convection may develop in place rather than via interaction with the cold front. These results give us a better understanding of structural evolution of clouds and precipitation as it interacts with the cyclone-scale dynamics and surrounding thermodynamic environment.",

            "abstract": "An important manifestation of plasma transport in the ionosphere is Subauroral Polarization Streams or SAPS, which are strong westward flow lying just equatorward of the electron auroral oval and thus of enhanced ionospheric conductivities of the auroral oval. While SAPS are known to intensify due to substorm injections, recent studies showed that large variability of SAPS flow can occur well after substorm onset and even during non-substorm times. These SAPS enhancements have been suggested to occur in association with auroral streamers that propagate equatorward, a suggestion that would indicate that plasma sheet fast flows propagate into the inner magnetosphere and increase subauroral flows. We present auroral images from the THEMIS ground-based all-sky-imager array and 2-d line-of-sight flow observations from the SuperDARN radars that share fields of view with the imagers to investigate systematically the association between SAPS and auroral streamers. We surveyed events from December 2007 to April 2013 for which high or mid-latitude SuperDARN radars were available to measure the SAPS flows, and identified 60 events. For streamers observed near the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval, we find westward flow enhancements of ~200 m/s slightly equatorward of the streamers. A preliminary survey suggests that >90% of the streamers that reach close to the equatorward boundary lead to westward flow enhancements. We also characterize the SAPS flow channel width and timing relative to streamers reaching radar echo meridians. The strong influence of auroral streamers on rapid SAPS flow evolution suggests that transient fast earthward plasma sheet flows can lead to westward SAPS flow enhancements in the subauroral region, and that such enhancements are far more common than only during substorms because of the frequent occurrences of streamers under various geomagnetic conditions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the linkage between two notable features of climate change and sea level rise during the past decades: a slowdown in global warming (hiatus) and an east-west seesaw pattern of SLR in the Pacific. During the hiatus, the subsurface layer of the Pacific shows significant increase in ocean heat content along with a strong east-west gradient that is reflected in the seesaw pattern of Pacific SLR through the thermosteric effect. Control simulations from 38 climate models indicate that during periods of negative trend in global mean surface temperature (analogous to hiatus decades in a warming world), dynamic sea level increases in the western Pacific and decreases in the eastern Pacific. The opposite occurs during periods of positive temperature trends. Using a regression analysis of the model simulations along with sea-level measurements from satellite altimetry, we find that the recent change in the Pacific Ocean heat storage has suppressed potential surface warming since 1998. Our results suggest that a flip of the Pacific SLR seesaw would imply a resumption of surface warming and SLR acceleration along the U.S. West Coast.",

            "abstract": "Shallow, pre-eruptive storage conditions are well known for dacitic magmas of the Cascade arc through melt inclusions, FeTi oxides, and experiments. Zircon ages indicate protracted (>105 yrs) incubation for some Cascade dacites, but their origins in the deep crust have not been established. Accordingly, we report experimental results identifying the P–T–H2O conditions under which such liquids could segregate from (hornblende-) gabbroic sources. Two compositions were investigated: (1) MSH-Yn dacite (SiO2: 65 wt%) from Mount St. Helens’ voluminous Yn tephra, and (2) MSH-Yn + 10% cpx to force saturation with cpx and locate the cpx + melt = amphibole peritectic. H2O-undersaturated (3-9 wt% H2O) piston cylinder experiments were conducted at pressures, temperatures, and fO2 appropriate for the lower to middle crust (400 to 900 MPa, 825 to 1100°C, and ReReO2). Results for MSH-Yn indicate near-liquidus equilibrium with a cpx-free hornblende-gabbro residue (amphibole, plagioclase, magnetite, +/- opx and ilmeno-hematite) with 6-7 wt% H2O, 925°C, and 700-900 MPa. Opx disappears down-temperature consistent with the reaction opx + melt = amphibole. Cpx-added phase relations are similar in that once ~10% cpx crystallizes, multiple saturation is attained with cpx, amphibole, and plagioclase, +/- opx, at 6-7 wt% H2O, 950°C, and 700-900 MPa. Plagioclase-amphibole-cpx saturated liquids diverge from plagioclase-amphibole-opx saturated liquids, consistent with the MSH-Yn dacite composition marking a (pseudo-invariant) distributary reaction point where amphibole appears down-temperature and opx + cpx cease to coexist. Liquid compositions and temperatures stall at reaction points, irrespective of whether the source is crystallizing or melting, accounting for the compositional and thermal uniformity of voluminous dacites that feed into the shallow storage regions of arc volcanoes.\n   ",

            "abstract": "Otsego Lake (42°43’N, -74°54’W) is a large oligotrophic, monomictic lake in upstate New York that occupies a narrow, N-S trending basin (approx. 13 km length, 2 km width) and has a maximum water depth of approx. 50 m. We collected two sediment cores from a shallow (4 m water depth) bench near the SW shore of the lake. The cores were collected approximately 200 m off-shore from a small stream delta. Age control was established through five 14C AMS-dates obtained from terrestrial plant macrofossils. We analyzed sediments for their magnetic properties (magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic- and isothermal remanent magnetization, hysteresis properties and coercivity distributions) and performed loss-on-ignition and X-ray analyses to determine the relative abundance of organic matter, quartz and calcite. The watershed of Otsego Lake rests in glacial debris and Devonian shale and limestone. The base of the core (> 9 ka) consists mostly of silt-sized, massive to weakly laminated siliceous and strongly magnetic sediments. Between 8-9 ka the climate warmed sufficiently to allow for the formation of calcareous sediments. Between 8 – 6 ka magnetic minerals are characterized by low abundance and small grainsize, while organic and inorganic carbon increase. Sedimentation rates decrease significantly between 6-2 ka (from ~100 cm/ka to 12-15 cm/ka). During this time interval the relative abundance of quartz increases, sediment becomes slightly more magnetic, and the magnetic grain-size increases as well. We interpret this time period as a low-stand, when lower lake levels allow for the redeposition and possible loss of sediment into the deeper part of the lake, as well as increased terrigenous input from the nearby lakeshore. This lowstand is clearly identified as a strong, continuous reflector in GPR profiles. Sediments younger than 2 ka are characterized by variable abundances of magnetic minerals, with magnetic remanence peaks appearing semi-periodically approximately every 400 years. These strongly magnetic layers may be the result of multiple periods of low lake levels, or represent changes in the nearby stream delta and associated terrestrial sediment input.",

Geographically explicit maps of post-forest land cover can provide valuable information about the extent and spatial distribution of the major drivers of deforestation. Brazil is the country with the largest extent of tropical forest in the world and the one with the most tropical forest cover loss since the turn of this century. This fate of the forest study aims to determine which land covers have replaced forest cover in Brazil. Using a classification tree algorithm, we determined pasture and cropland extent in areas of forest cover loss in Brazil circa 2012. We used 30 m resolution Landsat data for the 2000-2013 time period as well as tree cover loss data from the Global Forest Change (GFC) maps published by Hansen et al. (2013). The GFC data was used to mask out areas not categorized as forest cover lost between 2000 and 2013. Additionally, the year of loss layer was used to disaggregate pasture and cropland extent by year. Our results comprehensively demonstrate the extent to which pasture is the dominant post-forest land cover in Brazil. More broadly, the product reveals spatiotemporal patterns of forest conversion to pasture and cropland in Brazil, which could lead to a better understanding of the underlying drivers of deforestation.",

            "abstract": "Carbon emission reduction is essential to hampering anthropogenic climate change. While there are several methods to broach carbon reductions, the National Energy with Weather System (NEWS) model focuses on limiting electrical generation emissions by way of a national high-voltage direct-current transmission that takes advantage of the strengths of different regions in terms of variable sources of energy. Specifically, we focus upon modeling concentrating solar power (CSP) as another source to contribute to the electric grid. Power tower solar fields are optimized taking into account high spatial and temporal resolution, 13km and hourly, numerical weather prediction model data gathered by NOAA from the years of 2006-2008. Importantly, the optimization of these CSP power plants takes into consideration factors that decrease the optical efficiency of the heliostats reflecting solar irradiance. For example, cosine efficiency, atmospheric attenuation, and shadowing are shown here; however, it should be noted that they are not the only limiting factors. While solar photovoltaic plants can be combined for similar efficiency to the power tower and currently at a lower cost, they do not have a cost-effective capability to provide electricity when there are interruptions in solar irradiance. Power towers rely on a heat transfer fluid, which can be used for thermal storage changing the cost efficiency of this energy source. Thermal storage increases the electric stability that many other renewable energy sources lack, and thus, the ability to choose between direct electric conversion and thermal storage is discussed. The figure shown is a test model of a CSP plant made up of heliostats. The colors show the optical efficiency of each heliostat at a single time of the day. ",

Atmospherically generated nitrate (NO3–) and nitrite (NO2–) are the most attractive high-potential electron acceptors for driving the highly endergonic reactions at the entry points to autotrophic metabolic pathways at submarine alkaline hydrothermal vents (Ducluzeau, 2008; Russell, 2014). The Hadean atmosphere, dominated by CO2 and N2, will produce nitric oxide (NO) when shocked by lightning and impacts (Ducluzeau, 2008; Nna Mvondo, 2001). Photochemical reactions involving NO and H2O vapor will then produce acids such as HNO3 and HNO2 that rain into the ocean and dissociate into NO3– and NO2–. Previous work suggests that 1018 g of NOx can be produced in a million years or so, satisfying the need for micromolar concentrations of NO3– and NO2– in the ocean (Ducluzeau, 2008). But because this number is controversial, we present new calculations based on a novel combination of early-Earth GCM and photochemical modeling, calculating the sources and sinks for fixed nitrogen. Finally, it is notable that lightning has been detected on Venus and Mars along with evidence of atmospheric NO; in the distant past, could NOx have been created and available for the emergence of life on numerous wet, rocky worlds?",

Working with the instructor, students have to formulate their research questions, collect and analyze data, and arrive at conclusions. In other words, the focus is shifted from preparing for exams to learning to apply the concepts introduced in the classroom. This experience could result in better understanding of the scientific concepts but instructors have to devote more time for designing and implementing IBL methods in their classroom. At the University of Wyoming, an applied remote sensing course has been taught since 2008. Students enrolled in this course are required to complete a project that is designed around IBL methods. Students do not receive detailed instructions for completing their project, but are trained to develop their own research questions, design an experiment, review literature, and collect, analyze and interpret their data. Additionally they learn about uncertainties and strategies for addressing them at various stages of their project. This presentation will describe the work involved in designing, implementing and mentoring students to successfully complete the course requirements and learn scientific research methods. Lessons learned from this course could provide insights to other instructors interested in implementing IBL or other active learning methods in their classroom.",

While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many impacts, it is either too weak or absent in most climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is critical in generating the tropical arm of AMO. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework, where the response of tropical surface wind to a warm North Atlantic SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic. This in turn helps to generate the tropical arm of AMO. Most climate models miss both feedbacks and the wind speed response, though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves play a crucial role in particle dynamics in the Earth’s magnetosphere. The free energy for EMIC wave generation is usually provided by the temperature anisotropy of the energetic ring current ions. EMIC waves can in turn cause particle energization and losses through resonant wave-particle interactions. Using measurements from the Van Allen Probes, we perform a case study of EMIC waves and associated plasma conditions observed on 18 March 2013. From 0204 to 0211 UT, the Van Allen Probe-B detected He+-band EMIC wave activity in the post-midnight sector (MLT=4.6-4.9) at very low L-shells (L=2.6-2.9). The event occurred right outside the inward-pushed plasmapause in the early recovery phase of an intense geomagnetic storm – min. Dst = -132 nT at 2100 UT on 17 March 2013. During this event, the fluxes of energetic (> 1 keV), anisotropic O+ dominate both the H+ and He+ fluxes in this energy range. Meanwhile, O+ fluxes at low energies (< 0.1 keV) are low compared to H+ and He+ fluxes in the same energy range. The fluxes of <0.1 keV He+ are clearly enhanced during the wave event, indicating a signature of wave heating. To further confirm the association of the observed plasma features with the EMIC waves, we calculate the electron minimum resonant energy (Emin) and pitch angle diffusion coefficient (Dαα) of the EMIC wave packets by using nominal ion composition, derived total ion density from the frequencies of upper hybrid resonance, and measured ambient and wave magnetic field. EMIC wave growth rates are also calculated to evaluate the role of loss-cone distributed ring current ions in the EMIC wave generation.",

            "abstract": "Sediment plays a central role in the geomorphology of mountain landscapes: It is produced on hillslopes and eroded into channels, where both the size and flux of sediment particles influence river incision, and thus indirectly set the pace of erosion from slopes. Quantifying how sediment size and erosion rate vary across slopes is therefore vital to understanding landscape morphodynamics, but there are few methods for doing so. In previous work, we showed that apatite helium ages and cosmogenic nuclides in stream sediment can be combined to find the best-fit patterns in erosion rates across slopes. Here we show how this approach can be extended to quantify how sediment size varies with elevation using data from additional stream sediment sizes. To illustrate the approach, we build on our previous work from a steep catchment draining the High Sierra, in California. Apatite helium ages reveal that the average source elevation is 2.7 km in the finest size, 3.0 km in an intermediate size, and 3.2 km in the coarsest size. Meanwhile, cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in quartz decrease by a factor of two with increasing sediment size. Qualitatively, these results demonstrate that coarser sediment originates from higher elevations and that higher elevations are eroding faster than lower elevations. We quantified the altitudinal trends suggested by the data using an optimization analysis that explores the goodness of fit of several functional relationships between elevation, sediment size, and erosion rate. In our previous work, we highlighted some of the pitfalls of using a single sediment size to measure spatially averaged erosion rates. Here, we demonstrate how these pitfalls can be overcome using multiple sizes of stream sediment, and how this approach allows us to explore the role of sediment size and erosion rate in the geomorphology of mountain landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Hawaii is an ideal place to study the secular variation (SV) of the Earth's magnetic field in central Pacific region, thanks to its long and continuous volcanic activity. We present here a compilation of well-dated palaeomagnetic data from Hawaiian lava flows that allow a complete description of the full geomagnetic field vector (declination, inclination and intensity) in this area. All available radiocarbon ages have been uniformly calibrated using the IntCal13 calibration curve and the most probable radiocarbon ages have been used for further considerations. A total of 323 directional and 98 intensity data have been collected for the last 10 000 years, most of them coming from the Big Island (data from lava cores have not been included). The data cover almost continuously the last 5 millennia while data from older periods are still scarce. The directional data are well consistent with each other while the intensity data are less abundant and show a higher dispersion. For the last 5000 years, where the majority of the data are concentrated, continuous secular variation curves for both direction and intensity have been calculated using the moving window technique with windows of 200 years shifted by 100 years. The obtained curves clearly show some characteristic features of the geomagnetic field variation in the central Pacific. Low inclination values are well documented around 500 AD, 1000 BC and 2500 BC while high inclinations are observed around 3000 BC and 1500 AD. Declination shows an eastward trend from 1000 AD to the present while a declination low is registered around 500 BC. The intensity curve is highly influenced by the important dispersion of the reference data points. The obtained curves have been compared with the predictions of the CALS10k.1b and pfm9k.1a global geomagnetic field models. Such comparison shows a good general agreement even though the models show much smoother variations mainly regarding intensity. Nevertheless, both the Hawaiian SV curves and the pfm9k.1a model show abrupt variations in both direction and intensity of the field around 300-100 BC which seems to be a very interesting feature of the geomagnetic field in the Pacific region.",

Observations of ocean biogeochemistry collected over the past few decades document decreases in surface ocean pH, thermocline oxygen, and phytoplankton productivity. Such changes are often interpreted in the context of anthropogenic climate change, but internally-generated climate variability may also contribute. Here, we isolate the effects of anthropogenic climate change from those of internal variability on ocean biogeochemistry using the CESM Large Ensemble. The ensemble includes 34 members, each of which is subject to identical external forcing over 1920-2100 but starts from a slightly different atmospheric state.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown non-negligible impact of the representation of surface spectral emissivity on the polar radiation budget and on the simulated climate changes. While the surface spectral emissivity can be easily incorporated into the RRTMG_LW, one of the most widely used longwave radiation schemes in current weather and climate models, the errors due to the way of representing surface emissivity in the RRTMG_LW have not been quantified. Using a line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) as benchmark, we quantify such errors in the RRTMG_LW. The benchmark calculation is done using the LBLRTM and a 3-angle Gaussian quadrature formula to compute radiative flux and cooling rates, in which the angular dependence of surface emissivity was explicitly taken into account. The RRTMG_LW model, on the other hand, can only use band-averaged surface emissivity and do not include any explicit dependence with the zenith angle. Using typical sounding profiles in the tropics, mid-latitude summer, sub-arctic winter, and Sahara desert, we compare the outgoing longwave radiations and longwave radiative cooling rates as computed by the LBLRTM and by the RRTMG_LW model. The comparisons show that the largest fractional difference in OLR is 0.9%, which is obtained for the case of subarctic winter profile. The largest radiation cooling rate discrepancy happens at the lowest level near to the surface with a fractional difference of ~15% (i.e. ~0.1K/day), among which ~5% discrepancies are due to the representation of surface emissivity alone and the rest 10% can be attributed to the simplified representation of atmospheric radiative transfer in the RRTMG_LW. Above 800 hPa, the discrepancies are less than 1% and almost exclusively caused by the RRTMG_LW formulation. For the mid-latitude and tropical profiles, window band of 820-980cm-1 contributes most among all 16 RRTMG_LW bands to the discrepancies in the cooling rates. For the sub-arctic winter and Sahara desert profiles, the largest contribution comes from a far-IR band of 500-630cm-1.",

            "abstract": "Cordón Caulle (Southern Andes, 72.15ºW, 40.52ºS) is a large fissural volcano located within a NW-SE elongated and ~30 km long chain that includes Cordillera Nevada caldera and Puyehue stratovolcano. Cordon Caulle has erupted a continuous suite from basalts to rhyolites since the Middle Pleistocene, including rhyolitic magma of the same composition in its past three historical eruptions in 1921, 1960 and 2011. There was significant ground deformation observed before and during the 2011-2012 eruption (VEI 4), and the inverted source depths responsible for the ground deformation are in agreement with petrological results that suggests shallow magma storage. Here we use new RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed InSAR time series between March 2012 and June 2015, as well as UAVSAR interferograms between March 2013 and April 2014 to document post-eruptive uplift of more than 0.85 m, with uplift rates of ~0.45 m/yr during March – December 2012, one of the largest worldwide for silicic systems with geodetic instrumentation, and ~19 cm/yr between May 2013 and June 2015. The ongoing uplift has not been related to abnormal seismicity above background. The signal is located between the Cordón Caulle fissures and elongated across the strike of the volcanic chain. Inversion for pressurized sources and a tensile dislocation shows that the ground uplift is most likely produced by a subhorizontal sill ~6 km beneath the surface. The source location and geometry are different than those that produced the co-eruptive deflation signal between June 2011 and March 2012, and a subsidence event between February 1993 and February 1999, but as the source depths are similar, we interpret that the ongoing uplift is produced by the same plumbing system that has been active during the historical eruptions. The fact that the uplift signal is elongated across the volcanic chain, suggests that the active intrusion is tectonically controlled, as has been proposed for the long-term evolution of this volcanic chain.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning is a major anthropogenic event in Northern Sub-Saharan Africa (NSSA), which contributes 15-20% of the global annual total of particulate matter emissions from fires. This burning is mostly for agricultural, grazing or hunting purposes, and thus has a great potential for driving changes in the land use and land cover distribution in that region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard both the Terra and Aqua spacecraft have two complimentary data products to support this research: the MOD14/MYD14 active fire products measuring fire locations and strengths, and the MCD12 land cover type product, which includes the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land-cover classification system used in this analysis. More specifically, the MCD12Q1 tiled data product at 500 m was used to match against the 1 km active fire product resolution for the current analysis. Paired data between instantaneous fire measurements and the underlying land cover types for the particular year over the study period of 2003-2013 reveals a dominant burning of savanna, followed by cropland land cover type throughout the region. There are a few indications of the interchange between savanna and cropland due to burning practices. Even though the fire activity in the whole NSSA region is decreasing at a rate of 1.4%/yr during the study period, some land cover types in parts of NSSA show an increase, including local increases in sensitive land cover types such as forest and wetland, which could have serious ecological implications. The changes in the overall redistribution of biomass burning amongst the different land cover types in NSSA dictate that there is also a redistribution of biomass burning emissions. The extent of these changes will also be covered in this presentation.",

The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive and exhibits the highest levels of OA (lowest pH) because more CO2 can dissolve in cold water. We here use decadal data to show that extreme and extensive OA in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is caused not by direct uptake of atmospheric CO2 but rather by naturally-driven processes: carbon mobilization from thawing coastal permafrost/coastal ice complexes, and freshening due to growing Arctic river runoff and ice melt, which transport carbon along with freshwater to the ESAS. These processes compose a unique acidifying phenomenon that causes persistent, and potentially increasing, aragonite under-saturation of the entire water column. Extreme aragonite under-saturation in the western near-shore ESAS is associated with >80% depression of the total calcifying benthic biomass. Massive OA on the ESAS, the largest sea shelf system of the World Ocean, illustrates the complexity of the Earth system interacting with increasing anthropogenic pressure.",

The Joint Polar Satellite System will replace the afternoon orbit component and ground processing system of the current Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) managed by NOAA. The JPSS satellites will carry a suite of sensors designed to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological and geophysical observations of the Earth.\nThe ground processing system for JPSS is known as the JPSS Common Ground System (JPSS CGS). Developed and maintained by Raytheon Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS), the CGS is a multi-mission enterprise system serving NOAA, NASA and their national and international partners. The CGS has demonstrated its scalability and flexibility to incorporate multiple missions efficiently and with minimal cost, schedule and risk, while strengthening global partnerships in weather and environmental monitoring.\nThe CGS architecture is being upgraded to Block 2.0 in 2015 to “operationalize” S-NPP, leverage lessons learned to date in multi-mission support, take advantage of more reliable and efficient technologies, and satisfy new requirements and constraints in the continually evolving budgetary environment. To ensure the CGS meets these needs, we have developed 49 Technical Performance Measures (TPMs) across 10 categories, such as data latency, operational availability and scalability.\nThis paper will provide an overview of the CGS Block 2.0 architecture, with particular focus on the 10 TPM categories listed above. We will provide updates on how we ensure the deployed architecture meets these TPMs to satisfy our multi-mission objectives with the deployment of Block 2.0.",

            "abstract": "Limestone tropical forests in karst topography are one of the most poorly studied ecosystems on Earth, and has been substantially cleared by human activities throughout much of Central America. This ecosystem is noted for its high level of plant productivity, biomass, endemism and biological diversity compared to nearby neighboring tropical forests on volcanic rock substrates (Brewer et al. 2002). A question remains as to how limestone tropical forests are able to maintain the high nutrient demands of plant photosynthesis and tree biomass growth. Here, we demonstrate that rates of nitrogen (N) fixation are higher in limestone versus volcanic soil substrates, with direct evidence for the emergence of seasonally dependent iron limitation of N fixation in limestone tropical forest. N fixation rates showed a three-fold increase in response to iron additions, especially during the wet season when N demands of the forest trees are highest. In contrast, adjacent forests growing on the more classical acidic volcanic soils showed no response to iron or other nutrient additions. Biologically available pools of iron were exceedingly low in the limestone forest site, consistent with the complexation of iron under high pH conditions. Biological acquisition of iron, as measured by the concentration of iron chelating compounds (i.e. siderophores), provided additional evidence for iron limitation of microbial processes in limestone tropical forests, where concentrations were six times higher than those at the volcanic site. Our results suggest that the functioning of limestone tropical forest is strongly regulated by interactions between iron, soil pH, and N cycling.",

            "abstract": "Resource scarcity is considered to be one of the most serious issues plaguing Dhaka city. Because of the massive pressure of increasing population (15.931 million), a very unsustainable situation is waiting for this city in the upcoming future. It is inevitable to know how far this city is from being sustainable. This paper embodies the comparative analysis of the carbon footprint of four different areas in Dhaka city. It is considered as one of the most important key indicators of sustainability. It calculates the amount of biologically productive land in order to produce all the resources consumed by an individual or a particular community. This research has been conducted in both the planned and unplanned areas of this city. Among compound, component and direct method, component method was used to calculate the carbon footprint. Primary data were collected from door to door questionnaire survey. Total 371 samples were drawn from all the study areas at 95 % confidence level and 5% confidence interval. After finishing data analysis it was clear that the per capita carbon footprint of the selected study areas exceeds the per capita biocapacity of Dhaka city. And there exists a huge variation between the planned and unplanned areas of Old Dhaka and New Dhaka. Per capita carbon footprint of Gulshan & Jhigatola (part of New Dhaka) is higher than the per capita carbon footprint of Gandaria & Wari (part of Old Dhaka) that means resource stress is higher in Gulshan & Jhigatola in comparison with Gandaria & Wari because of the difference of daily consumption pattern. One of the most important findings of this study is that the per capita carbon footprint is the highest in Gulshan (1.2407 gha) among all the study areas and it is 85.56 times greater than the per capita biocapacity of Dhaka city (0.0145 gha) that means a single resident of this area needs 1.2407 gha land in order to support his/her demand on nature but only 0.0145 gha land (in an average) is available for him/her which indicates a very unsustainable future for the residents of this area. So now it is the most suitable time that urban planners and policy makers of our country immediately undertake some indispensable measures to ensure the sustainable future of this city.\nKey Words: Resource Scarcity, Sustainability, Per Capita Carbon Footprint and Per Capita Biocapacity.

The primary measurement location is at Toolik Field Station (TFS, 68° 38' N) in northern Alaska, with additional samples collected along a transect from TFS to the Arctic Ocean, and in Noatak National Preserve to be collected in August 2015. Soil and vegetation samples from all sites will be analyzed for total Hg concentration, pH, soil texture, bulk density, soil moisture content, organic and total carbon (C), nitrogen, along with major and trace elements.\nInitial results already obtained from TFS (characterized as moist to wet tundra with Typic Aquiturbel soils) show Hg concentrations in tundra vegetation (112±15 µg kg-1) and organic soil (140±8 µg kg-1) similar to those found in temperate sites. Calculation of plant-based Hg deposition rates by litterfall of 17.3 µg kg-1 yr-1 were surprisingly high, exceeding all other Hg deposition fluxes at this site. Hg concentrations in mineral soils (95±3 µg kg-1) were 2-3 times higher than those found at temperate sites. Hg concentrations showed weak relationships to organic C concentrations contrasting patterns from temperate soils where concentrations typically decline with depth following lower organic carbon contents. In fact, vertical mass profiles of Hg showed a strong increase with depth, with mineral layers storing over 90% (200-500 g ha-1) of Hg within these soils.\nA principle component analysis including major and trace elements indicated that soil Hg was not of lithogenic origin but from atmospheric sources, possibly by long-range transport. Carbon-14 dating results showed over 7,000 years old organic carbon in mineral soils of the active layer where highest concentrations of soil Hg were observed, suggesting long term retention of atmospheric Hg. These patterns suggest vertical translocation of Hg from the surface organic horizons to mineral soils and strong accumulation—possibly over millennia—therein.",

            "abstract": "In general, the gas hydrates are formed at low temperature and high pressure which requires a special technique to mimic the natural conditions. The hydrate thermal properties: heat capacity, heat of dissociation, are crucial for evaluating the effects on climate change and for a prediction of the gas production rates from hydrate reservoirs. The effect of the porous materials on the dissociation of synthetic methane hydrates was investigated at 150 – 300 K and atmospheric pressure. Another experiment with methane hydrates, but at high pressure (20 MPa) was performed at near room temperature using a highly sensitive micro-differential scanning calorimeter with a specifically design high pressure vessel (the vessel can withstand a pressure up to 1000 bars). The thermal cycle for measuring the methane hydrate dissociation in water includes cooling down a water solution under a certain methane pressure (30 to 350 bars) to -30 C to allow water crystallization and hydrate formation, then heated up to room temperature. The endothermic peak, following the ice melting is associated to the hydrate dissociation process and gives the enthalpy of the hydrate decomposition. The kinetics of the hydrates formation could also be predicted by a rapid DSC cooling experiment followed by isothermal step and heating. Both dissociation and specific heats of synthetic methane and ethane hydrates were measured under high-pressure condition by using a heat-flow type calorimeter to understand thermodynamic properties of gas hydrates under submarine/sublacustrine environments. The large reserves of natural gas are present as clathrate hydrates in permafrost regions and beneath the oceans have generated interest in the study of their thermophysical properties such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity. The effect of isotopic substitution in both THF and water on the eutectic and hydrate melting temperatures in water-tetrahydrofuran systems studied by DSC will be shown as an example.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, dynamical downscaling of global model projections using high-resolution regional models has been commonly used to simulate climate change impacts at the regional and local level. Many studies utilizing high-resolution models have led to improvements in the experiment design and model configuration for regional problems. In this study, our aim is to simulate climate change in New England using a model explicitly resolving convection and to analyze impacts of climate change in this region. We use Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to dynamically downscale Community Earth System Model (CESM) projections of the future with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 for New England. WRF simulations are performed on nested grids with 27, 9 and 3 km horizontal grid spacing, and the smallest grid sized nest is focused over New England. In our simulations, the simulated domains are kept large to minimize any numerical artifacts and the innermost domain is kept large in size and high in resolution to resolve convection. This is done to eliminate the model dependency to convection parameterization as has been observed in previous studies We are focusing on three time-slice runs of 20 years each representing near, mid and far future totaling 60 years. The high-resolution climate variables obtained from these simulations are used as forcing in smaller scale ecosystem, land surface hydrology and economy models to predict regional climate change impacts under a high emissions scenario. When presenting our results, we will focus on future changes in extreme events and societal, economical and health related impacts associated with these changes. We will state potential problems when using regional models for dynamical downscaling and when providing downscaled output to application models. Finally, we will describe how our results can be utilized to improve regional sustainability and adaptation strategies in New England.",

            "abstract": "This work examines the impact of diurnally varying radiation cycle on the intensity, structure and track of Hurricane Edouard (2014) at different stages of its life cycle through convection-permitting simulations.During the formation stage, nighttime destabilization through radiative cooling may promote deep moist convection that eventually leads to the genesis of the storm while a tropical cyclone fails to develop in the absence of the night phase despite a strong incipient vortex under favorable environmental conditions. The nighttime radiative cooling further enhances the primary vortex before the storm undergoes rapid intensification (RI). Thereafter, the nighttime radiative cooling mainly increases convective activities outside of the primary eyewall that leads to stronger/broader outer rainbands and larger storm size during the mature stage of the hurricane but there is little impact on the hurricane intensity in terms of maximum surface wind speed. There is no apparent eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) simulated in both sensitivity experiments without the diurnal cycle (daytime only and nighttime only) while the control forecast undergoes secondary eyewall formation during the mature stage of Edourad (as observed), suggesting the potential role of the diurnally varying radiative impact. Through changing the strength of the initial vortex during the formation stage, the diurnal cycle may also alter the track of the storm.",

However, conditions vary widely across this region, and even those areas prone to extended cloudiness have very high solar potential during the summer when days are clear and as much as 16 hours long. Given that this area is also somewhat isolated from the rest of the US electrical transmission grid, an assessment of the character of the area's solar resource is warranted. In this talk, we present results of an analysis of irradiance data from five sites spread across the northwestern US from western Oregon to southwestern Montana. The availability and variability of solar irradiance at each location is described over a range of temporal scales. Observed differences are related to local weather patterns, which vary with geographic location. The relationships among the irradiance time series measured at the individual sites are also examined, with consideration of potential smoothing of overall output that might be achieved if solar power plants were built in multiple locations.\n* Data provided courtesy of the University of Oregon Solar Radiation Monitoring Laboratory",

We have reached a new phase in the study of the MJO: the phenomenon has been described in great detail from an observational point of view, and perhaps even more importantly, the best numerical models can now simulate it well. I will argue that in this situation, theory is most compelling when its core assumptions can be specifically defended using both observations and comprehensive numerical models. I will make connections between the moisture mode view and results from several different types of numerical models: numerical weather prediction models, global climate models, and small-domain high-resolution cloud resolving models.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and predicting earthquake magnitudes from injection-induced seismicity is critically important for estimating hazard due to injection operations. A particular problem has been that the largest event often occurs post shut-in. A rigorous analysis would require modeling all stages of earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest, and not just initiation. We present a simple conceptual model for predicting the distribution of earthquake magnitudes during and following injection, building on the analysis of Segall & Lu (2015). The analysis requires several assumptions: (1) the distribution of source dimensions follows a Gutenberg-Richter distribution; (2) in environments where the background ratio of shear to effective normal stress is low, the size of induced events is limited by the volume perturbed by injection (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2013; McGarr, 2014), and (3) the perturbed volume can be approximated by diffusion in a homogeneous medium. Evidence for the second assumption comes from numerical studies that indicate the background ratio of shear to normal stress controls how far an earthquake rupture, once initiated, can grow (Dunham et al., 2011; Schmitt et al., submitted). We derive analytical expressions that give the rate of events of a given magnitude as the product of three terms: the time-dependent rate of nucleations, the probability of nucleating on a source of given size (from the Gutenberg-Richter distribution), and a time-dependent geometrical factor. We verify our results using simulations and demonstrate characteristics observed in real induced sequences, such as time-dependent b-values and the occurrence of the largest event post injection. We compare results to Segall & Lu (2015) as well as example datasets. Future work includes using 2D numerical simulations to test our results and assumptions; in particular, investigating how background shear stress and fault roughness control rupture extent.",

The P-3B aircraft provided in situ vertical profiles of meteorological quantities, trace gases, and aerosols over six Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) air quality monitoring sites over fourteen flight days. A major goal of DISCOVER-AQ is to better understand the processes, such as vertical mixing, controlling profile shape and linking column abundances to surface concentrations for NO2. Model vertical profiles are vital for obtaining accurate satellite retrievals of NO2 and thereby improving the applicability of satellite data for air quality analyses. Accurate simulatiions of the diurnal evolution of the NO2 profiles will be especially important for geostationary satellite retrievals. Model simulations performed using six commonly used PBL schemes with the coupled WRF/CMAQ model will be used to investigate the impact of vertical mixing on NO2 profile shapes. These modeled profiles will also be compared to the observed profiles to evaluate which PBL scheme (if any) best captures the in situ profiles, as well as PBL depth and the observed state of mixing. Lastly, the impact of PBL scheme on the column-surface relationship for NO2 will also be evaluated, and compared to observations.",

Ubiquitous moisture in the area make clouds a common feature over the Amazon Rainforest and along with the influences from deforestation have a significant impact on the radiation budget. This region experiences a seasonal contrast in clouds, precipitation, and aerosols making it an ideal location to study the relationship between these variables and the radiation budget. An internationally sponsored campaign entitled GOAmazon2014/15 included a deployment of an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility, which collected comprehensive measurements using in situ and remote sensors. Observations of clouds, aerosols, and radiative fluxes from the first year of the deployment are analyzed in conjunction with top of the atmosphere (TOA) observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and analyses from the newly released Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2). The combination of surface and TOA observations allows for the calculation of radiative flux divergence and cloud radiative effect (CRE) within the column, while the comparison to MERRA‑2 enables the verification of a new reanalysis product and a view of the spatial variation of the radiation budget. Clouds are very reflective in the area, creating a cooling effect in the shortwave (SW) at the surface, with some seasonality present due to the reduction of optically thick clouds in the dry season. Clouds have little effect on the column itself in the SW due to the balance between the reflective and absorbing properties of the clouds with the majority of the impact on the atmosphere from clouds warming in the longwave. Influences of aerosols are seen in the dry season, and an increase in moisture above the Amazon River and its tributaries enhance the CRE.",

While butterfly distributions have been well recognized for radiation belt electrons below ~ 1 MeV, there is lack of investigation of butterfly distributions for relativistic (> MeV) electrons. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of outer zone (L >= 3) relativistic electron butterfly distribution based upon a survey of over-two-year Van Allen Probes REPT measurements. The global profile of butterfly distribution is investigated in detail for relativistic electrons at REPT energies, along with its dependence on L-shell, MLT, and the level of geomagnetic activity. Furthermore, the occurrence pattern of outer zone relativistic electron butterfly distribution is explored with respect to the solar wind dynamic pressure, which suggests that there exist a good correlation between these two phenomena especially at high L-shells (e.g., L ~ 6) and that some other mechanism(s), besides losses through the magnetopause, should play to contribute to the occurrence of outer zone relativistic electron butterfly distribution at lower L-shells.",

            "abstract": "Water and energy resources are fundamental to life on Earth and essential for the production of consumer goods and services in the economy. Energy and water resources are heavily interdependent—energy production consumes water, while water treatment and distribution consume energy. One example of this so-called energy-water nexus is the consumption of water associated with the production of transportation fuels. The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model is an analytical tool that can be used to compare the environmental impacts of different transportation fuels on a consistent basis. In this presentation, the expansion of GREET to perform life cycle water accounting or the “virtual flow” of water into transportation and other energy sectors and the associated implications will be discussed. The results indicate that increased usage of alternative fuels may increase freshwater resource consumption. The increased water consumption must be weighed against the benefits of decreased greenhouse gas and fossil energy consumption. Our analysis highlights the importance of regionality, co-product allocation, and consistent system boundaries when comparing the water intensity of alternative transportation fuel production pathways such as ethanol, biodiesel, compressed natural gas, hydrogen, and electricity with conventional petroleum-based fuels such as diesel and gasoline.",

Undergraduate students in geoscience classes often have a poor understanding of the process and specifically do not understand what constitutes peer-reviewed literature. This becomes especially apparent in situations where students are asked to write research-oriented papers or essays that make use of peer-reviewed scientific sources. Often, they believe that news articles and online sources such as blogs constitute valid (peer-reviewed) scientific sources. We make use of a relatively simple in-class exercise in our introductory geoscience classes that teaches students the necessity of the review process and educates them about the true nature and value of peer-reviewed literature. It also reinforces an understanding of the scientific method in the context of conducting literature-based research. Students report that they are better equipped to conduct research using scientific literature as a result of participating in the exercise.",

Experimental observations are accompanied by uncertainty that must be properly accounted for while estimating such relations. Korenaga and Karato [2008] was the first study to conduct a rigorous statistical analysis by developing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion code, and they demonstrated the significance of taking into account all kinds of experimental errors, as well as including more than one mechanism in the deformation model and estimating all flow law parameters simultaneously. Their MCMC code was, however, later found to have a potential of introducing some parameter bias [Mullet et al., 2015].\nIn this study, we utilize an improved version of their MCMC code to revisit the same data set. The newly estimated flow law parameters are distinctly different from those obtained by Korenaga and Karato [2008], as well as older studies from which the experimental data was compiled. Our analysis demonstrates the superiority of the new inversion scheme over simple least square inversion, and underscores the need for a thorough statistical analysis of experimental data. We also discuss how covariance among model parameters could affect the predictions of viscosity based on the newly estimated flow laws.",

            "abstract": "Many U.S. cities are exploring the potential of using green infrastructure (e.g., porous pavements, green roofs, street planters) to reduce urban storm water runoff, which can be both be a nuisance and costly to treat. While tools exist to measure local runoff changes resulting from individual green infrastructure (GI) projects, most municipalities currently have no method of analyzing the collective impact of GI projects on urban stormwater systems under future rainfall scenarios and impervious surface distribution patterns. Using the mid-sized city of Knoxville, Tennessee as a case study, we propose a set of indicators that can be used to monitor and analyze the collective effects of GI emplacement on urban storm water runoff volumes as well as to quantify potential co-benefits of GI projects (e.g., urban heat island reduction, reduced stream scouring) under different climate projection ensembles and population growth scenarios. These indicators are intended to help the city prioritize GI projects as opportunities arise, as well as to track the effectiveness of GI implementation over time. We explore the aggregation of these indicators across different spatial scales (e.g., plot, neighborhood, watershed, city) in order to assess potential changes in climate change resilience resulting from the collective implementation of GI projects across an urban landscape.",

            "abstract": "Models of vegetation distributions are used for a wide variety of purposes, from global assessments of biome shifts and biogeochemical feedbacks to local management planning. Dynamic vegetation models, mostly mechanistic in origin, are valuable for regional to global studies but remain limited for more local-scale applications, especially those that require species-specific responses to climate change. Species distribution models (SDMs) are broadly used for such applications, but these too have several outstanding limitations, one of the most prominent being a lack of dispersal and migration. Several hybrid models have recently been developed, but these generally require detailed parameterization of species-level attributes that may not be known.\nHere we present an approach to couple migration potential with SDM output for a large number of species in order to more realistically project future range shifts. We focus on 40 tree species in the eastern US of potential management concern, either because of their canopy dominance, ecosystem functions, or potential for utilizing future climates. Future climates were taken from a CMIP5 model ensemble average using RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We used Random Forests to characterize current and future environmental suitability, and modeled migration as a negative exponential kernel that is affected by forest fragmentation and the density of current seed sources. We present results in a vulnerability framework relevant for a number of ongoing management activities in the region. We find an overarching pattern of northward and eastward range shifts, with high-elevation and northern species being the most adversely impacted. Because of limitations to migration, many newly suitable areas could not be utilized without active intervention. Only a few areas exhibited consistently favorable conditions that could be utilized by the relevant species, including the central Appalachian foothills and the Florida panhandle. We suggest that a continued effort to include migration potential into vegetation models can lead to more realistic results and management-relevant products.",

Multi-site GPS observations from more than 2500 ground-based GPS stations were used to analyze the dynamics of the ionospheric irregularities in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The most intense ionospheric irregularities lasted for more than 24 hours starting at 07 UT of March 17. This period correlates well with an increase of the auroral Hemispheric Power index. We find hemispheric asymmetries in the intensity and spatial structure of the ionospheric irregularities. Over North America the ionospheric irregularities zone expanded equatorward below ~45°N geographic latitude. Additionally, the strong mid and high latitude GPS phase irregularities in the auroral oval were found to be related to the formation of storm enhanced density, polar tongues of ionization and deepening of the main ionospheric trough through upper atmosphere ionization by energetic particle precipitations. Significant increases in the intensity of the irregularities within the polar cap region of both hemispheres were associated with the formation and evolution of the SED/TOI structures and polar patches.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying our understanding of tropical forest response to seasonal cycles of precipitation, and variability around the annual mean, is an ongoing problem. A decade ago, computer models were unable to reproduce forest behavior at some forests in tropical South America, with the result that ecophysiological function collapsed and Bowen ratio spiked unrealistially during the dry season. Subsequent work has mitigated this oversensitivity to annual cycles of rainy and dry seasons, with the result that our models may now be under-sensitive to variability around the mean. Hence the Goldilocks metaphor: We have moved our models from an over-sensitive (too hot) position to an under-sensitive (too cold) state, while we desire understanding and an ability to simulate both annual cycles and anomalous conditions (just right).\nIn this research we demonstrate our ability to combine in-situ and spectral datasets with models to converge on a description of biophysical processes that combines robustness to mean annual state with a realistic sensitivity to anomalous drought. We use climatology of annual mean precipitation and dry season character to obtain a Drought Resistance Index (DRI) that, when combined with soil depth data yields an initial estimate of forest drought resilience. Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) observations provide higher-resolution spatiotemporal monitoring of canopy response to anomalous events (such as 2010 drought) that can we use to refine our understanding of ecophysiological stress across temperature and precipitation gradients in tropical South America. We demonstrate that we can maintain fidelity to seasonality of surface flux as observed by eddy covariance flux towers while improving model response to drought events.",

            "abstract": "The Triassic­–Jurassic (T–J) transition was a time of significant environmental perturbation typically associated with CAMP volcanism and is considered to be one of the six major extinction events in Earth’s history. This event was associated with large perturbations of the global carbon cycle, as recorded in the isotopic composition of marine carbonate and bulk organic carbon. This has been elsewhere associated with widespread ocean acidification and a major disruption in marine carbonate production in neritic and pelagic environments. A carbon-isotope record from a paleo-equatorial carbonate platform exposed in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates (UAE), shows continuous shallow-water carbonate sedimentation across the Triassic­-Jurassic boundary, in contrast with other boundary sections from higher latitudes, where carbonate sedimentation is typically discontinuous. δ13C shows a 4‰ negative excursion in both bulk organic carbon and carbonate carbon followed by a positive excursion. The boundary in Ras Al Khaimah, is placed at the base of a thick oolite unit overlying limestones with abundant and diverse Rhaetian reefal biota. Deposition of fossiliferous limestones in this location persisted into the uppermost Rhaetian and through the initial negative carbon-isotope excursion. While characteristic late Triassic biota with originally aragonitic mineralogy disappears at the boundary, aragonite persists as the inferred original mineralogy of the earliest Jurassic ooids and occasional skeletal bioclasts. The evidence presented herein suggest equatorial seawater of Tethys appears to have remained aragonite-supersaturated across the boundary and extinction event in contrast to higher latitude depositional sequences raising questions about how widespread ocean acidification was and in what conditions it may be favoured.",

This relationship between SST and TC formation and intensification implies that rising SST in the climate change era will increase the probability of tropical cyclone formation and that therefore as global temperatures rise so will the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. However horizontal resolution of the global general circulation models used in IPCC simulations are usually too coarse to reproduce many smaller scale processes like TC.\nWe present a novel approach to downscale climate change scenarios, which could be also used to investigate the generation and propagation of tropical cyclones over the northern Indian Ocean. The REgional atmosphere MOdel REMO is coupled to the global ocean - sea ice model MPIOM with increased resolution over the Indian Ocean (~20km). The resulting coupled system called ROM. The coupled domain is standard CORDEX south Asia domain (0.44 deg). The models are coupled via the OASIS coupler. Exchange between ocean and atmosphere was made every three hours. Lateral atmospheric and upper oceanic boundary conditions outside the coupled domain were prescribed using ERA40, MPIESM-LR historical and MPIESM-LR RCP85 data.\nHere we present the results of the dynamical downscaling approach both coupled (ROM) and uncoupled (REMO) simulations for the same period. The validation period (ERA40 and Historical) is 1958-2001. While comparing with observations mean (1958-2001) annual frequency of 8 TC/year, ROM simulated with ERA40 (Historical) TCs are 12 (10), whereas with REMO they are 21 (18). Therefore ROM simulated TC frequency is much more realistic than REMO. REMO has simulated two times more TCs than ROM, hence leading to strong overestimation of TC tracks densities over the region. Scenario simulations (RCP85) showed that compared to 20th century frequency of tropical cyclones will be increased at the end of the 21st century both in coupled and uncoupled simulation. There is quite pronounced change in the TCs tracks. The frequency of landfalls increases.",

The new instruments feature trawl-resistant enclosures designed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) for shallow deployment [water depth ≤ 500 m], as well as new deep-water instruments designed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). Existing OBSIP instruments were also deployed along the Blanco Transform Fault and on the Gorda Plate through complementary experiments. Stations include differential pressure gauges (DPG) and absolute pressure gauges (APG). All data collected from the Cascadia, Blanco, and Gorda deployments will be freely available through the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management Center (DMC).\nThe Cascadia Initiative is the largest amphibious seismic experiment undertaken to date and demonstrates an effective structure for community experiments through collaborative efforts from the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team (CIET), OBSIP (institutional instrument contributors [LDEO, SIO, WHOI] and Management Office [IRIS]), and the IRIS DMC. The successes and lessons from Cascadia are a vital resource for the development of a Subduction Zone Observatory (SZO). To guide future efforts, we investigate the quality of the Cascadia OBS data using basic metrics such as instrument recovery and more advanced metrics such as noise characteristics through power spectral density analysis. We also use this broad and diverse deployment to determine how water depth and instrument shielding influence recorded data. Additionally, multi-year data collection allows us to identify temporal noise trends so that we can take advantage of quieter seasons for future deployments.",

            "abstract": "Decreased water availability due to hydrologic modifications, groundwater withdrawal, and climate change threaten the hydrological architecture of floodplain forests globally. The relative contributions of different sources of water (e.g., precipitation, surface flooding, and groundwater) to soil moisture on floodplains is poorly constrained, so identification of areas of water stress within a floodplain can provide valuable information about floodplain hydrology. Canopy temperature is a useful indicator of moisture stress and has long been used in agricultural and natural landscapes. Accordingly, thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data (spatial resolution of 1 km) from NASA’s MODIS sensor was used to examine patterns of spatiotemporal variation in water stress in two floodplain forests over 12 growing seasons. On the upper Sabine River floodplain, Texas, increasing rainfall-derived soil moisture corresponded with increased heterogeneity of LST but there was weak association between river stage and heterogeneity. On the lower White River floodplain, Arkansas, distinct differences in LST between two reaches were observed during low flow years, while little relationship was observed between LST spatial variability and rainfall-derived soil moisture on either reach. The differences in hydrological control on these floodplain ecosystems have important ramifications for varying resilience to climate change and water resource management.",

            "abstract": "Scientific imaging techniques have progressed at a fast pace in the recent years, thanks in part to great improvements in detector technology, and through our ability to process large amounts of complex data using sophisticated software. Broadband thermal cameras are ubiquitously used for permanent monitoring of volcanic activity, and have been used in a multitude of scientific applications, from tracking ballistics to studying the thermal evolution lava flow fields and volcanic plumes. In parallel, UV cameras are now used at several volcano observatories to quantify daytime sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions at very high frequency. In this work we present the results the first deployment of a ground-based Thermal Infrared (TIR) Hyperspectral Imaging System (Telops Hyper-Cam LW) for the study of passive and explosive volcanic activity at Stromboli volcano, Italy. The instrument uses a Michelson spectrometer and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry to produce hyperspectral datacubes of a scene (320x256 pixels) in the range 7.7-11.8 µm, with a spectral resolution of up to 0.25 cm-1 and at frequencies of ~10 Hz. The activity at Stromboli is characterized by explosions of small magnitude, often containing significant amounts of gas and ash, separated by periods of quiescent degassing of 10-60 minutes. With our dataset, spanning about 5 days of monitoring, we are able to detect and track temporal variations of SO2 and ash emissions during both daytime and nighttime. It ultimately allows for the quantification of the mass of gas and ash ejected during and between explosive events. Although the high price and power consumption of the instrument are obstacles to its deployment as a monitoring tool, this type of data sets offers unprecedented insight into the dynamic processes taking place at Stromboli, and could lead to a better understanding of the eruptive mechanisms at persistently active systems in general.",

Recently, the satellite Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data provides an opportunity to monitor large-scale groundwater depletion. However, the data is only available after 2002, limiting the understanding of inter-annual variability of seasonal groundwater depletion. In this study, a simple model with two parameters is developed, based on the seasonal Budyko framework for quantifying the seasonal groundwater depletion. The model is applied to the Indus and Ganges River basin in South Asia and the High Plain/Ogallala aquifer in United States. The parameters of the model are estimated by integrating GRACE and other multi-source data sets. Total water storage changes before 2003 are reconstructed based on the developed model with available data of evaporation, precipitation, and potential evaporation.",

            "abstract": "Meadows are recognized for their value to the ecological, hydrologic, and aesthetic functions of a watershed. As natural water retention sinks, meadows attenuate floods, improve water quality and support herbaceous vegetation that stabilize streambanks and promote high biodiversity. Alpine meadows are especially vital, serving as freshwater sources and distributing to lower lying provinces through ground and surface water interaction. These complexes are highly vulnerable to drought conditions, altered seasonal precipitation patterns, and mismanaged land use.\nOne such location, Van Norden meadow located in the Donner Summit area west of Lake Tahoe, is one of the largest sub-alpine meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of Northern California. Van Norden meadow offers a natural hydrologic laboratory. Ownership transfer of the area from a local land trust to the Forestry Service requires restoration toward natural meadow conditions, and involves notching the dam in 2016 to reduce currently impounded water volumes from 250 to less than 50 acre-feet. To monitor the effects of notching the dam on the upstream meadow conditions, better understanding of the surface and groundwater hydrology both pre-and post-base level alteration is required. Comprehensive understanding of groundwater flux that supports meadow reaches relies on knowledge of their often complex stratigraphic and structural subsurface framework. In recent years hydrogeophysics has emphasized the combination of near surface geophysical techniques, collaborated with well and borehole measures, to qualitatively define these parameters. Building on a preliminary GPR investigation conducted in 2014, in which 44 270 MHz transect lines were collected, we returned to Van Norden meadow in late summer 2015 to collect lower frequency GPR (50 and 100 MHz) and electrical resistivity profiles to better define the groundwater table, sedimentary, and structural features of the meadow.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the partitioning of available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes, the mean states and variability of the fluxes, and the extent and variability of surface energy budget closure is paramount to an understanding of regional climate. A focal point of WCRP’s Global Energy and Water Exchange (GEWEX) Data Assessment Panel (GDAP) LandFlux activities is the development of latent heat flux data products. The development of a long-term sensible heat flux data product has been limited by the parameterization for aerodynamic resistances, including stability of the boundary layer, surface roughness, and poor measurements of the surface temperature gradient.\nThis study will analyze the global terrestrial energy budget closure using consistent satellite-derived data products. The sensible heat data product is formed using a 1979-2009 hourly, 0.5 degree resolution land surface temperature (LST) product based on merging CFSR estimates with High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) observations to be consistent with HIRS. These LST data are also used to estimate surface emitted longwave radiation and net radiation. The parameterization of the aerodynamic resistance is based on optimized values using data at 70 FluxNet towers and extended globally through an objective analysis based on climate and land cover covariates. Multiple reanalysis-based air temperature estimates are used to form the surface temperature gradient and create an ensemble of global terrestrial sensible heat estimates. The latent heat flux estimates from LandFlux and remotely-sensed satellite surface radiation data products are combined with the sensible heat estimates to assess surface energy budget closure at various spatial and temporal scales, including the assessment of spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the Bowen ratio and the size of the residual of the budget relative to the available energy.",

            "abstract": "The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer on the MESSENGER spacecraft observed calcium emisison in Mercury's exosphere on a near-daily basis for >16 Mercury years. The calcium was persistently concentrated in the dawn hemisphere and was of extreme temperature (>50,000K). Any mechanism producing the Mercurian Ca exosphere must explain the facts that the Ca is extremely hot, that it is seen almost exclusively on the dawnside of the planet, and that its content varies seasonally, not sporadically. In this paper we consider the energization processes. We start with the assumption that calcium is ejected into the exosphere by impact vaporization, initially in the form of simple molecules, and that they are subsequently dissociated by some process. We consider here simple diatomic molecules or their clusters, focusing on calcium oxides while acknowledging that Ca sulfides may also be the precursor molecules. The pathways we discuss are (1) impact vaporization producing Ca and Ca-oxide clusters, (2) electron-impact dissociation of CaO molecules, (3) spontaneous dissociation of Ca-bearing molecules following impact vaporization, and (4) photodissociation. The most likely origin of extremely hot Ca seen in Mercury's exosphere is photodissociation or dissociative photoionization of a precursor CaO molecule or clusters, or possibly some other diatomic molecule such as CaS, produced by impact vaporization. Photodissociation of the CaO molecule results in a hot Ca atom and an even hotter oxygen atom. This explains both the observation of hot refractories in Mercury's exosphere and the absence of observable oxygen (Vervack et al., 2015), which would rapidly escape from the exosphere. It has been shown previously that CaO clusters and even dimers are produced by evaporation of diopside, and that the dawnside origin of the Ca is the result of preferential impact vaporization in the ram direction as Mercury moves through the interplanetary medium. In addition to Ca, there has been some indication that Mg in Mercury's exosphere is perhaps as hot as 20,000 K and may be concentrated in the dawn hemisphere (Sarantos et al., 2011). Some of the arguments put forth for Ca may also apply to Mg.",

Details about this tool will be presented in a companion paper by White et al. (2015, this conference).\nWe evaluate 3-hr precipitation forecasts from four models (the HRRR, HRRRexp, RAP, and RAPexp) that were added to the tool in Dec. 2014. The Rapid Refresh (RAP) and the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) models are run operationally by NOAA, are initialized hourly, and produce forecasts out to 15 hours. The RAP and HRRR have experimental versions (RAPexp and HRRRexp, respectively) that are run near-real time at the NOAA/ESRL/Global Systems Division.\nOur analysis of eight rain days includes atmospheric river events in Dec. 2014 and Feb. 2015. We evaluate the forecasts using observations at two sites near the California coast - Bodega Bay (BBY, 15 m ASL) and Cazadero (CZC, 478 m ASL), and an inland site near Colfax, CA (CFC, 643 m ASL).\nVarious criteria were used to evaluate the forecasts. (1) The Pielke criteria: we compare the RMSE and unbiased RMSE of the model output to the standard deviation of the observations, and we compare the standard deviation of the model output to the standard deviation of the observations; (2) we compare the modeled 24-hr precipitation to the observed 24-hr precipitation; and (3) we assess the correlation coefficient between the modeled and observed precipitation.\nBased on these criteria, the RAP slightly outperformed the other models. Only the RAP and the HRRRexp had forecasts that met the Pielke criteria. All of the models were able to predict the observed 24-hour precipitation, within 10%, in only 8-16% of their forecasts. All models achieved a correlation coefficient value above the 90th percentile in 12.5% of their forecasts. The station most likely to have a forecast that met any of the criteria was the inland mountain station CFC; the least likely was the coastal mountain station CZC, most likely due to model terrain issues.\nThe results will be presented in the context of the presence or absence of an atmospheric river approaching the California coast. The presentation will also include the analysis of modeled and observed integrated water vapor. Comparisons of model output to observations from more stations may also be included.",

            "abstract": "Flow duration curves (FDCs) are a graphical illustration of the cumulative distribution of streamflow. Daily streamflows often range over many orders of magnitude, making it extremely challenging to find a probability distribution function (pdf) which can mimic the steady state or period of record FDC (POR-FDC). Median annual FDCs (MA-FDCs) describe the pdf of daily streamflow in a typical year. For POR- and MA-FDCs, Lmoment diagrams, visual assessments of FDCs and Quantile-Quantile probability plot correlation coefficients are used to evaluate goodness of fit (GOF) of candidate probability distributions. FDCs reveal that both four-parameter kappa (KAP) and three-parameter generalized Pareto (GP3) models result in very high GOF for the MA-FDC and a relatively lower GOF for POR-FDCs at over 500 rivers across the coterminous U.S. Physical basin characteristics, such as baseflow index as well as hydroclimatic indices such as the aridity index and the runoff ratio are found to be correlated with one of the shape parameters (kappa) of the KAP and GP3 pdfs. Our work also reveals several important areas for future research including improved parameter estimators for the KAP pdf, as well as increasing our understanding of the conditions which give rise to improved GOF of analytical pdfs to large samples of daily streamflows.",

In this study, we estimate future yield changes for livestock due to heat stress in New England. We use the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), a component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) that is developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The simulation uses RCP8.5 boundary conditions, and is driven by CCSM4 atmospheric forcing from the CMIP5 archive, that conducts simulations of the past and next century. Heat stress metrics are calculated using the HumanIndexMod in CLM4.5 for the early and late 21st century. For example, the humidity index for comfort and physiology, wet bulb temperature and swamp cooler efficiency. Results indicate that in the New England Region, temperatures will increase by 4 °C and in New Hampshire specifically by 3 °C. Temperature humidity index for comfort and physiology, swamp cooler efficiency and wet bulb are all projected to rise by the end of the century. While it is obvious that these elevations in temperature will have a negative effect on animals inhibiting their performance and output, our analysis also emphasizes the role of changes in humidity in heat stress. We show that heat stress caused by temperature and humidity increases, will decrease overall production yield for dairy and beef cattle, sows, finishing hogs and poultry, as a result of heat stress and other major climatic factors. We estimate and discuss resulting economic losses for the livestock industries and the impact in the United States and New England Region.",

The use of approximate forward theory and modeling allows updating the model with new data on a regular basis, a few days after the publication of the monthly centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog issued at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. 3D2015_03Sv contains azimuthal anisotropy and achieves a lateral resolution of ~600 km in the upper mantle. Comparison with other seismic models shows that in the uppermost 200 km, the use of massive datasets with large redundancies allows to average errors, so that it is possible to build models that are consistent up to degree 60. In the transition zone, the number of data decreases and the effect of modeling choices is important. The most recent seismic models agree up to degree 15, which represents an improvement compared to the previous generation of models.",

Nyiragongo, located within the Virunga Volcanic Province on the western branch of the East African Rift, is known for its persistent lava lake activity as well as devastating eruptions in 1977 and 2002. The 2002 eruption caused a humanitarian crisis when channelized lava flows entered the nearby city of Goma killing 170 people and displacing ~350,000 others. These lavas have extremely low silica contents (39-42 wt.% SiO2) and are very fluid, allowing flows to move rapidly away from the source. We have measured the rheology of lavas from Nyiragongo using a concentric cylinder viscometer at temperatures of ~1220, 1205, 1190, 1175, 1165, and 1145°C. Each experiment starts with a liquid viscosity measurement at 1500˚C, followed by cooling to the desired experimental temperature. The lava spends 10-12 hours at this temperature, with constant stirring, before measurements begin. After measuring at a range of strain rates, the lava is quenched by immersion of the Pt crucible in a water bath. The viscosity is ~32 Pas at the liquidus temperature of ~1220°C, increasing gradually to ~142 Pas at 1165˚C. These viscosity measurements are much lower than most other basaltic compositions including Hawaiian lavas which have a crystal fraction of ~42% and apparent viscosity of ~2000 Pas at 1169°C. Over this temperature range, crystal fraction varies little (1-5% spinel crystals). Interpolating between measurements of the melt viscosity by concentric cylinder and parallel-plate viscometry suggests that at 1165˚C, the viscosity of the starting melt would be ~63 Pas. Consequently, the change in viscosity is due primarily to cooling rather than either the physical or chemical effects of crystallization. The data were collected at strain rates between ~1 and 46 s-1, and are well reproduced using a power-law model with exponents ~0.94 to 0.96. Below 1165˚C, crystal fraction and magma viscosity both increase rapidly. Further experiments at lower temperatures will quantify this rate of viscosity increase, and results will be compared to the more silicic Mt. Nyamuragira, only 15 km away.",

            "abstract": "Most climate and weather models exhibit systematic biases, such as under predicted diurnal temperatures in the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model. General approaches to alleviate the systematic biases include improving model physics and numerics, improving data assimilation, and bias correction through post-processing. In this study, we developed a novel, physics-based data analytics framework in post processing by taking advantage of ever-growing high-resolution (spatial and temporal) observational and modeling data. In the framework, a spatiotemporal PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is first applied on the observational data to filter out noise and information on scales that a model may not be able to resolve. The filtered observations are then used to establish regression relationships with archived model forecasts in the same spatiotemporal domain. The regressions along with the model forecasts predict the projected observations in the forecasting period. The pre-regression PCA procedure strengthens regressions, and enhances predictive skills. We then combine the projected observations with the past observations to apply PCA iteratively to derive the final forecasts. This post-regression PCA reconstructs variances and scales of information that are lost in the regression. The framework was examined and validated with 24 days of 5-minute observational data and archives from the WRF model at 27 stations near Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. The validation shows significant bias reduction in the diurnal cycle of predicted surface air temperature compared to the direct output from the WRF model. Additionally, unlike other post-processing bias correction schemes, the data analytics framework does not require long-term historic data and model archives.

            "abstract": "Mathematical inclusion theories predict the effective elastic properties of a porous medium with idealized-shape inclusions as a function of the elastic moduli of the host matrix and those of the inclusions. These effective elastic properties depend on the volumetric concentration of the inclusions (the porosity of the host frame) and the aspect ratio of an inclusion (the ratio between the thickness and length). Seemingly, these models can solve the problem of fluid substitution and solid substitution: any numbers can be used for the bulk and shear moduli of the inclusions, including zero for empty inclusions (dry rock). In contrast, the most commonly used fluid substitution method is Gassmann’s (1951) theory. We explore whether inclusion based fluid substitution is consistent with Gassmann’s fluid substitution. We compute the effective bulk and shear moduli of a matrix with dry inclusions and then conduct Gassmann’s fluid substitution, comparing these results to those from directly computing the bulk and shear moduli of the same matrix but with the inclusions having the bulk modulus of the fluid. A number of examples employing the differential effective medium (DEM) model and self-consistent (SC) approximation indicate that the wet-rock bulk moduli as predicted by DEM and SC are approximately Gassmann-consistent at high aspect ratio and small porosity. However, at small aspect ratios and high porosity, these inclusion models are not Gassmann-consistent. For all cases, the shear moduli are not Gassmann-consistent at all, meaning that the wet-rock shear modulus as given by DEM or SC is very different from the dry-rock moduli as predicted by the same theories. We quantify the difference between the two methods for a range of porosity and aspect ratio combinations.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon plays a unique role in the Arctic climate system due to its multiple effects. It causes Arctic warming by directly absorbing sunlight from space and by darkening the surface albedo of snow and ice, which indirectly leads to further warming and melting, thus inducing an Arctic amplification effect.\nBC depositions over the Arctic are more sensitive to regions in close proximity. In this study, we reconstruct BC emissions for Russian Federation, which is the country that occupies the largest area in the Arctic Circle. Local Russia information such as activity data, emission factors and other emission source data are used. In 2010, total anthropogenic BC emission of Russia is estimated to be around 254 Gg. Gas flaring, a commonly ignored black carbon source, contributes a dominant 43.9% of Russia’s total anthropogenic BC emissions. Other sectors, i.e., residential, transportation, industry, and power plants, contribute 22.0%, 17.8%, 11.5%, and 4.8%, respectively.\nBC simulations were conducted using the hemispheric version of CMAQ with polar projection. Emission inputs are from a global emissions database EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)-HTAPv2 (Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution) and EDGAR-HTAPv2 with its Russian part replaced by the newly developed Russian BC emissions, respectively. The simulations using the new Russian BC emission inventory could improve 46 - 61% of the Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (AAOD) measured at the AERONET sites in Russia throughout the whole year as compared to that using the default HTAPv2 emissions. At the four air monitoring sites (Zeppelin, Barrow, Alert, and Tiksi) in the Arctic Circle, surface BC simulations are improved the most during the Arctic haze periods (October - March). Emission perturbation studies show that Russia’s BC emissions contribute over 50% of the surface BC concentrations over the Arctic during the cold seasons.\nThis study demonstrates the good capability of H-CMAQ in simulating the transport of BC particles to the Arctic and suggests that the impact of Russian emissions on the Arctic haze has likely been underestimated, which is one of the causes that previous modeling works struggled in reproducing the BC levels in the Arctic region.",

For a tangential force, we have Chao´s (1960) formulae. For an arbitrary load at any depth within a stratified elastic half space, the resulting elastic field can be given in the same fashion, by using an integral representation in the radial wavenumber domain. Typically, computations use discrete wave number (DWN) formalism and Fourier analysis allows for solution in space and time domain. Experimentally, these elastic Green´s functions might be retrieved from ambient vibrations correlations when assuming a diffuse field. In fact, the field could not be totally diffuse and only parts of the Green’s functions, associated to surface or body waves, are retrieved. In this communication, we explore the computation of Green functions for a layered media on top of a half-space using a set of equipartitioned elastic plane waves. Our formalism includes body and surface waves (Rayleigh and Love waves). These latter waves correspond to the classical representations in terms of normal modes in the asymptotic case of large separation distance between source and receiver. This approach allows computing Green’s functions faster than DWN and separating the surface and body wave contributions in order to better represent Green’s function experimentally retrieved.",

Lack of communication between emergency managers, policy makers, and communities at risk may result in an inability to accurately identify disaster risk, and failure to determine priorities during a hazard event. Specific goals of communication change during the four phases of emergency management. Consequently, the communication strategy changes as well. Communication strategy also depends on a variety of attitudinal and motivational characteristics of the population at risk, as well as socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical features of the disaster-prone region. In May 2013, insufficient communication patterns between federal, state, tribal agencies, and affected communities significantly contributed to delays in the flood response and recovery in several rural villages along the Yukon River in central Alaska. This case study finds that long term dialogue is critical for managing disaster risk and increasing disaster resilience in rural Northern communities.

            "abstract": "Soil moisture patterns in the landscape are largely controlled by soil types (pore size distributions), landscape position and precipitation events. But how strong is the influence of vegetation on patterns within a single soil type? While we would envision a clear difference in soil moisture patterns and responses between for example bare soil, a pasture and a forest, our conceptual images start to become less clear when we compare different forest stands. Do different tree species cause species specific moisture patterns to emerge? Do these patterns change with the seasons? To investigate this question we analyzed data from 15 sensor clusters in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany (within the TERENO observatory) which were instrumented with soil moisture sensors (5 profiles per site), tensiometers, sap flow sensors, throughfall and stemflow gauges. Data has been collected at these sites since May 2014. While the soils under beech trees were more often relatively wet and more often relatively dry, the soils under pine trees showed less variability and more often average soil moisture. These differences could be explained by differences in the complex interactions between throughfall and stemflow on the one hand as well as root water uptake and sap flow patterns on the other hand. Further analysis will explore hydraulic redistribution between soil layers and hydraulic lift of groundwater (using root zone water balance methods and stable water isotope samples that were taken at different depths in the soil, in the groundwater and from the sapwood). The manifestation of tree species differences in soil moisture patterns and dynamics is likely to have implications for groundwater recharge, transit times and hydrologic partitioning within the critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Advances in seismometer design have diversified the range of instruments available for use in temporary field installations. IRIS programs, primarily PASSCAL and the Transportable Array (TA), have helped steer development of these new instruments to meet these evolving needs. PASSCAL operates a small pool of posthole broadband sensors, purpose built for direct burial. Near surface posthole installations are a new, cost effective, and logistically simple technique for broadband emplacement that is an alternative to the vault installations used in portable broadband seismic experiments for nearly 30 years. Direct burial installation is limited to the time and effort required to dig the borehole and emplace the sensor, thus reducing both material costs and time to install. Also, in Alaska, extreme environments and difficult logistics make standard TA tank vaults inappropriate for most sites. TA has developed improved deployment strategies for these environments. There, holes for posthole sensors are hammer- drilled or augered to several meters depth in soil, permafrost, or bedrock and then cased. These emplacement costs are generally less than standard TA vaults.\nWe compare various installation techniques for test cases as well as general deployments of PASSCAL and TA stations. Automated noise performance analyses have been part of the TA throughout its operation, but until recently vault performance for portable installations supported by the PASSCAL program was sparse. In this study, we select a suite of co-located direct burial and surface vault installations and compare their noise performance using probability density functions. Our initial analyses suggest that direct burial sensors have lower noise levels than vault installations on both horizontal and vertical channels across a range of periods spanning <1 s to 100 s. However, most of these initial experiments for PASSCAL were with sensors not purpose built for direct burial and it became obvious that a sensor designed for direct burial was necessary. For the TA, direct emplacement of purpose-built sensors has routinely improved noise levels, particularly beyond about 20 s, by tens of dB. These results suggest that moving towards an instrument pool composed primarily of purpose-built direct burial sensors could yield higher-quality data at lower cost.",

The continued viability of barrier islands is threatened in the face of rising seas and coastal erosion. To assess the response of barrier islands in Delaware Bay to sea level rise, we quantified shoreline migration and changes in their size using historic maps and aerial imagery. We establish a historical record of changes of barrier island area and rates of shoreline migration, we built a time-series analysis using aerial images and historic maps of Delaware Bay along the coast of New Jersey, dating back to 1970. Since 1970 the barrier islands have decreased in size, and the region experienced an average shoreline transgression rate of 3 m/yr. However, some areas are experiencing substantiality higher rates of shoreline migration, while other areas remain relatively stable. We interpret this as resulting from varying wind energy and currents in the bay. Using our measured rates of shoreline migration and NOAA wind data for the region, we developed a GIS model examining how wind and current energy may contribute to variation in rates of shoreline change in the region. This information allows us to better anticipate the effects of sea level rise on the fragile estuarine system.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the influence of melange rheology in a subduction thrust interface on stress and slip cycling constrained by observations from an exhumed subduction complex at Chrystalls Beach, New Zealand. A two-phase mélange dominated by large, competent brittle-viscous blocks surrounded by a weak non-linear viscous matrix is numerically modeled, and the evolution of bulk stress are analysed as the domain deforms. The models produce stress cycling behaviour under constant shear strain rate boundary conditions for a wide range of physical conditions that roughly corresponds to depths and strain rates calculated for instrumentally observed episodic tremor and slip (ETS) in presently-deforming subduction thrust interfaces. Stress cycling is accompanied by mixed brittle plastic-viscous deformation, and occurs as a consequence of geometric reorganisation and the progressive development and breakdown of stress bridges as blocks mutually obstruct one another. We argue that periods of low differential stress correspond to periods of rapid mixed-mode deformation and ETS. Stress cycling episodicities are a function of shear strain rate and pressure/temperature conditions at depth. The time period of stress cycling is principally controlled by the geometry (block distribution and density through time) and stress cycling amplitudes are controlled by effective stress. The duration of stress cycling events in the models (months-years) and rapid strain rates are comparable to instrumentally observed ETS. Shear strain rates are 1 – 2 orders of magnitude slower between stress cycling events, suggesting episodic return times within a single model domain are long duration (> centennial timescales), assuming constant flow stress. Finally, we derive a bulk viscous flow law for block dominated subduction mélanges for conditions 300 – 500°C and elevated pore fluid pressures. Bulk flow laws calculated for block-dominated subduction mélanges are non-linear, owing to a combination of non-linear matrix viscosity and development of tensile fractures at rapid shear strain rates. Model behaviour, including the generation of mixed-mode deformation, is highly comparable to the exhumed block-dominated melange found within the Chrystalls Beach Complex.",

However, constraining sources of CO2 evasion from urbanized estuaries remains incomplete, particularly in densely populated river systems receiving high loads of organic carbon from anthropogenic sources. To account for major factors regulating carbon fluxes the tidal reach of the Han River estuary along the metropolitan Seoul, characterization of organic carbon in the main stem and major urban tributaries were combined with continuous, submersible sensor measurements of pCO2 at a mid-channel location over a year and continuous underway measurements using a submersible sensor and two equilibrator sytems across the estuarine section receiving urban streams. Single-site continuous measurements exhibited large seasonal and diurnal variations in pCO2, ranging from sub-ambient air levels to exceptionally high values approaching 10,000 ppm. Diurnal variations of pCO2 were pronounced in summer and had an inverse relationship with dissolved oxygen, pointing to a potential role of day-time algal consumption of CO2. Cruise measurements displayed sharp pCO2 pulses along the confluences of urban streams as compared with relatively low values along the upper estuary receiving low-CO2 outflows from upstream dams. Large downstream increases in pCO2, concurrent with increases in DOC concentrations and fluorescence intensities indicative of microbially processed organic components, imply a translocation and subsequent dilution of CO2 carried by urban streams and/or fast transformations of labile C during transit along downstream reaches. The unique combination of spatial and temporal continuous measurements of pCO2 provide insights on estuarine CO2 pulses that might have resulted from the interplay between high loads of CO2 and organic C of anthropogenic origin and their priming effects on estuarine microbial processing of terrigenous and algal organic matter.",

            "abstract": "We are investigating the implications for use of satellite data in operational streamflow prediction. Specifically, the consequence of potential hydrologic model structure deficiencies on the ability to achieve improved forecast accuracy through the use of satellite data. We want to understand why advanced data do not lead to improved streamflow simulations by exploring how various fluxes and states differ among models of increasing complexity. In a series of prior studies, we investigated the use of a daily satellite-derived potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimate as input to the National Weather Service (NWS) streamflow forecast models for watersheds in the Upper Mississippi and Red river basins. Although the spatial PET product appears to represent the day-to-day variability in PET more realistically than current climatological methods used by the NWS, the impact of the satellite data on streamflow simulations results in slightly poorer model efficiency overall. Analysis of the model states indicates the model progresses differently between simulations with baseline PET and the satellite-derived PET input, though variation in streamflow simulations overall is negligible. For instance, the upper zone states, responsible for the high flows of a hydrograph, show a profound difference, while simulation of the peak flows tend to show little variation in the timing and magnitude. Using the spatial PET input, the lower zone states show improvement with simulating the recession limb and baseflow portion of the hydrograph. We anticipate that through a better understanding of the relationship between model structure, model states, and simulated streamflow we will be able to diagnose why simulations of discharge from the forecast model have failed to improve when provided seemingly more representative input data. Identifying model limitations are critical to demonstrating the full benefit of a satellite data for operational use.",

In particular, our detector is tuned to capture E-region irregularities and various other events such as meteors, aircraft, and ambiguities that result from poor transmission of signals or noise interference. The detection stage applies to passive radar images with pixels normalized to a defined value range. To separate the background, we apply a thresholding value and an area cuttoff to keep regions with connected pixels of a minimum size; for each particular image, these parameters can be determined algorithmically in two ways through our ExplainedEntropy (EE) and MaximumRegionArea (MRA) techniques. EE identifies the smallest set of regions that explain the most entropy of the image. MRA sets the area threshold to be a function of the largest region size. The classification stage picks up on these detected areas and applies neural networks and random forests to the image feature space. This way we are able categorize images based on their scientific content and make them searchable for scientists.\nA training set of real radar images was available to evaluate our approach and its adaptivity. Based on these labeled real images, we also evaluated the robustness of the detection with enhanced set of perturbed images that were generated through a model-based simulator. The simulator also allowed for controlled experiments in the amount of perturbation and noise added, to precisely characterize the operation ranges of our machine learning algorithms.

            "abstract": "Water sources in California are derived predominantly from precipitation (mostly during the winter time) and storage in the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada. With California facing one of the most severe droughts on record, it is important to understand the factors influencing precipitation and snowpack for water management and hydropower operation. Recent observational and numerical modeling studies have shown that aerosol pollutants can substantially change precipitation and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada. However, previous studies focused only on one of the aerosol effects or just focus on a single event. A complete view on regional climate effects of aerosol on precipitation and snowpack in California is not delivered yet.\nIn this study, we use a fully coupled aerosol-meteorology-snowpack model (WRF-Chem-SNICAR) to investigate aerosol impacts on regional climate in California, with a focus on precipitation and snowpack. We will evaluate the performance of the WRF-Chem-SNICAR model on simulating regional climate in California. Sensitivity experiments will be conducted to disentangle the relative roles of each aerosol effect, such as aerosol radiation interaction vs. aerosol cloud interaction and aerosol snowpack interaction, local emission vs. long-range transport etc.",

The Chuacús Complex is constitute by a polymetamorphic high-pressure sequence of quartzofeldespathic orto and para-gneiss, calcsilicate, marble, pelitic schist, and amphibolite with eclogite relicts.\nTwo representative garnet amphibolite samples were selected for detailed study. This rocks present a mineral assemblage composed of garnet, calcic amphibole, sodic-calcic amphibole, sodic plagioclase, quartz, minor zoisite and white mica. Both samples contain considerable amounts of titanite and ilmenite. Garnet varies in grain shape, size and show different textural features. The coarse-grained porphydoblasts are mostly subhedral to euhedral and exhibit prograde compositional zoning, with increasing spessartine content to the core (Alm44-49Grs32-34Sps18-20Pyr1.1-1.5), and increasing almandine and pyrope component to the rim (Alm64-66 Grs29-31Pyr3.3-4.6Sps0.37-0.96). Amphibole exhibit a constant grain size and shape. Its chemical composition varies along the samples from calcic amphibole (Si=6.57-6.93; Xmg=0.41-0.66) to sodic-calcic amphibole (Si=6.61-6.69; Xmg=0.49-0.54).\nIn order to constrain the P-T evolution, multiequilibria thermobarometry was combined with thermodynamic modeling. Multiequilibria thermobarometry calculated in the system NCKMnFMASHTO shows a P-T evolution from 15 kbar and 400 °C to 19 kbar and 540 °C. In the other hand, preliminary equilibrium assemblage diagrams calculated in the system NCKFMASHTO shows a P-T evolution from 11 kbar to 13.5 kbar and from 550 °C to 650°C, for the observed mineral assemblage.\nThis work describes the textural, paragenetic and thermobarometric features from this lithotype and their petrogenetic implications are discussed.

Mn, a postulated neurotoxin is known to cause neuromuscular problems, inhibition of neurological development particularly in children. The health impacts from higher bioavailable proportions of As is well known in being a Class I carcinogen. The discovery of this additional contaminant in the already As afflicted regions of SE Asia poses serious implications for millions of inhabitants. The current study aims to address three objectives in understanding biogeochemical cycling of Mn and As in groundwaters: i) the occurrence and overall distribution (lateral and temporal) of groundwater Mn and As; ii) characterization of the dissolved organic matter and microbial content and the resultant effects that are imposed on dissolved As and Mn; and iii) the relationship between Mn, As, and various other inorganic constituents and their impact on the subsequent release of Mn, on top of As. A three year time series of chemical data for the dissolved constituents from six villages in Murshidabad will be presented. Hariharpara, Beldanga, Naoda villages contain reducing groundwaters (mean Mn: 0.93mg/L); Nabagram, Kandi, Khidirpore demonstrate oxidizing aquifers (Mn: 0.74mg/L). Eighty-three percent of the wells surveyed contain Mn levels that exceed the recommended WHO limit of 0.4 mg/L. Dissolved As within the same locations show a range from <10µg/L to ~4000 µg/L. DOC values demonstrate a positive correlation with Mn in reducing and a negative correlation in oxidizing environments. The reducing aquifers are also high in As and DOC, indicating that the microbially mediated reductive dissolution of As-sorbed onto Fe-Mn mineral phases is probable. Fluorescence analyses of dissolved OM, solidphase modeling of Mn speciation are being combined in this study for more insight into the mechanisms of Mn release and its relation if any to As release.",

            "abstract": "The widely observed differences between net carbon dioxide (CO2) flux estimates derived from eddy covariance systems deploying open- and closed-path infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) pose a major challenge for site intercomparison studies. Our limited knowledge about potential systematic biases in the derivation of CO2 flux estimates by these two types of systems hampers our ability to detect significant differences in CO2 flux measurements made at contrasting ecosystems. Here we explore potential systematic biases in CO2 fluxes measured with two open-path IRGAs. Comparison of fluxes from open- (EC150 & IRGASON, Campbell Scientific Inc.) and (en)closed-path IRGAs (LI7000 & LI7200, LI-COR Biosciences) at a northern peatland and a northern boreal forest site revealed consistent differences in CO2 flux estimates across a wide range of environmental conditions. These differences directly scaled with the magnitude of the sensible heat flux indicating a selectively systematic bias in open-path CO2 flux measurements due to the temperature sensitivity of the CO2 density measurements. We present two empirical correction procedures: the “direct” approach requires data from a limited period of concurrent CO2 flux measurements by open- and closed-path IRGA-based eddy covariance systems, whereas the second approach only requires wintertime CO2 flux data from the open-path IRGA. The “direct” approach effectively removes the bias in the open-path CO2 flux measurements and results in remaining differences with the closed-path CO2 fluxes smaller than 0.5 µmol m-2 s-1. In contrast, the “wintertime” approach seems to overcompensate for the sensible heat effects with differences remaining between 0.9 µmol m-2 s-1 and 1.8 µmol m-2 s-1. When a high-frequency air temperature is used to compensate for the temperature sensitivity of the CO2 density measurements, open- and closed-path CO2 flux agree within ±0.5 µmol m-2 s-1, similar to the “direct” post-processing correction. These findings highlight the importance of corrections for systematic errors in open-path CO2 flux measurements to ensure intercomparability among years at a given ecosystem and among contrasting ecosystems",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is being considered as an approach to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions from large stationary sources such as coal fired power plants and natural gas processing plants. Computer modeling is an essential tool for site design and operational planning as it allows prediction of the pressure response as well as the migration of both CO2 and brine in the subsurface. Many processes, such as buoyancy, hysteresis, geomechanics and geochemistry, can have important impacts on the system. While all of the processes can be taken into account simultaneously, the resulting models are computationally very expensive and require large numbers of parameters which are often uncertain or unknown. In many cases of practical interest, the computational and data requirements can be reduced by choosing a smaller domain and/or by neglecting or simplifying certain processes. This leads to a series of models with different complexity, ranging from coupled multi-physics, multi-phase three-dimensional models to semi-analytical single-phase models. Under certain conditions the three-dimensional equations can be integrated in the vertical direction, leading to a suite of two-dimensional multi-phase models, termed vertically-integrated models. These models are either solved numerically or simplified further (e.g., assumption of vertical equilibrium) to allow analytical or semi-analytical solutions. This presentation focuses on how different vertically-integrated models have been applied to the simulation of CO2 and brine migration during CCS projects. Several example sites, such as the Illinois Basin and the Wabamun Lake region of the Alberta Basin, are discussed to show how vertically-integrated models can be used to gain understanding of CCS operations.",

It is where Supertyphoon Haiyan formed, the strongest storm to hit land, which provided a window into the hydrologic impacts of an extreme storm. Through detailed documentation of flood levels, groundwater table elevations and salinity, electrical resistivity, and modeling, we found that Haiyan's storm surge reached 7 m above sea level along Samar Island, Philippines, which led to contamination of crucial aquifers by infiltrating seawater. A contaminated surficial aquifer will take years to recover. Groundwater in an underlying deeper aquifer saw widespread contamination immediately after the storm, but here salinity has decreased significantly after 8 months. However, this deeper aquifer remains vulnerable to seawater slowly percolating through the surficial aquifer. As warmer seas generate more powerful storms, the vulnerability of aquifers to persistent contamination from intense storm surges is a growing concern for coastal communities.",

            "abstract": "Many aspects of disturbance processes can have large impacts on the composition of plant communities, and associated changes in land cover type in turn have biogeochemical feedbacks to climate. In particular, changes to disturbance regimes can potentially change the number and stability of equilibrial states, and plant community states can differ dramatically in their carbon (C) dynamics, energy balance, and hydrology.\nUsing the Klamath region of northern California as a model system, we present a theoretical analysis of how changes to climate and associated fire dynamics can disrupt high-carbon, long-lived conifer forests and replace them with shrub-chaparral communities that have much lower biomass and are more pyrogenic.\nSpecifically, we develop a tractable model of plant community dynamics, structured by size class, life-history traits, lottery-type competition, and species-specific responses to disturbance. We assess the stability of different states in terms of disturbance frequency and intensity, and quantitatively partition long-term low-density population growth rates into mechanisms that influence critical transitions from stable to bistable behavior.\nOur findings show how different aspects of disturbance act and interact to control competitive outcomes and stable states, hence ecosystem-atmosphere C exchange. Forests tend to dominate in low frequency and intensity regimes, while shrubs dominate at high fire frequency and intensity. In other regimes, the system is bistable, and the fate of the system depends both on initial conditions and random chance. Importantly, the system can cross a critical threshold where hysteresis prevents easy return to the prior forested state. We conclude that changes in disturbance-recovery dynamics driven by projected climate change can shift this system away from forest dominated in the direction of shrub-dominated landscape. This will result in a large net C release from the landscape, and alter biophysical ecosystem-climate interactions.",

Not only may these particles themselves be undesirable contaminants, but they can also aid in the transport of smaller, molecular-scale contaminants by chemical attachment. In this research, we examined the influence that air-water interfaces (AWI) and air-water-solid contact lines (AWS) have on colloid deposition and mobilization in three-dimensional systems. We used x-ray microtomography to visualize the transport of hydrophobic colloids as they move through a partially saturated glass bead pack. Drainage and imbibition experiments were conducted using syringe pumps to control the flow of a colloid suspension through the porous media at 0.6 mL/hr. The high ionic strength fluid was adjusted to a pH of 9.5 and a concentration of 1.0 mol/L KI. During the drainage and imbibition, the flow was periodically halted and allowed to equilibrate before collecting the microtomography scans. Dopants were used to enhance the contrast between the four phases (water, air, beads, and colloids), including potassium iodide dissolved in the fluid, and an outer layer of silver coating the colloids. We hypothesized that AWIs and AWSs will scour and mobilize a significant percentage of colloids, and therefore reduce the concentration of colloids along the vertical profile of the column. The concentration of potassium iodide, and thus the ionic strength, necessary for adequate image segmentation was also explored in separate experiments so that the influence of ionic strength on colloid deposition and mobilization can be studied.",

            "abstract": "The 10-day explosive phase of the May 2008 eruption of Chaitén Volcano, Chile, draped adjacent watersheds with a few cm to >1m of tephra. Subsequent lava-dome collapses generated pyroclastic flows that delivered additional channel sediment. During waning phases of explosive activity, modest rainfall (~20 mm in 24 hours; peak intensity ~3–5 mm h-1) triggered an exceptional sediment flush from multiple watersheds. This flush swiftly aggraded channels by many meters, mostly by fluvial transport; in some basins, earliest transport was by hyperconcentrated-flow lahars. Ten km from the volcano, Chaitén River avulsed through coastal Chaitén town owing to 7m of channel aggradation. That aggradation and delta growth downstream of the abandoned and newly avulsed channels allow estimates of post-disturbance bedload flux. On the basis of pre-eruption bathymetry of Chaitén Bay (by the Chilean Navy) and measurements of delta-surface changes from satellite images, we derived time-series estimates of averaged delta volume. The initial flush from 11–14 May 2008 deposited 1–3 million m3 of sandy sediment at the mouth of Chaitén River. By 26 May, after channel avulsion, a second delta contained about 7 million m3 sediment. Delta volume increased at a logarithmically decreasing rate until late 2011 when it reached about 16 million m3. Subsequently, delta area and volume decreased slightly by wave erosion. The deltas, especially the latter, grew through bedload transport. Sediment particles in the river channel and on deltas are composed of lithic rhyolite and poorly vesicular pumice sand. Channel width through town ranged from 50 to 75 m. Rates of channel aggradation and delta growth, channel width, and an assumed bulk deposit density of 1100–1500 kg/m3 indicate that unit-width bedload flux just before and shortly after avulsion (~14–15 May) was exceptional and perhaps as great as 100–200 kg/m/s. From October 2008 to December 2011, unit-width flux rates declined logarithmically from about 6 to 0.1 kg/m/s.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) storage in complex terrain is challenging due to high spatial variability. Generally, the challenge is met by transforming point data to the entire landscape using surrogate, spatially-distributed, variables like elevation or precipitation. In many ecosystems, remotely sensed information on above-ground vegetation (e.g. NDVI) is a good predictor of below-ground carbon stocks. In this project, we are attempting to improve this predictive method by incorporating LiDAR-derived vegetation indices. LiDAR provides a mechanism for improved characterization of aboveground vegetation by providing structural parameters such as vegetation height and biomass. In this study, a random forest model is used to predict SOC using a suite of LiDAR-derived vegetation indices as predictor variables. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) is an ideal location for a study of this type since it encompasses a strong elevation/precipitation gradient that supports lower biomass sagebrush ecosystems at low elevations and forests with more biomass at higher elevations. Sagebrush ecosystems composed of Wyoming, Low and Mountain Sagebrush have SOC values ranging from .4 to 1% (top 30 cm), while higher biomass ecosystems composed of aspen, juniper and fir have SOC values approaching 4% (top 30 cm). Large differences in SOC have been observed between canopy and interspace locations and high resolution vegetation information is likely to explain plot scale variability in SOC. Mapping of the SOC reservoir will help identify underlying controls on SOC distribution and provide insight into which processes are most important in determining SOC in semi-arid mountainous regions. In addition, airborne LiDAR has the potential to characterize vegetation communities at a high resolution and could be a tool for improving estimates of SOC at larger scales.",

            "abstract": "Recent intraplate volcanism in Madagascar (since 1 Ma) is currently unexplored through broadband seismic methods. The Madagascar continental crust fragment is located between the hotspots of Réunion and Comoros may allow for a possible deep source. However, it remains unclear what the origin may be or what pathway the rising asthenosphere may take. Geochemical analysis of recent basalts [e.g. Bardintzeff et al., 2010] appears to suggest that melting may only occur in the lower lithospheric mantle, although the enriched, alkaline volcanism in the north shows some similarities to a Comoros hotspot source with a continental crust influence. The stress regime of Madagascar is E–W extensional, so reactivated NNW–SSE oriented faults, remnant from Madagascar’s split from Africa, may provide potential pathways for rising magma. The MACOMO (MAdagascar COmoros MOzambique) seismic experiment deployed 25 broadband stations across the Madagascar and 6 stations in Mozambique for up to two years. Seismic data are supplemented with those collected by the RHUM-RUM (Réunion Hotspot and Upper Mantle - Réunions Unterer Mantel) land stations, 7 stations from the Madagascar Seismic Profile experiment, both deployed at the same time as MACOMO, as well as 4 permanent GSN, GEOSCOPE and GEOFON stations. Using the adaptive stacking method of Rawlinson and Kennett [2004], we analyze relative travel times of teleseismic P- and S-waves to generate the first tomographic models of the mantle beneath Madagascar. We combine the models with shallow structure information gained from surface wave and ambient noise tomography that shows low velocity zones beneath the central (Itasy/Ankaratra) and northern (Nosy Bé/Massif d’Ambre) volcanic regions extending to depths of at least 150 km. Preliminary P-wave finite-frequency tomography results (using the method of Schmandt and Humphreys, [2010]) from 181 events suggests that the central low velocity zone may extend even deeper into the asthenospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests in the sporadic permafrost zone have been shown to decline at the expense of wetlands following permafrost disappearance. These land cover changes cause shifts in ecosystem properties and affect biosphere-atmosphere interactions. The goal of our study is to examine the effects of permafrost disappearance on landscape-scale sensible (H) and latent heat fluxes (LE) and related potential feedbacks on regional air temperatures (Ta)\nWe use a combination of nested eddy covariance flux towers, flux footprint and planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamic modelling, and MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing products to resolve spatio-temporal dynamics in H and LE at the landscape scale at Scotty Creek, NWT (61º18’ N; 121º18’ W) and in radiometric land surface temperatures (LST) at the regional scale across the southern Taiga Plains in the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada. The heterogeneous landscape comprises boreal forests with permafrost and permafrost-free wetlands.\nOur results show that H above the heterogeneous landscape was about twice as high as above a nearby treeless, permafrost-free bog. In contrast, landscape-scale LE was only about 50 % of LE over the bog. These differences were primarily driven by higher heat transfer efficiency of the aerodynamically rougher forest and lower albedo of the forest compared to the bog (about 10 % lower during summer and about 40 % lower during late winter). Aerodynamic LST increased with the fraction of forest in the flux footprints. This effect was strongest (r2 = 0.55, slope = 0.06 K per % forest) at the end of winter when contrasts in albedo are largest. Bulk surface conductance increased with the fraction of wetlands in the footprints. On a regional scale, radiometric MODIS LST increased with tree cover during the snow cover period (0.06 K per % tree cover), but decreased during the summer (-0.04 K per % tree cover). Modelling results showed that a shift from the current heterogeneous to a homogeneous bog landscape could lead to a decrease in the maximum PBL height by about 700 m and to a decrease in regional Ta by 1 to 2 K. Our results show clearly that permafrost degradation and forest cover shifts will affect local and regional surface energy balances in the boreal zone and could represent important modifiers of future climates.",

            "abstract": "Cities have an opportunity to become more resilient to future climate change through investments made in urban infrastructure today. However, most cities lack access to credible high-resolution climate change projection information needed to assess and address potential vulnerabilities from future climate variability. Therefore, we present an integrated framework for developing an urban climate adaptation tool (Urban-CAT). Urban-CAT consists of four modules. Firstly, it provides climate projections at different spatial resolutions for quantifying urban landscape. Secondly, this projected data is combined with socio-economic data using leading and lagging indicators for assessing landscape vulnerability to climate extremes (e.g., urban flooding). Thirdly, a neighborhood scale modeling approach is presented for identifying candidate areas for adaptation strategies (e.g., green infrastructure as an adaptation strategy for urban flooding). Finally, all these capabilities are made available as a web-based tool to support decision-making and communication at the neighborhood and city levels. In this paper, we present some of the methods that drive each of the modules and demo some of the capabilities available to-date using the City of Knoxville in Tennessee as a case study.",

            "abstract": "The Tri-State lead and zinc mining district in SW Missouri, SE Kansas, and NE Oklahoma encompasses nearly 2,500 sq. miles of land and at its peak accounted for half of the US zinc (23,000,000 tons) production that surpassed one billion dollars in economic value. Once these lead and zinc rich ores were extracted, mining and milling sites were abandoned leaving behind a new landscape with numerous environmental challenges. Since 1970, most of the sites have been targeted for remediation and reclamation by federal and state agencies including the EPA. In order to capture the full extent of the impact of lead and zinc mining in the Tri-State area, numerous geoscientific approaches including data from small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were employed to investigate the influence of mining in the study area. The study presented here is focused on observational assessment of the existing landscape using multiple commercial high-definitions data from UAVs to study different sites across areas of concern in the three states. Primary results (images) gathered and analyzed DEM and GIS data from abandoned mines showed the potential to provide a quick snapshot of successful or unsuccessful remediated areas. Although research and remediation of the Tri-State mining district are a continuous process, evidence from this geomorphic study suggest that UAVs can provide a quick overview of the remediated landscape or serve as a primary background tool for a more detail site-specific environmental study.",

The MMS fleet encountered many structures with unambiguously small-scale spatial gradient in magnetic field (comparable to the separation of the fleet), indicating the existence of very thin current sheets in this near-tail region. During this commissioning phase, the MMS spacecraft were in a string of pearls configuration, not ideally suitable for “curlometer” determination of the current density. Thus the current density and thickness of the sheets are only roughly determined using reasonable assumptions. In this study we correlate the current sheet’s location and thickness with solar wind conditions and the ground magnetic field records.",

            "abstract": "We use a three-dimensional hybrid plasma model to study the global aspects of Jovian plasma interaction with Ganymede. Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, is a unique body for several reasons: (1) it is the only known moon that has its own intrinsic magnetic field, (2) its dipole magnetic moment is large enough to form an embedded magnetosphere within the magnetosphere of Jupiter, and (3) it has a bound neutral atmosphere and an ionosphere, mainly composed of molecular and atomic oxygen, that interact with the co-rotating plasma of Jupiter. Since Jupiter's magnetic dipole moment tilts nearly 10o from its rotation axis, Ganymede passes two distinct plasma environments on its orbit around Jupiter (which is slightly inclined to the Jovian equator): (1) the plasma sheet, where the plasma density is nearly 5 cm-3 and plasma beta is slightly larger than one, and (2) outside the plasma sheet where the plasma density is lower than that in the sheet and plasma beta is smaller than one. The sonic and Alfvénic Mach numbers, however, are both smaller than one in both of these regions. Thus, the formation of a bow shock upstream of Ganymede is not expected. The plasma interaction with Ganymede has been studied before using MHD simulations and the formation of a magnetopause, magnetotail, and Alfvén wings were examined. We use our three-dimensional hybrid model to compare the global effects of the two plasma regimes on the interaction with Ganymede. We compare our simulation results with Galileo flyby observations, and explain differences between our mode with MHD simulation results. We also provide a global map of plasma precipitation into the surface of Ganymede which has direct impact on Ganymede's atmosphere/exosphere formation.",

On-disk plumes are analogous to polar/coronal-hole plumes but have not been studied in detail in the past. We research their formation and characteristics, such as lifetime, intensity and magnetic setting at the feet. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images in the 171 Å filter and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) line-of-sight magnetograms, both from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), are analyzed with the IDL SolarSoftWare package and used to study the plumes. We find that on-disk plumes form at the places of converging magnetic fields, and disappear when those fields disperse. However, plumes disappear after nearby events, such as flares, or with the emergence of opposite polarity. The lifetime of each plume tends to be several days, although some appear and disappear within several hours. On-disk plumes outline magnetic fields close to the sun, allowing a better understanding of fine magnetic structures than before. Additionally, since plumes must be heated to around 600,000 K to be visible in 171 Å, their formation and characteristics could tell about how they, and therefore the corona, are heated.",

            "abstract": "The Landsat archive is increasingly being used to detect trends in the occurrence of forest disturbance. Beyond information about the amount of area affected, forest managers need to know if and how disturbance regimes change. The National Forest System (NFS) has developed a comprehensive plan for carbon monitoring that requires a detailed temporal mapping of forest disturbances across 75 million hectares. A long-term annual time series that shows the timing, extent, and type of disturbance beginning in 1990 and ending in 2011 has been prepared for several USFS Regions, including the Northern Region. Our mapping starts with an automated detection of annual disturbances using a time series of historical Landsat imagery. Automated detections are meticulously inspected, corrected and labeled using various USFS ancillary datasets. The resulting maps of verified disturbance show the timing and types are fires, harvests, insect activity, disease, and abiotic (wind, drought, avalanche) damage. Also, the magnitude of each change event is modeled in terms of the proportion of canopy cover lost. The sequence of disturbances for every pixel since 1990 has been consistently mapped and is available across the entirety of NFS. Our datasets contain sufficient information to describe the frequency of stand replacement, as well as how often disturbance results in only a partial loss of canopy. This information provides empirical insight into how an initial disturbance may predispose a stand to further disturbance, and it also show a climatic signal in the occurrence of processes such as fire and insect epidemics. Thus, we have the information to model the likelihood of occurrence of certain disturbances after a given event (i.e. if we have a fire in the past what does that do to the likelihood of occurrence of insects in the future). Here, we explore if previous disturbance history is a reliable predictor of additional disturbance in the future and we present results of applying logistic regression to obtain predicted probabilities of occurrence of additional disturbance types. We describe responses in additional disturbance and prominent trends for each major forest type.",

            "abstract": "Energy flow through ecosystems plays a critical role in processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales, from monthly growing season length of landscapes to sub-diurnal responses of soil respiration to temperature, photosynthesis and water inputs. The interaction of solar radiation and ecosystems is complex with terrestrial canopies and aquatic structure both connecting above- and below-ground processes via energy fluxes. Previous work by Leuning et al has shown that at 30-minute timescales, only 8% of eddy covariance sites in the La Thuile dataset observe energy closure and when averaged to 24-hour timescales, this goes up to 45%. This work examines the effect of temporal lags in energy storage in both terrestrial (shrub and forest) and aquatic (lake) ecosystems. Analyses show energy storage terms have unique temporal lags that vary between ecosystem and time of year, from having zero lag to several hour timescales within terrestrial ecosystems, depending primarily on water content. Large differences between ecosystem types are also highlighted as aquatic ecosystems have lags that range between daily and monthly timescales. Furthermore, ecosystem disturbance can alter time lags as well and results from a native bark beetle disturbance show vegetation lag decreasing while soil lag increasing following changes in water content. Energy storage lags can improve site energy closure by several percent, and these results will lead to a better understanding of surface energy budget closure, an as-of-yet unresolved issue in the flux community, as well as highlighting the importance of time-dependency of ecosystem energy fluxes as a unique method to examine ecosystem processes.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying transpiration in landscapes remains a challenging task. Especially bridging the gap between tree- or plot-scale measurements and information on the landscape scale which could be gathered from remote sensing, digital elevation models or forest inventories still poses considerable problems. These problems reach from errors associated with the measurements to the reliability of representing transpiration amounts by large-scale data.\nIn this study we analyse spatial patterns of sap velocity to identify the importance of tree- or site-specific characteristics for transpiration at the landscape scale. We set up multiple linear regression models for a dataset of daily sap velocities for 61 trees at 24 locations in mixed beech and oak forests in a catchment in Luxemburg, recorded during the growing season of 2014. As predictors we use the tree-specific characteristics species, diameter and height and the site-specific characteristics basal area and number of stems for the respective stands as well as landscape attributes such as aspect, slope position and geology. Analysing the importance of these predictors could be useful for upscaling tree-based measurements to the landscape-scale based on data from digital elevation models, forest inventories or remote sensing. We also assess the temporal dynamics of the importance of tree- vs. site-specific predictors and link them to typical controls for sap flow such as atmospheric demand and soil moisture.\nFirst results indicate that site-specific predictors contribute considerably to the explained variance of the linear models. However, remotely sensed information explained very little of the variation in daily sap velocity patterns. Further analyses will quantify to which extent we can use the landscape-scale information from digital elevation models, geology and forest inventories to upscale tree-based transpiration estimates.",

Here, we provide insights on the process dominating the ecohydrology of the tropical alpine biome (i.e., páramo) of the Zhurucay River Ecohydrological Observatory. The study site is located in south Ecuador between 3400-3900 m in elevation. We used a nested monitoring system with eight catchments (20-753 ha) to measure hydrometric data since December 2010. Biweekly samples of rainfall, streamflow, and soil water at low tension were collected for three years (May 2011-May2014) and analyzed for water stable isotopes. We conducted an isotopic characterization of rainfall, streamflow, and soil waters to investigate runoff generation. These data were also integrated into a lumped model to estimate the mean transit time (MTT) and to investigate landscape features that control its variability. The isotopic characterization evidenced that the water stored in the shallow organic horizon of the Histosol soils (Andean wetlands) located near the streams is the major contributor of water to the streams year-round, whereas the water draining through the hillslope soils, the Andosols, regulates discharge by recharging the wetlands at the valley bottoms. The MTT evaluation indicated relatively short MTTs (0.15-0.73 yr) linked to short subsurface flow paths of water. We also found evidence for topographic controls on the MTT variability. These results reveal that: 1) the ecohydrology of this ecosystem is dominated by shallow subsurface flow in the organic horizon of the soils and 2) the combination of the high storage capacity of the Andean wetlands and the slope of the catchments controls runoff generation and the high water regulation capacity of the ecosystem.",

However, CMIP5 models do account for the fresh water from precipitation minus evaporation (P-E). On average in CMIP5 models P- E reaching the Southern Ocean has increased to a present value of about 2600 Gt yr-1 greater than pre-industrial times and 3-8 times larger than estimates of the mass imbalance of Antarctic ice sheets and shelves. Two sets of model experiments were conducted from 1980-2013 in CESM1-CAM5 artificially distributing fresh water either at the ocean surface according to an estimate of iceberg melt, or at the ice shelf fronts at depth. An anomalous reduction in vertical advection of heat into the surface mixed layer resulted in sea surface cooling at high southern latitudes, and an associated increase in sea ice area. A freshwater enhancement of 1780 Gt yr-1 (approximately 1.3 times either present day basal melt or iceberg calving freshwater fluxes) raised the sea ice total area by 1×106 km2. Yet, even a freshwater enhancement up to 2670 Gt yr-1 was insufficient to offset the sea ice decline due to anthropogenic forcing for any period of 20 years or longer. Further, the sea ice response was found to be insensitive to the depth of fresh water injection.",

            "abstract": "Understanding timescales and mechanisms of magma emplacement and storage in the upper crust is fundamental for evaluating the controls on melt mobility and the tempo and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. U-Pb dating on zircons is commonly used to estimate these processes in upper crustal reservoirs, but increasing precision in zircon ages has lead to increasing difficulty interpreting them in terms of melt emplacement and storage. We present >150 ID-TIMS U/Pb dates on zircon coupled to numerical thermal simulations that 1) constrain the emplacement history and thermal evolution of upper-crustal reservoirs with analytical precision of thousands of years, 2) aid interpretation of complex age spectra and identification of zircon inherited from deeper crustal levels, and 3) provide insight into time-integrated rates of magma recharge and duration of potential eruption windows in active system. Our study of the Late Miocene Mt. Capanne intrusion (Elba, Italy) – a well-documented example of arc-related laccolith emplaced in the upper-continental crust - shows that this reservoir was incrementally built in minimum 300’000 years by accretion of numerous batches of magma. A variety of numerically simulated emplacement scenarios show that maximum volumes that can be erupted correspond to the volume of each pulse injected. Our results also require that the majority of zircon crystallization occurred in zircon-saturated reservoirs at deeper crustal levels prior to final magma emplacement and cooling, which has implications for using zircon U-Pb geochronology to infer upper crustal magma residence times and for accurate interpretation of volcanic ashbed geochronologic data.",

            "abstract": "Mapping bedrock depth is useful for earthquake hazard analysis, subsurface water transport, and other applications. Recently, collaborative experimentation provided an opportunity to explore a mapping method. Near surface glacial till shear wave velocity (Vs) where data is available from an array of 3-component seismometers were studied for this experiment. Vs is related to depth to bedrock (h) and fundamental resonance (Fo); Fo = Vs/(4h). The H/V spectral peak frequency of recordings from a 3-component seismometer yields a fundamental resonance estimate. Where a suitable average Vs is established, the depth to bedrock can be calculated at every seismometer. 3-component seismometer data was provided by Spectraseis. Geophones, seismographs, and an extra 3-component seismometer were provided by Wright State University for this study.\nFor Vs analysis, three MASW surveys were conducted near the seismometer array. SurfSeis3© was used for processing MASW data. Overtones from complicated bedrock structure and great bedrock depth are improved by combining overtones from multiple source offsets from each survey. From MASW Vs and depth to bedrock results, theoretical fundamental resonance (Fo) was calculated and compared with the H/V peak spectral frequency measured by a seismometer at selected sites and processed by Geopsy processing software. Calculated bedrock depths from all geophysical data were compared with measured bedrock depths at nearby water wells and oil and gas wells provided by ODNR. Vs and depth to bedrock results from MASW produced similar calculated fundamental resonances to the H/V approximations by respective seismometers.\nBedrock mapping was performed upon verifying the correlation between the theoretical fundamental resonance and H/V peak frequencies. Contour maps were generated using ArcGIS®. Contour lines interpolated from local wells were compared with the depths calculated from H/V analysis. Bedrock depths calculated from the seismometer array correlate with the major trends indicated by the surrounding wells. A final contour map was developed from depth to bedrock measured by all wells and depths calculated from the average Vs and estimated resonance at select Spectraseis 3-component seismometers.",

            "abstract": "Langmuir waves are commonly observed in the upstream regions of planetary and interplanetary shock. Solar wind electrons accelerated at the shock front are reflected back into the solar wind and can form electron beams. In regions with beams, the electron distribution becomes unstable and electrostatic waves can be generated. The process of generation and the evolution of electrostatic waves strongly depends on the solar wind electron distribution and generally exhibits complex behavior. Langmuir waves can be identified as intense narrowband emission at a frequency very close to the local plasma frequency and weaker broadband waves below and above the plasma frequency deeper in the downstream region. We present a detailed study of Langmuir waves detected upstream of the Saturnian bowshock by the Cassini spacecraft. Using data from the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS), Magnetometer (MAG) and Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) instruments we have analyzed several periods containing the extended waveform captures by the Wideband Receiver. Langmuir waves are a bursty emission highly controlled by variations in solar wind conditions. Unfortunately due to a combination of instrumental field of view and sampling period, it is often difficult to identify the electron distribution function that is unstable and able to generate Langmuir waves. We used an electrostatic version of particle-in-cell simulation of the Langmuir wave generation process to reproduce some of the more subtle observed spectral features and help understand the late stages of the instability and interactions in the solar wind plasma.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we will review recent developments in both active and passive Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) for soil moisture monitoring. DTS involves using fiber-optic cables to measure temperature at sub-meter resolution along cables up to several kilometers in length. Soil thermal properties depend on soil moisture. Hence, temperature variations either in response to externally-applied heating (active) or the response to net radiation (passive) can be monitored and used to infer soil moisture.\nDTS occupies a unique measurement niche, potentially providing soil moisture information at sub-meter resolution over extents on the order of km at sub-daily time steps. It complements observations from point sensors to other innovative measurement techniques like cosmic ray neutron detection methods and GPS reflectometry. DTS is being developed as a tool for the validation of soil moisture observations from remote sensing and for hydrological field investigations.\nHere, we will discuss both technological and theoretical advances in active and passive DTS for soil moisture monitoring. We will present data from new installations in the Netherlands and the USA to illustrate recent developments. In particular, we will focus on the value of combining temperature observations from DTS with physical models using data assimilation. In addition to yielding improved soil moisture and temperature profile estimates, recent research has shown the potential to also derive information on the soil thermal and hydraulic properties. We will conclude by outlining the current challenges, with particular emphasis on combining active and passive DTS.",

Within the HyperHydro network, a modeling workshop was held at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, on 9-12 June 2015. The goal of the workshop was to start the HyperHydro (H^2) experiment for comparing different large-scale hydrological models, at different spatial resolutions, from 50 km to 1 km. Model simulation results (e.g. discharge, soil moisture, evaporation, snow, groundwater depth, etc.) are evaluated to available observation data and compared across various models and resolutions.\nIn AGU 2015, we would like to present the results of this inter-comparison experiment. During the workshop in Utrecht, the models compared were CLM, LISFLOOD, mHM, ParFlow-CLM, PCR-GLOBWB, TerrSysMP, VIC and WaterGAP. We invite participation from the hydrology community on this experiment. As test-beds, we focus on two river basins: San Joaquin (~82000 km2) and Rhine (~185000 km2).

The course is made up of a series of short, myth-debunking lecture videos that can be strategically used in college courses. The videos and the visuals within have proven a great resource for an introductory college level climate change course. Methods for using the videos in both online and in-classroom courses will be presented, as well as student reactions and learning from the videos. The videos introduce and explain a climate science topic, then paraphrase a common climate change myth, explain why the myth is wrong by identifying the characteristic of climate denial used, and concludes by reinforcing the correct science. By focusing on common myths, the MOOC has made an archive of videos that can be used by anyone in need of a 5-minute response to debunk a myth. By also highlighting five characteristics of climate denial: fake experts, logical fallacies, impossible expectations, cherry picking, and conspiracy theories (FLICC), the videos also teach the viewer the skills they need to critically examine myths they may encounter in the real world on a variety of topics. The videos also include a series of expert scientist interviews that can be used to drive home points, as well as put some faces to the science. These videos are freely available outside of the MOOC and can be found under the relevant “Most used climate myths” section on the skepticalscience.com webpage, as well as directly on YouTube.

            "abstract": "The use of satellite remote sensing to estimate spatially resolved ground level air pollutant concentrations is increasing due to advancements in remote sensing technology and the limited number of surface observations. Satellite retrievals provide global, spatiotemporal air quality information and are used to track plumes, estimate human exposures, model emissions, and determine sources (i.e., natural versus anthropogenic) in regulatory applications. Ground level PM2.5 concentrations can be estimated using columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS, where the satellite retrieval serves as a spatial surrogate to simulate surface PM2.5 gradients. The spatial statistical models and MODIS AOD retrieval algorithms have been evaluated for the dark, vegetated eastern US, while the semi-arid western US continues to be an understudied region with associated complexity due to heterogeneous emissions, smoke from wildfires, and complex terrain.\nThe objective of this work is to evaluate the uncertainty of MODIS AOD retrievals by comparing with columnar AOD and surface PM2.5 measurements from AERONET and EPA networks. Data is analyzed from multiple stations in California and Nevada for three years where four major wildfires occurred. Results indicate that MODIS retrievals fail to estimate column-integrated aerosol pollution in the summer months. This is further investigated by quantifying the statistical relationships between MODIS AOD, AERONET AOD, and surface PM2.5 concentrations. Data analysis indicates that the distribution of MODIS AOD is significantly (p<0.05) different than AERONET AOD. Further, using the results of distributional and association analysis the impacts of MODIS AOD uncertainties on the spatial gradients are evaluated. Additionally, the relationships between these uncertainties and physical parameters in the retrieval algorithm (e.g., surface reflectance, Ångström Extinction Exponent) are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Uranium-thorium or Th-230 dating has proven to be an important tool in determining the timing of events in the late Quaternary. Among the major applications are: the timing of sea level change, the timing of continental climate change as preserved in cave archives, the timing of climate change in marine and ice core archives through correlation to Th-230 – dated cave records, and calibration of the radiocarbon timescale. The success of these applications has been driven by continuing technical advances in the measurement of the rare actinide isotopes, U-234 and Th-230. The advances have improved the precision, sensitivity, and accuracy of the measurements. The main factor in measurement improvement has been an increase of about 5 orders of magnitude (over the past 30 years) in the fraction of the sample that can be detected, dramatically improving counting statistics, as well as measurement sensitivity. The 5-order of magnitude improvement, comes largely from the shift to mass spectrometric measurement techniques, but also has resulted from subsequent improvement in ionization plus transmission efficiency. While additional improvement above the 5-order of magnitude figure may be possible, current efforts are focused on improving the accuracy of the measurements, standardizing gravimetric standards among laboratories, and shortening measurement times. These efforts will be discussed along with summary results of some of the major applications.",

Since LAEs are produced by the interaction between ions and the near-Earth exosphere (altitudes ~200-800 km), they are a global signature of how the ring current decays in response to solar wind conditions. In this “optically thick” region, an ENA readily becomes reionized, and an ion is readily neutralized. Therefore, emerging ENAs that contribute to the LAE signal (detectable several RE away) have undergone multiple charge exchange and electron stripping interactions. Accounting for the ~36 eV energy loss per interaction, we developed a model to quantify the total energy lost by emergent LAEs. The analytical tool is applied to an ensemble of moderate to large storms (including the recent 17 March and 23 June storms in 2015) to reconstruct the parent ion spectra from TWINS ENA images.

To assess these threats, it is vital to quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here we apply a novel Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, quantifying among-species variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms sharing taxonomic affinities or trophic position. Despite this, we detected a systematic difference in the direction and magnitude, but not seasonal timing, of phenological climate sensitivity among trophic levels. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups and are projected to lag behind phenological changes at lower trophic levels, potentially making them at higher risk of disconnection with seasonal resources.",

            "abstract": "The controlled outflows from a reservoir or dam are highly dependent on the decisions made by the reservoir operators, instead of a natural hydrological process. Difference exists between the natural upstream inflows to reservoirs, and the controlled outflows from reservoirs that supply the downstream users. With the decision maker’s awareness of changing climate, reservoir management requires adaptable means to incorporate more information into decision making, such as the consideration of policy and regulation, environmental constraints, dry/wet conditions, etc. In this paper, a reservoir outflow simulation model is presented, which incorporates one of the well-developed data-mining models (Classification and Regression Tree) to predict the complicated human-controlled reservoir outflows and extract the reservoir operation patterns. A shuffled cross-validation approach is further implemented to improve model’s predictive performance. An application study of 9 major reservoirs in California is carried out and the simulated results from different decision tree approaches are compared with observation, including original CART and Random Forest. The statistical measurements show that CART combined with the shuffled cross-validation scheme gives a better predictive performance over the other two methods, especially in simulating the peak flows. The results for simulated controlled outflow, storage changes and storage trajectories also show that the proposed model is able to consistently and reasonably predict the human’s reservoir operation decisions. In addition, we found that the operation in the Trinity Lake, Oroville Lake and Shasta Lake are greatly influenced by policy and regulation, while low elevation reservoirs are more sensitive to inflow amount than others.",

            "abstract": "Because of the high cost of extreme events and the growing evidence that global warming is likely to alter the statistical distribution of climate variables, detection and attribution of changes in the probability of extreme climate events has become a pressing topic for the scientific community, elected officials, and the public. While most of the emphasis has thus far focused on analyzing the climate variable of interest (most often temperature or precipitation, but also flooding and drought), there is an emerging emphasis on applying detection and attribution analysis techniques to the underlying physical causes of individual extreme events. This approach is promising in part because the underlying physical causes (such as atmospheric circulation patterns) can in some cases be more accurately represented in climate models than the more proximal climate variable (such as precipitation). In addition, and more scientifically critical, is the fact that the most extreme events result from a rare combination of interacting causes, often referred to as “ingredients”. Rare events will therefore always have a strong influence of “natural” variability. Analyzing the underlying physical mechanisms can therefore help to test whether there have been changes in the probability of the constituent conditions of an individual event, or whether the co-occurrence of causal conditions cannot be distinguished from random chance. This presentation will review approaches to applying detection/attribution analysis to the underlying physical causes of extreme events (including both “thermodynamic” and “dynamic” causes), and provide a number of case studies, including the role of frequency of atmospheric circulation patterns in the probability of hot, cold, wet and dry events.",

            "abstract": "Deformation bands play an important role in reservoir engineering, geological storage, underwater landslides and slow geological procedures. Various mechanisms can be involved at different scales and may be responsible for deformation bands. Mechanical and chemical degradation of the grain skeleton is a softening factor that can lead to compaction, shear or even dilation band formation [1]–[3]. The present study is twofold. On one hand it focuses on the mathematical modeling of chemically induced strain localization instabilities in porous rocks and on the other hand it explores the conditions for their creation [4], [5].\nIn a saturated porous rock, the progressive mechanical damage of the solid skeleton during deformation, results in the increase of the interface area of the reactants and consequently in the acceleration of the dissolution rate of the solid phase [6]. Under the presence of dissolving fluids the solid skeleton is degraded more rapidly (mass removal because of dissolution), the overall mechanical properties of the system diminish (contraction of the elastic domain – chemical softening), deformations increase and the solid skeleton is further damaged (intergranular fractures, debonding, breakage of the porous network etc.). Based on a micromechanical model, the conditions for deformation band triggering are investigated analytically. The heterogeneity of the microstructure in terms of chemical reactivity of the constituents of the REV is taken into account resulting in a characteristic internal length of the system. The post bifurcation behavior is finally studied both analytically and numerically revealing the thickness of the localized zone.\n",

            "abstract": "California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.",

            "abstract": "Proxy reconstructions of the late Pleistocene paleoclimate indicate that southwestern North America was significantly more wet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~21 ka) than in the present. Pluvial paleolakes were abundant throughout the Great Basin and as far south as the modern Mojave Desert. The source of precipitation that fed these lakes and the role of evaporation in the hydrologic balance are debated. A leading hypothesis is increased Pacific winter storm frequency as a result of the jet stream being split or shifted south by the North American ice sheets. Alternative hypotheses include enhanced monsoonal precipitation, a re-routing of the storm track across the continent, and/or reduced evaporation. Using LGM simulations from the PMIP3 ensemble and the LMDZ general circulation model, and comparing to proxy records of LGM precipitation in the region, we find that atmospheric rivers, narrow filaments of humid tropical air, were strengthened over the eastern Pacific during glacial intervals and directed into southern California. A strengthened Aleutian Low and a weakened North Pacific High produced a mean state conducive to this strong, south-shifted atmospheric river system, which enhanced moisture delivery into the southwestern part of the Great Basin.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates drivers of changing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export in the UK’s River Thames basin between 1884 and 2014. Specifically, we consider how the impacts of land-use change and population growth drive increases in DOC concentrations and fluxes at the basin outlet. Such key factors for the long-term increase in riverine DOC in temperate, mineral-soil catchments are still widely debated.\nFirst, we estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the Thames basin for the period. Second, we convert SOC losses due to land-use change into DOC loss to surface waters through runoff. Finally, we combine this input of DOC with an export coefficient model that considers catchment drivers for DOC release to the river. SOC stocks for each year are calculated from a large database of typical SOC levels for land-uses present in the Thames basin and are combined with literature values of transition times for SOC to adjust to a new level following land-use change. We also account for climate change effects on SOC stock due to temperature increases, which reduces SOC stocks as soil organic matter turnover rates increase.\nOur work shows that the major driver for DOC increase to the river Thames was the rise in the catchment population, where the increase in urban area was used as a proxy. This highlights the role of sewage effluent in contributing to the rise of fluvial DOC, even though wastewater treatments were in place since the early 1990s. Land-use change had significant but short-term impacts in the increase in DOC, mainly due to massive conversion of permanent grassland into arable land during World War II.",

These constitute the most accurate hybrid simulations of ion-scale turbulence ever presented so far, and let us explore a very wide range of scales, i.e., three decades in wave vectors simultaneously. We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we add a spectrum of in-plane large-scale magnetic and kinetic fluctuations, with energy equipartition and vanishing correlation. We perform a set of simulations with many different values of two fundamental parameters, i.e., the plasma beta, β, and the amplitude of the initial fluctuations, Brms, in order to investigate their relevance in determining the spectral properties of the turbulent cascade around ion scales. Once turbulence is fully developed, we observe the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations following a power law with a spectral index of -5/3 in the inertial range, with a spectral break around ion scales and a steeper power law in the sub-ion range. The scale at which the steepening of the spectrum occurs changes when exploring the (β,Brms) parameter space. Such a movement of the spectral break is clearer when looking at the spectra of the parallel magnetic fluctuations and of the density fluctuations. Moreover, these share the same power law behavior at sub-ion scales, exhibiting a spectral index of -2.8, which seems to be independent on the values of the two varying parameters. We compare our results with solar wind observations, and we suggest possible explanations for such behavior.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a powerful tool for monitoring changes on the surface of the Earth at a local or global scale. The use of data sets from different sensors across many platforms, or even a single sensor over time, can bring a wealth of information when exploring anthropogenic changes to the environment. For example, variations in crop yield and health for a specific region can be detected by observing changes in the spectral signature of the particular species under study.\nHowever, changes in the atmosphere, sun illumination and viewing geometries during image capture can result in inconsistent image data, hindering automated information extraction. Additionally, an incorrect spectral radiometric calibration will lead to false or misleading results. It is therefore critical that the data being used are normalized and calibrated on a regular basis to ensure that physically derived variables are as close to truth as is possible. Although most earth observing sensors are well-calibrated in a laboratory prior to launch, a change in the radiometric response of the system is inevitable due to thermal, mechanical or electrical effects caused during the rigors of launch or by the space environment itself. Outgassing and exposure to ultra-violet radiation will also have an effect on the sensor’s filter responses. Pre-launch lamps and other laboratory calibration systems can also fall short in representing the actual output of the Sun.\nA presentation of the differences in the results of some example cases (e.g. geology, agriculture) derived for science variables using pre- and post-launch calibration will be presented using DigitalGlobe’s WorldView-3 super spectral sensor, with bands in the visible and near infrared, as well as in the shortwave infrared. Important defects caused by an incomplete (i.e. pre-launch only) calibration will be discussed using validation data where available. In addition, the benefits of using a well-validated surface reflectance product will be presented. DigitalGlobe is committed to providing ongoing assessment of the radiometric performance of our sensors, which allows customers to get the most out of our extensive multi-sensor constellation.",

            "abstract": "Operational hydrologic forecasters as well as the communities that they serve have long recognized the value of including uncertainty in hydrologic projections. While single value (deterministic) forecasts are easy to understand and link to specific mitigation actions, the potential for using modern risk management strategies is very limited. This is particularly evident at lead times beyond a few days when forecast skill may be low but the value (and costs) of mitigation actions may be quite high.\nBased on nearly ten years of research and development, the NWS’s National Water Center (NWC, formerly the Office of Hydrologic Development) implemented and evaluated the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS, see Demargne et al. 2014 Brown et al., 2013, Brown et al., 2014a/b/c). The HEFS provides hydrologic forecasts that reflect the total uncertainty, including that contributed by the meteorological forcing and the hydrologic modeling. The HEFS leverages the skill in weather and climate forecasts to produce ensemble forecasts of precipitation, temperature and streamflow at forecast lead times ranging from one hour to one year. The resulting ensembles represent a rich dataset from which a wide variety of risk-based decision support information can be derived.\nThe NWS River Forecast Centers (RFCs) are starting to incorporate the Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS,) into their routine operations. In 2012, five (of thirteen) RFCs began running and testing HEFS in an experimental mode. In 2015, HEFS was deployed (including training and software support) to the eight remaining RFCs. Currently, all RFCs are running the HEFS every day in real-time for an increasing number of forecast locations. Eventually, forecasts from the HEFS will be integrated into the warning/hazard services at the NWS Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). This contribution describes the HEFS framework, the development and deployment strategy, and the operational plans for HEFS going forward.",

            "abstract": "Isopach maps from 8 tephra eruptions from Mount St. Helens were reported in Carey et al. (1995) and for 3 eruptions from Glacier Peak in Gardner et al. (1998). These isopach data only define single slopes on a thickness versus square root of area plot (Fierstein and Nathenson, 1992) whereas one expects a second slope in the medial to distal region for larger eruptions. A model was proposed by Carey et al. (1995) for estimating the second slope to calculate volumes. A more recent study by Sulpizio (2005) for estimating the second slope involves a systematic analysis of many eruptions to provide correlation equations. The purpose of this study is to recalculate the volumes of Mount St. Helens and Glacier Peak eruptions and compare results from the two methods for estimating second slopes.\nIn order to gain some perspective on the methods for estimating the second slope, we use data for thickness versus distance beyond the last isopach that is available for some of the eruptions. The thickness versus square root of area method is extended to thickness versus distance by developing an approximate relation between the two, assuming elliptical isopachs. Thickness versus distance data tend to support the Sulpizio method.\nThe volumes derived using the Sulpizio method are 20 % or less of the values for the Mount St. Helens layers given in Carey et al. (1995) and about 50 % of the values for the Glacier Peak layers given in Gardner et al (1998). For example, for Mount St. Helens layer Wn, the volume calculated from the isopachs is 0.55 km3, using the Carey et al.

            "abstract": "The ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) / CalWater2 was a joint DOE/NOAA field campaign in early 2015 to study atmospheric rivers in the Pacific Ocean and their impacts on the western United States. The campaign goals were to improve understanding and modeling of large-scale dynamics and cloud and precipitation processes associated with atmospheric rivers and aerosol-cloud interactions that influence precipitation variability and extremes in the western United States. Coordinated measurements were made from ground-, aircraft- and sea-based platforms. The second ARM mobile facility (AMF-2) was deployed on board the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown for this campaign, which included a new Marine Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) to measure the atmospheric downwelling and reflected infrared radiance spectrum at the Earth's surface with high absolute accuracy.\nThe M-AERI measures spectral infrared radiance between 520–3020 cm-1 (3.3–19 μm) at a resolution of 0.5 cm-1. The M-AERI can selectively view the atmospheric scene at zenith, and ocean/atmospheric scenes over a range of ±45° from the horizon. The AERI uses two high-emissivity blackbodies for radiometric calibration, which in conjunction with the instrument design and a suite of rigorous laboratory diagnostics, ensures the radiometric accuracy to be better than 1% (3σ) of the ambient radiance.\nThe M-AERI radiance spectra can be used to retrieve profiles of temperature and water vapor in the troposphere, as well as measurements of trace gases, cloud properties, surface emissivity and ocean skin temperature. We present preliminary results on measurements of ocean skin temperature, ocean emissivity properties as a function of view angle and wind speed, as well as comparisons with radiosondes and satellite observations.",

The data were analyzed based on a wave pouch track dataset, and composites were constructed with more than 1,500 satellite passes. It was found that column water vapor increases with the decreasing radius of the pouch center and starts to increase within two days prior to genesis; significant increase in precipitation occurs within 24 hours prior to genesis. These features are consistent with a recently proposed two-stage conceptual model for tropical cyclone formation. On the other hand, the analysis also reveals an unexpected decrease in column water vapor from -18 h to genesis time.",

Primary data sources include: USGS geologic maps, USGS Data Series, the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program (GVP) catalog, and published journal articles. A total of 726 volcanic vents have been identified from 45 volcanoes or volcanic fields spanning ten states.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS) identifies 28 volcanoes and volcanic centers in the western conterminous U.S. that pose moderate, high, or very high threats to surrounding communities based on their recent eruptive histories and their proximity to vulnerable people, property, and infrastructure. This compilation enhances the understanding of volcano hazards that could threaten people and property by providing the context of where Holocene eruptions have occurred and where future eruptions may occur.

            "abstract": "New seismological monitoring networks combine broadband seismic receivers, hydrophones and micro-barometers antenna, providing complementary observation of source-radiated waves. Exploiting these observations requires accurate and multi-media – elastic, hydro-acoustic, infrasound - wave simulation methods, in order to improve our physical understanding of energy exchanges at material interfaces.\nWe present here a new development of a high-order Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, for the simulation of coupled seismic and acoustic wave propagation, within a unified framework ([1],[2]) allowing for continuous and discontinuous Spectral Element Methods (SEM) to be used in the same simulation, with conforming and non-conforming meshes. The HDG-SEM approximation leads to differential – algebraic equations, which can be solved implicitly using energy-preserving time-schemes.\nThe proposed HDG-SEM is computationally attractive, when compared with classical Discontinuous Galerkin methods, involving only the approximation of the single-valued traces of the velocity field along the element interfaces as globally coupled unknowns. The formulation is based on a variational approximation of the physical fluxes, which are shown to be the explicit solution of an exact Riemann problem at each element boundaries. This leads to a highly parallel and efficient unstructured and high-order accurate method, which can be space-and-time adaptive.\nA numerical study of the accuracy and convergence of the HDG-SEM is performed through a number of case studies involving elastic-acoustic (infrasound) coupling with geometries of increasing complexity. Finally, the performance of the method is illustrated through realistic case studies involving ground wave propagation associated to topography effects.\nIn conclusion, we outline some on-going extensions of the method.\n",

            "abstract": "Challenging societal problems that cannot be solved by one method or one discipline alone, like epidemic preparedness, mental health, and climate change, demand leadership and the ability to work across disciplines from those with specialized expertise. Teaching leadership at the graduate school level is a challenge that many schools are striving to meet, through mechanisms like project-based courses, leadership skill development workshops, and others. We argue that some of the most valuable but most difficult leadership skills to learn are those that require cultural norms that are fundamentally different from those traditionally encountered in graduate school. These include the ability to make informed decisions based on limited knowledge and resources, the need to make choices in the face of uncertainty, and the recognition that one ultimately bears responsibility for the outcomes. These skills are also among the most important for students planning on nonacademic careers. Acquiring such skills requires a focus on learning-by-doing and a culture of graduate student empowerment. This submission focuses on the experience of students in a student-centered, interdisciplinary, cross-campus leadership program called Emerging Leaders in Science and Society (ELISS), hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). ELISS establishes the expectation that students act as leaders, which in itself reframes leadership as an achievable goal. A major finding from two years of experience with ELISS is the critical importance of establishing cultures of trust and empowerment at the graduate level in order to foster development of transferable skills. ELISS graduate students specifically focus on interdisciplinary collaboration (the 13 2015 fellows come from 13 academic disciplines); stakeholder engagement, primarily focused on outreach to both traditional and nontraditional experts in our communities outside of academia; and solution-generating rather than problem-spotting activities with stakeholders. The ELISS strategy of establishing a cultural norm that young scientists can and should engage global societal issues is a novel approach to fostering leadership skills and interdisciplinary comfort that can readily be translated to both academic and nonacademic success.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched in January 2015. The objective of the mission is global mapping of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. For soil moisture algorithm validation, the SMAP project and NASA coordinated SMAPVEX15 around the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Tombstone, Arizona on August 1-19, 2015. The main goals of SMAPVEX15 are to understand the effects and contribution of heterogeneity on the soil moisture retrievals, evaluate the impact of known RFI sources on retrieval, and analyze the brightness temperature product calibration and heterogeneity effects. Additionally, the campaign aims to contribute to the validation of GPM (Global Precipitation Mission) data products. The campaign will feature three airborne microwave instruments: PALS (Passive Active L-band System), UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) and AirMOSS (Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface). PALS has L-band radiometer and radar, and UAVSAR and AirMOSS have L- and P-band synthetic aperture radars, respectively. The PALS instrument will map the area on seven days coincident with SMAP overpasses; UAVSAR and AirMOSS on four days. WGEW was selected as the experiment site due to the rainfall patterns in August and existing dense networks of precipitation gages and soil moisture sensors. An additional temporary network of approximately 80 soil moisture stations was deployed in the region. Rainfall observations were supplemented with two X-band mobile scanning radars, approximately 25 tipping bucket rain gauges, three laser disdrometers, and three vertically-profiling K-band radars. Teams were on the field to take soil moisture samples for gravimetric soil moisture, bulk density and rock fraction determination as well as to measure surface roughness and vegetation water content. In this talk we will present preliminary results from the experiment including comparisons between SMAP and PALS soil moisture retrievals with respect to the in situ measurements.

            "abstract": "Amazon forests represent nearly half of all tropical vegetation biomass and, through photosynthesis and respiration, annually process more than twice the amount of estimated carbon (CO2) from fossil fuel emissions. Yet the seasonality of Amazon canopy cover, and the extent to which seasonal fluctuations in water availability and photosynthetically active radiation influence these processes, is still poorly understood. Implementing six remotely sensed data sets spanning nine years (2003-2011), with reported field and flux tower data, we show that southern equatorial Amazon forests exhibit a distinctive seasonal signal. Seasonal timing of water availability, canopy biomass growth and net leaf flush are asynchronous in regions with short dry seasons and become more synchronous across a west-to-east longitudinal moisture gradient of increasing dry season length. Forest cover is responsive to seasonal disparities in both water and solar radiation availability, temporally adjusting net leaf flush to maximize use of these generally abundant resources, while reducing drought susceptibility. An accurate characterization of this asynchronous behavior allows for improved understanding of canopy phenology across contiguous tropical forests and their sensitivity to climate variability and drought. These insights can also inform land surface models to provide a more accurate representation of seasonal forest carbon allocation strategies responsive to environmental drivers.",

            "abstract": "The permeability of sandstones can be modeled using the Katz and Thompson (KT) model which relates permeability to a characteristic hydraulic length scale, typically measured by mercury injection, and the electrically interconnected porosity. In situ estimation of these hydraulic parameters remains a challenge in hydrogeology; emerging geophysical technologies may help to solve this problem. Induced polarization (IP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are two geophysical methods shown to be sensitive to physical properties of the pore space that control fluid flow, such as the pore size distribution. Using laboratory data collected on sandstone cores with a diverse range of properties, we demonstrate that our measured NMR parameters best predict the characteristic hydraulic length scale of the KT model, while the IP data can be used to improve estimates of the true formation factor. We incorporate these estimated hydraulic parameters into a KT model to derive an IP-NMR permeability model that compares favorably to permeability estimates from the KT model using mercury injection measurements. Furthermore, the resulting model uses parameters that are potentially measureable in the field; future work will focus on implementing the model at the field scale.",

            "abstract": "Wind is air in motion and stress is the turbulent transport of momentum between the ocean and the atmosphere. There was no large-scale measurement of stress before the scatterometer and the stress we used was almost entirely derived from wind through a drag coefficient. While the strong wind of a tropical cyclone (TC) causes destruction at landfall, it is the surface stress that drags down the TC. The relations that were established to retrieve moderate wind speeds from the normalized radar cross-section, or backscatter power, measured by Ku-band and C-band scatterometers do not apply well to TC-scale winds. Even if we have good wind measurements, there is a large uncertainty in the drag coefficient in TC. We will give credence to our hypothesis that there is no distinct physics of radar backscatter from ocean surface for weather phenomenon like the TC. The relation between backscatter and surface roughness or stress does not change under TC, and the same retrieval algorithm can be extended to the TC. The need for changes in wind retrieval algorithm is explained through the change of the drag coefficient. We separate the sensor parameters that affect backscatter, such as, incident angle, azimuth angle, polarization and backscatter frequencies, from the secondary factors related to the physics of the air-sea interface and turbulent transport, such as air stability (shear and buoyance), air density, sea states, and sea sprays, and establish a simple approximation of surface stress from the backscatter averaged over the relevant spatial and temporal scales. We established a relation between backscatter and surface stress over a moderate range of wind speed, where wind measurements coincident with satellite observations are abundant, and the drag coefficient is well established to convert wind measurements to stress. This relation is applied to retrieve stress from the scatterometer measurement in the high wind range of TC. With abundant stress measurements by the scatterometers, the drag coefficient for TC are characterized and compared with conventional values. The variation of stress in TC will be used to understand the intensification of TC with respect to feedback by the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Despite their importance and ubiquity in the atmosphere, organic aerosols are still very poorly parameterized in global models. This can be explained by two reasons: first, a very large number of unconstrained parameters are involved in accurate parameterizations, and second, a detailed description of semi-volatile organics is computationally very expensive. Even organic aerosol properties that are known to play a major role in the atmosphere, namely volatility and aging, are poorly resolved in global models, if at all. Studies with different models and different parameterizations have not been conclusive on whether the additional complexity improves model simulations, but the added diversity of the different host models used adds an unnecessary degree of variability in the evaluation of results that obscures solid conclusions.\nHere we will present a thorough study of the most popular organic aerosol parameterizations with regard to volatility in global models, studied within the same host global model, the GISS ModelE2: primary and secondary organic aerosols both being non-volatile, secondary organic aerosols semi-volatile (2-product model), and all organic aerosols semi-volatile (volatility-basis set). We will also present results on the role aerosol microphysical calculations play on organic aerosol concentrations. The changes in aerosol distribution as a result of the different parameterizations, together with their role on gas-phase chemistry and climate, will be presented.",

In this experiment, instead of using a commercial aircraft that flies over long distances, we used a military reconnaissance aircraft performing a circular flight over Korean Peninsula. Measurements indicate that the radiation dose is approximately 2.12 ~ 2.88 Sv/hr at 30,000 ft. We obtained two observational results from this experiment. First, changes in dose rate occurred within a flight time of 5 - 7 hours.

The maximum of the NOx emissions at Fukuoka is estimated to be at the city center, and the monitoring site is located ~5 km southwest of the city center, outside of the central area.\nTo clarify the inhomogeneity as well as the transport/mixing processes of the polluted air in the urban area, continuous profile measurements have been conducted in two azimuth directions: towards and away from the city center. From NO2 observations, we sometimes observed spatial inhomogeneity associated with vertical/horizontal transport of high concentrations of NO2 from the city center, and horizontal transport of low concentrations from the ocean via a land-sea breeze. On the other hand, we observed spatial inhomogeneity in HONO and HCHO during summer, which was probably due to photochemical production over the city center.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forest soils contribute disproportionately to the poorly-characterized and persistent deep soil carbon (C) pool. Highly-weathered and often extending one to two meters deep, these soils also contain an abundance of semicrystalline, Fe- and Al-containing short-range-order (SRO) minerals, metastable derivatives of framework silicate and ferromagnesian parent materials. SRO minerals are capable of soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization through sorption or co-precipitation, a faculty enhanced by their high specific surface area (SSA). As such, SRO-mediated organomineral associations may prove a critical, yet matrix-selective, driver of SOM stabilization capacity in tropical soils, particularly at depth.\nSurface (0-20 cm) and subsoil (50-80 cm) samples were taken from 20 quantitative soil pits dug in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, located in northeast Puerto Rico. Soils were stratified across granodiorite and volcaniclastic parent materials, spanning primary mineral contents of 5 to 40%. Selective dissolution procedures were used to isolate distinct forms of Fe-C interactions: (1) sodium pyrophosphate to isolate organo-mineral complexes, (2) hydroxylamine and (3) oxalate to isolate SRO phases, and (4) inorganic dithionite to isolate crystalline Fe oxides. Extracts were analysed for dissolved organic C (DOC) and Fe and Al concentrations to estimate SOM associated with each mineral phase. Soils were also subjected to SSA analysis, 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction before and after extraction to determine the contribution of extracted mineral phases to SOM stabilization capacity. Preliminary results indicate a dominance of secondary (hydr)oxides and kaolin minerals in surface soils, strongly driven by parent material. With depth, however, we observe a marked shift towards SRO mineral phases across both parent materials, suggesting that SRO-mediated organomineral associations are significant contributors to observed C storage in tropical subsoils.",

Tectonics that could have affected seismic structure still present in this region include long-term subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America, processes associated with the Columbia River flood basalts and Yellowstone mantle plume, Basin and Range extension, and the current Juan de Fuca subduction just west of the IDOR deployment. Fragments of the Farallon slab, clearly identified elsewhere beneath North America, might be present in the upper mantle of the study region. One such slab remnant, due to subduction associated with accretion of the Siltezia terrane, has been identified in the upper mantle just NW of our study region (Schmandt and Humphreys, 2011). The Juan de Fuca microplate, another remnant of the Farallon slab, subducts eastward beneath North America and is resolved at upper mantle depths regionally. In addition, the distribution of upper mantle asthenosphere is likely affected by the Yellowstone mantle plume and ongoing Basin and Range extension in our study area. We analyzed 239 teleseismic events recorded at the IDOR network with an epicentral distance between 30 and 95 degrees and magnitudes of 5.5 and higher. We picked P and S arrivals using the Automated and Interactive Measurement of Body-wave Arrival Times (AIMBAT) tool, based on the multi–channel cross-correlation method of VanDecar and Crosson (1990). We determined more than 7600 travel-time measurements. Preliminary results indicate a significant variation from west to east in delay times for event-station pairs across the IDOR network.",

However, compared with the established initiation mechanisms for \"isolated\" events, the mechanisms for \"sympathetic\" events are still largely unknown, and nascent theories are untested. In this study, we build a realistic environment of solar corona on 2011 February 15 using a global MHD model and investigate how an eruption can impact the surrounding solar structures. Our result shows that the solar eruption’s impact on the different structures can be quite different. Within the CME expansion domain, it is possible to trigger an eruption by overlaying field removal through expansion induced reconnection. The magnitude of impact is found to be dependent on the orientation of the erupting flux rope. Outside the CME expansion domain, the post-eruption reconfiguration could play an important role for solar sympathy. Based on the modeling results, we discuss the possibility of using observable/estimable parameters to quantify the eruption impact therefore providing an useful parameter for forecasting sympathy.",

            "abstract": "During GoAmazon2014/5, ambient air was exposed to controlled concentrations of OH or O3 in-situ using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). Oxidation ranged from hours–several weeks of aging. Oxidized air was sampled by several instruments (e.g., HR-AMS, ACSM, PTR-TOF-MS, SMPS, CCN) at both the T3 site (IOP1: Feb 1–Mar 31, 2014, and IOP2: Aug 15–Oct 15, 2014) and T2 site (between IOPs and into 2nd IOP). Oxidation of ambient air in the OFR led to significant and dynamic SOA formation. In general, more SOA was produced during the nighttime than daytime, and more in the dry season (IOP2) than wet season (IOP1). The maximum amount of SOA produced during nighttime from OH oxidation ranged from less than 1 µg/m3 to greater than 10 µg/m3. O3 oxidation of ambient air also led to SOA formation, although much less than from OH oxidation. Preliminary PMF factor analysis showed that the less-oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) factor was produced at up to several days OH aging, while at longer ages the more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA) factor was formed and LO-OOA was depleted. HOA, BBOA, and IEPOX-SOA factors were not formed in the reactor, just depleted at high ages (though at different rates). More detailed PMF results will be presented. Variations in the amount of SOA formation often, but not always, correlated with measured gas-phase biogenic and/or anthropogenic SOA precursors (e.g., SV-TAG sesquiterpenes, PTR-TOFMS aromatics, isoprene, and monoterpenes). The SOA mass formed in the OFR was ~10x larger than could be explained by aerosol yields of measured primary VOCs, suggesting that most SOA was formed from intermediate sources such as S/IVOCs (e.g., VOC oxidation products or evaporated POA), consistent with previous OFR field and lab studies. To verify the SOA yields of VOCs under OFR experimental conditions, atmospherically-relevant concentrations of several VOCs were added individually into ambient air in the OFR and oxidized by OH or O3. SOA yields were similar to published chamber yields.",

Understanding the influence of changes in land cover on hydrology is critical to anticipating future water availability and impacts on agriculture/industry, ecosystems, and residential water supplies. In the United States, most major water sources originate in forested watersheds, and thus we aim to understand how changes in forest cover influence water supplies over those areas, specifically identifying which types of watersheds exhibit marked rapid changes in water yield as a result of disturbance processes (e.g., fire). Using a set of 601 primarily unmanaged watersheds (2000-2010) across the US and a 30m forest disturbance dataset, we explored the relationship between changes in water resources, measured in terms of detrended runoff ratios, and forest disturbance severity. Preliminary results find some watersheds nearly completely disturbed due to fire, while others undisturbed. Most watersheds were relatively insensitive--in terms of their expected runoff ratios--to disturbances during that time period, but several were highly sensitive. Areas which showed major increases in water yield post-disturbance generally had larger disturbances occur in areas coincident with higher average precipitation. Soils in these areas had comparatively moderate to low infiltration rates and little subsurface water exchange, and were typically at higher slopes with a lower wetland component. They also had less water storage in the system. Overall, the results from this study are expected to be broadly relevant to communities and scientists seeking to anticipate the hydrologic impacts of large-scale land-cover disturbance.",

            "abstract": "Wetland ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Wetlands act as a major long-term storage of carbon by sequestrating carbon-dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Meanwhile, they can emit significant amounts of methane (CH4) due to anaerobic microbial decomposition.\nThe Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area (BBECA) is recognized as one of Canada’s largest undeveloped natural areas retained within an urban area. Historically, it has been substantially reduced in size and degraded by peat mining and agriculture. Since 2005, the bog has been declared a conservancy area, and the restoration efforts in BBECA focus on rewetting the disturbed ecosystems to promote a transition back to a raised bog. A pilot study measured CH4, CO2 and N2O exchanges in 2014 and concluded to monitor CO2, CH4 fluxes continuously. From the perspective of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, CO2 sequestered in bog needs to be protected and additional CO2 and CH4 emissions due to land-cover change need to be reduced by wise management.\nIn this study, we measured the growing-season (June-September) fluxes of CO2 and CH4 exchange using eddy covariance (EC). A floating platform with an EC system for both CO2 (closed-path) and CH4 (open-path) began operation in June 2015. During the growing-season, gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) averaged 5.87 g C m-2 day-1 and 2.02 g C m-2 day-1, respectively. The magnitude of GEP and Re were lower than in previous studies of pristine northern peatlands. The daily average CH4 emission was 0.99 (±1.14) g C m-2 day-1 and it was higher than in most previous studies. We also characterized how environmental factors affected the seasonal dynamics of these exchanges in this disturbed peatland. Our measurements showed that soil temperature and soil water content were major drivers of seasonal changes of GHG fluxes.\nThe daily average GHG warming potential (GWP) of the emissions in the growing seasons (from CO2 and CH4) totals to 37.09 g CO2e m-2 day-1. CH4 was the significant constributor (99 % of GHG emissions) indicating that GHG exchange due to photosynthesis and respiration was of secondary order. Although oxygen limitation due to the high water table caused by the restoration strategy suppressed the Re it also promoted substantial CH4 formation under anoxic conditions.",

Different secondary formation processes, active after initial ice nucleation, have been proposed to explain this discrepancy, but their relative importance, and even the exact physics of each mechanism, are still unclear. We construct a simple bin microphysics model (2IM) including depositional growth, the Hallett-Mossop process, ice-ice collisions, and ice-ice aggregation, with temperature- and supersaturation-dependent efficiencies for each process. 2IM extends the time-lag collision model of Yano and Phillips to additional bins and incorporates the aspect ratio evolution of Jensen and Harrington. Model output and measured ice crystal size distributions are compared to answer three questions: (1) how important is ice-ice aggregation relative to ice-ice collision around -15°C, where the Hallett-Mossop process is no longer active; (2) what process efficiencies lead to the best reproduction of observed ice crystal size distributions; and (3) does ice crystal aspect ratio affect the dominant secondary formation process. The resulting parameterization is intended for eventual use in larger-scale mixed-phase cloud schemes.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are channels of high water vapor flux within the low atmosphere that transport moisture towards midlatitudes on synoptic timescales. For areas with coastal mountainous terrain such as North America’s west coast, ARs often produce high intensity precipitation due to orographic forcing. Regional AR studies focus on the Pacific Northwest as this is where ARs landfall most frequently. For Southern California (SCA) there are relatively few AR landfalls per year, however, ARs that do landfall in SCA provide a majority of the area’s annual total precipitation as well as some of the region’s highest intensity rainfall. As SCA is prone to both drought as well as precipitation-induced hazards, and because the area is dependent on relatively few precipitation events to provide the bulk of annual rainfall totals, any changes to storm frequency or intensity may dramatically impact the region. It imperative to understand the characteristics and mechanisms behind high-impact ARs events that landfall in SCA in order to properly forecast and prepare for future occurrences, particularly as these events are important for water management and hazard mitigation.\nWe develop an algorithm that uses daily total precipitable water fields from reanalysis to identify AR activity impacting North America’s western coast from 1979 to 2013 and categorizes identified AR events according to landfall region. Additional reanalysis fields are used to create composites of atmospheric variables prior to, on the day of, and after AR landfall in order to determine and differentiate the defining characteristics for ARs impacting these varying regions. This allows us to characterize the atmospheric makeup behind ARs impacting SCA, including possible indications as to the mechanisms behind their initiation as well as trajectory.",

Here we demonstrate progress using the three-dimensional Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Using a first-order calving law and prescribed subshelf basal melt rates, we performed high-resolution (<1km) hindcasts of the Greenland Ice Sheet of the 1989-2012 period. These hindcasts allow us to study the processes governing ice-shelf thinning, break-up, and subsequent speed-ups and dynamic thinning. Focussing our analysis on the Jakobshavn basin we show that our simulations are able to capture the thinning of the floating tongue resulting from increased subshelf basal melt rates. Furthermore, our simulations capture both the magnitude and the timing of the dynamic thinning associated with the loss of the floating tongue, as well as the speed-up. We find little seasonal variations in surface speeds prior to 1995, and strong variations thereafter, in good agreement with observations of Echelmeyer and Harrison (1991) and Joughin et al (2012).",

            "abstract": "The main criteria for assessment of urban territory for sustainability for underground construction occurred at a certain depth of continuous soil and rock strata of permanent thickness high bearing capacity. Distinguishing areas depending on the distribution, depth of occurrence and thickness of such rock strata is the first stage of territory zoning according to the geological conditions favorable for subsurface construction. The hydrogeological conditions, as well as the development of natural and techno natural hazards, are assessed at the next stage. In this paper, the method and technique of compiling the map of subsurface zoning according to the geological conditions is discussed for two cities with difference geological conditions: Moscow (Russia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan). Vertical zoning of cities subsurface is controlled by three basic levels: up to a depth of 10 m, foundations of the most of the buildings are situated; up to a depth of 20 m, the highway tunnels are located, collectors of deep subsurface communication lines, and foundations of large multi-purpose complexes; up to a depth of 40 m, deep highway tunnels are located, and foundations of individual unique buildings. In Moscow, the mid- and upper Jurassic clay layer and the Carboniferous carbonate-terrigenous complex are the most continuously stretching stratigraphic and lithological rock strata of permanent thickness. The location of modern and buried ancient erosional channels is one of the chief factors controlling the geological conditions in Moscow. The degree of territory favorable for subsurface construction depends on the depth of the thickness of the Jurassic clay horizon. Tashkent city is located in a high seismic zone and therefore the geological conditions of underground space are defined first by the modern tectonic movements and secondly is defined by distribution of loess soils with up to the depth of 70 m. Hydrogeology is important factor for sustainability of constructions.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that, if society can do no better than the commitments it’s already made to reducing greenhouse gases, we will achieve a 2C threshold by 2030 and a 3C threshold by 2050 [e.g., Jackson et al., 2015]. Given that a global average of 2C or 3C translates to about three times that (6C, 9C) over continents, this portends a future of on-going climate change for generations to come, with all of its concomitant struggles in adapting. It also portends a global society looking increasingly at ways to mitigate the cause(s) of climate change. Recent events have propelled that to some extent already, but it is likely we will see more as time goes on. Nevertheless, there is a huge difference between making commitments and achieving them. Nations, states, cities, resource managers, energy interests, and other invested parties will be looking at ways to reduce emissions, driven either by markets, taxes, or other relevant policies.\nAnticipating this need, WMO has begun developing an implementation plan for an Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System (IG3IS). To work effectively, an IG3IS must integrate high quality observations from multiple and varied platforms, incorporate observation-based information from transport models, and deliver useful information at sub-continental, policy-relevant scales. Existing surface-based networks, emerging networks in developing countries, and new aircraft-based measurements and satellite observations make a difference, but additional observations and improved transport modeling are critical. This presentation will look at what is available, what the gaps are, and how IG3IS intends to address them.",

Approximately 70 percent of human water use is allocated to agriculture with 40 percent of global food production originating from irrigated lands. Growing demand for food will only worsen the strain placed on many irrigated agricultural systems resulting in an unsustainable reliance on groundwater. This work presents an overview of the Platte River Cosmic-ray Neutron Probe Monitoring Network, which consists of 10 fixed probes and 3 mobile probes located across the Platte River Basin. The network was installed in 2014 and is part of the larger US COSMOS (70+ probes) and global COSMOS networks (200+ probes). Here we will present an overview of the network, comparison of fixed neutron probe results across the basin, spatial mapping results of the mobile sensors at various sites and spatial scales, and lessons learned by working with various producers and water stakeholder groups. With the continued development of this technique, its incorporation for soil moisture management in large producer operations has the potential to increase irrigation water use efficiency in the Platte River Basin and beyond.",

            "abstract": "Currently, global trends in consumptive water-use indicate an increasing and unsustainable reliance on groundwater resources. Each year approximately 60% of water used for agriculture is wasted through inadequate water conservation, losses in distribution, and inappropriate times and rates of irrigation. Therefore, in order to coordinate a strategy to accomplish the agricultural demands of our global community we must maintain a stable global food and water trade while increasing crop yield and efficiency. This research aims to improve the operability of the recently developed and promising cosmic-ray neutron method for estimating field scale soil moisture. The sensor works by passively counting above ground low-energy neutrons which correlate to the total water in the sensor measurement volume (a sphere with radius of ~300 m and vertical soil depth of ~30 cm). Because the sensor responds to different forms of water (sources of hydrogen), estimates of background water in the mineral soil need to be accounted for in order to minimize measurement error. Here we compared field-scale estimates of soil mineral water with readily available global datasets. Using the newly compiled 1km resolution Global Soil Dataset (GSDE), we were able to investigate the correlation between soil mineral water and clay content for various soil taxonomic orders. Preliminary results suggest statistically significant linear relationships for Aridisol, Mollisol and Ultisol soil orders. Incorporation of this dataset will allow for real-time soil moisture mapping of hundreds of center-pivots using the mobile cosmic-ray probe without the need for time-consuming in-situ soil sampling. Integrating this technique into soil moisture management has the potential to increase the efficiency of irrigation water used in agriculture.",

The Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft has frequently detected strong escaping planetary ion fluxes in both tailward and upstream solar wind motional electric field directions since the beginning of its science phase in November 2014. Our statistical study using three-month MAVEN data from November 2014 through February 2015 illustrates a substantial plume-like escaping planetary ion population organized by the upstream electric field with strong fluxes widely distributed in the northern hemisphere of the Mars-Sun-Electric-field (MSE) coordinate system, which is generally consistent with model predictions. The plume constitutes an important planetary ion escape channel from the Martian atmosphere in addition to the tailward escape. The >25eV O+ escape rate through the plume is estimated to be ~35% of the tailward escape and ~25% of the total escape. We will compare the dynamics of the plume and tailward escaping ions based on their velocity-space distributions with respect to the electromagnetic fields. We will also discuss the variations of the plume characteristics between different ion species (O+, O2+, and CO2+) and from the effect of different solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions.",

            "abstract": "In March of 2014, Van Allen Probe A observed several packets of whistler-mode waves while passing through the apogee of an orbit on the dayside magnetosphere. These waves were localized in regions of strong density inhomogeneity. For one observed wave, the wave maximum occurred within the center of the channel formed by a density enhancement. The other two waves were observed on either side of strong density depletion. We first determine the wave characteristics using data from Van Allen Probe A. Then, we use the observations to specify parameters in an electron MHD simulation to model the propagation of whistler-mode waves inside density structures. These observations and simulations demonstrate how whistler-mode waves can become trapped inside density structures, a phenomenon known as ducting. The density ducts serve to guide the whistler-mode waves into the earth’s radiation belt while minimizing damping effects. The purpose of this research is to understand the role of density ducts in guiding whistler-mode waves, which will have important applications for remediation of energetic particles from the radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring and forecasting of the seasonal melt of snow and ice in the Arctic is a priority need as Arctic climate changes and the number of stakeholders increases. Seasonal snow and ice melt represent the largest annual perturbation to the surface net radiation budget. Radiative interactions between clouds, the surface and the atmosphere play an important role on scales of minutes to decades, but models insufficiently represent cloud properties. Furthermore, the surface radiation budget is not directly observed from satellite platforms. Direct observations from the surface must therefore be used to document the physical and correlative relationships between variables, and to provide a baseline target for data sets with more comprehensive spatial representation.\nHigh-quality, continuous, long-term observations of radiative fluxes are collected from land stations surrounding the Arctic Basin as part of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA) facilitates international collaboration amongst station scientists and other topic experts for the purposes of streamlining pan-Arctic synthesis studies. The IASOA Radiation Working Group is currently analyzing the data acquired from Barrow, Alaska (1993-2015), Alert, Canada (2004-2014), Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (1993-2015), Eureka, Canada (2007-2015), and Tiksi, Russia (2011-2015). The measurements include upwelling and downwelling longwave and shortwave fluxes, as well as direct and diffuse shortwave flux components, and surface meteorology. The observations are post-processed using the Radiative Flux Analysis (RFA) method, which, in addition to basic quality control, provides value-added metrics such as cloud radiative forcing (CRF), optical depth, and fractional sky cover. Here, we present a spatial and temporal analysis of the surface radiation budget and calculated variables from the pan-Arctic BSRN stations. Particular attention is given to inter-site variability of seasonal cycles in CRF and associated relationships with surface albedo and cloud macrophysics.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) in the atmosphere cycles between two redox forms, Hg0 and HgII. Hg0 has a lifetime of ~1 year allowing near-global transport, while HgII is efficiently removed by deposition within weeks. Understanding atmospheric Hg redox chemistry is critical to determining the patterns of deposition to the surface, where Hg can be transformed to the bioaccumulative neurotoxin, methylmercury. We present a state-of-the-science redox mechanism for use in atmospheric models, with new theoretical data, which we implement in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We evaluate our simulation against atmospheric observations and examine implications for Hg deposition. Modeled HgII wet deposition depends on the oxidation of anthropogenic, ocean, and soil Hg0 emissions and the reduction of emitted anthropogenic HgII. We present a new global anthropogenic atmospheric Hg emissions inventory for 1990 – 2010 with improved speciation of power plant emissions and regional commercial Hg emissions. The seasonal cycle of ocean evasion is also critical to atmospheric Hg variability. We present an advance in our ability to model atmosphere-ocean exchange of Hg, through more realistic ocean circulation from the 3-D MITgcm. Our results suggest Br is the dominant oxidant in the stratosphere, consistent with constraints from aircraft observations of the Hg gradient with depth into the stratosphere. The proposed redox mechanism leads to increased HgII deposition to the Tropics, with implications for tropical surface ocean enrichment, and decreased deposition to the Southern Ocean. Within the uncertainty of Hg0 oxidation rates, we find atmospheric HgII reduction is still needed. We find changes in speciated Hg emissions due to emissions controls can explain recent observed regional trends in atmospheric Hg. These have shifted power plant impacts to relatively more global than local Hg deposition. Coupling to the more realistic 3-D ocean model improves simulated atmospheric Hg seasonal cycles.",

            "abstract": "On March 3, 2015 Villarrica Volcano underwent an abrupt change in volcanic behavior that culminated in a large fire fountaining event lasting 30 minutes that prompted the evacuation of residents within 9 km from the vent. This paroxysm was the first in 30 years and changed summit morphology by temporarily capping the previously stable lava lake with volcanic material. After March 3, Villarrica exhibited a period of quiescence before reactivating with various levels of ash venting associated with strombolian style activity. Ten infrasound arrays, each comprising three pressure transducers, were deployed in January and February that recorded until mid June and serendipitously chronicled the awakening, paroxysm, and recovery to a more open vent system typical to Villarrica. Coincidentally, several optical datasets were gathered. Time lapse photography, provided by Proyecto Observacion Villarrica Internet (POVI), recorded vent activity at an interval of ~15 seconds with a 240 mm zoom lens at 16 km from the vent, starting December 2014 until March 12, 2015. Additionally, video footage of the vent was recorded at 30 frames per second (fps) with a 50 mm lensed surveillance camera between March 4 and June of 2015 at a distance of 16 km from the vent. The combined infrasound and image processing approach offers novel insight into the various acoustic signatures of a dynamic and violent volcanic system. Video parameters, including plume color, ascent rate, and duration of venting are synthesized as time series. These video metrics of vent activity are then quantitatively compared to the corresponding infrasound waveform. The result is the classification of several different infrasound modes of activity during the diverse eruptive sequence of Villarrica between January and June of 2015.",

            "abstract": "The midlatitude response to localized equatorial heating events that last 2 days is examined through experimentation with an atmospheric general circulation model. Such responses are argued to be important because many tropical rainfall events only last a short time and because the responses to such pulses serve as building blocks with which to study the impacts of more general heating fluctuations. The experiments indicate that pulse heating produces responses in midlatitude locations that are far from the source and these responses persist much longer than the heating pulses that drive them. Moreover the responses have little or no phase propagation. Consequently the upper tropospheric structure of the responses is remarkably similar to the reaction to steady tropical heating, including being composed of similar recurring patterns and being especially pronounced at special locations. The impact of short-lived tropical heating also produces persistent responses in midlatitude surface fields and in the statistics of synoptic eddies.\nThese results imply a) there is potential for improving subseasonal prediction through improved assimilation and short range forecasts of tropical precipitation and b) attributing subseasonal midlatitude events to tropical heating is more difficult than it may at first appear to be.",

We present analysis of the first NuSTAR solar observations, that began in late 2014 and continued through 2015. These include using its imaging spectroscopy capabilities to derive the thermal characteristics of several “non-flaring” active regions, providing limits to the high temperature emission.

            "abstract": "This study explores how the spatial and temporal variability of stream flow and sediment transport influence the growth and recovery rate of benthic primary producers in a rainfall dominated mountain stream over different seasons. Primary producers sustain higher trophic levels and thus understanding how sediment transport impacts their growth is important for efficient river management. The control of sediment transport processes on suitable habitat for these organisms depends on the frequency of high flows capable of mobilizing material and the spatial distribution of forces throughout the stream. However there other factors such as light, nutrient availability, and temperature that are also important. We hypothesize that the control physical processes exert on the growth dynamics of these organisms varies both according to the amount of localized bed disturbance caused by sediment transport and the flow field and seasonal variations in additional growth factors. This hypothesis is tested in a 160m reach of Oak Creek, OR draining 7 km2. Habitat disturbance maps were developed based on the spatial and temporal variability of velocity and shear stress and estimated sediment transport rates. These maps are used to select habitat patches with contrasting disturbance levels for benthic chlorophyll a monitoring. Velocity and shear stress were modeled using the two dimensional hydraulic model FaSTMECH, developed by the USGS. Sediment transport rates were estimated using spatially variable magnitudes of shear stress and grain size distributions and validated using both field measurements and historical data. Preliminary results during the spring indicate an inverse correlation between disturbance and algal growth, however there were no flow events above the critical threshold for motion during this time. It is likely that increased nutrient fluxes in areas of higher velocity resulted in increased algal growth rates during these period.",

            "abstract": "It has been long debated what role static stress changes play in the enhancement and suppression of seismicity in the near-field region of large earthquakes. While numerous observations have correlated earthquake triggering and elevated seismicity rates with regions of increased Coulomb failure stress (CFS), observations of seismic quiescence in stress shadow regions are more controversial. When observed, seismicity shutdowns are often delayed by days to months following a negative stress perturbation. Some studies propose that the delay in the seismic shutdown can be caused by rupture promoting failure on one fault type while suppressing activity on another; thus the observed seismicity reflects the weighted contribution of the two faulting populations. For example, it was noted that in the 75 years following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, strike-slip faulting earthquakes were inhibited, while thrust faulting events were promoted. However, definitive observations supporting this delayed shutdown mechanism are rare. In this study, we report seismicity rate increases and decreases that correlate with regions of Coulomb stress transfer, and show observations of a delayed shutdown in the Yuha Desert, California. We use a Coulomb stress change model coupled with a rate-and state- earthquake model to show that the delay in the shutdown is due to the combined changes in the rates of normal and strike-slip faulting events following the 2010 M5.72 Ocotillo aftershock of the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake.",

Managers need reliable information to adjust their strategies as population density increases. However they are currently overwhelmed by the diversity of available information and the multiplicity of sources. CBI's goal is to centralize and package effectively the usable information for land managers and for the general public in order to increase awareness and promote preparation for the challenges ahead. We are designing conservation planning atlases in Data Basin for a number of landscape conservation cooperatives to address this need. We are adding some user-friendly tools to specifically serve the available climate projections and land use data in a meaningful way. By working closely with a group of managers, our goal is to understand how consideration of these projections figures into the decision-making process and refine the ways we can deliver relevant metrics. We have been holding interviews to gather information and critical feedback on existing climate-related web pages and tools, providing us with benchmarks for improvement. As it turned out, the student-manager dialogue added a component of climate change education and awareness of available tools to the project. Through an iterative process we plan to continue this exchange and address the variety of issues managers continually have to face to maintain healthy ecosystems.",

Considering Precise Point Positioning (PPP) with single frequency data the options available include, for example, the use of Klobuchar model or applying Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM). The GIM contains Vertical Electron Content (VTEC) values that are commonly estimated considering a global network with poor covering in certain regions.

Another possibility to correct for ionosphere effects in the PPP is to apply the ionosphere estimation technique based on Kalman filter. In this case, the ionosphere can be treated as a stochastic process and a good initial guess is necessary what can be obtained from an ionospheric map. In this paper we present the methodology involved with ionosphere estimation by using Kalman filter and also the application of global and regional ionospheric maps in the PPP as first guess. The ionosphere estimation strategy was implemented in the house software called RT_PPP that is capable of accomplishing PPP either for single or dual frequency data. GPS data from Brazilian station near equatorial region were processed and results with regional maps were compared with those by using global maps. Improvements of the order 15% were observed.

Both occurred immediately offshore on the\nprimary plate boundary interface between the Nazca and South America plates. They are among the\nlargest earthquakes to be instrumentally recorded; the 2010 Maule event is the second largest\nearthquake to produce strong motion recordings.\nGround motion to intensity conversion equations (GMICEs) are used to reconstruct the distribution of shaking for historical earthquakes by using\nintensities estimated from contemporary accounts. Most great (M>8) earthquakes, like these, occur\nwithin subduction zones, yet few GMICEs exist for subduction earthquakes. It is unclear whether\nGMICEs developed for active crustal regions, such as California, can be scaled up to the large M of\nsubduction zone events, or if new data sets must be analyzed to develop separate subduction\nGMICEs.\nTo address this question, we pair instrumental peak ground motions, both acceleration\n(PGA) and velocity (PGV), with intensities derived from onsite surveys of earthquake damage made\nin the weeks after the events and internet-derived felt reports. We fit a linear predictive equation\nbetween the geometric mean of the maximum PGA or PGV of the two horizontal components and intensity,\nusing linear least squares. We use a weighting scheme to express the uncertainty of the pairings\nbased on a station's proximity to the nearest intensity observation.\nThe intensity data derived from the onsite surveys is a complete, high-quality investigation of the earthquake damage. We perform\nthe computations using both the survey data and community decimal intensities (CDI) calculated\nfrom felt reports volunteered by citizens (USGS \"Did You Feel It\", DYFI) and compare the results.\nWe compare the GMICEs we developed to the most widely used GMICEs from California and central US\nearthquakes, and global earthquakes. Existing GMICEs consistently over-predict intensity for these two subduction events. This may be a regional difference, or a magnitude-dependent\neffect. Currently, however, there is not enough data from these great subduction earthquakes to\nprefer one interpretation over the other.",

In late April 2015 we collected 76 soil-gas samples in multi-layer foil bags from existing 1.5-m deep tubes, both inside and outside the low-level waste area, as well as from two 110-m-deep multilevel gas-sampling boreholes and a distant background site. These samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide concentration and isotopic composition by direct injection into a cavity ring-down spectrometer. Graphical analysis of results indicates mixing of CO2 characteristic of the root zone (δ13C -18 ‰ VPDB), deep soil gas of the capillary fringe (-20‰), and CO2 produced by microbial respiration of organic matter disposed in the waste area trenches (-28‰). Land-surface boundary conditions are being constrained by the application of a novel non-dispersive infrared sensor and traditional concentration and flux measurements, including discrete CO2 flux data using a gas chamber method to complement continuous data from surface- and tower-based CO2 sensors.

            "abstract": "Surface energy fluxes are exchanged between the surface of the earth and the atmosphere and impact weather, climate, and air quality. The radiation from the sun triggers the surface-atmosphere interaction during the day as heat is transmitted to the surface and the surface heats the air directly above generating wind (i.e., thermal turbulence) that transports heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This process is impacted by greenhouse gasses (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide and other trace gases) that absorb heat emitted by the earth’s surface. The concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gasses are increasing leading to changes in ABL dynamics as a result of the changing surface energy balance. The ABL processes are important to characterize because they are difficult to parameterize in global and regional scale atmospheric models. Empirical data can be collected using eddy covariance micrometeorological methods to measure turbulent fluxes (e.g., sensible heat, moisture, and CO2) and quantify the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere.\nThe objective of this work is to calculate surface fluxes using observational data collected during one week in September 2014 from a monitoring site in Echo, Oregon. The site is located in the Columbia Basin with rolling terrain, irrigated farmland, and over 100 wind turbines. The 10m tower was placed in a small valley depression to isolate nighttime cold air pools. This work will present observations of momentum, sensible heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide fluxes from data collected at a sampling frequency of 10Hz at four heights. Atmospheric stability is determined using Monin-Obukov length and flux Richardson number, and the impact of stability on surface-atmosphere exchange is investigated. This work will provide a better understanding of surface fluxes and mixing, particularly during stable ABL periods, and the results can be used to compare with numerical models.",

Over the last decade, historical time series of AVHRR and MODIS data has been used to characterize the seasonal and interannual variation in terrestrial ecosystems and their responses to a changing and variable climate. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the operational JPSS satellites provides land surface observations in a timely fashion, which has the capability to monitor phenological development in near real time. This capability is particularly important for assisting agriculture, natural resource management, and land modeling for weather prediction systems. Here we introduce a system to monitor in real time and forecast in the short term phenological development based on daily VIIRS observations available with a one-day latency. The system integrates a climatological land surface phenology from long-term MODIS data and available VIIRS observations to simulate a set of potential temporal trajectories of greenness development at a given time and pixel. The greenness trajectories, which are qualified using daily two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), are applied to identify spring green leaf development and autumn color foliage status in real time and to predict the occurrence of future phenological events. This system currently monitors vegetation development across the North America every three days and makes prediction to 10 days ahead. We further introduce the applications of near real time spring green leaf and fall color foliage. Specifically, this system is used for tracing the crop progress across the United States, guiding the field observations in US National Phenology Network, servicing tourists for the observation of color fall foliage, and parameterizing seasonal surface physical conditions for numerical weather prediction models.",

The surface rupture extends about 120 km west of the boundary between the Pacific and the North American plates. The EMC event initiated near the center and ruptured bilaterally into an east-dipping strike-slip fault zone to the north and a west-dipping strike-slip zone to the south. Here we use geodetic measurements including GPS, InSAR (SAR interferometry), and sub-pixel offset measurements to characterize the fault slip during the EMC event. We use dislocation inversion methods to determine fault geometry as well as sub-fault slip distribution based on geodetic measurements. We find that assuming layered earth elastic structure increased the inferred deep slip (10-15 km depth) by up to 1.6 m (60%) compared to assuming a homogeneous elastic structure. Inferred slip was also strongly (up to 2 m) influenced by the choice of observational constraints used in the inversion. The choice of constraints also influenced the inverted seismic moment from Mw 7.20 to 7.26, and the difference is equivalent to a Mw 6.5 event. Our results show that the outcomes of coseismic inversions can vary greatly depending on the methodology, something that needs to be considered both for characterizing an earthquake and when using such results in subsequent studies of postseismic deformation.",

This heterogeneity is one of the biggest barriers to the development of accumulated data products and access capabilities, and to the use of paleo data beyond the community of paleoclimate specialists. We describe a new effort underway at the World Data Service for Paleoclimatology to create a set of standards for documenting variables (i.e., exactly what was measured or reconstructed). The nine-part variable description the WDS-Paleo uses currently is the starting point for this project, which will result in vocabularies that are complete, precise, standard, and extensible. This framework was designed to be general enough for use with all of the eighteen different proxy and reconstruction data types archived by the WDS-Paleo, thus allowing more uniformity to be applied to its holdings and allowing metadata to be stored and searched across proxy types in a single database structure. Ongoing work will extend this generalized variable framework, under the guidance of advisory panels consisting of subject matter experts, to generate proxy-specific and cross-proxy controlled vocabularies.

Stemflow has often been neglected in hydrologic budgeting of both trees and shrubs due to the small volume, and limited number of quantitative studies conducted. Studies of stemflow in shrub species are especially rare, and this study intends to decrease uncertainty of its occurrence. Six shrubs of species Prunus laurocerasus ‘Otto Luyken', Hydrangea quercifolia ‘Alice’ , and Itea virginica ‘Little Henry’ were studied in an urban environment in Philadelphia, PA. During the 2015 growing season, total incident rainfall and measured stemflow were recorded. Stemflow was collected using aluminum collars attached to four stems of each individual. Vinyl tubing transported stemflow from the collars into collection bottles that were weighed after each rain event.\nCanopy areas of each collared branch were calculated. Impact of branch and leaf attachment angles, leaf area index, stem diameter, and bark properties on stemflow were analyzed. In addition to species characteristics, rain depth, rain intensity and wind speed were considered. Stemflow averages were found to be 12 %, 4 %, and 3 % for P. laurocerasus, H. quercifolia, and I. virginica respectively, with values up to 24 % in certain P. laurocerasus branches during some storms. The results show that although in some shrub species stemflow may be negligible, in others it can be high enough to be considered substantial in hydrologic budget calculations. By examining how the quantity of stemflow is affected by both meteorological and species characteristics, the partitioning of rainfall can be more accurately calculated.",

            "abstract": "Nearly half of annual rainfall in the Amazon rainforest region is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration (ET). However, this land-atmosphere water vapor feedback in Amazonia has been continuously disturbed by anthropogenic influence and climate change such as severe drought events. While forest ET dynamics in the Amazon have been studied from both point estimates (or in-situ measurements) and regional land-surface models as well as coarse-spatial satellite data, finer spatial data is required to address the spatial variability of forest ET associated with both forest disturbances and extreme climate events. We use Landsat-based METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) model to generate high-resolution (30 m) ET products and investigate its potential to characterize local and regional ET behavior by comparison to ET calculated from flux tower data. METRIC estimates actual ET as residual of the surface energy balance and is applied to capture the spatial variability of forest ET. The flux tower data were collected at two sites with different forest types: Para with wet equatorial forest and Rondônia with seasonally dry tropical forest. Our study was conducted on the dry season of the years 2003 and 2005 for Para, and 2000 through 2002 for Rondônia as a function of data availability of both cloud-free Landsat images and meteorological data for METRIC processing. Daily gridded actual ET estimates from METRIC during the dry season were obtained using a cubic spline interpolation of ETrF (fraction of reference ET) values between the satellite image dates and multiplying by daily reference ET. Across the all study years, differences between the daily ET estimates for the selected image dates from METRIC and the flux towers were less than 1.2 mm/day, while on monthly basis, these averaged daily ET differences were much lower (< 0.5 mm). At Para, the correlation (R2) between the daily ET rates from METRIC and the flux towers were 0.75 and 0.51 for the years 2003 and 2005, respectively, whereas the correlation at Rondônia were 0.77, 0.84, and 0.72 for 2000, 2001 and 2003, respectively. These results indicate that METRIC derived ET estimates have good correlation with the flux tower ET measurements.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 40% of global food production comes from irrigated agriculture. With the increasing demand for food even greater pressures will be placed on water resources within these systems. In this work we aimed to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture at various scales by combining fixed and roving cosmic-ray neutron probes at four study sites across an East-West precipitation gradient overtopping the High Plains Aquifer (HPA). Each of the four study sites consisted of coarse scale mapping of the entire ~12 by 12 km domain and detailed mapping of 1 quarter section (0.8 by 0.8 km) agricultural field. By using a simplistic data merging technique we are able to produce a statistical daily soil moisture product at a variety of key spatial scales in support of irrigation water management technology: the individual sprinkler (~102 m2) for variable rate irrigation, the individual pie slice (~103 m2) for variable speed irrigation, and the quarter section (0.64 km2) for uniform rate irrigation. In addition, we are able to provide a daily soil moisture product over the 144 km2 study area at a variety of key remote sensing scales 1, 9, and 144 km2. These products can be used to support SMAP/SMOS through calibration, validation, and value addition by statistical downscaling. Future work could include larger scale monitoring in support of GRACE total water storage calculations in the HPA or other key groundwater resource locations by incorporating existing COSMOS sites or establishment of new networks.",

PAN is observed to form rapidly in fire plumes from the oxidation of short-lived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of NOx. It is thought that efficient PAN production in smoke plumes may lead to relatively efficient downwind ozone (O3) production if PAN decomposition serves as an important source of NOx. North America has a relatively long biomass burning season; fires are observed in many different locations over North America during late spring and summer. Here, we present the first measurements of elevated PAN from Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) over western North America during biomass burning season (late spring through summer). We investigate the relationships between the observed interannual variability of elevated PAN and fires, temperature, meteorology and long-range transport.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic fabric and rock magnetism studies were performed on the units of the 570 ± 3 Ma-old isotropic Cabreuva granite (NW of São Paulo State). This intrusion with 160 km2 is roughly elliptical in the oriental and occidental sectors whereas in the south sector it is circular. It is composed of quartz-monzodiorite, granodiorite, quartz-monzonite, monzogranite, diorite, quartz syenite and synogarnite. Magnetic fabrics were determined by applying both anisotropy of low-field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anisotropy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (AARM). The two fabrics are coaxial. The parallelism between AMS and AARM tensors excludes the presence of a single domain (SD) effect on the AMS fabric of the units. Several rock-magnetism experiments performed in one specimen from each sampled unit show that for all units the magnetic susceptibility and magnetic fabrics are carried by magnetite grains.\nFoliations and lineations in the units were successful determined by applying magnetic methods. Most of the magnetic foliations are horizontal or steeply dipping in all units, and are roughly parallel to the foliation of the rocks which surround the granite. The magnetic lineations present mostly low plunges for the whole pluton. Thin section analysis show that rocks from the Cabreuva granite were not affected by the regional strain during and after emplacement. This evidence allows us to interpret the observed magnetic fabrics as primary in origin (magmatic) acquired when the rocks were solidified as a result of magma flow, in which horizontally plunging magnetic lineation suggests that the feeder zone is far from this area.",

            "abstract": "Structure in the charged particle number density in the equatorial ionosphere can have a profound impact on the fidelity of HF, VHF and UHF radio signals that are used for ground-to-ground and space-to-ground communication and navigation. The degree to which such systems can be compromised depends in large part on the spatial distribution of the structured regions in the ionosphere and the background plasma density in which they are embedded.\nIn order to address these challenges it is necessary to accurately distinguish the background ionospheric conditions that favor the generation of irregularities from those that do not. Additionally we must relate the evolution of those conditions to the subsequent evolution of the irregular plasma regions themselves. The background ionospheric conditions are conveniently described by latitudinal profiles of the plasma density at nearly constant altitude, which describe the effects of ExB drifts and neutral winds, while the appearance and growth of plasma structure requires committed observations from the ground from at least one fixed longitude.\nThis talk will present an international collaborative CubeSat mission called SPORT that stands for Scintillation Prediction Observations Research Task. This mission that will advance our understanding of the nature and evolution of ionospheric structures around sunset to improve predictions of disturbances that affect radio propagation and telecommunication signals. The science goals will be accomplished by a unique combination of satellite observations from a nearly circular middle inclination orbit and the extensive operation of ground based observations from South America near the magnetic equator.

            "abstract": "Warm circumpolar deep water reaching 3.5ºC above the in situ freezing point pervasively fills a network of glacially carved troughs in the Amundsen sea, West Antarctica, and melts and thins neighbouring ice shelves, including Pine Island glacier Ice Shelf (PIIS). Hydrographic, current, and microstructure observations obtained in austral summer 2009 and 2014 by an autonomous underwater vehicle beneath the PIIS are used here to detail the complex ice-ocean interaction and resulting ocean circulation. The theoretical schematic of deeply incoming warm and saline water melting the grounding line and generating a buoyant plume upwelling along the ice draft is generally consistent with observations. The cavity beneath PIIS is clearly divided in two by a seabed ridge, constraining the oceanic circulation and water masses distribution. On the seaward side of the ridge, a thick warm deep water layer circulates cyclonically and is overlaid by a thin meltwater layer. Only intermediate depth waters are allowed to overflow from the ridge top into the inner cavity, where a much thinner warm water layer is now overlaid by a thicker meltwater layer. At the ice/ocean interface, melt induced freshening is forcing an upwelling which in turn injects cyclonic vorticity and participates in creating a vigorous cyclonic recirculation in the inner cavity. The top of the ridge, where warm waters overflow in the inner cavity, is a dynamical boundary characterized by northward along-ridge currents up to 0.2 m/s and enhanced shear, thermal gradient, and mixing. Observations at two points at the ice interface indicate that the ocean remains stratified within 2 meters of the ice.",

            "abstract": "With favorable tropical SST conditions, the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season turns out surprisingly quiet. The suppressed Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity can be attributed to the unusually frequent breaking of midlatitude Rossby waves. We will show that the frequency of RWB over the North Atlantic and indices of Atlantic TC activity are negatively correlated in 1979-2013, at confidence levels comparable to the correlation between tropical Atlantic SST and TC activity.\nOur case study suggests that RWB induces tropics-extratropics mixing and perturbs the tropical Atlantic atmosphere. This is supported by the composites of RWB-induced anomalies using RWB cases identified in July-October in 1979-2013. RWB frequency over the North Atlantic varies substantially from season to season, and its variations are closely associated with the variability of tropical Atlantic environment. More (less) frequent RWB contributes to higher (lower) vertical wind shear and lower (higher) moisture content. Consequently, TC activity is substantially suppressed when RWB is frequent. We also find that the correlation is mostly contributed by RWB over the West Atlantic, although RWB over the East Atlantic also have significant impacts on TC activity. Taken together, our study highlights the extratropical impacts on Atlantic TC activity.",

            "abstract": "Water use by rice fields is one of the most important components in hydrologic model simulation of the Sacramento Valley, California. In this study, rice fields were mapped by an automatic approach using Landsat imagery. The automatic approach is advantageous for its capacity of mapping rice fields repeatedly, consistently and timely without the need to collect training data. Seasonal dynamics of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were employed to identify rice based on its phenological characteristics. Classification could be conducted around planting date for early response to cropland use change, or for the full growing season to monitor rice growth. Two studies are illustrated as the applications of this mapping method:\n1. A rice map was produced before mid-June to forecast rice acreage and water use in the 2015 drought. Due to continuous drought, rice acreage in the Sacramento Valley reached the historical minimum of the past 20 years in 2014, and further reduction is occurring in 2015. A quantitative measure of rice field extent is needed to forecast rice water use as early as possible. The automatic mapping method utilized the spectral dynamics during initial flooding to identify rice fields. Based on the map product, the forecast of rice water demand was made to facilitate the simulation of current-year hydrologic conditions.\n2. Rice field extent has been mapped since 1989 and phenological metrics have been derived to study the change in growing season. The increasing use of short-season rice varieties and special weather condition (like El Nino in 2015) may alter the seasonal pattern of water demand by rice. Rice fields were identified based on the temporal profiles of NDMI and EVI derived from series of segmented images. Validation using field survey data and other land use maps showed a promising accuracy. The start and the end of the growing season and other phenological metrics were extracted from object-level temporal profiles of EVI by a curve-fitting method. The monthly pattern of water demand by rice fields was depicted for each region and each year to improve the calibration of hydrologic simulation models.",

            "abstract": "Variations of gas density and composition in Earth’s thermosphere and ionosphere are key indicators of interactions between different layers of Earth’s atmosphere. The nature of interactions between neutral and ion species in the upper atmosphere is an active area of study in Heliophysics and there is much to learn about the dynamic relationship between the ionosphere and neutral thermosphere. Mass Spectrometers are among an array of instruments used to explore Earth’s upper atmosphere and other space environments. Normally, these instruments are substantial in size and deployed on larger satellites. Data from these larger instruments generally provides information from a specific point in time at a single location. Studies of atmospheric density and composition with multiple locations for each time point could be performed by CubeSat swarms if proper instrumentation were available to fit CubeSat payload restrictions. The proposed miniaturized time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) will have a mass resolution and range sufficient for measuring the composition of Earth’s thermosphere and ionosphere while operating within the power and space constraints of a CubeSat. The capabilities of this instrument would potentially dramatically reduce the cost of future missions while simultaneously enhancing the science return. The design employs miniaturization of TOF-MS technology, including resolution refinement techniques used for larger instruments and standard concepts for TOF-MS components such as acceleration grids, a Bradbury-Nielsen wire gate, a gridless ion mirror, and microchannel plate detector (MCP). The quality of particle detection is known to have a significant impact on the instrument performance. A signal collector for an MCP detector is being designed to maximize the detection performance and enable the transmission of density and composition data back to Earth.",

            "abstract": "A 1-D analytic solution for combined heat and groundwater flow through an aquifer system accounts for geothermal heating at the base of the aquifer, recharge of cooler water along the groundwater flow path, advection of heat within the aquifer, conduction of heat through the vadose zone, and viscous heating. The 1-D solution, which uses a freely available Python script, can be applied to moderately complex geometries by solving the heat flow equation for piece-wise linear or constant properties and boundary conditions. Analysis of the Eastern Snake River Plain regional aquifer system demonstrates that viscous heating, normally neglected by numerical solutions, is variably important along the groundwater flow path, and that heat conduction to the land surface and cool recharge are the primary thermal perturbations causing deviation from a steady, slow heating along the flow path. Because viscous heating is sometimes important, a general anisotropic form of the viscous heat-generation term has been derived and can be included in more complex 2-D and 3-D numerical solvers of the coupled heat and groundwater flow equations. The 1-D solution allows quick and easy determination of whether this term needs to be included. The rate at which thermal perturbations equilibrate with distance is controlled by the Peclet Number (the ratio of advective to conductive heat transport), which can be used to estimate the distance over which thermal perturbations (e.g., cool recharge or local geothermal hotspots) will be detectable.",

            "abstract": "The use of a coastally-located GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) instrument as a relatively high accuracy proxy tide gauge, by employing multipath reflection analysis of incoming signals, has been demonstrated in recent studies. Inversion of positional GNSS data (coseismic displacements) from networks of multiple instruments is currently used to constrain tsunamigenic sources for forecasting in existing tsunami early-warning systems. However, the GNSS multipath reflection method has not yet been directly applied in a tsunami-warning context. This technique employs reflected signals arriving at the GNSS antenna, which are generally discarded as 'noise' in standard positional measurements. The signal-to-noise ratio data encoded in standard RINEX data are analyzed, allowing computation of the vertical distance from the antenna to the water surface using multipath reflection theory. GNSS instruments can be co-located with pre-existing physical (analog) tide-gauge instruments to create a comparative baseline to evaluate the suitability of this technique in the field. Sea level time series derived from GNSS data are compared with time series recorded by analog instruments in order to establish a correlation and margin of error in typical use. With the aid of three test sites bordering the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada, we will assess whether tsunami wave amplitudes and periods can be determined in near real time with sufficient accuracy for use in tsunami detection and early warning. The ultimate goal of this work is to deploy GNSS instruments independently as tide gauges in locations where analog tide gauges are not practical. An expanded network of coastal GNSS instruments would also provide valuable positional data for crustal deformation analyses, especially in regions with current sparse networks such as the west coast of Canada.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed the response of tropical dry forests to seasonal and interannual rainfall variability, focusing on the caatinga biome in semi-arid in Northeast Brazil. We selected four sites across a gradient of rainfall amount and seasonality and analyzed daily rainfall and biweekly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the period 2000-2014. The seasonal and interannual rainfall statistics were characterized using recently developed metrics describing duration, location, and intensity of wet season and compared them with those of NDVI time series and modelled soil moisture. A model of NDVI was also developed and forced by different rainfall scenarios (combination amount of rainfall and duration of wet season). The results show that the caatinga tends to have a more stable response characterized by longer and less variable growing seasons (of duration 3.1±0.1 months) compared to the rainfall wet seasons (2.0±0.5 months). Even for more extreme rainfall conditions, the ecosystem shows very little sensitivity to duration of wet season in relation to the amount of rainfall, however the duration of wet season is most evident for wetter sites. This ability of the ecosystem in buffering the interannual variability of rainfall is corroborated by the stability of the centroid location of the growing season compared to the wet season for all sites. The maximal biomass production was observed at intermediate levels of seasonality, suggesting a possible interesting trade-off in the effects of intensity (i.e., amount) and duration of the wet season on vegetation growth.",

            "abstract": "It is now well established that stratospheric ozone depletion has been one of the dominant drivers of recent climate change in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. However, the effects of ozone depletion on Antarctic climate change during the past several decades are much more uncertain. Here, we examine the impact of ozone depletion on the Antarctic surface energy budget using a suite of simulations from the Community Earth System Model-Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM-WACCM). CESM-WACCM is a state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean general circulation model that includes interactive stratospheric chemistry, as well as a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice scheme. We performed two sets of integrations with WACCM for the period 1960-2005, each consisting of \u00076 ensemble members. In the first set of integrations, the model was driven with all time-varying natural and anthropogenic forcings, most notably the observed increases in ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and other well-mixed greenhouse gases. The second set of 6 integrations is identical to the first, except that ODSs are kept fixed at 1960 levels, thus preventing the model from developing a springtime Antarctic stratospheric ozone hole. Comparison between these two ensembles of simulations therefore unambiguously quantifies the impact of ozone depletion on the Antarctic surface energy budget. We find that the decrease in stratospheric ozone concentrations in recent decades leads to an \u0007increase of 2-3 W/m2 in incident (downward) shortwave radiation at the Antarctic surface during austral spring and summer. However, due to a concomitant increase in surface reflectivity, there is little change in net shortwave radiation in the model simulations. Downward long-wave emission increases as a consequence of greenhouse gases in both ensembles, while latent and sensible heat fluxes do not change significantly. \u0007Taken together, these results indicate that ozone depletion alone has a negligible effect on Antarctic surface energy budget.\b Implications of these results for the interpretation of observed Antarctic surface temperature changes are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Similkameen watershed in southern British Columbia, Canada is expected to warm substantially in the coming decades. A higher proportion of winter rain to snow and an earlier onset of spring snowmelt are likely to result in lower spring stream flow peaks. The reduction in winter water storage, combined with longer, warmer, and drier summers, poses a challenge for water resources in an irrigation-based agricultural watershed. There are already substantial irrigation developments, and water demands are expected to increase to maintain current agricultural production, further stressing a shrinking summer water supply.\nAgriculture releases significant amounts of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 8% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada, excluding CO2 emissions from fuels. Agricultural GHG fluxes are complex but the active management of agricultural systems offers possibilities for mitigating GHG emissions. Although GHG emissions derived from soil have been researched for several decades, there are still geographic regions and agricultural systems that have not been well characterized.\nThis work will address a series of questions for the Similkameen watershed. For a range of climate scenarios, we will: (i) use the GENESYS (GENerate Earth SYstems Science input) hydrometeorological model to simulate historical and future water supplies; (ii) link GENESYS and AquaCrop models to assess climate driven changes in water requirement and associated crop productivity; and (iii) link GENESYS and HOLOS (whole-farm model and software program that estimates GHG emissions) to estimate farm and regional level GHG emissions and seasonal nutrient balance for the crops in the watershed.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation methods applied to hydrological applications have primarily focused on assimilating streamflow and, more recently, soil moisture observations. Few cases actually assimilate both observations, and even fewer incorporate additional observations into the assimilation procedure. This is despite extensive developments in remote sensing information. Most research on data assimilation has focused on the implementation of sequential assimilation using Kalman filters. We present an alternative approach using variational methods based on Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to simultaneously assimilate streamflow data and remote sensing information obtained from the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) community, namely snow-covered area, snow water equivalent and soil moisture. This approach enables a highly flexible formulation of distance metrics for the introduction of noise into the model and the agreement between simulated and observed variables.\nThe application of MHE on data assimilation is tested at two data-dense test sites in Germany and one data-sparse environment in Turkey. The assessment of results is based on the lead time performance of state variables of the conceptual rainfall-runoff model, i.e. not limited to the performance of streamflow forecast but also applicable to snow and soil moisture forecast skills. Results show a potential improvement on the performance of the forecasted streamflow when using a perfect time series of state variables generated through the simulation of the conceptual rainfall-runoff model HBV. The assimilation of H-SAF data, in combination with streamflow, reduces the performance of the forecasted streamflow compared to the assimilation using only streamflow data. However, other forecasted quantities such as the snow water equivalent or soil moisture are improved. Recommendations based on the test cases are given following the length of the assimilation window.",

            "abstract": "The late Cenozoic tectonics of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions needs to be evaluated within the context of a larger dynamic system related to the subduction of the Indian oceanic lithosphere beneath Myanmar and Yunnan. The details of the geodynamic processes involve mantle flows associated with rollback and tears (which probably occur both laterally and horizontally) of the Indian slab with consequent effects on the geology of the overriding plate. These effects include: 1) volcanism in Tongchong, Yunnan Province, 2) clockwise rotational deformation of the overriding plate and 3) Burma Plate capture. In this talk we will present the strain rate throughout the region with a moment tensor summation of earthquake data. The deformation of SE Tibet, Yunnan and western Sichuan constitutes a distributed N-S oriented dextral shear zone with clockwise rotations up to 1.7° per million years. It is the clockwise vorticity relative to south China that accounts for the relative northward motion of India at a rate of 38±12 mm/yr at the Himalayas. Relative to south China, there is no southeastward extrusion of crustal material beyond the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Studies on earthquake seismic moment data, fault-slip data, and GPS measurements all show a clockwise rotational motion of SE Tibet, Yunnan, western Sichuan and eastern Myanmar around the EHS. The mirror image of this situation that is occurring today is the counterclockwise rotation of Anatolia, which is associated with the rollback of the Hellenic and Cyprian Trenches. In this talk we will also discuss the extreme oblique convergence between Indian and Burma plates and one of the effects of the oblique subducation is the transfer of right-lateral strike-slip faulting to the Indo Burma Range, one of the largest GeoPRISMs on Earth.",

            "abstract": "Direct measurement of groundwater flux is difficult to obtain in the field so hydrogeologists often use easily-detectable environmental tracers, such as heat or chemicals, as an indirect way to characterize flux. Previously, we developed a groundwater flux characterization (GFC) probe by using distributed temperature sensing (DTS) to monitor the temperature responses to active heating in a well. The temperature responses were consistent with the hydraulic conductivity profiles determined at the same location, and provided high-resolution information (approx. 1.5 cm) about vertical variations in horizontal flux through the screen. One of the key assumptions in the previous GFC approach was that the vertical variations in the thermal conductivity of the aquifer materials near the well are negligible, so that the temperature differences with depth are primarily a result of groundwater flux instead of thermal conduction. Although this assumption is likely valid for wells constructed with an artificial filter pack, it might become questionable for wells with natural filter packs (such as the wells constructed by direct push where the sediments are allowed to directly collapse onto the well screen). In this work, we develop a new procedure for separating advection from thermal conduction during GFC measurement. In addition to the normal open-screen GFC profiling, an impermeable sleeve was used so that heating tests could be performed without advective flow entering the well. The heating tests under sleeved conditions were primarily controlled by the thermal conduction around the well, and therefore could be used to remove the impact of thermal conduction from the normal GFC results obtained under open-screen conditions. This new procedure was tested in a laboratory sandbox, where a series of open-screen and sleeved GFC tests were performed under different flow rates. Results indicated that for the tested range of rates (Darcy velocity 0 – 0.78 m/d), the relation between the temperature increase in open-screen GFC tests and flow rate appeared to be largely linear, while temperature responses in the sleeved tests did not change significantly with flow. Numerical simulations of these experiments have further confirmed the validity of the new procedure for removing the conduction impact from flux measurement.",

Data provided by in-situ spacecraft measurement are too sparse to supply enough inputs for continuous global modeling of the radiation belt. Here we present a model to predict amplitude, peak frequency and spectral width of the electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave from the anisotropic ring current ion distributions, which are the source of the wave. The model is derived from hybrid simulations in a large initial parameter space for plasmas consisting of electrons, protons, and helium ions. Key parameters include the ratio of plasma frequency to ion gyrofrequency, the density, temperature and anisotropy of hot ions, and the cold-ion composition. The results show that amplitude, peak frequency and spectral width of EMIC waves can be related to linear properties of the anisotropy-driven instability, e.g. growth rate and plasma beta, through simple analytic formulas. Combined with a dynamic ring current model, this model can provide global EMIC wave information needed for radiation-belt modeling.",

However, even if the flow speed is significantly damped within dense arrays, the amount of sediment that gets lifted into suspension increases as the density of the array increases due to array- and cylinder-scale turbulence. We present a first attempt to provide predictive relationships of suspended sediment concentration using an alternative approach for the Shields parameter with an empirical coefficient to account for turbulence generated by submerged arrays of rigid cylinders.

            "abstract": "The temporal evolution of seismicity rates within geothermal fields provides important observational constraints on the ways in which rocks respond to natural and anthropogenic loading. We develop an iterative, regularized inversion procedure to partition the observed seismicity rate into two primary components: (1) the interaction seismicity rate due to earthquake-earthquake triggering, and (2) the time-varying background seismicity rate controlled by other time-dependent stresses, including anthropogenic forcing. We parameterize our seismicity model using an Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) framework with a background seismicity rate that varies smoothly with time. We apply our methodology to study long-term changes in seismicity rates at the Geysers and Salton Sea geothermal fields in California. At the Geysers, we find that the background seismicity rate is highly correlated with fluid injection. Seismicity at the Geysers has experienced a rate increase of approximately 50% since year 2000 and exhibits strong seasonal fluctuations, both of which can be explained by changes in fluid injection following the completion of the Santa Rosa pipeline. At the Salton Sea, the background seismicity rate has remained relatively stable since 1990, with short-term fluctuations that are not obviously modulated by fluid fluxes related to the operation of the geothermal field. The differences in the field-wide seismicity responses of the Geysers and Salton Sea to geothermal plant operation may reflect differences in in-situ reservoir conditions and local tectonics, indicating that induced seismicity may not be solely a function of fluid injection and withdrawal.",

The challenge is to make accurate field measurements at sites around the world, even in extreme environmental conditions. Sites with dirty air present a particular challenge. Gas concentration measurements may be degraded as dust or debris is deposited on the optical windows in the sample cell. The traditional solution has been to add an in-line filter upstream of the sample cell to keep the windows clean. However, these filters clog over time and must be changed periodically. An in-line filter also acts as a mixing volume and in some cases limits the frequency response of the analyzer. A novel eddy-covariance system that includes a vortex air cleaner at the inlet has been developed and field tested. This new system eliminates the need for a traditional in-line filter to keep the sample cell windows clean. The new system reduces system maintenance and down time. Eddy covariance systems with the vortex intake were tested at several sites ranging from sites with extremely dirty urban air to sites with relatively clean mountain air, and in agricultural areas. These flux systems were monitoring either CO2 and H2O, or N2O. Results show that the closed-path eddy covariance systems with a vortex intake perform very well and require lower maintenance compared to similar systems with in-line filters.",

There remain significant uncertainties in the processes responsible for NOx emissions and subsequent mixing and chemical removal. NOx has a short lifetime and its emissions show high spatiotemporal variability at urban scale. Future geostationary satellite instruments including TEMPO, GEMS and Sentinel-4 will provide hourly time resolution and high spatial resolution observations providing maps of NO2 on diurnal and local scales. Here we determine the extent to which a TEMPO like instrument can quantify urban-scale NOx emissions using a regional data assimilation (DA) system comprising of a chemical transport model, WRF-Chem, a TEMPO simulator and the DART Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter. We generate synthetic TEMPO observations by sampling from a nature run on an urban scale domain. We consider the effect of albedo, surface pressure, solar and viewing angles and a priori NO2 profiles on the TEMPO NO2 averaging kernel to achieve scene-dependent instrument sensitivity. We estimate NOx emissions using DART in a state augmentation approach by including NOx emissions in the state vector being analyzed. The ensemble-based statistical estimation of error correlations between concentrations and emissions are critical as they determine the impact of assimilated observations. We describe observing system simulation experiments to explore the optimal approach in the ensemble-based DA system to estimate hourly-resolved NOx emissions from TEMPO NO2 observations. Several case studies will be presented examining the role of covariance localization length and chemical perturbations on the success of the approach.",

            "abstract": "Two medium-sized watersheds of the Piracicaba river basin, the Camanducaia and Jaguari sub-basins, are being studied to evaluate the effects of land use change on the basin’s hydrobiogeochemistry. The Jaguari basin is an important provider the Cantareira reservoir system that supplies around six million inhabitants of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Brazil. A one-year hydrological study began on January 2015 to monitor some water quality parameters such as pH, electric conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+) and total nitrogen (TN). For that purpose we established 19 sampling stations along the Camanducaia (8 stations) and Jaguari (11 stations) river channels; two stations at their main tributaries Mosquito and Camanducaia Mineiro, respectively; and another two stations at small streams in headwater areas of the Jaguari and Camanducaia watersheds. Preliminary results show that DOC concentrations are correlated DIC (r=0.81 at Jaguari; r=0.70 at Camanducaia; p <0.05). We observe that DOC tends to increase by multiples of 2.5 and 3.5 times from forested headwater areas to the most downstream stations of Jaguari and Camanducaia, respectively. Regarding DIC these multiples are 4.4 and 1.9 times greater. The four most downstream stations at Jaguari show urban area effects with higher DIC monthly values ranging from 28.7 to 33 mg L-1. Also DIC correlated with EC values (means around 160 µS) at two of these stations. We expect that at the end of this monitoring year results will show stronger relations between hydrobiogeochemical parameters and land use change.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes proposed satellite carbon measurements from the CHRONOS mission. The primary goal of this experiment is to measure the atmospheric pollutants carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) from geostationary orbit, with hourly observations of North America at high spatial resolution. CHRONOS observations would provide measurements not currently available or planned as part of a surface, suborbital and satellite integrated observing system for atmospheric composition over North America. Carbon monoxide is produced by combustion processes such as urban activity and wildfires, and serves as a proxy for other combustion pollutants that are not easily measured. Methane has diverse anthropogenic sources ranging from fossil fuel production, animal husbandry, agriculture and waste management. The impact of gas exploration in the Western States of the USA and oil extraction from the Canadian tar sands will be particular foci of the mission, as will the poorly-quantified natural CH4 emissions from wetlands and thawing permafrost. In addition to characterizing pollutant sources, improved understanding of the domestic CH4 budget is a priority for policy decisions related to short-lived climate forcers. A primary motivation for targeting CO is its value as a tracer of atmospheric pollution, and CHRONOS measurements will provide insight into local and long-range transport across the North American continent, as well as the processes governing the entrainment and venting of pollution in and out of the planetary boundary layer. As a result of significantly improved characterization of diurnal changes in atmospheric composition, CHRONOS observations will find direct societal applications for air quality regulation and forecasting. We present a quantification of this expected improvement in the prediction of near-surface concentrations when CHRONOS measurements are used in Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). If CHRONOS and the planned NASA Earth Venture TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) mission were implemented concurrently, the resulting measurement suite would efficiently and expeditiously serve to address the science goals of the Decadal Survey proposed GEO-CAPE mission.",

            "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that plant productivity, and especially shrub abundance, is increasing in the Arctic in response to climate change. This greening is substantiated by increases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, repeat photography and field observations. The implications of a greener Arctic on carbon sequestration by tundra ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we explore existing datasets of plant productivity and soil carbon stocks to quantify how greening, and in particular an expansion of woody shrubs, may translate to the sequestration of carbon in arctic soils.\nAs an estimate of carbon storage in arctic tundra soils, we used the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database v2. As estimates of tundra type and productivity, we used the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation map as well as the MODIS and Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields, and MODIS GPP/NPP (MOD17) products.\nPreliminary findings suggest that in graminoid tundra and erect-shrub tundra higher shrub abundance is associated with greater soil carbon stocks. However, this relationship between shrub abundance and soil carbon is not apparent in prostrate-shrub tundra, or when comparing across graminoid tundra, erect-shrub tundra and prostrate-shrub tundra. Uncertainties originate from the extreme spatial (vertical and horizontal) heterogeneity of organic matter distribution in cryoturbated soils, the fact that (some) permafrost carbon stocks, e.g. yedoma, reflect previous rather than current vegetative cover, and small sample sizes, esp. in the High Arctic.\nUsing Vegetation Continuous Fields and MODIS GPP/NPP (MOD17), we develop quantitative trajectories of soil carbon storage as a function of shrub cover and plant productivity in the Arctic (>60°N). We then compare our greening-derived carbon sequestration estimates to projected losses of carbon from thawing permafrost.\nOur findings will reduce uncertainties in the magnitude and timing of the carbon-climate feedback from the terrestrial Arctic, and thus provide guidance for future climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

In the games, players come to understand how demand for energy, water use, and climate change are tightly intertwined. Analysis by scientists from the national laboratories ensured that the games are reflect current data and research. The games have been tested with high school and informal science educators and their students and have received a formal evaluation. The games website\nhttp://isenm.org/games-for-learning\nshows how the games align with the NGSS, the Common Core, and the NRC's Strands of Science Learning. It also contains an extensive collection of accessible articles on the nexus to support use of the games in instruction.\nThirst for Power is a challenging resource management game. Players, acting as governors of regions, compete to be the first to meet their citizens’ energy needs. A governor can choose from a variety of carbon-based or renewable energy sources, but each source uses water and has an environmental—including climate change—impact. Energy needs must be met using only the water resources allocated to the region and without exceeding the environmental impact limit. \"ACTION\" cards alter game play and increase competition. Challenge and Persuade is a game of scientific argumentation, using evidence on nexus-related fact cards. Players must evaluate information, develop fact-based arguments, and communicate their findings. One card deck contains a set of adjectives, a second a series of fact cards. Players use their fact cards to make the best argument that aligns with an adjective selected by the “Judge”. Players take turns being the “Judge,” who determines who made the best argument.\nThe games particularly align with NGSS elements:\nConnections to Engineering, Technology, and Application of Science. Players come to understand the science and engineering behind many energy sources and their impacts.\nConnection to Nature of Science. Players must manage the complexity of relationships among water, energy, and climate change and solve problems with science, technology, and policies.\nScience and Engineering Practice.

            "abstract": "River deltas earn their name from a characteristic planform-triangular shape, but in reality demonstrate a wide range of morphologies. The sinuosity of delta shorelines, i.e. shoreline rugosity, is particularly variable worldwide even among deltas where waves and tides are not dominant processes. We hypothesize that river-dominated deltas built through construction of depositional lobes develop a characteristic shoreline rugosity that is determined by long-term patterns in avulsion location, avulsion timing, and channel migration, all of which can be strongly influenced by backwater hydrodynamics. Scaling arguments predict that shoreline rugosity should increase linearly with avulsion timescale, inversely with avulsion lengthscale, and inversely with channel lateral migration rate. We present results from two scaled flume experiments that confirm this hypothesis, and furthermore illustrate the importance of backwater hydrodynamics in controlling the dominant rates and scales in a growing delta. Under the case of variable discharge floods that maintain a dynamic backwater zone, avulsions occur at a fixed distance from the shoreline, resulting in the construction of lobes of constant size even during shoreline progradation. In addition, erosion caused by drawdown hydrodynamics during floods eliminates alternating bars, which slows lateral migration of the channel and allows for more elongate delta lobes. Based on these results, and a compilation of modern river-dominated deltas, we propose a new dimensionless phase space for the occurrence backwater-mediated deltas with rugose shorelines.",

            "abstract": "Balloon-borne measurements are ideal candidates for assimilation into reanalyses as they provide data at a spatial and temporal scale that cannot be gained from satellite-based measurements. Google [x] Project Loon is flying hundreds of long duration super-pressure balloons at altitudes of around 20 km in the southern mid-latitudes. Onboard measurements of temperature and pressure, as well as wind data which can be derived from balloon location information, will significantly increase the availability of these data over southern middle and high latitudes.\nWe present an analysis of the scientific utility of Project Loon temperature, pressure and wind data. Project Loon temperature measurements from 79 balloon flights indicate a bias that depends on the solar zenith angle. This bias results from the daytime heating of the balloon by solar radiation and can be statistically modelled using a linear least squares regression model. Once the measurements are corrected using this model, differences between the balloon-borne temperature measurements and NCEP CFSR temperatures are reduced to less than 1K for all solar zenith angles smaller than 150°. This suggests that an empirically derived correction for Loon-based temperature measurements may make these data suitable for use in reanalyses. Loon pressure measurements agree well with reanalyses, with differences between balloon measurements and NCEP CFSR of 0.174±0.571 hPa and against NCEP NCAR 0.535±0.537 hPa. Wind fields derived from balloon location information compare favourably with MERRA and ERA-Interim reanalyses. Loon wind fields exhibit high-frequency variability which isn't observed in MERRA or ERA-Interim reanalyses. Project Loon provides long duration measurements with high temporal resolution that are valuable to reanalyses, particularly in a region that has a sparse measurement record such as the middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography tells us that the large-scale structure of the lower mantle is dominated by a pair of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), and contains regions of faster-than-average velocities associated with past subduction. These structures are thought to influence and be influenced by mantle convection, and are linked to the introduction/creation, survival, and destruction of chemical heterogeneity in the deep interior. In fact, while sinking slabs are ipso facto associated with compositional variations, the laterally abrupt velocity changes across the boundaries of the LLSVPs – among other lines of evidence – indicate that the LLSVPs also represent a domain compositionally distinct from ambient mantle. The discovery of meso-scales structures, seismically similar to the LLSVPs and exemplified by the Perm Anomaly, suggests that compositional variations in the lower mantle might be tomographically discernible even at smaller length scales. Quantifying the morphology and spatial distribution of these seismically imaged structures provides important clues to the chemical heterogeneity and dynamical state of the Earth’s deep interior.\nIn this presentation, we determine the morphology of the slower-than-average, faster-than-average, and neutral seismic regions, in order to provide quantitative estimates of the locations, volumes, and shapes of lower mantle structures, including, but not limited to the African and Pacific LLSVPs. We do so by carrying out a cluster analysis of VS profiles with a sliding window in depth, which allows us to map out the three-dimensional morphology of the LLSVPs that is consistent across tomographic models. Based on these analyses, we estimate the volume of the LLSVPs to be 5-9% of the mantle, which is several times larger than past estimates. We then catalog the broad range of boundary geometries for the LLSVPs and compare them to results from high-resolution waveform studies, where available. Finally, we identify meso-scale structures within and outside the LLSVPs, and demonstrate their effects on seismic waveforms.",

            "abstract": "The northward-flowing Red River of the North Basin (RRB), located in eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, is vulnerable to frequent floods due to its flat terrain and low permeability soil. A vast majority of floods in the basin occur during the snowmelt season, when the winter snowpack thaws and spring rains fall onto saturated soils. This causes the Red River to spill over shallow banks and across the floodplain. The region has sparse in situ observations of snow and soil moisture, making flood prediction in the RRB difficult. Remote sensing data can help to capture magnitude, timing, and spatial distribution of watershed scale snow, soil moisture, and snowmelt parameters in the RRB, which will allow for better characterization of the watershed’s hydrologic state. This research examines snow water equivalent (SWE; from the AMSR-E, AMSR2, and SSM/I satellite instruments), soil moisture (from AMSR-E, SMOS, and SMAP), and snow covered area (SCA; from MODIS), along with modeled SWE and snow depth from NOAA’s National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). These data are compared with observations from local and federal snow surveys, NOHRSC Airborne Gamma Radiation Snow Survey Program flights, NOAA National Climate Data Center (NCDC) cooperative network sites, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) sites, and the North Central River Forecast Center’s (NCRFC) model states, in order to determine data quality as well as strengths and weaknesses of satellite observations for RRB flood forecasting. Future analyses will include evaluation of freeze/thaw state information from the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) satellite, and explore the potential for flood forecasting improvement by updating state variables of the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) operational forecasting models with remotely sensed fields.",

            "abstract": "Pareto multi-objective global optimization (PMOGO) methods generate a suite of solutions that minimize multiple objectives (e.g. data misfits and regularization terms) in a Pareto-optimal sense. Providing a suite of models, as opposed to a single model that minimizes a weighted sum of objectives, allows a more complete assessment of the possibilities and avoids the often difficult choice of how to weight each objective.\nWe are applying PMOGO methods to three classes of inverse problems. The first class are standard mesh-based problems where the physical property values in each cell are treated as continuous variables. The second class of problems are also mesh-based but cells can only take discrete physical property values corresponding to known or assumed rock units. In the third class we consider a fundamentally different type of inversion in which a model comprises wireframe surfaces representing contacts between rock units; the physical properties of each rock unit remain fixed while the inversion controls the position of the contact surfaces via control nodes. This third class of problem is essentially a geometry inversion, which can be used to recover the unknown geometry of a target body or to investigate the viability of a proposed Earth model. Joint inversion is greatly simplified for the latter two problem classes because no additional mathematical coupling measure is required in the objective function.\nPMOGO methods can solve numerically complicated problems that could not be solved with standard descent-based local minimization methods. This includes the latter two classes of problems mentioned above. There are significant increases in the computational requirements when PMOGO methods are used but these can be ameliorated using parallelization and problem dimension reduction strategies.",

            "abstract": "We tested the hypotheses that increased hydrological connectivity is associated with gully formation due to sugarcane agriculture, and, that this in turn, compromises the effectiveness of stream riparian buffers at protecting streams. Based largely on results from temperate regions, national-level programs to restore riparian buffers have been promoted in tropical countries like Brazil. The assumption is that the buffers would mitigate the impacts of agriculture on stream hydrology and water quality. We show however that the combination of intensive agriculture and heavy seasonal rainfall (which is characteristic of many tropical regions) causes gully formation thereby expanding the drainage network and increasing the hydrological connectivity between streams and their uplands. The result is that excess runoff and associated materials from croplands and from the gullies themselves can enter stream channels directly without interaction with a riparian buffer. Focusing on 11 first-order streams in Brazil, we quantified the relationship between a suite of landscape metrics, the hydrologic response to storm events (i.e., stream flashiness) and changes in suspended sediment concentrations. We included novel metrics describing the hydrological connectivity via gully. We demonstrate that streams more hydrologically connected to their uplands via gullies were flashier and had greater suspended sediment concentrations.

            "abstract": "Population growth and changes in land use are leading to increasing rates of deforestation and land degradation in the Brazilian Caatinga—a semiarid tropical forest. The influence of deforestation and subsequent recovery on soil hydrological properties and erosion are poorly understood. To investigate the influence of forest regeneration stage on soil hydrological processes, we conducted small plot rainfall simulation experiments on (1) a degraded pasture, recently abandoned; (2) an abandoned pasture left for natural recovery in the past seven years; (3) a 40 year old regenerating forestland; and (4) an old-growth forestland. In addition, we determined infiltration rates using single rings (following the Beerkan Method) and in the laboratory we applied the constant head method to soil core samples. Hydraulic parameters will be obtained using the BEST method with SciLab software and statistical analysis of the data will be carried in R. We found that infiltration rates were highest and erosion the lowest in the old-growth forest. Surprisingly, differences in both infiltration and erosion rates were quite small in the other sites. These results suggest that significant time is required following deforestation for recovery of soil hydrological properties.",

            "abstract": "Dunes around Khnifiss lagoon (28° 3'N, 12°13'W) show different colors ranging from black at the beach, whitish yellow in transverse dunes near the beach to reddish at the mega barchans situated few kilometers in the SW. The scientific question is about the abundance of different dunes in the same environmental conditions. The present work aims to investigate the factors that influence dunes color change, and then at which degree these factors could control dunes stability.\nTo highlight the difference in color observed at the dune fields then to characterize dunes mineralogy, Landsat TM images were used in addition to mineralogical analysis that was carried out for the black grains samples originated from megabarchans. Optic Microscope and SEM- EDS data was adopted, in addition to physico-chemical analysis provided by Electronic Microprobe. Grain size and shape analysis were conducted to characterize the different types of grains of sand.\n3/1 Landsat image band ratio allowed iron oxide distinction, the results revealed the importance of iron oxide concentration. Furthermore, mineralogical and physico-chemical analysis revealed (i) a high grade of oxides (Rutile, Ilmenite, Magnetite, Ulvöspinel) in samples, (ii) silicates (Quartz, Clinopyroxene, feldspar, Zircon), (iii) phosphate (apatite) and (iv) carbonate (calcite). The grain size analysis of the sand originated from the megabarchans reveals that there are three populations of sand. Black grains with a diameter less than 100µm and dominated by the magnetite, red ones composed mainly by the quartz with diameter between 100 and 180 µm and grains with diameter more than 180 µm are white and composed by carbonates.\nThe threshold of motion of these different grains was calculated. It shows that these different grains have the same threshold of motion, which means that the grain size compensates the density. This explains the abundance of different populations of sand in the same environment. The dominance of iron oxides justified the color black in sand. However, the whitish yellow and reddish color observed in dunes could be attributed to iron oxide clay coating, produced under weathering conditions, covering the grains of quartz.\nKey words: black sand, Landsat, Iron Oxide, Khnifiss beach, megadunes, Tarfaya, Morocco",

            "abstract": "The sparse water resources of semi-arid regions such as Mongolia are important for sustaining traditional livelihoods and supporting modern development. Nomadic pastoralists of the Khangai Mountain region rely on surface water supplies for their livestock. Increasing agricultural and industrial development, particularly mining, will place strain on already limited water resources. The large amounts of spatial and temporal hydroclimatic variability inherent to this region can be assessed through dendrohydrology, or the application of tree-ring research to study long-term past hydrologic phenomena. The Larix sibirica, and Pinus sibirica trees of the region provide records of the persistence of moisture limitation over the last several hundred years. We analyze a network of ten tree-ring sites, two of which are newly developed and examine correlations of ring width to monthly and seasonal streamflow in four river basins across the region to inform the selection of tree-ring predictor sites for use in streamflow reconstruction. Precipitation correlations were also assessed using data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre as previous research suggests gridded precipitation data correlates as strongly with the selected tree-ring sites as station-based data, yet have no missing data. The streamflow data had fewer missing values than station-based precipitation data, but were also not complete. Missing monthly mean flow values from five gages were filled using Predictive Mean Matching methods. Moderate (r=0.35-0.54) to strong (r=0.55-0.74) significant positive correlations were found for previous year’s (PY) and current year’s (CY) summer precipitation, mainly in June, July, and August. More strong and moderate correlations were observed with streamflow in PY and CY summer months than with precipitation; some spring months were also well correlated. Northern river gages correlated with more tree ring sites and had overall higher correlation values than southern sites. The most southerly streamflow sites however, were not significantly correlated to tree-ring widths in CY June or July. The results suggest distinct spatial patterns of proxy relations to hydroclimate in each basin necessitating careful selection of tree-ring predictors for modeling past moisture conditions.",

            "abstract": "The ferric smectite nontronite is one of the first minerals formed by secondary weathering of Columbia River Basalts (CRB). Although nontronite is a common weathering product of CRB, it is not ubiquitous; field relations in near-surface flows suggest it only forms where sufficient water is available. In near-surface flows that are above the water table, nontronite is found filling cracks or vesicles, or in association with paleosols now preserved between flows in many localities. Field relations strongly suggest that porosity and permeability at the millimeter to meter scale control the supply of water for weathering and are key to the chemical composition of secondary clays and to the overall abundance of individual secondary weathering minerals.\nWeathering in the basalts initiates in void spaces that hold water, where high-Fe nontronite forms radiating acicular sprays. Small void spaces fill completely with nontronite of uniform composition, which penetrates the walls and replaces surrounding glass and ferromagnesian minerals. This process produces a relatively limited quantity of high-purity ferric nontronite. In large void spaces where water is limiting, nontronite lines the interior of vesicles but does not fill them; vermicular clay strands grow into the space from nucleation sites at the vesicle wall. Nontronitic cores are coated by layers of Mg- and Al-rich clays, and Mn oxides coat the exteriors. Thus, weathering under water-limited conditions appears to produce more compositionally complex mineral assemblages. In more extensively weathered basalts, nontronite is not present except in isolated, enclosed spaces.\nResults of this study may be useful in interpreting remotely sensed mineralogical data on Mars. The compositions of ferromagnesian smectites and spatial relationships between different clays on Mars may hold clues to the original conditions of water-rock interaction.",

The region, dominated by Neogene and quaternary volcanoclastic loess and loess-like deposits, shows one of the highest groundwater As concentrations of the world which cause serious problems to human health. The oxidising and high pH conditions of the Pampean groundwater leads to the dissolution of volcanic glass and Fe oxy-hydroxides and the release of As to water.\nVariation of As content related to lithogenic factors is evident from our study in Claromecó River Basin (Southern Pampean plain): the Mio-Pliocene fluvial facies (MPFF) show low As content (2.6mg/kg) compared to the Late Pleistocene fluvial facies (11.6mg/kg; LPFF). Furthermore, the pedogenic calcrete and the paleosols developed in fluvial facies present significantly different As content: 3.9 mg/Kg in MPFF pedogenic calcrete and 16.5 mg/Kg in LPFF paleosols. Modern soils show the highest As content, especially in the illuvial horizons (23.3 mg/Kg) controlled by grain size and clay mineralogy constituents.\nPreliminary results demonstrate a sedimentological control embarking differences in As concentrations. These differences are probably attributed to a major hydraulic gradient during the MPFF, which is reflected in grain size and in fluvial structures, which probably was followed by washed out sediments. A geomorphological control was observed through an increase of As concentrations from the interfluves (MPFF) to the valleys (LPFF) as well as from the upper to the lower basin zone within the LPFF. Pedogenic calcrete and paleosols developed in MPFF and LPFF respectively reflect the different geomorphological conditions showing high As content in LPFF paleosols (attributed to Fe oxy-hydroxides). This study relates mineralogy and sedimentological environment to groundwater, surface water from wetlands to understand the hydrochemical processes in controlling As within the Claromecó basin.",

            "abstract": "The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) instrument includes two spectrographic channels that provide both images and spectra covering the wavelength ranges from 56 to 118 nm (EUV) and 110 to 190 nm (far-UV). While previous studies focused on analyzing spectra, very few have used the capability of UVIS to produce images. This approach allows for the investigation of a much wider set of observations (currently about 10,000 over 10 years of data). A big data analytics approach narrows the number of observations for more specific applications and detailed spectral analysis.\nPrevious studies on a reduced set of UVIS observations have demonstrated that dayglow emissions are at least a factor of ten brighter than the nightglow and are predominantly excited by solar photoelectrons. On the other hand, energetic Saturnian magnetosphere-plasma interactions with Titan’s ambient neutral species are a significant source of UV nightglow emissions. Magnetosphere particle interactions, particularly the particles H+ and O+, along with secondary electrons, produce a nightglow spectrum.\nOur preliminary results from the UVIS images show that the airglow is highly variable in intensity and nightglow emissions are sporadic. We investigate here the various sources of nightglow to relate the nightglow spatial distribution and occurrence to the orbital position. We also present a case study where UVIS observed an airglow brightening, with an enhanced intensity over a short period of time (15 minutes). Further investigation demonstrates that other particles instruments onboard Cassini detected an electron burst correlated with this airglow. Modeling of this event brings information on the aerosols distribution in the Titan’s upper atmosphere, on the airglow characteristics and the possible energy sources.",

Site characteristics, including surface soil moisture, slope, vegetation cover, soil type, litter depth, and upslope accumulated area will be used to describe differences in runoff volumes and sediment concentrations between sites. Rainfall simulations are also being used to quantify and compare the initiation of runoff, runoff volumes, and sediment concentrations under high intensity precipitation events in cutblocks, at the cutblock-buffer interface, and within vegetated buffers.

            "abstract": "In 2010-11, a sequence of earthquakes occurred on an unmapped basement fault near Guy, Arkansas. The events are likely to have been triggered by a nine month period of wastewater disposal during which 4.5x105 m2 of water was injected at two nearby wells. Magnitude-frequency distributions (MFD) for the induced sequence show two interesting properties: (i) a low Gutenberg-Richter (GR) b-value of ~0.8 during injection, increasing to 1.0 post-injection (ii) and downward curvature of the MFD at the upper magnitude limit. We use a coupled model of injection-triggering and earthquake rupture to show how the evolving MFD can be understood in terms of an effective stress increase on the fault, which arises from overpressuring and strength reduction.\nReservoir simulation is used to model injection into a horizontally extensive aquifer that overlies an impermeable basement containing a single permeable fault. Earthquake triggering occurs when the static strength, reduced by the modeled pressure increase, satisfies a Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Pressure evolution is also incorporated in a model of fault rupture, which is based on an expanding bilateral crack approximation to quasidynamic rupture propagation and static/dynamic friction evolution. An earthquake sequence is constructed as an ensemble of triggered ruptures for many realizations of a heterogeneous fractal stress distribution.\nDuring injection, there is a steady rise in fluid pressure on the fault. In addition to its role in triggering earthquakes, rising pressure affects the rupture process by reducing the dynamic strength relative to fault shear stress; this is equivalent to tectonic stress increase in natural seismicity. As mean stress increases, larger events are more frequent and this is reflected in a lower b-value. The largest events, however, occur late in the loading cycle at very high stress; their absence in the early stages of injection manifests as downward curvature in the MFD at large magnitudes.",

            "abstract": "Rutile is a common accessory mineral in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks and igneous, with many applications in geosciences. Rutile geochemistry, especially the high field strength elements (i.e., Nb and Ta), monitors many geological processes including subduction-zone metamorphism, while Zr provides temperature information in buffering assemblages. Rutile can also be used for U-Pb geochronology, but typically low U concentrations can make age dating difficult. Many applications of rutile now rely on laser ablation ICPMS (LA-ICPMS) analysis, a major disadvantage of this technique is the lack of reliable rutile standards. Here, we present laser ablation data of several rutile megacrysts from around the world, illustrating typical geochemical characteristics of potential standards. Whole-grain transects and depth profiles were collected on several rutiles, including Graves Mountain, Kragerø, Madagascar, Mozambique, Quebec, and Diamantina. Most transects, particularly across Graves Mountain and Diamantina, show dramatic zoning in Zr (up to 100 ppm), U (up to 10 ppm), and Nb (up to 1000 ppm). Rutile grains from Mozambique and Kragerø show little variation in concentration in Zr, U, and Nb. However, U concentrations generally range from 1ppm (Graves Mountain) to 45ppm (Kragero). Depth profiles (30-80s analysis; 15-40 µm) showed a combination of slight surface contamination plus minor to significant near-rim zoning. Some samples, such as Mozambique, show minor concentration changes in Zr, Nb, and Ta over the outer 10 µm but are otherwise unzoned, whereas U concentrations decrease for 25 µm then are constant. Kragero shows depth zoning throughout for Zr, Ta, and U but Nb is unzoned. Some rutile megacrysts show promise as standards (e.g. Mozambique and Kragero), but must be prepared to eliminate crystal surfaces. Other megacrysts would have to be subsampled within specific crystals to isolate chemical homogeneous domains.",

In this study, titanite-based T-t paths were determined along a transect across the proposed trace of the ductile South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) in central Nepal. Titanite-bearing calcsilicates were sampled from the upper Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) through the putative lower Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) along the Marsyandi River in the Annapurna Himal. T’s decrease from 800 ºC to 650 ºC with increasing structural level, consistent with previous work that shows decreasing T structurally upwards towards the STDS. T-t trends separate into three groups, from structurally lowest to highest: I. increasing T from ~27 to ~15 Ma, II. constant T from ~50 to ~10 Ma, and III. Decreasing T from ~ 25 Ma to ~ 10 Ma. These data are consistent with synmetamorphic thrusting from ~25 Ma to ~15 Ma: Group I (structurally low) heated during burial, Group II (structurally intermediate) resided in the shear zone at quasi-static T, and Group III (structurally high) cooled during emplacement. After ~ 15 Ma, Groups I-III exhumed coherently, supported by decreasing T-t trends at all structural levels. These data are consistent with (a) titanite T-t paths from elsewhere in the Annapurna Himal, (b) the timing of heating of structurally lower GHS rocks from other Central Nepal locations, and (c) the occurrence of intra-GHS thrusts within the orogen. High-grade GHS transport more likely occurred through a series of in sequence thrusts, rather than ductile flow.

            "abstract": "Basal sliding, rather than ice deformation, is responsible for nearly all of an ice-sheet's mass flux into its surrounding oceans. The importance of basal sliding has lead many to speculate on a so-called `sliding law', or a relation between observable quantities and the sliding speed of flowing ice. To date, a universal sliding law has been elusive, primarily due to lack of observations of the processes occurring at the ice-bed interface. In recent years, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface velocity observations have grown from a few outlet glaciers to nearly complete coverage of both Antarctica and Greenland. We use these data to constrain an ice-sheet model, and employ control methods to determine the basal traction field. While this method of estimating basal traction incorporates errors in the geometry and rheology of ice, it does provide an estimate of basal processes that can not be directly observed at the desired resolution. With a comprehensive estimate of the basal traction, we derive parameter estimates which linearly relate ice-sheet observations to the estimated traction fields via a generalized linear model. Here, we present the methodology, linear parameter estimates, traction field estimates, and corresponding surface speed. To conclude, an experiment featuring the dynamical evolution of an ice sheet's basal traction is conducted. In it, we see that the dynamically evolving field provides a sliding law that is at least as plausible as static prescriptions of basal traction or heuristic relations involving sliding.\nOne of the statistically-generated-basal-traction fields for Antarctica is shown below.",

We have carried out new zircon dissolution experiments at 1270-1890 K and 0.5-1.5 GPa to refine our understanding of Zr diffusion and zircon solubility in several rhyolitic melts containing different H2O contents. Zr diffusivity in rhyolitic melts depends strongly on temperature and H2O content, and weakly on pressure and anhydrous melt composition. The diffusion data for each individual melts follows the Arrhenius relation. For melts with different composition including H2O content, Zr diffusivity depends also on the Si+Al cation mole fraction in the anhydrous melts and can be expressed as follows:\nlnDZr = –14.707 – [34089(Si+Al) – 1559w – 1726P]/T,\nwhich can reproduce experimental data to within 0.72 lnD units (or a factor of 2 in D). Zr diffusion data for different rhyolitic melts in this study and in the literature are roughly expressed as a function of the Eyring diffusivity. This relation can predict Zr diffusivity to within about 1 lnD unit (or within a factor of 2.7 in D). Zr concentration at zircon saturation in silicic melts depends strongly on temperature, and weakly on pressure, anhydrous melt composition and H2O content. Existing geothermometers based on zircon saturation has large uncertainties although our effort to improve it has not been successful. The dissolution or growth rate of a freely falling zircon crystal is modeled. The controlling factors are mostly the temperature and Zr concentration in the melt. Typical zircon growth rate in wet rhyolitic melt is 0.01 to 1.0 µm/yr. Zircon growth has the potential to serve as a geospeedometer.",

This wood, which can function as both a storage area and source for large wood in river channels, can also be a significant organic carbon stock in river-floodplain ecosystems. We present data on downed wood volumes for different floodplain vegetation communities in the central Yukon River Basin in interior Alaska. We measured downed wood volume per unit floodplain area and wood decay characteristics within four distinct floodplain vegetation communities, and equate downed wood volumes per unit area to total organic carbon per unit area. Preliminary results suggest that downed wood volumes are greatest in disturbed white spruce forests, compared to undisturbed white spruce, deciduous forests, and black spruce woody wetlands. Disturbances contributing to large wood volumes include fire, wind, and ice jam floods. We also compare wood volumes in interior Alaska to downed wood volumes in other unmanaged floodplain vegetation communities, including a subtropical lowland alluvial river-floodplain and a semi-arid mountainous river-floodplain. These three datasets provide comparisons of unmanaged riparian forests across diverse climatic settings and highlight the climatic conditions and biomes that result in substantial downed wood and organic carbon storage in floodplain environments.",

            "abstract": "Renewables currently make up a small (but growing) fraction of total U.S. electricity generation. In some regions, renewable growth has resulted in instantaneous penetration levels of wind and solar in excess of 60% of demand. With decreasing costs, abundant resource potential and low carbon emissions and water requirements, wind and solar are increasingly becoming attractive new generation options. However, factors such as resource variability and geographic distribution of prime resources raise questions regarding the extent to which our power system can rely on variable generation resources. Here, we describe scenario analyses designed to tackle engineering and economic challenges associated with variable generation, along with insights derived from research results. These analyses demonstrate the operability of high renewable systems and quantify some of the engineering challenges (and solutions) associated with maintaining reliability. Key questions addressed include the operational and economic impacts of increasing levels of variable generation on the U.S. power system. Since reliability and economic efficiency are measured across a variety of time frames, and with a variety of metrics, a suite of tools addressing different system impacts are used to understand how new resources affect incumbent resources and operational practices. We summarize a range of modeled scenarios, focusing on ones with 80% RE in the United States and >30% variable wind and solar in the East and the West. We also summarize the environmental impacts and benefits estimated for these and similar scenarios. Results provide key insights to inform the technical, operational and regulatory evolution of the U.S. power system.

            "abstract": "Water tracks are the most prominent drainage pathways that route water through the soil over permafrost in the polar environment and thus play a major role in hydrology, geomorphology, and geochemistry of the polar ecosystem. Existing literature on water tracks is limited and is largely confined to tundra areas devoid of vegetation. The objective of this study is to initiate the investigation of water tracks in thickly vegetated boreal regions, many of which contain predominant engineered infrastructures. The ancillary objectives include the development of methods for mapping the distribution of water tracks in boreal regions and a preliminary analysis of the geotechnical impacts of water track interception on infrastructures. The study area is Goldstream Road in Fairbanks, Alaska. This road experiences high amounts of damage, possibly due to interception of prominent water tracks. To investigate the road damage, the Alaska Department of Transportation has collected geophysical data in 2012. We plan to create a water track distribution map around the Goldstream Road using high-spatial-and-spectral-resolution remote sensing imagery and correlate it with the geophysical data from 2012. We have collected ground data from two water tracks: one in a residence in Fairbanks and the other besides the Goldstream Road. The two tracks vary greatly in size and features. Both water tracks revealed different yet quite promising characteristics. These findings will be used to extract other water tracks from remotely sensed images of the Goldstream Road area. So far, a 2010 SPOT 5 image (2.5m x 2.5 m), an aerial orthophoto (14 cm x 14 cm) and a DEM (57 cm x 57 cm) from September 2014 have been acquired. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) processing was performed on the 2010 SPOT 5 image. A detailed water track database was created and water tracks are being manually digitized from the available imagery and Web Mapping Services (WMS). As a test, using FLIR, handheld thermal infrared camera, we have successfully characterized water track on the residential property. Our research will provide essential insight into water tracks in boreal regions, engineering solutions and mitigation of damages from water track interception as vital considerations for future engineering designs.",

            "abstract": "We will present an all-sky climatology derived from reanalyses of specific humidity inversions, a quite prevalent phenomenon in both polar regions. All produce increased frequency of humidity inversions in monthly mean profiles over the polar regions. According to the climatology, humidity inversions in the polar regions are the most persistent in winter and strongest in summer or autumn. An advantage of using the reanalyses is that they can be used to test previous hypotheses about how these inversions form or are maintained. For instance, MERRA is unique in that it provides humidity tendencies due to various processes. We will show from such tendencies averaged over humidity inversions in the polar regions that the most influential processes are dynamics, moist processes, and turbulence. Of dynamical processes, local advection may not be as important as humidity fluxes into the polar regions. Over the Arctic, winter humidity inversions are near-surface associated with temperature inversions, while summer inversions are more likely associated with cloud-top processes when clouds are very persistent.\nWe will also present an evaluation of surface processes over Arctic land, ocean, and sea ice in the reanalyses by comparing to global datasets and station data. For the most part, near-surface quantities and surface fluxes are better represented over land than over the oceans and sea ice. We will use the insights developed from these assessments of surface and near-surface processes in reanalyses to evaluate the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and global climate models.",

In order to image such discontinuities, methods based on the analysis of the scattered wavefield have been developed, such as receiver functions (RF), which are able to image mantle interfaces under single stations.\nSince surface wave data and receiver functions provide complementary constraints on shallow earth structure, it is natural to combine them to obtain more robust models of the crust and upper-mantle (e.g. Julia et al., 2000; Lawrence and Wiens, 2004). Here we present a set of 1D shear-wave models, depicting the first 300km of the upper mantle, under a number of stations in North America, using Bayesian inversions.\nThere are several original aspects to our approach: 1) we consider both Love and Rayleigh wave dispersion data, allowing us to constrain radial anisotropy; 2) instead of a standard RF methodology, scattered body waveforms (i.e. the coda of P phases) are directly inverted through a cross-convolution misfit function(Bodin et al., 2014), thus avoiding the instability issues arising from deconvolution, and, importantly, allowing us to account for crustal multiples without ambiguity; 3) we use a Bayesian trans-dimensional MCMC approach in which the number of isotropic and of anisotropic layers are treated as unknowns, allowing us to obtain models compatible with the data, with the least number of parameters. In contrast to standard RF analysis, our approach allows us to constrain not only the position of discontinuities, but also the variations of shear wave velocity between them, thus providing better constraints on the characteristics of intra-lithospheric low velocity layers.",

Using the DZstats software package we applied five metrics to twenty large synthetic data sets and one large empirical data set. The metrics included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Kuiper tests as well as Cross-correlation, Likeness, and Similarity coefficients of probability density plots (PDPs), kernel density estimates (KDEs) and locally adaptive, variable-bandwidth KDEs (LA-KDEs). We evaluate the metrics’ utility based on three criteria: 1) samples from the same population should become systematically more similar with increasing sample size; 2) the metrics should maximize the range of possible coefficients; and 3) the metrics should minimize artifacts resulting from sample-specific complexity. K-S and Kuiper test p-values, and all KDE and LA-KDE coefficients passed a maximum of one criterion. Likeness and Similarity coefficients of PDPs, as well as K-S and Kuiper test D- and V-values passed two of the criteria. Cross-correlation of PDPs passed all three.\nAs hypothesis tests of derivation from a common source, individual K-S and Kuiper p-values too frequently reject the null hypothesis that samples come from a common source. However, mean p-values calculated by bootstrap subsampling and comparison of sample data sets yield a binary discrimination of identical versus different source populations. Cross-correlation and Likeness of PDPs, and Cross-correlation of KDEs yield the widest divergence in coefficients and thus a consistent discrimination between identical and different source populations, with Cross-correlation of PDPs requiring the smallest sample size. In light of this, we recommend standard acquisition of large (n > 300) detrital geochronology data sets and repeated subsampling for robust quantitative comparison using Likeness, Cross-correlation, or K-S p-values.",

While there is significant research examining post-disturbance carbon stocks and recovery, there is less known about the fate and quality of post-disturbance carbon pools. In an effort to understand the recovery and resilience of forest carbon stocks to severe wildfire we examined the carbon and black carbon (pyrogenic) stocks (e.g. above ground biomass, coarse woody debris, charcoal, soils) and export fluxes (stream export, soil respiration) within the burn scars of three Colorado fires (Hayman in 2002, Hinman in 2002, and Waldo Canyon in 2012) and compared them to nearby unburned forested ecosystems. The Hayman and Hinman fire comparison allows us to quantify differences between fire impacts in Ponderosa-Douglas Fir (montane) and Spruce-Fir (subalpine) ecosystems, while the Hayman and Waldo Canyon comparison gives us insights into how recovery time influences carbon biogeochemistry in these systems.

The Rio crosses several active rift-related normal faults and the active, mid-crustal Socorro Magma Body (SMB; a sill at 19 km depth that is actively doming the land surface), providing an unusual opportunity to explore the effects of deep magma emplacement and active faulting on the terraces.\nRio Salado terraces were mapped using a high-resolution DEM and digital color stereophotographs and were projected onto a valley-parallel vertical plane to construct longitudinal profiles. Three new soil pits were described to aid terrace correlation. A net incision rate of 0.41 ± 0.06 m/ka was inferred from the correlation of a major fill-cut terrace to the 122 ± 18 ka Airport surface ~25 km south of the Rio Salado. This incision rate is >1.5 times more rapid than estimated rates nearby or in other parts of New Mexico, but yields age estimates for other terraces that are consistent with soil development. Terrace gradients in the Rio Salado have increased through time, indicating either stream response to Rio Grande incision or footwall tilting from the Quaternary Loma Blanca fault (LBF). Two terraces in the LBF hanging wall are back-tilted relative to their footwall counterparts, suggesting a listric geometry for the LBF. However, two others (Qtf and Qtc) are east-tilted relative to their footwall counterparts. Both Qtf and Qtc merge eastward with the next youngest terrace in the flight, and Qtc is arched, consistent with an earlier episode of surface uplift above the SMB.\nFuture work will involve (a) additional terrace mapping over the SMB, (b) cosmogenic 36Cl depth profile dating of the Rio Salado terraces to determine incision rates, allow regional terrace correlations, and constrain fault-slip slip rates and the record of SMB-related surface uplift, and (c) numerical modeling of SMB inflation constrained by uplift signals.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission launched on Jan 31, 2015. The mission employs L-band radar and radiometer measurements to estimate soil moisture with 4\\% volumetric accuracy at a resolution of 10 km, and freeze-thaw state at a resolution of 1-3 km. Immediately following launch, there was a three month instrument checkout period, followed by six months of level 1 (L1) calibration and validation. In this presentation, we will discuss the calibration and validation activities and results for the L1 radar data.\nEarly SMAP radar data were used to check commanded timing parameters, and to work out issues in the low- and high-resolution radar processors. From April 3-13 the radar collected receive only mode data to conduct a survey of RFI sources. Analysis of the RFI environment led to a preferred operating frequency. The RFI survey data were also used to validate noise subtraction and scaling operations in the radar processors. Normal radar operations resumed on April 13. All radar data were examined closely for image quality and calibration issues which led to improvements in the radar data products for the beta release at the end of July. Radar data were used to determine and correct for small biases in the reported spacecraft attitude. Geo-location was validated against coastline positions and the known positions of corner reflectors. Residual errors at the time of the beta release are about 350 m. Intra-swath biases in the high-resolution backscatter images are reduced to less than 0.3 dB for all polarizations. Radiometric cross-calibration with Aquarius was performed using areas of the Amazon rain forest. Cross-calibration was also examined using ocean data from the low-resolution processor and comparing with the Aquarius wind model function. Using all a-priori calibration constants provided good results with co-polarized measurements matching to better than 1 dB, and cross-polarized measurements matching to about 1 dB in the beta release. During the second half of the L1 cal/val period, the RFI removal algorithm will be tuned for optimal performance, and the Faraday rotation corrections used in radar processing will be further developed and validated.\nThis work is supported by the SMAP project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.",

            "abstract": "Zircon crystals have been used as proxies for their host magmatic composition and as records of the evolution and differentiation of silicic magma systems through the use of integrated techniques such as cathodoluminescence imaging, LA-ICPMS trace element analysis, thermometry, and high-precision CA-IDTIMS U/Pb dating. This petrochronologic approach can aid in identifying crystal populations arising from discrete pulses of magmatism, reconstructing the growth histories of those populations, quantifying the chemical evolution of the host magma, and determining the timing and tempo of that chemical evolution. The Yellowstone Volcanic Field hosts both large and small volume silicic eruptions whose zircon records can provide insights to magmatic processes using a petrochronologic approach. Morphological and thermochemical trends preserved in zircon grains extracted from the three Yellowstone super-eruptions and a small volume precursory eruption indicate that magmatism in the volcanic field is punctuated, characterized by numerous pulses of melting, differentiation, and solidification occurring prior to eruption. U/Pb zircon dating constrains magma assembly to geologically short timescales, with populations of earlier solidified zircon incorporated into the nascent magma just prior to eruption. This requires punctuated intervals of high magmatic flux be superimposed on longer durations of a much lower background flux. Thus super-eruptions within the Yellowstone Volcanic Field result from rapid production and evolution of magma, and preceded by periods of smaller volume magma production that undergo similar differentiation processes over comparable timescales.",

            "abstract": "By making use of GPS measurements from Precise Orbit Determination (POD) GPS antenna onboard Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites we present results of the equatorial irregularities/plasma bubbles detection. For a given research we use data from a multi-satellite constellation consisting of the three Swarm satellites and the TerraSAR-X satellite. The major advantage of such LEO constellation is rather similar orbit altitude of ~500 km. The GPS-based indices, characterizing the occurrence and the strength of the ionospheric irregularities, were derived from the LEO GPS observations of a zenith-looking onboard GPS antenna. To study GPS fluctuation activity at the topside equatorial ionosphere we used TEC-based indices ROT (rate of TEC change) and ROTI (rate of TEC Index), proposed by Pi et al. (1997). We demonstrate a successful implementation of this technique for several case studies of the equatorial plasma bubbles occurrence in the post-midnight and morning LT hours during the year 2014. The ionospheric irregularities detected with GPS technique in Swarm/TerrasSAR-X data are consistent with the in situ plasma density variations registered by the three Swarm satellites (PLP measurements), as well as by three DMSP satellites at ~840 km orbital height, which indicate a large altitudinal extent of the observed phenomenon. Also we analyzed the global/seasonal distribution of the ionospheric irregularities at the topside equatorial region caused the phase fluctuations in GPS measurements onboard LEO satellite. We demonstrate that ROT/ROTI technique can be applied to LEO GPS data for geomagnetically quiet and disturbed conditions, as well as detection of the storm-induced equatorial irregularities in the morning local time.",

            "abstract": "After eight years in orbit the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite is scheduled to re-enter in the fall of 2015. During the last year of its life, the orbit often brought the satellite to altitudes below the F-peak. The C/NOFS Occultation Receiver for Ionospheric Sensing (CORISS) GPS sensor provided TEC and scintillation observations via GPS occultation for most of the C/NOFS mission. Once the C/NOFS orbit is lower than the F-peak, radio occultation observations cannot be used to probe the ionosphere. However, CORISS also tracks signals above the horizon that can provide TEC and scintillation observations. The low C/NOFS orbit provides a unique vantage point for CORISS to look up into regions of scintillation. This presentation explores scintillation as observed below the low F-region, its occurrence, intensity variations, and its distribution. We compare statistically the measurements to occulting scintillation measurements.",

In this work, we seek to formulate and parameterize a 2D CTRW directly from attributes of fracture networks with complex geometry. A Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model is used to produce data on plume evolution over multiple spatial scales by synthetically generating a fracture network based on known fracture characteristics and conducting flow and particle tracking simulations under steady-state boundary conditions and flux-weighted particle migration. DFN Fracture segments, defined as the linear distance between two fracture intersections, are analyzed to define the distribution of jump lengths. The time for particles to migrate along these segments is recorded by the DFN model and is used to define a distribution of waiting times. These distributions provide a basis on which to formulate a CTRW to predict the migration of inert particles on a continuum of scales. The performance of the CTRW in simulating transport at multiple spatial scales is obtained by comparing spatial moments of the DFN plumes with CTRW solutions.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbances alter rates of organic matter decomposition by microbes, which introduces uncertainty to the fate of soil carbon and aboveground carbon stocks. Quantifying soil microbial response to disturbance will reduce this uncertainty in dynamic, heterogeneous ecosystems. Here, we assessed how potential exoenzyme activities and biogeochemistry vary across Colorado landscapes disturbed by insect, fire, and flooding. We sampled 56 plots that spanned a burn severity gradient following the 2012 High Park Fire and a beetle kill chronosequence. Topsoil biogeochemistry, potential exoenzyme activity, and microbial biomass were quantified within each plot, and for a subset of 16 plots visited before and after a 2014 rainfall event. Terrain variables were generated from a LiDAR-derived DTM. Our results documented a shift in exoenzyme activity that corresponded to fire-driven changes in pH, which averaged 4.8 ± 0.2 in unburned plots to 6.3 ± 0.4 in severe burn plots. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were employed to predict exoenzyme activity using principal components derived from biogeochemical and terrain variables. The models explained up to 50% of the variance in exoenzyme activity, with the strongest relationships identified for phosphatase and the carbon degrading enzymes, β-Glucosidase and 4-MUB-β-D-cellobioside. The unexplained variance may result from the legacy of disturbance across sites. For example, burned and unburned plots presented contrasting geochemical responses to the 2014 rainfall event. Specifically, PO43- did not differ significantly between the burned and unburned plots in the pre-flood soils. Interestingly, PO43- was significantly different between the two groups in the post-flood soils due to a decrease in PO43- at the unburned plots and a slight increase at the burned plots. Similar trends were recognized for DIN and NH4+ in the burned and unburned sites yet the beetle kill plots exhibited little geochemical response pre- and post-flood. Our results demonstrate that exoenzyme activities are controlled, in part, by topography and disturbance-driven changes in biogeochemistry. Future work will examine how microclimate and disturbance history, such as undocumented flood events, contribute to soil ecological and geochemical variability across complex terrain.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is a light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosol emitted from combustions of fossil fuels and biomasses and is estimated as the second most important contributor to positive climate forcing after the carbon dioxide. In the atmosphere, the fractal aggregate of BC-spherules may be mixed with non-absorbing (or weakly absorbing) compounds that forms morphologically complex “BC-containing particle”. A reliable scattering code for BC-containing particles is necessary for predicting mass absorption efficiency of BC and designing/evaluating optical techniques for estimating microphysical properties (i.e., size distribution, mixing state, shape, refractive index) of BC-containing particles. The computational methods that derived from the volume-integral form of the Maxwell equation, such as discrete dipole approximation (DDA), are method of choice for morphologically complex object like BC-containing particles. In ordinary DDA, the entire particle volume is approximated as a collection of tiny cubical dipoles (with side length d) placed on a 3D cubic lattice. For several model BC-containing particles, the comparisons with numerically exact T-matrix method reveals that the ordinary DDA suffered from persistent positive systematic error (up to +30%) in absorption even under d <<λ. The cause of this DDA error is identified to be the shape error in BC-spherules. To eliminate the shape error in BC-spherules, we propose a new DDA methodology which may be called hybrid DDA (h-DDA): each primary BC sphere is assumed as a spherical dipole, while remaining particle volume of coating material is approximated by a collection of tiny cubical dipoles on a 3D cubic lattice. Positive absorption bias up to +30% in ordinary DDA is suppressed to within 3% in h-DDA. In h-DDA code, an efficient FFT-based algorithm for solving the matrix equation has been implemented, by utilizing the multilevel block-Toeplitz property of the submatrix corresponding to inter-dipole interaction within coating material.",

            "abstract": "Radiative transfer models of snow albedo have usually assumed spherical snow grains, using Mie theory to compute single-scattering quantities. The scattering by realistic nonspherical snow grains is less in the forward direction and more to the sides, resulting in a smaller asymmetry factor g (the mean cosine of the scattering angle). Compared to a snowpack of spherical grains with the same area-to-mass ratio, a snowpack of nonspherical grains will have a higher albedo, thin snowpacks of nonspherical grains will more effectively hide the underlying surface, and light-absorbing impurities in the snowpack will be exposed to less sunlight. These effects are examined here for a variety of snow grain shapes, with aspect ratio from 0.1 to 10. The albedo of opaque snowpack with equidimensional non-spherical snow grains (aspect ratio 1) is higher than that with spherical snow grains by 0.036 and 0.05, for grain radius 100 mm and 1000 mm; respectively. For snow grain radius of 100 mm, the albedo reduction caused by 100 ppb black carbon is 0.02 for spherical snow grains, but only 0.01 for equidimensional non-spherical snow grains.",

            "abstract": "Surface expressions of the hydrothermal system at Lassen Volcanic National Park include numerous solfataras to the south and southeast of Lassen Peak. Extensive sampling of gas for chemical and isotope analyses took place from the mid-1970s through 2000. Based on those data the model for the Lassen hydrothermal system suggests the main gas upflow occurs at Sulphur Works, which is part of a circulating hydrothermal flow cell (HC1) that includes Bumpass Hell and Little Hot Springs Valley (Janik & McLaren, 2010). A second, slightly cooler cell (HC2) provides gas and steam to Boiling Springs Lake, Devils Kitchen and ultimately to features at Terminal Geyser.\nAs part of the USGS volcano monitoring effort, sampling of Lassen gases resumed in 2014. Gas compositions of boiling point and superheated fumaroles at four of the Lassen solfataras contained lower concentrations of meteoric-derived components than most early samples. In 2014 the combined N2 and Ar concentrations from the individual areas decreased on average by 50 to 65% relative to CO2. N2/Ar ratios also shifted away from the ratio in air-saturated water toward values as high as 171, consistent with a decline in meteoric water content. Concentrations of hydrothermal gases CO2, H2S, and CH4, and d13C-CO2 values are similar to the early data. Helium concentrations are variable and show no trends. Helium isotope ratios (Rc/RA) since 2007 from HC1 are between 6.9 and 7.5 and for HC2 are between 6.0 and 6.5. A 2014 Terminal Geyser sample had a value of 6.0. A longer record of helium isotope data is required to examine temporal trends.\nWater in the Lassen hydrothermal system is ultimately derived from rain and snowfall at higher elevations in the park. The area has experienced drought conditions since at least 2012. The 2014 dataset suggests that the drought may influence gas compositions by reducing the input of shallow meteoric water. Lassen gases from the California drought of 1976-1977 exhibit similar behavior.",

            "abstract": "Climate change models predict that interannual rainfall variability will increase in California over the next several decades; these changes are expected to alter fuel characteristics and fire regimes in chaparral. Fires uncouple N mobilization and uptake by increasing nitrification and destroying plant biomass. Following fire, heavy winter rains can leach N into streams, particularly from slopes that have been denuded. The extent to which N is transported from burned slopes to streams depends on how rapidly soil microbes metabolize N into mobile forms such as NO3-, and how rapidly recovering plants take up mineral N. However, the long-term impacts of a changing climate and fire regime on N dynamics remain unknown. To project the effects of these drivers, we combined empirical measurements with the ecohydrologic model RHESSys. Specifically, we measured inorganic N concentrations and microbial biomass in chaparral soils that burned 1, 4, 20 and 40 years prior to sampling. We then experimentally adjusted NH4+ concentration and pH in a factorial design, and incubated the treated soils for 8 weeks. Nitrification was highest in soils collected from the most recently burned sites, and was most powerfully constrained by NH4+. However, when NH4+was sufficiently high, pH determined the relative proportion of inorganic N that was nitrified.\nAfter incorporating these relationships into the RHESSys framework, we modeled mineralization, nitrification, N leaching, NPP, and plant uptake under a range of climate and fire timing scenarios. We considered a range of scenarios where fires were imposed either at the beginning or end of the growing season followed by 15 years of recovery, and considered 15 possible climate trajectories. Modeling results suggest that chaparral systems are vulnerable to rapid nitrification and leaching immediately after fire, however recovering plants rapidly immobilize soluble N under most climate scenarios. The strongest variability in NPP and plant N-uptake between different climate trajectories occurred during the first few years of recovery. Notably, following drier years, NPP and plant N-uptake recovered more slowly. In cases where drought and fire were followed by heavy rain, nitrate losses were more severe, which can further slow plant recovery and promote a positive feedback on N export.",

            "abstract": "Rapid cooling of silicate melts facilitates undercooling, where nucleation is delayed and crystal growth begins at temperatures below equilibrium. In such cases, rapid crystal growth and release of latent heat of crystallization can produce net heating (recalescence). We have documented recalescence in Fe-Mg pyroxene and komatiite melts, using a thermal imaging (FLIR) camera for melt volumes on the order of cm3, and using differential scanning calorimetry for melt volumes on the order of mm3. On cooling Fe0.8Mg1.2Si2O6 liquid from ~1600˚C in air, at ~30˚C/s, crystallization begins at ~1110˚C. Averaging over the whole base of the crucible (~10cm2), the observed temperature increase is ~100˚C and it takes ~2.5 seconds to attain the thermal peak. Crystallization and heating can be seen migrating across the melt volume together. When looking at a 3x3 pixel spot (~1mm2 in our setup), reheating to >1270˚C occurred in ~1 s. About 30 mg of the same melt was cooled in a differential scanning calorimeter. Cooled at ~1˚C/s, two distinct crystallization peaks were seen at ~1450 and ~1270˚C. Cooled at ~2˚C/s, the first peak was delayed to ~1315˚C and merged with the second. Examination of recovered samples indicates crystallization of enstatite, followed by Fe-oxides and tridymite in a silica-rich glass matrix. On cooling of komatiite liquid from ~1600˚C at ~50˚C/s, crystallization begins at ~1080˚C. The average temperature plateaus for ~2s and then continues cooling. When looking at a 3x3 pixel spot, heating of ~10˚C could be detected only by comparing different video frames. We conclude that (i) thermal imaging of lava flows needs to be conducted with mm-scale spatial resolution to assess true temperature fluctuations, and (ii) thermal models that incorporate latent heat of crystallization as an “effective heat capacity” term do not allow recalescence, and may inaccurately capture the thermal history of rapidly cooled lava.",

            "abstract": "Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares are the main drivers of space weather. Their potential impact on Earth is determined by the morphology and orientation of the magnetic structure associated with these events and its evolution as it propagates into the interplanetary magnetic field. Knowing the 3D coronal magnetic field prior to the trigger of a CME is therefore one of the key features for predicting their geomagnetic effect. Since the magnetic field is essentially measured at the photosphere, one must rely on reconstruction models to obtain the 3D magnetic field in the corona. Hence, obtaining an accurate model of the real 3D coronal magnetic field is one of the cornerstones for precise Space Weather Forecasting. In this work, we propose a new method for data-constrained reconstruction of the 3D coronal magnetic field. Model-data fitting is achieved by optimizing a user-specified metric,\nM\n, quantifying the difference between a dataset (including e.g. polarization, extreme-ultraviolet emission, X-ray emission) and its synthetic analogue. The synthetic data is produced by forward calculations applied to a 3D magnetic model that depends upon a finite set of parameters. After introducing the method, we present its validation on a synthetic test bed consisting of a coronal magnetic flux rope assumed to depend on four parameters, i.e. height in the corona, latitude, longitude, and tilt angle. A specific value of each parameter is used to generate a ground truth and the corresponding synthetic data. We show that, when\nM\ndoes not possess any degenerate minimum, our method performs well and the best-fit parameters provide a good approximation of the ground-truth parameters. We then show how using additional observations can help in removing any existing degeneracy. Finally, we discuss future plans for validation and application of our method to solar observations.",

            "abstract": "We have studied the time sequence of the development of the near-Earth magnetotail and the auroral arc associated with a substorm onset, using the data from the THEMIS spacecraft and ground-based observatories at high temporal and spatial resolutions. We discuss four steps of the auroral development, linking them to magnetotail changes: the auroral fading, the initial brightening of an auroral onset arc, the enhancement of the wave-like structure, and the poleward expansion. A case study shows that near-Earth magnetic reconnection began at X~-17 RE at least ~3 min before the auroral initial brightening and ~1 min before the auroral fading. Ionospheric large-scale convection also became enhanced just before the auroral fading and before the auroral initial brightening. Then low-frequency waves were amplified in the plasma sheet at X~-10 RE, with the pressure increase due to the arrival of the earthward flow from the near-Earth reconnection site ~20 s before the enhancement of the auroral wave-like structure. Finally, the dipolarization began ~30 s before the auroral poleward expansion. On the basis of the present observations, we suggest that near-Earth magnetic reconnection plays two roles in the substorm triggering. First, it generates a fast earthward flow and Alfvén waves. When the Alfvén waves which propagate much faster than the fast flow reach the ionosphere, large-scale ionospheric convection is enhanced, leading to the auroral initial brightening and subsequent gradual growth of the auroral wave-like structure. Second, when the reconnection-initiated fast flow reaches the near-Earth magnetotail, it promotes rapid growth of an instability, such as the ballooning instability, and the auroral wave-like structure is further enhanced. When the instability grows sufficiently, the dipolarization and the auroral poleward expansion are initiated.",

            "abstract": "Over the last several years, Earth-based telescopic and Mars orbit remote sensing instruments have reported significant abundances of methane on Mars ranging to tens of parts-per-billion by volume (ppbv). These observations have reported “plumes” or localized patches of methane with variations on timescales much faster than model predictions, leading to speculation of sources from sub-surface methanogen bacteria, geological water-rock reactions, degassing of infalling comets, or UV degradation of micro-meteorites or interplanetary dust. Using the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) in the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite on Curiosity, we report in situ detection of methane at background levels of ~0.7 ppbv and also in an episodic release at ten times this value. We will discuss the mechanisms that are believed contributing to these two regimes, report new measurements made since the publication in Science1, and discuss the evidence and implications for seasonal vs. episodic release.\n",

            "abstract": "Four months of observations from a near-coastal mooring deployed off southern Tamaulipas-northern Veracruz coast (western Gulf of Mexico) during winter 2012-2013 provides velocity and pressure series in a coastal region where apparently no in-situ measurements have been formally reported. The measurements show numerous events of intense alongshore velocities with magnitudes typically exceeding 80 cm/s, associated with intensified winds associated with the cold fronts invading the western Gulf during fall-winter, via coastal-trapped motions coming from northern locations. These motions induce a coastal jet that modulates the regional along-shelf transports. This notion is corroborated by an analytical coastal-trapped wave (CTW) model which explains most of the variability of the sea level and the alongshore barotropic velocity observed in the mooring, and which can also be used to estimate how much of the observed variance is generated in remote locations along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater and surface water flow through riparian aquifer soils and streambed sediment provides opportunities for microbial communities to transform water chemistry, particularly for nitrogen (N). The efficiency of NO3- removal is generally thought to decrease from headwaters to coasts but is poorly constrained near coasts, particularly within tidal freshwater zones (TFZs). High resolution geochemical sampling of reactive and conservative species in White Clay Creek, reveals hotspots of nitrogen removal and production within the stream bed and riparian aquifer. Nitrate removal was greatest in streambed sediments with removal rates decreasing with average stream depth. In addition, nitrate removal occurred within the riparian aquifer at the well 2 m from the stream bank. In contrast, nitrate production was highest in the riparian aquifer (4-13 m from the stream channel). Removal and production are related to the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate in the pore water, with production occurring when ratios are less than 7 and removal or uptake dominating at ratios greater than 7. Furthermore, nitrogen processes vary more in space than time (i.e. over the tidal cycle); suggesting that nitrogen cycling is driven in large part by substrate chemistry.",

            "abstract": "The southern Hayward fault is an active, northwest-striking, right lateral strike slip fault within the densely populated eastern San Francisco Bay area. Recent subsurface investigation along the southern Hayward fault has revealed unexpectedly complex deformation between subparallel fault traces. In the city of Fremont, the southern Hayward fault crosses Mission Boulevard (MB) as three parallel to subparallel traces, the eastern, central, and western traces. Recent exploratory trenches excavated near MB by another consultant and logged by the authors revealed that the western and central traces of the Hayward fault are nearly parallel with limited secondary deformation between them. However, along strike farther to the northwest, abundant secondary deformation in the form of multiple northeast-dipping thrust faults was encountered in the exploratory trenches. The thrust faults locally place Plio-Pleistocene Irvington Gravels Formation over slope wash deposits and Bk horizon soils, implying late Quaternary activity.\nField reconnaissance and review of historical aerial photographs that pre-date urbanization revealed no geomorphic evidence of landslides in the vicinity of the identified thrust faults, and subsurface investigation did not identify evidence of a landslide graben on the upper slope. Slope inclinations in this area are mostly low to moderate (6° to 12°) with few steeper inclinations (up to 20°). Thus, these compressional structures appear to be unrelated to landsliding.\nOur working hypothesis for the origin of the thrust faults northwest of MB involves compression related to a small left step along the central trace. This left step corresponds closely to the location of the observed thrust faults. The resulting compression is manifest as a series of thrust faults that do not appear to continue north or south of the step over region.",

            "abstract": "Despite the ubiquitous methane (CH4) supersaturation in lakes, mechanistic understanding on the internal CH4 cycling that regulate the annual CH4 emission from these systems remains unresolved. Multi-year measurements on vertical and horizontal variability in CH4 concentration and isotopic (δ13C) signature, along with the estimates on the rates of air-water and sediment CH4 flux from a small temperate lake (Lake Croche, South eastern Quebec, Canada) were used to reconstruct the internal CH4 cycling in the northern temperate lakes. While flux from hypolimnetic sediments was the largest source of water column CH4, strong, but seasonally varying CH4 oxidation zone separated the CH4-rich hypolimnion from surface layer. The diffusive oxygen (O2) supply from the upper layers regulated the oxidation zone, upward expansion and storage of CH4 in the deeper water column. Despite the strong oxidation-filter, surface water CH4 always exceeded the atmospheric equilibrium and concentrations were varied over the space and time. Lateral advection from the epilimnetic sediments and sporadic entrainment from the sub-surface CH4 maxima mostly explains the surface CH4 variability during stratified period. Air-water exchange was a relatively larger sink than the oxidative loss of CH4 in the surface layers. Using a mass-balance approach, we reconstruct the processes regulating annual CH4 emission from northern temperate lakes.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind displays temperature anisotropy associated with the protons, which is often represented as a rhombic shape data distribution in (Tperp/Tll, βll) space. The upper-right and lower-right boundaries of such a data distribution appear to be limited by various kinetic plasma instabilities driven by the proton temperature anisotropy. To understand such boundaries, the present authors developed a quasi-linear model in inhomogeneous solar wind plasma in which the instability-driven dissipation terms appear on the right-hand sides of the equations for Tperp and Tll, while self-consistently computing for the wave intensities. Such a formalism successfully reproduced the upper-right and lower-right boundaries. However, in order to explain the vast majority of data points within the distribution that are found well away from the boundaries and possessing near isotropy, Tperp ≈ Tll, one must include effects other than the collisionless dissipations, i.e., other than dissipations due to instabilities. The present paper employs an improved quasi-linear theory that incorporates not only the instability-driven collisionless dissipation terms, but also the dissipations due to binary collisions (which is often called the collisional age) as well as the dissipations due to spontaneous thermal emissions. The set of equations for Tperp and Tll as well as for the waves are solved over inhomogeneous solar wind model, and the results will be discussed. The present approach may help in interpreting existing and future satellite data, including those from the near future Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter Missions.",

            "abstract": "Gravel-bedded river channels commonly evolve so that median sized grains on the bed surface are at, or near, the threshold for motion when the flow reaches bankfull stage. In addition, theory predicts the near- equivalence of the bankfull (bf) and critical (c) non-dimensional shear stresses (τ*bf ~= τ*c) for straight, cohesionless gravel channels. However, not all natural gravel channels conform to this simple relationship. To understand why some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of what is needed to initiate sediment motion, we compile a dataset of the hydraulic geometry and median grain sizes of ~300 reaches from gravel-bedded rivers in North America. Notably, we find that the ratio of bankfull to critical Shields stresses is significantly higher in West Coast river reaches (2.6, n=77) than in river reaches in the rest of the continent (1.0, n=216). We explore the hypothesis that these reaches have adjusted to maintain a high excess shear stress at bankfull flows to accommodate elevated sediment supplies resulting from rapid erosion along the tectonically active margin of western North America. As a test of this hypothesis, we explore spatial patterns in calculated transport capacity and 10Be-derived erosion rates across North America. We find that an order of magnitude decrease in sediment transport capacity away from the Pacific plate boundary parallels an order of magnitude decrease in 10Be-derived erosion rates. These findings suggest that tectonically sustained high erosion rates on the West Coast may be recorded in the channel geometry and bed surface grain size of gravel-bedded channels.",

            "abstract": "Mechanically-chemically mediated processes may significantly alter the morphology of rock fracture surfaces. These processes may occur either as diagenetic mechanisms over geologic timescales under in situ-conditions, or during man-made engineering processes, during which injected fluids and/or induced temperature changes can significantly accelerate these processes. Numerical simulations at the grain scale have been conducted to predict the changes in normal stiffness and transmissivity of fractures under the combined processes of pressure dissolution and free-face precipitation. The ensuing compaction mechanism is characterized by dissolution of asperities under contact, and subsequent re-precipitation of the dissolved mass over the adjacent free surfaces. The normal stiffness of the fracture increases over time, due the increase in total contact area, and an increase in the number of regions in contact. The resultant stiffness curves reflect two regimes. At low loads, contact occurs primarily over the dissolved and precipitated, smoothened surface contact region, leading to rapid, exponential-like stiffening. At high loads, previously free-surface regions are brought into contact, and their unaltered rough nature results in the traditional, linear stiffening with increasing compression. The transition between the two contact regimes is approximately given by the confining pressure acting during the compaction process. During the compaction process, a steady decline of the hydraulic transmissivity is observed, due to both the decrease in mean aperture, and the increased tortuosity caused by the additional contact regions, up to the point at which the contact zones percolate and effectively seal the fracture hydraulically. The remaining fracture porosity is hydraulically ineffective, but may be as high as a third of the initial value. It follows that both the magnitude and nature of the predicted stiffness curves differ fundamentally from those observed for freshly induced fractures used in laboratory experiments.",

Curvilinear NW- to NNW-trending high-angle strike-slip faults and seismicity lineaments define small circles around an Euler pole (117.7°W, 47.9°N) of rotation relative to North America that approximates GPS-derived poles for the rotation of eastern Washington and the Snake River Plain. Although the lengths of strike-slip faults that follow small circle paths suggest maximum earthquake magnitudes of M6.6 to M7.2, their slip rates calculated from the Euler pole are low (0.3 to 0.5 mm/yr). Many normal faults in the Lewis and Clark Zone in Montana, the Centennial fault system north of the Snake River Plain, west of the Wasatch Front, in the northern Basin and Range, and locally east of the Oregon Cascade arc are radial to this pole of rotation, suggesting that these normal faults help accommodate this crustal rotation. Regions undergoing contraction in western Washington and northwestern Oregon are separated from those to the east undergoing extension by lines radial to the Euler pole. In our regional kinematic model, dextral faults along small circles connect SW-directed crustal extension in the Intermountain Seismic Belt and E-directed extension in the Cascade arc south of Mount Hood to N-directed contraction in the Olympic Peninsula, Puget Lowland, and the Yakima Fold and Thrust Belt. The lack of Quaternary faulting and seismicity in the Oregon segment of the forearc is consistent with its clockwise rotation as a rigid block. Potential drivers of the crustal rotation include westward slab rollback and the Yellowstone geoid high, and the overall velocity field may integrate the response of rotating blocks and distributed deformation between them.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover has been exploring the environment of Gale Crater since it landed in August 2012. By September 2014 the rover had reached the basal units of the Mt. Sharp (Aeolis Mons) stratigraphy. The ongoing scientific investigation of these strata includes multispectral imaging acquired by the Mast Cameras (Mastcams), Bayer-patterned CCD cameras each equipped with a rotating filter wheel whose filter band centers span twelve unique wavelengths in the visible to near-infrared. This wavelength range (445-1013 nm) covers the locations of many broad spectral absorptions exhibited by a variety of iron-bearing minerals, including both primary igneous minerals such as pyroxenes and olivines as well as minerals such as oxides and sulfates that can form via water-rock interactions. Mastcam spectra acquired to date over the traverse have shown a great variety of spectra in outcrops, float rocks, drill tailings, and other material imaged by the camera. Comparisons with the results of other instruments, such as ChemCam or in the case of drill samples, CheMin, aid in the interpretation of spectral features.\nRecent results from the Mastcam multispectral investigation have shown that since reaching the Murray Formation at the base of Mt. Sharp, the spectral diversity observed by Mastcam has increased, including the appearance of distinct absorption features not previously observed in the mission. Much of this new diversity is seen to be variable over small spatial scales within an outcrop, sometimes in association with light-toned veins, suggesting alteration by fluids percolating through fractures in the rock. Follow-up analyses by other instruments further constrain the mineralogy that gives rise to these spectral features. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the alteration environment has shifted from that observed in Yellowknife Bay and the surrounding plains.",

Based on our experience with STEREO beacon images, we demonstrate that operational images can be used to do good quality science. We also discuss the limitations of operational data for scientific research. Finally, we discuss ways in which a predominantly operational mission could be combined with science mission, to further enhance research.",

            "abstract": "Following the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman giant earthquake (Mw 9.1), multiple geology and geophysical surveys were conducted to gain better understanding of the behavior and mechanism of the tsunamigenic event. We present the first regional study of seafloor depth changes offshore of northern Sumatra, covering from the northwest of Northern Sumatra to west of the Simeulue Island, 1-6.5°N and 93-96.5°E. The oldest bathymetric dataset was from Dec 1997-Jan 1998 and the newer datasets were from the multiple surveys between Jan-Feb 2005 and Jan-Mar 2009. Using a re-sampled cell size of 115 m and sample interval of 100 m, we focused our observation on five 30-50 km long, SW-NE transects comparing the 1997/8 data with later surveys of the toe of the accretionary prism. The depth errors are the standard deviation for each dataset. For the five regions discussed, from N to S, we observe for crossing: (1) an average shoaling of ~120 ±31 m between 1997 and 2005 adjacent to and on the seaward flank of a fold closest to the Sunda Trench; (2) a landward shift of the fold closest to the Trench with an average shoaling of ~29 ±9 m between 1997 and 2005 on the landward flank of this fold; (3) the second fold landward of the Trench shows an average deepening of ~43 ±16 m between 1997 and 2005 proximal to a mass-wasting feature and a consequent shoaling of ~44 ±3 m on landward flank of the next fold seaward; (4) a seaward shift and a shoaling of ~38 ±14 m between 1997 and 2005 on the fold closest to the Trench; and (5) a slight landward shift between 1997 and 2005. While uncertainties remain, the 10s of m vertical and 100s of m horizontal changes likely reflect co-seismic motion on the décollement (e.g. crossing 4), post-seismic motion on landward vergent thrusts (e.g. 2), and/or slumping (e.g. 1,3).",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a poorly constrained flux in the North American monsoon (NAM) region, leading to potential errors in land-atmosphere feedbacks. Due to the region’s arid to semi-arid climate, two factors play major roles in ET: sparse vegetation that exhibits dramatic seasonal greening, and irrigated agriculture. To more accurately characterize the spatio-temporal variations of ET in the NAM region, we used the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, modified to account for soil evaporation (Esoil), irrigated agriculture, and the variability of land surface properties derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer during 2000-2012. Simulated ET patterns were compared to field observations at fifty-nine eddy covariance towers, water balance estimates in nine basins, and six available gridded ET products. The modified VIC model performed well at eddy covariance towers representing the natural and agricultural land covers in the region. Simulations revealed that major source areas for ET were forested mountain areas during the summer season and irrigated croplands at peak times of growth in the winter and summer, accounting for 22% and 9% of the annual ET, respectively. Over the NAM region, Esoil was the largest component (60%) of annual ET, followed by plant transpiration (T, 32%) and evaporation of canopy interception (8%). Esoil and T displayed different relations with P in natural land covers, with Esoil tending to peak earlier than T by up to one month, while only a weak correlation between ET and P was found in irrigated croplands. These VIC-based estimates are the most realistic to date for this region, outperforming several other process-based and remote-sensing-based gridded ET products. Furthermore, spatio-temporal patterns reveal new information on the magnitudes, locations and timing of ET in the North American monsoon region, with implications for land-atmosphere feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Transverse aeolian ridges, or TARs, are found throughout the tropics of Mars and typically appear as rows of bright ripples that are several meters tall and spaced semi-regularly several tens of meters apart. The origin of these features remained mysterious for decades after their discovery in Viking and Mars Global Surveyor images. A new hypothesis (Geissler, 2014, 10.1002-2014JE004633) suggests that TARs might be deposits left behind by dusty turbidity currents in the Martian atmosphere. The hypothesis assumes that the micron-sized dust particles are transported in suspension in turbulent flows, driven both by the winds and by gravity. The dust is concentrated near the surface, much like turbidity currents on Earth. Because of the difference in density, however, the dust clouds behave as a fluid distinct from the clear sky above. In particular, waves can appear at the surface of the dense “fluid” when the flows encounter topographic obstacles along their paths. Such gravity waves travel at speeds that are determined by gravity and the thickness of the flow, much like waves in shallow water on Earth. When the wave propagation speed matches the speed of the flow, stationary waves are produced that persist in fixed locations. The bedforms deposited by such stationary waves are called “antidunes” (Gilbert, 1914, USGS Prof. Paper 86) because, unlike dunes, they can migrate upstream in a supercritical flow. Antidunes are commonly seen in shallow, high energy fluvial deposits on Earth. They are usually destroyed as quickly as they form, and are rarely preserved. The Martian TARs survive because the dust is sticky; TARs are deposited by currents that are much slower than the wind speeds needed to lift the dust again. Subaerial antidunes are much rarer on Earth and less well studied, and so the giant subaerial stationary antidunes of Mars, if that is what the TARs turn out to be, may teach us much about a geological process that is poorly known on our planet.",

            "abstract": "\"Solstice\" mission is the 7-year extension of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft exploration of the Saturn system that will culminate with the “Grand Finale”. Beginning in mid-2017, the spacecraft is scheduled to execute 22 orbits that have their periapses between the innermost D-ring and the upper layers of Saturn's atmosphere. These orbits will be perturbed by the gravitational field of Saturn as well as by the rings. We present an analysis of simulated “Grand Finale” radiometric data, and we investigate their sensitivity to the ring mass and higher zonal gravitational harmonics of the planet. We model the data quantity with respect to the available coverage of the tracking stations on Earth, and we account for the times when the spacecraft is occulted either by Saturn or the rings. We also use different data weights to simulate changes in the data quality. The dynamical model of the spacecraft motion includes both gravitational and non-gravitational forces, such as the daily momentum management due to Reaction Wheel Assembly and radioisotope thermo-electric generator accelerations. We solve the equations of motion and use a weighted-least squares fit to obtain spacecraft’s state vector, mass(es) of the ring or the individual rings, zonal harmonics, and non-gravitational accelerations. We also investigate some a-priori values of the A- and B-ring masses from Tiscareno et al. (2007) and Hedman et al. (2015) analyses. The preliminary results suggest that the “Grand Finale” orbits should remain sensitive to the ring mass even for GMring<2 km3/s2 and that they will also provide high accuracy estimates of the zonal harmonics J8, J10, and J12.",

The basins are then classified according to their parameter sensitivity patterns, using Principal component analysis (PCA) and expectation-maximization (EM) –based clustering approach. Similarities and differences among the parameter sensitivity-based classification system and existing climate classification systems are discussed. Within each class, the same inversion modeling setups, with a unique subset of unknown parameters, can be used for parameter calibration. By reducing the parameter dimensionality to a reasonably low number, the classification makes the inverse modeling possible and less ill-posed. Surrogate models are then developed and validated as computationally efficient alternative to the CLM numerical simulators. A set of experiments of surrogate-based model calibration, including deterministic optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)–Bayesian approaches, were conducted to evaluate the transferability of parameter values within and between the watershed classes.",

            "abstract": "The Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) recorded nine very high-resolution frames—eight at 12 m/pixel and one at 6 m/pixel—during the E12 flyby of Europa in Dec. 1997. To understand the implications for the small-scale structure and evolution of Europa, we mosaicked these frames (observations 12ESMOTTLE01 and 02, incidence ≈18°, emission ≈77°) into their regional context (part of observation 11ESREGMAP01, 220 m/pixel, incidence ≈74°, emission ≈23°). The topography data, which was created from the image mosaic overlaps, is sparse and segmented over the high-resolution images but connected by the underlying regional resolution topography. The high-resolution topography (24 m/pixel) is among the best for the current Europan dataset. From this dataset we ascertain the root mean square, or RMS, slope for some of the most common Europan surface features in a new region. We also employ a Fourier Transform method previously used on Ganymede and on other areas of Europa (Patel et al., 1999 JGR), to derive common wavelengths for the subunits of the ubiquitous ridged plains terrain. These results have important implications for differentiating between possible formation mechanisms—extensional tilt blocks (Pappalardo et al., 1995 JGR) or folds (Leonard et al., 2015 LPSC Abstract)—and for potential future missions. We continue this method for another high-resolution region taken in the E12 orbit, WEDGES01 and 02, with the specific goal of investigating how the variations in ridged plains morphologies relate across the surface of Europa.",

            "abstract": "Long-term CO2 containment in a geological storage reservoir is a key criterion for successfully implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS), however, CO2 leakage through different pathways cannot be completely ruled out in some instances. In this study we investigate the conditions for reactive barrier formation as a technology to mitigate and remediate CO2 leakage. We propose to inject a liquid reagent consistent of an alkaline sodium-silicate solution on top of the storage caprock, which will lead to silica mineral precipitation when in contact with an acidic, CO2-enriched fluid. This reaction will create a barrier that seals the leakage by reducing the permeability. Preliminary modelling has shown that the density, viscosity and alkalinity of the reagent fluid are critical for a successful seal formation, whereas differences in formation water composition and in the rock mineral composition are less important. In order to study the reaction through experiments, different reagent solutions were prepared and characterised in terms of silica concentration, density, viscosity and buffer capacity. In a static, diffusion-controlled batch experiment we observed silica mineral precipitation in the outer layer of the piece of rock inhibiting further mixing of the two fluids and slowing down the initial reaction rate. Core-flood experiments will be carried out to simulate barrier formation under fluid flow conditions. Here, the sealing efficiency of the reaction will be continuously measured in terms of a change in permeability.",

            "abstract": "Large normal faults are often reactivated as high-angle reverse faults during compressional basin inversion. Prevailing models to explain steep reverse slip call upon significant fluid overpressure. Though such models are consistent with some seismological data and field observations from incipient (low-displacement) reverse faults, they remain largely untested in the case of basin-scale faults.\nWe present field and experimental data from the >200 km long Moonlight Fault Zone in New Zealand, an Oligocene basin-bounding normal fault that reactivated in the Miocene as a high-angle reverse fault (present dip angle 65°-75°). Excellent exposures of the fault zone exhumed from c. 4-8 km depth are found in creek sections along the entire strike length. Wall rocks are mainly quartz-albite-muscovite-chlorite schists with a strong foliation that is everywhere sub-parallel to the Moonlight Fault (i.e. dip angle 65°-75°). Although the overall structure of the fault zone changes significantly along strike in response to wall rock composition, the <5 metre thick fault core everywhere contains interconnected layers of foliated cataclasite rich in authigenically-grown chlorite and muscovite/illite. Microstructural evidence suggests deformation in the fault core by a combination of cataclasis, frictional slip along phyllosilicate seams and dissolution-precipitation.\nSingle-direct and double-direct friction experiments were performed with the BRAVA apparatus (INGV, Rome) on saturated wafers (e.g. with intact foliation) of foliated cataclasite at normal stresses up to 75 MPa. The foliated cataclasites have a friction coefficient of <0.25 and negligible frictional healing. In combination with dissolution-precipitation mechanisms, a friction coefficient of <0.25 can account for slip on high-angle reverse faults if accompanied by only moderately high fluid pressures. Our results indicate that friction may be equally as important as fluid pressure during compressional basin inversion.",

The Global Decomposition Project (GDP) is designed to introduce and educate students about soil organic matter and decomposition through a standardized protocol for collecting, reporting, and sharing data. The Interactive Model of Leaf Decomposition (IMOLD) utilizes animations and modeling to learn about the carbon cycle, leaf anatomy, and the role of microbes in decomposition. Paired together, IMOLD teaches the background information and allows simulation of numerous scenarios, and the GDP is a data collection protocol that allows students to gather usable measurements of decomposition in the field.\n Our presentation will detail how the GDP protocol works, how to obtain or make the materials needed, and how results will be shared. We will also highlight learning objectives from the three animations of IMOLD, and demonstrate how students can experiment with different climates and litter types using the interactive model to explore a variety of decomposition scenarios. The GDP demonstrates how scientific methods can be extended to educate broader audiences, and data collected by students can provide new insight into global patterns of soil decomposition. Using IMOLD, students will gain a better understanding of carbon cycling in the context of litter decomposition, as well as learn to pose questions they can answer with an authentic computer model. Using the GDP protocols and IMOLD provide a pathway for scientists and educators to interact and reach meaningful education and research goals.",

It was found that in a typical aquifer the error in h(x, t) in early time is mainly caused by the random initial condition and the error reduces as time progresses to reach a constant error in later time. The duration during which the effect of the random initial condition is significant may last a few hundred days in most aquifers. The constant error in h(x, t) in later time is due to the combined effects of the uncertainties in the source/sink and flux boundary: the closer to the flux boundary, the larger the error. The error caused by the uncertain head boundary is limited in a narrow zone near the boundary and remains more or less constant over time. The aquifer system behaves as a low-pass filter which filters out high-frequency noises and keeps low-frequency variations. Temporal scaling of groundwater level fluctuations exists in most part of a low permeable aquifer whose horizontal length is much larger than its thickness caused by the temporal fluctuations of areal source/sink.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variation in climate, soils, disturbance regime, and forest management − as well as temporal variation in weather − all influence terrestrial carbon sources and sinks. Spatially-distributed, process-based, carbon cycle simulation models provide a means to integrate information from these various influences to estimate carbon pools and flux over large domains. Here we apply the Biome-BGC model over the 4 state (OR, WA, ID, Western MT) Northwest U.S. region for the interval from 1986-2010. Landsat data was used to characterize disturbances and revealed that the overall disturbance rate on forest land across the region was 0.8 % yr-1, with 49 % as harvests, 28 % as fire, and 23 % as pest/pathogen. A large proportion of the harvested area was on private forestland (62 %) and a large proportion of total burned area was on public forestland (89 %). Net ecosystem production (NEP) for the 2006-2010 interval on forestland was predominantly positive (a carbon sink) throughout the region, with maximum values in the Coast Range, intermediate values in the Cascade Mountains, and relatively low values in the Inland Rocky Mountain ecoregions. Croplands throughout the region had consistently high NEP. Localized negative NEPs were mostly associated with recent disturbances. There was large interannual variation in regional NEP, with notably low values across the region in 2003. In all ecoregions there was a downward trend in NEP over the 25 year study period. The net ecosystem carbon balance was positive in OR, near neutral in ID and WA, and negative (a carbon source) MT. The Northwest region as a whole was a carbon sink in the 2006-2010 period.",

            "abstract": "Although ground water is a major source of water in the western US, little research has been done on the impacts of climate change on western groundwater storage and recharge. Here we assess the impact of projected changes in precipitation and temperature on groundwater recharge across the western US by dividing the domain into five major regions (viz. Northern Rockies and Plains, South, Southwest, Northwest and West). Hydrologic outputs from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model based on Bias-Correction and Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections from 11 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration pathway 6.0 (RCP 6.0) scenarios were selected for projecting changes in recharge. Projections are made for near future (2020-2050) and far future (2070-2100) relative to the historical period (1970-2000). Averaged over the domain, half of the GCMs caused VIC to increase recharge across the region while the remaining half resulted in decreased recharge for both the near (-10.1% to 5.8%) and far (-9.7% to 17%) future. A majority (9 out of 11 GCMs) of the VIC simulations projected increased recharge in the Northern Rockies and Plains for both the near and far future. A majority of the simulations agreed on reduced recharge in other regions for the near future. For the far future, a majority of the simulations agreed on decreased recharge in the South (9 out of 11 GCMs) and Southwest (7 out of 11 GCMs) regions. The change is projected to be largest for the South region which could see recharged reduced by as much as 50%. Changes in recharge in the Northwest region are predicted to be small (within 10% of historical recharge). Despite the large variability in projected recharge across the GCMs, recharge projections from this study will help water managers with long term water management planning.",

            "abstract": "This study seeks to prove the usefulness of near-surface seismic methods as complementary data to conventional geotechnical and geological data in the characterization of areas of landslide risk. The setting is located in a low income housing neighborhood in the city of Campos do Jordão, state of São Paulo, Brazil. The area was devastated by numerous landslides between December 1999 to January 2000 after heavy rainfall in the area. Currently the area is being monitored by the National Center for Monitoring and Warning of Natural Disasters (CEMADEN). The landslides in this area are known to be shallow. The survey line passes within a couple feet of the CEMADEN monitoring station which measures soil temperature, soil moisture, rainfall intensity, and rainfall accumulation (Mendes et. al 2015). Refraction and Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) surveys were performed. In order to better identify the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave, separate surveys isolating the vertical and radial components of the Rayleigh wave were performed. By comparing the obtained Shear wave (Vs) and Compressional wave (Vp) profiles with the already known geotechnical data provided by CEMADEN and geological data from a previous study (Ahrendt 2005) of the site a better understanding of the geological interfaces that constitute the landslide prone area is obtained.",

            "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the several air pollutants that are largely produced by anthropogenic activities in urban areas as a result of incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. Long-term satellite data can monitor spatial and temporal changes in CO globally. Here we investigated spatial, vertical, and temporal changes in CO concentrations over the largest ten US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) using Version 6 MOPITT TIR-only CO retrievals. The 15-year average of MOPITT Surface CO concentrations over urban areas were highest (388 ppbv) over New York City and lowest (151 ppbv) over Miami. The influence of cities on elevated CO levels extends well beyond the immediate urban area. The CO seasonal profiles above the surface show distinct seasonality with peaks March-April and troughs September-October. However, larger cities show a lack of CO seasonality near the surface. We applied the nonparametric Seasonal Kendall (SK) trend test to the CO time series. Results revealed significant decreasing trends in CO concentration, with stronger trends in the lower atmosphere (>700 hPa) than in the mid-troposphere (500-700 hPa). Our results demonstrate the strong influence of local urban emissions on (near-) surface CO concentrations. Decreasing urban CO over the past 15 years reflects improved urban metabolism through improved energy efficiency, and increasing use of alternative transportation and zero-emission vehicles.",

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring fibrous actinolite, winchite, magnesioriebeckite, richterite, magnesiohornblende, and erionite have been found in rock, soil, and dust in southern Nevada and northwestern Arizona. The areas containing naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) include urban areas (e.g. Boulder City) and rural areas where people routinely enjoy outdoor activities including horseback riding, running, hiking, bicycling, and off-road-vehicle (ORV) recreation. A recent study showing mesothelioma in young people and women suggests some form of environmental exposure. Rock, soil, dust and clothing were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS); additional rock samples were analyzed using wavelength dispersive electron probe microanalysis (EPMA); additional soil samples were analyzed using PLM (polarizing light microscopy) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) using the Fluidized Bed Asbestos Segregator preparation method. Winds have transported and mixed the Ca-amphiboles, which are primarily from Nevada, with the Na-amphiboles that are primarily from northwestern Arizona. Erionite, which has not previously been reported in this area, was a common soil component found in 5 of 6 samples. The erionite source has not yet been determined. Winds have transported the amphibole and erionite particles into the Nellis Dunes Recreation Area – an ORV recreation area located 35 km north of Boulder City that otherwise would not be geologically predicted to contain fibrous amphiboles. In Boulder City, wind directions are primarily bimodal N-NE and S-SW with the strongest winds in the spring coming from the S-SW. The arid climate in this part of the Mojave Desert greatly increases the potential for wind erosion and human exposures. These results suggest that the entire Las Vegas Basin has, at times, received these particles through wind transport. Because the most likely human exposure pathway is through inhalation of dust, the Las Vegas metropolitan area, with over 1.9 million people, may be subject to exposure.",

Among all households, there was no exceedance of thresholds national standards PM10 (120 µg/m3) and PM2.5 (60 µg/m3). However, 10.7% of residences exceeded the PM10 threshold of the World Health Organization (50 µg/m3) and 39.2% for PM2.5 (20 µg/m3). The cluster analysis grouped the measures in the houses in four profiles. In three of them were greater amount of mass in ultrafine particles (E), followed by coarse particles (A) with the minimum in C level. The maximum in E may be due to the high contribution vehicular and secondary aerosol outdoor environment. The secondary maximum in A may be due to particles ressuspension and also arising from outdoors. These three groups differ only by the amount of PM measured in the households; they represent high, medium and low PM concentrations. The fourth group has average concentrations, but it presents a different profile because its maximum is in the D rather than E. All data will be analyzed concerning the possible sources.",

            "abstract": "A critical concern for boreal ecosystems centers on broad-scale responses to warming; i.e., where warming will lead to declining growth and mortality, or enhanced growth and greater productivity. However, few studies have synthesized tree growth along biogeographic gradients in an attempt to address this issue. We sought to develop a broader understanding of how trees have responded to recent warming for a dominant conifer species from the southern boreal to the western forest margin, an area expected to show signs of an early-stage boreal biome shift.  A new 30-site network of ring-width chronologies (1216 trees >4cm dbh) were evaluated for growth differences in Picea glauca across low-elevation, closed forests, open woodlands, and altitudinal treeline from southern interior boreal forest to the western forest-tundra margin. Regional temperature records were used to evaluate 1) whether tree growth near western treeline, which experiences cooler summers but warmer winters than in the interior, showed greater sensitivity to temperature than interior sites, 2) if the temperature-growth response varied through time, across ecosystem types, and by tree age, and 3) if there was a temperature-growth threshold. Positive growth trends since the 1980s in many open stands were consistent with the predicted expansion of western and altitudinal treeline. However, years with temperatures >13oC corresponded with a growth plateau or decline at all but the altitudinal treeline sites regardless of geographic location. Closed-canopy stands showed growth declines, high spruce beetle activity, and less resiliency to further warming. Warming leads to markedly different responses according to ecosystem type and biogeographical setting at the boreal forest-tundra margin. Low-elevation forests are less resilient to further warming where temperatures have already reached threshold levels and further spruce beetle outbreaks occur, even at the western margin of boreal forest.",

Using Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) [Ridley et al., 2006] coupled with realistic transport, we examine the underlying mechanisms of the longitude-dependent storm enhancements.

This community is the first (Group I) of three community types that represent different stages in the transition from vapor-dominated to brine-dominated water-rock interactions (i.e., vent effluent geochemistry). We have now observed this similar transition from four hydrothermal regions from across the Pacific Ocean. The second type of mat community (Group II) that has been observed is characterized by the presence of another group of Epsilonproteobacteria; however, these are mostly sulfur-oxidizing phylotypes (e.g., Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum, and/or Sulfuricurvum). Finally, once the transition from sulfur to iron is complete, then the third type (Group III) cluster together by the presence of Zetaproteobacteria, which are known to use iron-oxidation. Each of these community types are dominated by groups of microorganisms characterized by cultured isolates, all of which are strict chemolithoautotrophs capable of carbon fixation and are hypothesized as both ecosystem engineers and primary producers in these energy-rich ecosystems.

Total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA) concentrations ranged from 0.55 to 9.96 μM (mean 3.76 ± 1.80 μM) and not only peaked with discharge during winter storms, but also remained elevated throughout the irrigation season when discharge was low. Summer irrigation was a critical hydrologic regime for DOM cycling, since it mobilized DOM similar in concentration and reactivity to DOM released during winter storms for an extended period of time, with the largest amino acid contributions to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pools (3.4 ‒ 3.7 % DOC-AA, 17.4 ‒ 22.5 % DON-AA), the largest proportion of basic amino acids (B/(B+A) = 0.19 ‒ 0.22), and the largest degradation index values (mean 1.37 ± 0.96). The mole percent of non-protein amino acids, commonly considered as an indicator of microbial degradation, decreased with DOM processing and was highest during summer (mean 4.1 ± 1.1%). A lack of correlation between THAA concentrations and UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence proxies (including “protein-like” fluorophores B and T) indicated that optical properties may be limited in representing amino acid dynamics in this system. A new parameter for DOM processing derived from trends in individual amino acids demonstrated strong potential for inferring the extent of DOM degradation in freshwater systems. The biogeochemical relevance of irrigation practices is heightened by timing, since the additional export of reactive DOM coincides with enhanced downstream DOM processing in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a critical habitat for endangered species serving as water source for 25 million Californians.",

            "abstract": "We have identified several landforms in the Hrad Vallis region of Mars (33.0o – 35.5oN, 216o – 218oW), which suggest that this area was covered by an ice sheet concurrent with volcanic eruptions. Using digital elevation models derived from High Resolution Imaging Science (HiRISE) and Context Camera (CTX) data, a reexamination of the area reveals a complex history including flow inflation and topographic control by transient topographic barriers. Among Amazonian-age outflow channels, Hrad Vallis is exceptional as it exhibits good evidence of magma/water interactions. It is inferred to have formed in association with a shallow igneous sill that melted part of the martian cryosphere and/or released water from an extensive aquifer to produce enormous lahar-like mud flows. Exposed ~30 m high dikes, 20 m high eroded mounds, and flow paths that are inconsistent with present-day topographic gradients, lead us to speculate that this area was covered by at least ~40 m of material (eolian deposits or ice) at the time of volcanic dike intrusion and flow emplacement. This material was subsequently removed leaving no clear morphologic signs (e.g., wind streaks, if eolian material; moraines, if ice). We favor the ice model because if this area was once ice-covered, it offers a plausible mode of formation (as pingoes) for some enigmatic 30 m high domes in the vicinity. At least one 120 km long flow from Hrad Vallis was emplaced as a pahoehoe-like flow that was confined by topographic obstacles and subsequently inflated to thickness of ~45 m. Although the direct relationship between this flow and Hrad Vallis remains to be determined, the inflated flow suggests a longer period of eruption/emplacement at a slower effusion rate than was previously believed.",

            "abstract": "Gas-driven filter pressing is the process of melt expulsion from a volatile-saturated crystal mush, induced by the buildup and subsequent release of gas pressure. Filter pressing is inferred to play a major role in magma fractionation at shallow depths (<10 km) by moving melt and gas relative to the solid, crystalline framework. However, the magmatic conditions at which this process operates remain poorly constrained. We present novel experimental data that illustrate how the crystal content of the mush affects the ability of gas-driven filter pressing to segregate melt. Hydrous haplogranite (2.1 wt% water in the melt) and dacite (4.2 wt% water in the melt) crystal mushes, with a wide range of crystallinities (34–80 vol% crystals), were investigated using in-situ, high temperature (500–800 °C) synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy with high spatial (3 micron/pixel) and temporal resolution (~8 s per 3D data set). The experimental results show that gas-driven filter pressing operates only below the maximum packing of bubbles and crystals (~74 vol%). Above this threshold, the mush tends to fracture and gas escapes via fractures. Therefore, the efficiency of gas-driven filter pressing is promoted close to the percolation threshold and in situations where a mush inflates slowly relative to build-up of pressure and expulsion of melt. Such observations offer a likely explanation for the production of eruptible, crystal-poor magmas within Earth’s crust.\nFigure = Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy 3D renderings of representative haplogranite (A–D) and dacite (E–H) samples, with different crystal (Φ) and bubble fractions (β) at representative temperatures and experimental times (t, in minutes).

            "abstract": "On the major interior rivers of Alaska, spring river ice breakup is the single largest annual flood threat and can result in fatalities in addition to millions of dollars of damages. Unlike freeze up, which is a gradual, months-long progression, breakup is a quick process during which an entire winters worth of ice lifts and moves downstream in a short time frame (hours to days). Breakup types range between thermal and dynamic. A thermal breakup is relatively slow; ice degrades in place before moving downstream. A dynamic breakup is quicker; the ice is relatively strong before the breakup front moves past. Severe breakup flooding is typically a result of a dynamic breakup. Because the ice has not yet deteriorated, large, strong sheets of ice become jammed on islands, river bends, or other ice sheets, creating an ice jam. The water levels behind an ice jam can rise rapidly and with little warning.\nThe goal of this study is to better understand predictors of breakup flood severity on the Upper and Middle Yukon River; between Eagle and Nulato, Alaska. We examine end of winter snowpack, ESRL Temperature Reanalysis data, and breakup-related flood observations from 2000 to 2015. Experience has shown that those years which have a large end of winter snowpack and a rapid spring warm-up have an above average chance of flooding, but this study seeks to expand on that knowledge base. What about years where only one of those factors (quick warm up or large snowpack) is present? Also, are there cases of years where the April antecedent conditions were similar, but the outcome of breakup was different? Why? Is flooding at a certain location an indicator that there will be flooding at another location downstream? This study is an in-depth examination of the past 15 years of breakup on the Yukon. A better understanding of these past events will lead to greater skill at predicting future events, and a better service for our stakeholders.",

These systems are deployed using a number of reagent ion chemistries in both the positive and negative mode. Moreover, high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometers make it possible to detect and (potentially) quantify species without the use of authentic standards.\nAcetate CIMS (or negative-ion proton-transfer CIMS) detects species by abstracting a proton from carboxylic acids, nitrated phenols, and other species with acidic protons. Clustering reactions are also known to occur, complicating analysis. proper interpretation of the mass spectra requires understanding these mechanisms and controlling for unwanted ionization processes. We investigate the ability to control for clustering reactions using authentic standards under various clustering regimes while maintaining ion transmission efficiency in simple and complex matrices. The feasibility of using isotopically labeled acetate to unambiguously identify clusters is also investigated. Bulk metrics for describing the spectra (oxygen:carbon, oxidation state, average carbon number, etc) are also investigated to understand their susceptibility to experimental configuration.",

Presented at this time are the first results of an ongoing study of a rapidly eroding, steep sea cliff in Vancouver, British Columbia. The sea cliff is formed in a 70-m-thick sequence of outwash sands and silts (Quadra Sand) deposited during the early part of the last glaciation, known locally as the Fraser Glaciation. The sea cliff is unstable and retreating due to wave attack, groundwater seepage, and shallow-seated landslides. If no measures are taken to stem wave erosion, the sea cliff will likely retreat faster with rising seas over the remainder of this century. The beach below the cliff is a popular recreational location, thus a hard engineering solution to the erosion problem might be unacceptable to Vancouver residents. We have used conventional photogrammetry, structures from motion, thermal imaging, and terrestrial full waveform laser scanning to provide base-line spatial data for the most rapidly eroding section of the cliff. Here, we present some of our results and discuss the challenges that we faced in characterizing this large soil slope.",

            "abstract": "With a changing global climate and growing demand for water throughout the world, responsible and sustainable land and water resource management practices are becoming increasingly important. Accounting for the amount of water used by riparian vegetation is a critical element for better managing water resources in arid and semiarid environments. The objective of this study was to determine water uptake by selected riparian vegetative species in a semiarid riparian corridor in North-Central Oregon. Exo-skin sap flow sensors (Dynamax, Houston, TX, U.S.A.) were used to measure sap flux in red alder (Alnus rubra) trees, the dominant overstory vegetation at the field site. Xylem sap flow data was collected from selected trees at the field site and in a greenhouse setting. Transpiration rates were determined based on an energy balance method, which makes it possible to estimate the mass flow of sap by measuring the velocity of electrical heat pulses through the plant stem. Preliminary field results indicate that red alder tree branches of about 1 inch diameter transpire between 2 and 6 kg of water/day. Higher transpiration rates of up to 7.3 kg of water/day were observed under greenhouse conditions. Streamflow and stream water temperature, vegetation characteristics, and meteorological data were analyzed in conjunction with transpiration data. Results of this study provide insight on riparian vegetation water consumption in water scarce ecosystems. This study is part of an overarching project focused on climate-vegetation interactions and ecohydrologic processes in arid and semiarid landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Hot springs and fumaroles release significant quantities of aqueous and gaseous mercury into the environment. Yet few studies have looked at the microbial underpinnings of mercury transformations in geothermal settings. Recent advancements in culture-independent molecular techniques, such as ultra-high-throughput sequencing, allow us to delve deeply into the functional and phylogenetic make-up of these extreme environments. Here we present results from deep metagenomic sequencing of geothermal microbial communities cycling mercury, focussing on the connections between putative metabolisms and mercury methylation, and the evolution of the mer-operon. Presented are data from two adjacent, acidic (pH<3), mesothermal (33-68 °C) hot springs of the Ngawha geothermal field (New Zealand), extremely enriched in total mercury (>1000 ng L-1), and varying methylmercury concentrations (1-10 ng L-1). Microbial communities of both springs are dominated by mercury resistant acidophilic, sulfur- and iron-cycling microbes: Acidithiobacillus, Thiomonas, and Thermoplasma. Mercury methylation genes (hgcAB) were only detected in the cooler spring (∆T~10 °C), with an order of magnitude greater methylmercury (10 ng L-1). The hgcAB genes have no known closest relatives (<90%), but lowest common ancestor analysis matched members of the Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria as well as uncultured environmental bacteria. Our findings show that geothermal microbial communities are capable of a net production of methylmercury, alongside active demethylation-reduction by mer-capable microbes, despite selective pressures from low pH and high mercury levels. However, temperature may be the major limiting factor on mercury biomethylation in geothermal settings, as no hgcAB genes were detected in the spring that was nearly identical in all physio-chemical parameters to its neighbour except for temperature (T >40°C), and methylmercury concentration. We conclude that the relative amount of mercury methylation in each hot spring is controlled by the presence of methylating bacteria and archaea, the release of bioavailable mercury species from sulfide minerals, counterbalanced by microbial mercury demethylation and reduction and mercury sulfide mineralization.",

Several reports have analyzed its features and its impact under diverse points-of-view. In this work, we analyze the low latitude ionosphere behavior in Brazil and its response during this peculiar period. The ionospheric variation is analyzed through typical parameters such as vertical total electron content (VTEC), the peak height of F2 layer and its critical frequency, hmF2 and foF2, in 2008, around the southern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA), in Cachoeira Paulista (22.5o S, 45.0 o W, mag. lat: 16 o S, dip angle: -32.3o) and at an equatorial station, São Luís (2.33o S, 44.2o W, dip angle: −6.7o). VTEC values present a semiannual variation pattern and two well-defined peaks in March and October. Daily maximum values are observed around 15:00 LT. It was observed periodicities observed of 9, 13.5 and 27 days in VTEC and hmF2, mainly at the first and the second half of 2008. These periods match with the observed periods in solar and geomagnetic indexes such as Vsw, Kp and AE and are associated with occurrence of high speed streams (HSS) coming from solar coronal holes. A complex response of the low latitude ionosphere is observed, with prominent increases and decreases of VTEC at daytime during the interval of occurrence of HSSs. It is suggested that a combination of several factors such as prompt penetration of electric field, disturbed dynamo electric field, meridional winds, thermal expansion of thermosphere and composition changes of neutral atmosphere are responsible for the high day-to-day variability of the ionosphere",

Under UV radiation, when a non-fluorescent diamond appeared dim, bubbles of included fluids became visible as yellow and blue spherules.

The second type of fluid-rich diamonds display iridescence of pink, blue, green and yellow colors. They show lamellar, filamentous, or tubular structures, some of the tubes are filled with granules, probably grown from fluids in the tubes. An FT-IR investigation of both types yielded similar results. Apart from absorption due to intrinsic diamond lattice vibrations, we found an outstanding group of bands just below wavenumber 3000. This indicates the presence of a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons of long chain length.

Herrera et al. [1, 2]. Using the DVS-approach a group of four algorithms, referred to as the ‘DVS-algorithms’, which fulfill the DDM-paradigm (i.e. the solution of global problems is obtained by resolution of local problems exclusively) has been derived. Such procedures are applicable to any boundary-value problem, or system of such equations, for which a standard discretization method is available and then software with a high degree of parallelization can be constructed. In a parallel talk, in this AGU Fall Meeting, Ismael Herrera will introduce the general DVS methodology.\nThe application of the DVS-algorithms has been demonstrated in the solution of several boundary values problems of interest in Geophysics. Numerical examples for a single-equation, for the cases of symmetric, non-symmetric and indefinite problems were demonstrated before [1,2]. For these problems DVS-algorithms exhibited significantly improved numerical performance with respect to standard versions of DDM algorithms. In view of these results our research group is in the process of applying the DVS method to a widely used simulator for the first time, here we present the advances of the application of this method for the parallelization of MODFLOW. Efficiency results for a group of tests will be presented.\n",

            "abstract": "Emergent wetland vegetation has been shown to mitigate coastal inundation and erosion hazards by reducing wave energy through friction (Shepard et al., 2011), although its use in coastal protection planning is limited because predictive models require improved vegetation data. We isolated biophysical characteristics (biomass, stem density, rigidity, etc.) of plants using horizontal digital photographs (Side-On Photos) in conjunction with remote sensing and physical surveys. We studied the dominant salt-marsh species/assemblages in Port Susan Bay of Washington State, a vulnerable estuary that has experienced up to 1 kilometer of marsh retreat since the mid-1960s. We measured plant height, stem diameter, stem density (area available for flow) from fall to early spring (August 2014 through April 2015) using Side-On Photography and digital image processing techniques. Metrics from Side-On Photography were highly correlated to physical lab measurements. Vegetation rigidity was measured in-situ with a handheld digital scale with respect to measurement height and bending angle. Plant elasticity showed a strong correlation to stem diameter in two dominant bulrush species. We employed remote sensing supervised classifications techniques (Maximum-Likelihood and Decision Tree Classifiers) to hyperspectral imagery to map the spatial extent of vegetation assemblages with an overall accuracy of 86.7%. Combining these methods enabled us to extrapolate and validate vegetation characteristics across the study area and to estimate species-specific friction coefficients for input to cross-shore wave models. On-going studies include sensitivity analyses of wave models to seasonally-dependent vegetation parameters in the nearshore and ultimately wave impacts along the coast. By accounting for site-specific and spatiotemporal variability in vegetation data, we inform scientific understanding of the interactions of vegetation, waves, and sediment processes.",

            "abstract": "Although most studies of the effect of EMIC waves on relativistic electrons have focused on wave events in the afternoon sector in the outer plasmasphere or plume region, strong magnetospheric compressions provide an additional stimulus for EMIC wave generation across a large range of local times and L shells. We present here observations of the effects of an intense, long-duration hydrogen band EMIC wave event on February 23, 2014 that was stimulated by a gradual 4-hour rise and subsequent sharp increases in solar wind pressure. Large-amplitude linearly polarized hydrogen band EMIC waves (up to 25 nT p-p) that included triggered emissions appeared for over 4 hours at both Van Allen Probes while these spacecraft were outside the plasmapause, in a region with densities ~5-20 cm-3, as they passed near apogee from late morning through local noon. Observations of radiation belt electrons by the REPT and MagEIS instruments on these spacecraft showed that these waves caused significant depletions of more field-aligned electrons at ultrarelativistic energies from 5.2 MeV down to ~2 MeV, and some depletions at energies down to below 1 MeV as well.",

            "abstract": "While the clearest evidence for hydrothermal circulation resides in focused upwellings at high-temperature vents, which form chimneys, circulation also features less-understood low-temperature diffuse flow and recharge zones. Flow focusing depends on the subsurface porosity and permeability structure, which, in the reactive environment of hydrothermal circulation, is likely influenced by mineral dissolution and precipitation from hydrothermal fluids. We developed two-dimensional Finite Element models of coupled reactive flow and porosity evolution and discuss how reactions may influence flow focusing and the morphology of upwellings and downwellings. This work can also address the chemical and thermal flux provided to the ocean, and the grade and volume of metal sulfide deposition.\nOur coupled system (See image) considers 1) Darcy flow driven by fluid buoyancy; 2) Heat transport in a porous medium; 3) Evolution of dissolved mineral concentration; 4) Evolution of porosity and permeability in response to mineral precipitation or dissolution. We also include an “ocean” layer, which allows hot fluid to escape the system without being forced to cool dramatically as they approach the seafloor.\nAbsent porosity evolution, hydrothermal circulation forms flame-like upwellings that bend to avoid downdrafts. The circulation varies at the time scale of decades. Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained, precipitation of amorphous silica takes place in the upwellings as they rise and cool down. When coupled with porosity and permeability evolution, silicate precipitation forces the upwellings to flatten and become diffuse. Localized recharge zones stabilize and develop an armor of low porosity rocks where high temperature fluids cooled rapidly and deposited silica as they approach the recharge zone. This morphology of localized, armored recharge zone and diffuse upwellings does not match observations at natural vent fields, which implies that a critical element of the hydrothermal system is missing from our models. Future models will also consider anhydrite which precipitates as seawater is heated and hence may counteract the effects of silica and may form localized upwellings and diffuse downwellings.",

            "abstract": "Recently, a full waveform time domain solution has been developed for the magnetotelluric (MT) and controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods. The ultimate goal of this approach is to obtain a computationally tractable direct waveform joint inversion for source fields and earth conductivity structure in three and four dimensions. This is desirable on several grounds, including the improved spatial resolving power expected from use of a multitude of source illuminations of non-zero wavenumber, the ability to operate in areas of high levels of source signal spatial complexity and non-stationarity, etc.\nThis goal would not be obtainable if one were to adopt the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) approach for the forward problem. This is particularly true for the case of MT surveys, since an enormous number of degrees of freedom are required to represent the observed MT waveforms across the large frequency bandwidth. It means that for FDTD simulation, the smallest time steps should be finer than that required to represent the highest frequency, while the number of time steps should also cover the lowest frequency. This leads to a linear system that is computationally burdensome to solve.\nWe have implemented our code that addresses this situation through the use of a fictitious wave domain method and GPUs to speed up the computation time. We also substantially reduce the size of the linear systems by applying concepts from successive cascade decimation, through quasi-equivalent time domain decomposition. By combining these refinements, we have made good progress toward implementing the core of a full waveform joint source field/earth conductivity inverse modeling method.\nFrom results, we found the use of previous generation of CPU/GPU speeds computations by an order of magnitude over a parallel CPU only approach. In part, this arises from the use of the quasi-equivalent time domain decomposition, which shrinks the size of the linear system dramatically.",

            "abstract": "In November 2014 the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft began the science phase of its mission to study the upper atmosphere of Mars and its escape to space. The loss of atmospheric particles (in neutral or charged state) to space is thought to have played a role in the evolution of the Martian climate over the past ~4 billion years. Charged particle escape at Mars may be significant due to the absence of a global dynamo magnetic field for most of its history, allowing more direct access of the solar wind to the Martian atmosphere. Among its many measurement capabilities, MAVEN can detect escaping planetary ions with high time cadence and high energy and mass resolution using the STATIC (SupraTheral and Thermal Ion Composition) instrument.\nWe present the results of an effort to compute the escape rate of ions from the Martian atmosphere over MAVEN’s primary mission. We statistically map the measured fluxes of planetary ions to various surfaces near Mars, including a closed spherical shell surrounding the planet. We map both incoming and outgoing ion fluxes over different mass and energy ranges, and separate the fluxes by different drivers of escape measured by MAVEN, including solar wind pressure, Extreme Ultraviolet flux, and Interplanetary Magnetic Field strength. We place our results in context with measurements of ion escape made by the Phobos 2 and Mars Express missions, and address the implications for atmospheric loss over the history of the planet.",

Such effort consists of reforestation of riparian zones and spring lands at the hills of selected catchments, including the Ribeirão das Posses (RP) catchment. Since 2012 the University of São Paulo has developed research at RP to monitor the benefits of these practices on stream water quality, and identified a few parameters as good indicators to follow up the results of this PES program. The present study has the objective to show results of the monthly monitoring in2015,including 13 sampling stations at RP catchment distributed as follows: one in a spring forested area, three in spring areas of different ages of reforestation (3, 5 and 8 years), and nine at reaches of RP streamlocated in a way to contemplate the effects of the first order streams that comes from the studied spring areas entering RP. We established two additional stations at the Jaguari River, upstream and downstream of RP outlet. In situ measurements include temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO), and collect water samples to bring to the laboratory for analyses of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC), total nitrogen (TN) and alkalinity. Also, sediments (fine fraction: >0.45 µm; and coarse fraction: >63 µm) are collected for isotopic carbon analyses. Preliminary results show pH values ranging from 5.5 to 7.8, while DO ranges from 5.8 to 8.9 mg L-1. As for EC, the mean at the spring forested station was 34.6 µS cm-1, while at spring areas of 3, 6 and 8 years of reforestation they were 53.3, 73.8 and 34.8 µS cm-1, respectively. We expected that by the end of this annual monitoring the benefits of reforestation will be affirmed.",

Stage zero channels have well connected floodplains with elevated water tables, spatially variable hydrologic regimes and structurally complex aquatic and riparian habitat. As such, they provide incredibly valuable habitat for a suite of terrestrial and aquatic taxa, including several Pacific salmon species that are in decline. In this presentation, we provide an overview of the features and types of stage zero channels, where in the landscape they are likely to be found, how they evolve under natural conditions, and restoration techniques for converting less ecologically valuable channel types into stage zero channels. We compare the structure and function of stage zero channels to more traditional channel restoration targets. We conclude that new approaches to stream restoration are needed that take into account society’s economic and ecological imperatives to create resilient, structurally complex and dynamic systems, and that the spatial scale of restorative actions should be expanded where possible to better recognize and integrate the interdependent nature of longitudinal, lateral and vertical linkages in stream systems.",

A very widely held public perception is that the increase in temperature is a cause of drought. This represents the warming-induced drought scenario. However, the agricultural and hydrologic scientific communities have a very different interpretation with drought being the cause of increasing temperature. In essence, those communities assume the warming is a surface feedback and their interpretation is for drought-induced warming. This is a classic cause-effect problem that has resisted definitive explanation due to the lack of radiative observations at suitable spatial and temporal scales.\nIn this presentation we first summarise the observations and then use theory to untangle the cause-effect relationships that underlie the competing interpretations. We then show how satellite data (CERES, NASA) can be used to disentangle the cause-effect relations.",

            "abstract": "Nationwide, the impacts of irrigation on summer (June-July-August) weather over the United States are examined for a pair of unusually wet (2010) and dry (2012) years using an integrated regional climate-irrigation modeling system based on the WRF-Noah-Mosaic framework. A novel irrigation scheme was developed for WRF to mimic center pivot irrigation practices for farmlands across the U.S., over areas defined using MODIS-based irrigation extent data. Results show that this new irrigation approach can dynamically generate irrigation water amounts that are in good agreement with the observed irrigation water use estimates across the High Plains, a region where the prescribed parameters in the irrigation scheme best match actual irrigation practice. Synoptic conditions are significantly altered by the simulated irrigation under both wet and dry conditions, but in different patterns. For the dry summer, irrigation helps strengthen the dominant continental high pressure system in the central U.S. and favors the downwind transport of moisture generated over irrigated lands, contributing to increased downwind rainfall. For the wet summer, the cyclonic vortex system is deepened by irrigation in the central U.S. along the Great Plains low-level jet corridor, enhancing rainfall locally over the heavily irrigated lands. In both cases, introducing irrigation into the model reduced overall mean biases and root-mean-square errors in the simulated daily precipitation over the entire United States. This highlights the importance of integrating anthropogenic influences on the land surface in regional climate modeling.",

            "abstract": "The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) is a space instrument that will investigate important questions about the distribution of carbon dioxide on Earth as it relates to growing urban populations and changing patterns of fossil fuel combustion. OCO-3 will explore, for the first time, daily variations in the release and uptake of carbon dioxide by plants and trees in the major tropical rainforests of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, the largest stores of aboveground carbon on our planet. NASA will develop and assemble the instrument using spare materials from OCO-2 and host the instrument on the International Space Station (ISS) (earliest launch readiness in early 2018.)\nThe low-inclination ISS orbit lets OCO-3 sample the tropics and sub-tropics across the full range of daylight hours with dense observations at northern and southern mid-latitudes (+/- 52º). At the same time, OCO-3 will also collect measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over these areas. The combination of these dense CO2 (expected to have a precision of 1 parts per mission) and SIF measurements provides continuity of data for global flux estimates as well as a unique opportunity to address key deficiencies in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. The instrument utilizes an agile, 2-axis pointing mechanism (PMA), providing the capability to look towards the bright reflection from the ocean and validation targets.\nThe PMA also allows for a snapshot mapping mode to collect dense datasets over 100km by 100km areas. Measurements over urban centers could aid in making estimates of fossil fuel CO2 emissions. This is critical because the largest urban areas (25 megacities) account for 75% of the global total fossil fuel CO2 emissions, and rapid growth (> 10% per year) is expected in developing regions over the coming 10 years.\nSimilarly, the snapshot mapping mode can be used to sample regions of interest for the terrestrial carbon cycle. For example, snapshot maps of 100km by 100km could be gathered in the Amazon or key agricultural regions. In addition, there is potential to utilize data from ISS instruments ECOSTRESS and GEDI, which measure other key variables of the control of carbon uptake by plants, to complement OCO-3 data in science analysis.\nCopyright 2015 California Institute of Technology",

            "abstract": "As large magnitude wildfires persist across the western United States, understanding their impact on hydrologic behavior and predicting regional streamflow response is increasingly important. Sediment and debris flows, as well as elevated flood levels in burned watersheds are often addressed, but wildfires also alter the timing and overall volume of both short and long-term runoff, making the prediction of post-fire streamflow critical for water resources management. Watershed models are a powerful tool for both representing wildfire runoff response and discerning the processes that induce that response. In the current study, selected wildfire-impacted basins across the western United States are modeled using the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) in order to develop a generalized approach. This distributed-parameter, physical process based watershed model allows us to target specific processes, while still having the flexibility to account for uncertainty and complex physical interactions that are not explicitly represented in model parameterization. Two change detection modeling approaches are considered. First, models calibrated using pre-fire data are applied to the post-fire period and residuals between simulated and observed flow are examined to quantify the response in each specific watershed. Here an analysis of the model’s ability to detect long-term response is also presented. Second, the post-fire conditions are modeled by adjusting appropriate parameters, and the parameter differences are used to guide process learning. In this latter method, parameters are specifically tailored to represent processes affected by wildfire, and scenarios with different parameter interactions are statistically compared. The results of these analyses are synthesized to provide a framework for predicting wildfire runoff response using PRMS, which will ultimately empower water resource decisions.",

Thus far, however, the intervention of subjectivity, such as determining the camera relative exposure value (REV) and threshold in the histogram, hindered computing accurate gap fraction. Here we propose a novel method that enables us to measure gap fraction accurately during daytime under various sky conditions by DCP. The novel method computes gap fraction using a single DCP unsaturated raw image which is corrected for scattering effects by canopies and a reconstructed sky image from the raw format image. To test the sensitivity of the novel method derived gap fraction to diverse REVs, solar zenith angles and canopy structures, we took photos in one hour interval between sunrise to midday under dense and sparse canopies with REV 0 to -5. The novel method showed little variation of gap fraction across different REVs in both dense and spares canopies across diverse range of solar zenith angles. The perforated panel experiment, which was used to test the accuracy of the estimated gap fraction, confirmed that the novel method resulted in the accurate and consistent gap fractions across different hole sizes, gap fractions and solar zenith angles. These findings highlight that the novel method opens new opportunities to estimate gap fraction accurately during daytime from sparse to dense canopies, which will be useful in monitoring LAI precisely and validating satellite remote sensing LAI products efficiently.

We present an analysis of the area and magnetic signatures of the filament and suspected hole, as well as solar wind data. Multiple EUV channels from SDO/AIA are combined with magnetograms from SDO/HMI and the GONG network to quantify the evolution of this event. Another ephemeral coronal hole from June 2015 is used a comparison. Results from this analysis show that the 2010 event was not an ephemeral coronal hole, but rather a solar ‘hiccup’ – the attempted, and failed, formation of a small coronal hole. While the reasons behind the failure remain speculative, these findings show that a lot of potential lies in future research of this event – in observing the interactions between the hole and the filament, and our continued understanding of the formation and characteristics of coronal holes.",

            "abstract": "Fault zones consist of a fault core and a surrounding damage zone. Fault zones are typically characterized by the presence of many healed surfaces, the strength of which is unknown. If a healed fault recovers its strength such that its cohesion is equal to or greater than that of the host rock, repeated cycles of fracture and healing may be one mechanism producing wide fault zones. I present laboratory evidence supporting the strength recovery of healed fault surface, obtained by AE monitoring, strain measurements and X-ray CT techniques. The loading experiment was performed with a specimen collected from an exhumed fault zone. Healed surfaces of the rock sample were interpreted to be parallel to slip surfaces. The specimen was a cylinder with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm long. The long axis of the specimen was inclined with respect to the orientation of the healed surfaces. The compression test used a constant loading rate under 50 MPa of confining pressure. Macroscopic failure occurred when the applied differential stress reached 439 MPa. The macro-fracture surface created during the experiment was very close to the preexisting plane. The AE hypocenters closely match the locations of the preexisting healed surface and the new fault plane. The experiment also revealed details of the initial stage of fault development. The new fault zone developed near, but not precisely on the preexisting healed fault plane. An area of heterogeneous structure where stress appears to have concentrated, was where the AEs began, and it was also where the fracture started. This means that the healed surface was not a weak surface and that healing strengthened the fault such that its cohesion was equal to or greater than that of the intact host rock. These results suggest that repeated cycles of fracture and healing may be the main mechanism creating wide fault zones with multiple fault cores and damage zones.",

Key Laboratory for Urban Habitat Environmental Science and Technology, School of Environment and Energy, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China\nAbstract：The coupling of a Thermal Denuder (TD) with a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was used in Xianghe, which is a regional background site in North China, during June - July, 2013 to on-line measure the mass concentrations and semi-volatilities of atmospheric submicron particles, including organic matter (OM), SO42- , NO3-, NH4+, and Cl-. The total PM1 mass concentration measured was averagely (47.9±47.3) mg/m3 during the campaign, with OM accounting for 38.2% of the total PM1 mass, followed by SO42- (33.7%), NH4+ (13.8%), NO3- (12.3%), and Cl- (2.0%). It was found that NO3- and Cl- had the highest semi-volatility, with about 60% of them evaporating into the gas phase by increasing the temperature to 50 °C, while SO42- showed the lowest semi-volatility, with almost 90% of its mass remaining in the particle phase at 50 °C. The semi-volatility of OM and NH4+ was at the middle level. The semi-volatility of NO3- was affected by the pollution level of the atmospheric submicron particles since it showed an increasing trend with the increasing of PM1 at 50 °C. The oxygen-to-carbon ration of organic aerosol was 0.47 to 0.60 by increasing the temperature from 50 ℃ to 200 °C. In addition, the semi-volatility of the PM1 species with vacuum aerodynamic diameters of 60-2000 nm was little size dependent. The calculation based on the high-resolution mass spectra of OM showed that CO2+-containing organic species had lower semi-volatility, while C4H9+-containing organic species had higher semi-volatility. The semi-volatility of OM was found to be negatively related to its oxidation state. The quantitative result of atmospheric submicron particles’ semi-volatility is essential to the research of the physicochemical properties and pollution mechanism of particles as well as the validation of the air quality models.",

            "abstract": "An L-shaped array of three-component short period seismic stations was deployed at the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica approximately 100 km south of the ice edge, near 180° longitude, from November 18 through 28, 2014. Polarization analysis of data from these stations clearly shows propagating waves from below the ice shelf for frequencies below 2 Hz. Energy above 2 Hz is dominated by Rayleigh and Love waves propagating from the north. Frequency-slowness plots were calculated using beamforming. Resulting Love and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves were inverted for the shear wave velocity profile, from which we derive a density profile. The derived shear wave velocity profiles differ within the firn for the inversions using Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves. This difference is attributed to an effective anisotropy due to fine layering. The layered structure of firn, ice, water, and ocean floor results in a characteristic dispersion curve pattern below 7 Hz. We investigate the observed structures in more detail by forward modeling of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves for representative firn, ice, water, sediment structures. Rayleigh waves are observed when wavelengths are long enough to span the distance from the ice shelf surface to the seafloor. Our results show that the analysis of high frequency Rayleigh waves on an ice shelf has the ability to resolve ice shelf thickness, water column thickness, and the physical properties of the underlying ocean floor using passive-source seismic data.",

            "abstract": "Within the portfolio of risk assessment strategies for carbon capture and sequestration projects, numerical modeling and simulation is frequently utilized for predicting CO2 storage capacity, leakage potential, and geomechanical reservoir integrity. In numerical CO2 injection models, one commonly used approach for simulating the effects of relative permeability (krel) is to apply the van Genuchten (1980) model to the wetting phase and the Corey (1954) model to the non-wetting phase. In this formulation, wetting phase permeability decay is controlled by a phase interference parameter (m), and non-wetting phase permeability decay is controlled by irreducible non-wetting phase saturation (Sgr). Although krel is a well-known phenomenon, there exists much uncertainty in parameterizing krel models and little is known about the influence of parameter space on reservoir performance. This work presents results from a numerical modeling experiment designed to isolate the effects of variability in krel parameters, m and Sgr. A series of CO2 injection simulations is performed for 399 unique combinations of m and Sgr, which vary systematically over a range of 0.1 – 0.99 and 0.01 – 0.50, respectively. CO2 is injected at modest 2.78 kg/s for 10 years into a radially symmetric grid using a beta version of TOUGH3/ECO2N, and all reservoir properties remain constant across the ensemble of 399 simulations. Results from this work show the injection pressure response ranging from ~10 MPa to >60 MPa, where the high end of this range is focused on a narrow portion of the parameter space corresponding to m < 0.3 for all Sgr. Additionally, the maximum CO2 plume radius (defined as CO2 saturation > 0.01) ranges from 550 m to 1250 m, where the high end of this range corresponds with low m and low Sgr. Although the model geometry is quite simple, these results demonstrate enormous variability in the both injection pressure and CO2 plume dimension solely as a function of krel.",

In order to improve COMS LST accuracy, Cho et al. (2015) developed six types of LST retrieval equations (CSW_v2.0) by considering temperature lapse rate and water vapor/aerosol effect. Similar to CSW_v1.0, the LST retrieved by CSW_v2.0 had a correlation coefficient of 0.99 with the prescribed LST and the root mean square error (RMSE) improved from 1.41 K to 1.39 K. However, CSW_v2.0 showed relatively poor performance, in particular, the temperature lapse rate is certainly large (superadiabatic cases during daytime or strong inversion cases during early morning). In this study, we upgraded the CSW_v2.0 by considering diurnal variations of boundary layer temperature to reduce the relatively large errors under the large lapse rate conditions. To achieve the goals, the diurnal variations of air temperature along with the land surface temperature are included during radiative transfer simulations for the generation of the pseudo-match-up database. The preliminary analysis results showed that RMSE and bias are reduced from 1.39K to 1.14K and from -0.03K to -0.01K. In this presentation, we will show the detailed results of LST retrieval using new algorithms according to the viewing geometry, temperature lapse rate condition, and water vapour amount along with the intercomparison results with MODIS LST data.",

            "abstract": "Updraft speeds of thermals have always been difficult to measure, despite significant roles they play in transporting pollutants and in cloud formation and precipitation. To our knowledge, no attempt to date has been made to estimate updraft speed from satellite information in the boundary layer and at the cloud base. In this study, we introduce two methods of retrieving the maximum updraft (Wmax) and updraft at cloud base (Wb) in the planetary boundary layer topped by convective clouds. The first method uses ground-air temperature difference to characterize the surface sensible heat flux, which is found to be correlated with updraft speeds measured by the Doppler lidar over the Southern Great Plains (SGP). Based on the relationship, we use the satellite-retrieved surface skin temperature and reanalysis surface air temperature to estimate the updrafts. The second method is based on a good linear correlation between cloud base height and updrafts, which was found over the SGP, the central Amazon, and on board a ship sailing between Honolulu and Los Angeles. We found a universal relationship for both land and ocean. The performance of these two methods of retrieving updrafts was tested against the lidar and Radar measurements with good agreements found for both methods. Compared with the first method that only works over land, the second method expands its applicability to ocean and is more accurate in retrieving Wmax the with RMSE (root-mean-square error) = 0.38 m/s and MAPE (mean-absolute-percentage-error) = 19%, and Wb with RMSE = 0.34 m/s and MAPE = 21%.",

Research to date indicates that the hydrologic feedback between water table depth and peat accumulation is fundamentally similar across tropical peatlands, but peat accumulation and fluxes cannot always be spatially uniform across the landscape because peat accumulates in domes. We show that upscaling from local measurements to landscape fluxes of CO2 and CH4 requires (1) sampling in both the growing interiors and the static margins of peat domes, and (2) use of topographical data from the peatland. Similarly, inference of past carbon sequestration from dated peat cores requires a model for the partitioning of peatlands into domes by drainage networks.",

            "abstract": "The vertical distribution of dust in the Martian atmosphere has been a topic of discussion in the recent years. Measurements by limb sounding instruments like the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) and the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) indicate that atmospheric dust is not homogeneously distributed in the vertical but exhibits layering in the lower atmosphere. Recent retrievals from TES measurements also suggest a dust maximum higher in the atmosphere that predominantly occurs at 50-60 km altitude on the daytime hemisphere. We use new retrievals from MCS measurements to investigate this deduction.\nMCS is a mid- and far-infrared thermal emission radiometer on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It measures radiances in limb and on-planet viewing geometries. From these radiance measurements, profiles of atmospheric temperature, dust and water ice are retrieved from the surface to ~80 km altitude with a vertical resolution of ~5 km. Updates to the retrieval algorithm yield improved representations of aerosols above ~40 km altitude. The sensitivity of an MCS limb measurement to aerosols at these altitudes is typically not limited by signal-to-noise but rather by the uncertainties in the representation of the instrument's vertical field-of-view, the far wings of which can provide radiance contributions from the lower atmosphere and the surface. Sensitivity studies suggest that radiances attributed to dust in the middle atmosphere are a consequence of these far wing effects.\nOur results do not support the existence of widespread dust in the middle atmosphere of Mars inferred from earlier observations. The average dust extinction does not exceed 10-6 km-1 at 463 cm-1 above 50 km altitude in atmospheric conditions without large dust storms.",

Usually the underwriters such as regional, national or international organizations, banks or (re)insurance companies hold these risk portfolios. The micro-level insurance contracts when aggregated at state, country or regional level, could potentially pose significant systemic risk due to tail dependency, micro-correlation and fat-tail nature of the damage, threatening the survival of this micro-financial risk management sector, ultimately impeding the sustainable development goals. Analyzing the observed inter-annual variability of the tropical climate system, this paper identifies the physical mechanisms for heterogeneous climatic response and suggests that diversification opportunity exists across different regions and seasons.\nTaking two case studies from tropical Africa, an empirical analysis is done to highlight that El Niño modulates the number of wet days in an opposite way across the two regions and seasons, suggesting the possibility of diversification of the index insurance portfolios across regions and seasons. Specifically, El Niño is associated with drier condition over Sahel, while it is associated with wetter condition over Tropical Eastern Africa (TEA), during their respective Jul-Aug-Sep and Oct-Nov-Dec rainy seasons. Such contrasting modulation in the number of wet days can be understood by the phase relationship between the local rainy season and El Niño evolution stage. The transient phase of El Niño, which is in phase with the rainy season (Jul-Sep) over Sahel, is characterized by tropospheric stability induced by tropospheric warming without regional North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) adjustment. In contrast, the mature phase of El Niño is in phase with the short rainy season (Oct-Dec) over TEA, and is characterized by adjusted warmer regional Indian Ocean SST and increased onshore- advection of moisture from the Indian Ocean.",

The simulation results of HadGEM2-AO provided from NIMR/KMA were used as boundary data for RCMs. In general, the five RCMs well simulated the spatial/seasonal variations for thetemperature and precipitation. In particular, the simulation skills of RCMs were clearly improved in both temperature and precipitation compared with that of HadGEM2-AO. However, their simulation skills had systematic error although the magnitudes of error were dependent on the RCMs, variables, seasons, and locations. The simple ensemble reduced the model biases, but most of the systematic biases were still remained. On the other hand, the weighted ensemble averaging using Taylor's skill score (WEA_Tay) clearly reduced the biases irrespective of variables and seasons in terms of mean climate. The temperature over NEA region in the late 21st century is projected to increase irrespective of locations, scenarios (+1.96~+4.85℃), and seasons with more warming at northern part of model domain. On the other hand, the precipitation changes are depended on the locations, scenarios and seasons. More detailed results for climate changes in the late 21st century under 4 RCP scenarios by five RCMs and ensembles will be discussed in presentation.",

If the calibration is performed in a Bayesian manner, where the parameters are estimated as probability density functions, one practical approach is to first construct statistical emulators of CLM4 such that fearsome cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solutions could be accommodated. On the other hand, it is often impossible to construct an accurate emulator when the CLM4 output of interest shows a complex behavior in the parameter space. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a multi-chain, parallel MCMC method to calibrate CLM4 without the use of emulators.

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, China have been facing extreme particulate matter (PM) pollution problems due to the combination of fast increase of population, industrialization, urbanization and associated energy consumption and lagging of sufficient emission control measures. Studies have identified the major components of fine PM (PM2.5) in China include primary PM (which is directly emitted into the atmosphere), sulfate and nitrate (which are mainly secondary PM, i.e., formed from gaseous precursors), and organic aerosols (which can be primary or secondary). Contributions of different source sectors to the different PM components are substantially different; therefore source apportionment of these components can provide critical information needed for policy makers to design effective emission control strategies.\nIn the current study, a source-oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that directly tracks the contributions from multiple emission sources to primary and secondary PM2.5 is developed, and then applied to determine the regional contributions of power, industry, transportation and residential sectors to primary PM, nitrate and sulfate concentrations in China. Four months in 2012-2013 are simulated to predict the seasonal variations of source contributions. Model predictions are evaluated with ambient measured concentrations. The source-oriented CMAQ model is capable of reproducing most of the available PM10 and PM2.5 mass, and PM2.5 EC, POC, nitrate and sulfate observations. Predicted source contributions for EC also generally agree with to the source contributions estimated by receptor models reported in previous studies. Model predictions suggest residential is a major contributor to primary PM (30-70%) in the spring and winter, and industrial contributes 40-60% of primary PM in the summer and fall; Transportation is an important source for EC (20-30%); Power sector is the dominating source of nitrate and sulfate in both winter and summer, transportation sector is an important source of nitrate (20–30%), and industry sector contributes 20–30% to nitrate and sulfate.",

            "abstract": "Drought is an insidious natural hazard, which may cause severe damage both in natural environment and human society. Timely drought forecasting enables civil protection authorities and public to take actions to reduce the risk of droughts. Thus drought forecasting plays an important role in setting out drought mitigation strategy. Analysis of the dominant oscillations of droughts and large-scale climate indices has shown that climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are significant indicators of drought occurrences in southern United States. It suggests that the climate indices may be used in drought forecasting at a long lead time. In this study, the multi-channel entropy spectral analysis (MCESA) was developed to incorporate the ENSO climate signals to entropy approach for long-term drought forecasting. To focus on the lack of surface water, drought was quantified by standardized streamflow index (SSI) in this study. SSI time series turned out to be stationary and highly autocorrelated, which showed significant 12-month periodicity. As a result, SSI was successfully forecasted using MCESA with ENSO as an indicator for lead times of 4-6 years. The drought forecasting was more reliable for the stations in humid areas than arid areas. Comparison from the retrospective drought forecasts with or without ENSO showed that inclusion of ENSO climate signals reduced the forecasting errors. The forecasts under El Nino (La Nina) condition reduced (increased) drought severity, making the forecasts more accurate.",

            "abstract": "Gaseous elemental and oxidized mercury (Hg) fluxes were measured in a laboratory setting from substrate materials derived from industrial-scale open pit gold mining operations in Nevada, USA. Mercury is present in these substrates at a range of concentrations (10 - 40000 ng g-1), predominantly of local geogenic origin in association with the mineralized gold ores, but altered and redistributed to a varying degree by subsequent ore extraction and processing operations, including deposition of Hg recently emitted to the atmosphere from large point sources on the mines. Waste rock, heap leach, and tailings material usually comprise the most extensive and Hg emission relevant substrate surfaces. All three of these material types were collected from active Nevada mine sites in 2010 for previous research, and have since been stored undisturbed at the University of Nevada, Reno. Gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) flux was previously measured from these materials under a variety of conditions, and was re-measured in this study, using Teflon® flux chambers and Tekran® 2537A automated ambient air analyzers. GEM flux from dry undisturbed materials was comparable between the two measurement periods. Gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) flux from these materials was quantified using an active filter sampling method that consisted of polysulfone cation-exchange membranes deployed in conjunction with the GEM flux apparatus. Initial measurements conducted within greenhouse laboratory space indicate that in dry conditions GOM is deposited to relatively low Hg cap and leach materials, but may be emitted from the much higher Hg concentration tailings material.",

What changes in the North American carbon balance should be updated with a SOCCR-2? This presentation will review what we know about the North American carbon cycle today that might diverge from our state of knowledge at the time of SOCCR-1, focusing especially on atmospheric methods for assessing the carbon cycle. Atmospheric methods were not utilized in SOCCR-1; I will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of including these methods in SOCCR-2. Further, I will discuss the degree to which we currently have the capacity to detect changes in important components of the North American carbon cycle, focusing primarily on atmospheric methods. Finally, I will suggest high priorities for research that could fill the gaps in our ability to detect and understand changes in important components of the North American carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "In this study, utilizing depth-sensitivity of interferometric waveforms recorded by co-located Hi-net and KiK-net sensors, we separate the responsible depth of seismic velocity change associated with the M6.3 earthquake occurred on November 22, 2014, in central Japan. The Hi-net station N.MKGH is located about 20 km northeast from the epicenter, where the seismometer is installed at the 150 m depth. At the same site, the KiK-net has two strong motion seismometers installed at the depths of 0 and 150 m. To estimate average velocity change around the N.MKGH station, we apply the stretching technique to auto-correlation function (ACF) of ambient noise recorded by the Hi-net sensor. To evaluate sensitivity of the Hi-net ACF to velocity change above and below the 150 m depth, we perform a numerical wave propagation simulation using 2-D FDM. To obtain velocity change above the 150 m depth, we measure response waveform from the depths of 150 m to 0 m by computing deconvolution function (DCF) of earthquake records obtained by the two KiK-net vertical array sensors. The background annual velocity variation is subtracted from the detected velocity change. From the KiK-net DCF records, the velocity reduction ratio above the 150 m depth is estimated to be 4.2 % and 3.1 % in the periods of 1-7 days and 7 days - 4 months after the mainshock, respectively. From the Hi-net ACF records, the velocity reduction ratio is estimated to be 2.2 % and 1.8 % in the same time periods, respectively. This difference in the estimated velocity reduction ratio is attributed to depth-dependence of the velocity change. By using the depth sensitivity obtained from the numerical simulation, we estimate the velocity reduction ratio below the 150 m depth to be lower than 1.0 % for both time periods. Thus the significant velocity reduction and recovery are observed above the 150 m depth only, which may be caused by strong ground motion of the mainshock and following healing in the shallow ground.",

            "abstract": "Space borne gravity measurements collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have proven applicable in studying a wide variety of topics such as groundwater levels, glacial isostatic adjustment, ocean bottom pressure, sea level rise, and mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets. Due to GRACE's spatial resolution and associated leakage, applications have been limited to broad regional locations. Recent studies have improved upon the accuracy and spatial resolution to generate an orthogonal, band-limited basis over the particular region of interest, using an approach known as the Slepian basis method. While this and other GRACE based methods have been conducted over Greenland and Antarctica for mass balance estimations, little research has been devoted to measure mass variations of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). Because of Baffin and Ellesmere's proximity to Greenland and the spatial resolution of GRACE, observed signal from the CAA glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet blend together. Preliminary results using a point source method indicate upwards of 850 Gt mass loss in the CAA between March 2002 and May 2015 with an average rate of about -70 Gt/yr. We leverage the Slepian basin approach and exploit the updated ICE-6G glacial isostatic adjustment model to better differentiate between these two signal sources and estimate the mass balance of the Canadian Arctic Islands with greater confidence and a higher accuracy. This improved determination of regional mass balance better constrains CAA's contribution to global sea level rise and the methods developed here can be employed in other locations and processes of interest.",

            "abstract": "Over the 21st century, the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean North Atlantic storm track changes are projected to undergo an overall poleward intensification and eastward extension. However, considerable spread exists with regard to how individual CMIP5 models represent the magnitude and structure of these storm track changes. In this study, we examine the extent to which ocean forcing affects the ability of CMIP5 models to simulate the behavior of the North Atlantic storm tracks under future climate change scenarios. Emphasis is placed on investigating projected changes within the NorESM/CESM family of models. Despite similarities between the atmospheric models, the projected lower tropospheric storm track changes are markedly different between the coupled CMIP5 output from CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, NorESM1-M. A suite of AGCM experiments are used to evaluate the sensitivity of the North Atlantic storm tracks to different CMIP5 realizations of projected changes in: 1) SSTs across the North Atlantic and 2) SSTs across the globe. Unlike the upper tropospheric storm track changes, which are strongly influenced by remote SST changes, the lower tropospheric North Atlantic storm tracks are linked to changes in local SST and attendant surface baroclinicity. However, the atmospheric responses in the AGCM simulations are dependent on the choice of the atmospheric model: CAM5 simulations exhibit a higher sensitivity to the underlying SST conditions than CAM4. Analysis will focus on the physical mechanisms through which SST drive the low-level storm track changes. We will also examine the influence of direct radiative forcing associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on our AGCM simulations.",

            "abstract": "We study the influence of interplanetary (IP) shock impact angles in the shock geoeffectiveness focusing on simulations and observations. In our simulations, we use OpenGGCM simulations to study the magnetospheric and ionospheric responses to shock impacts. Three cases are presented here: two inclined shocks, with 3.7 and 7.4 Mach numbers, and a frontal shock, whose shock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with Mach number of 7.4. We find that, in the two inclined cases, due to the north-south asymmetry, the magnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The geomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the other hand, in the head-on case, the magnetotail is compressed from both sides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm. By comparing the strong inclined shock and the frontal shock, we find that, despite the inclined shock having a larger Mach number, the frontal shock leads to a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, we conclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness, depending on their shock normal orientation. In our observational study, we present a survey of IP shocks at 1 AU using Wind and ACE satellite data from Jan 1995 to Dec 2013 to study the same shock-related effects. A shock list covering one and a half solar cycle is compiled. We use data from SuperMAG, a large chain with more than 300 geomagnetic stations, to study geoeffectiveness triggered by IP shocks. The SuperMAG SML index (enhanced AL index), is used to quantify substorm strength. The jumps of the SML index triggered by shock impacts is investigated in terms of shock orientation and speed. We find that, in general, strong and almost frontal shocks are more geoeffective than inclined shocks with low speed. The highest correlations (R = 0.78) occurs for fixed shock speed and varying the shock impact angle. We attribute this result, predicted previously by simulations, to the fact that frontal shocks compress the magnetosphere symmetrically from all sides, which contributes to the release of magnetic energy stored in the tail, which in turn can produce moderate to strong auroral substorms, which are then observed by ground based magnetometers. These results confirm our previous numerical simulations.",

These higher temperatures create the potential for geothermal electrical energy production at shallower depths. A heat transport fluid is required to bring the geothermal heat to the surface. The heat transport fluid must demonstrate a low affinity for mineral dissolution and precipitation to avoid dissolving the formation and clogging the piping material. Our project aims to evaluate a geothermal system consisting of two boreholes within the geological setting of the Canadian part of the Williston Basin. A saturated MgCl2-brine is used to transport heat.\nSophisticated numerical modelling with a reactive transport model is used to evaluate MgCl2-brine as a heat exchange fluid in a halite dominated formation. Since solubility is temperature dependent, the model needs to simulate the dissolution and precipitation of salt minerals due to temperature change. Preliminary results, completed under equilibrium conditions suggest a 90°C range where dissolution and deposition will be slow. These temperatures fall within the 80 to 130°C range present in the salt formations.",

            "abstract": "Jovian satellite Europa has one of the youngest surfaces in the solar system, with an average surface age of ~60 Ma and an abundance of recent resurfacing features. This young age, coupled with strong evidence for a ~100- km-deep ocean beneath its icy shell, is suggestive of ongoing or periodic endogenic activity. The Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System (E-THEMIS) instrument, selected for the upcoming Europa mission, has a primary science goal of detecting and characterizing thermal anomalies in the surface units that may be indicative of recent resurfacing or active venting. The E-THEMIS instrument will have a spatial resolution of up to 5 x 22 m from an altitude of 25 km, and a precision of 0.1-0.2 K, with an accuracy of 1-2.2 K from 220 K to 90 K, respectively. This will allow confident detection of thermal anomalies that are ~2 K warmer than their surroundings. In this presentation, I will summarize the current state of knowledge of endogenic activity on Europa, present modeling results of surface temperature expressions of various types of possible thermal anomalies, and make predictions for the detections possible with E-THEMIS, and discuss what these detections would reveal about Europa's surface and subsurface properties and processes. Particular attention will be given to differentiating between thermal signatures due to surface properties versus endogenic activity. Model predictions will include predicted surface temperature expressions for active chaos regions, active vents, sub-ice lakes, and warm ice or liquid water erupted onto the surface. Both steady-state and transient models have been developed, allowing an estimate for the time a thermal anomaly remains detectable after active processes cease. The models include heat transfer by conduction, convection (in liquid water), and radiation (at the surface), the latent heat of fusion, depth- and temperature- dependent thermophysical parameters, subsurface absorption of sunlight with exponential decay in absorption with depth, variation in insolation with time, and cooling by sublimation of surface volatiles. Specific model-based predictions for E-THEMIS will be presented, based on the expected surface temperatures, size of the anomaly, and spacecraft distance from target.",

First, we discuss a dropout of outer belt energetic electron fluxes corresponding to the arrival of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) followed by a corotating stream in September 2014. Second, we discuss the reformation of the outer radiation belt that began on September 22nd. We find that the arrival of the ICME and the corotating interaction region that preceded the stream cause a long-duration (many day) dropout of high-energy electrons. The recovery in radiation belt fluxes only begins when the high-speed stream begins to develop IMF Bz fluctuations and auroral activity resumes. Furthermore, during periods in which several consecutive solar wind structures appear, the first structure primes the outer radiation belt prior to the interaction of the subsequent solar wind structures with the magnetosphere. Consequently, the evolution of the outer radiation belt through the solar cycle is significantly affected by the dominant structure of each phase of the cycle. We use energetic electron and magnetic field observations provided by the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS, and GOES missions.",

This article reports a new finding: enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic (TA)-SST and the WNPSH after the late 1970s. Regression study suggests that the warm TA-SST produced a zonally overturning circulation anomaly, with descending over the central equatorial Pacific and ascending over the tropical Atlantic/eastern Pacific. The anomalous descending over the central equatorial Pacific likely induced low-level anticyclonic anomaly to the west and therefore enhanced the WNPSH.\nOne implication of this new finding is for predictability. The well-known “spring predictability barrier” (i.e., the influence of El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) falls dramatically during boreal spring) does not apply to the TA-SST/WNPSH relationship. Conversely, the TA-SST shows consistently high correlation starting from boreal spring when the ENSO influence continues declining. The TA-SST pushes the predictability of the WNPSH in boreal summer approximately one season earlier to boreal spring.",

            "abstract": "The Southern California coastal region has a temperate climate, however, there are days with extreme heating where temperatures may reach above 37°C, stressing the region’s power grid, leading to health issues, and creating environments susceptible to fires. These extreme localized heating events occur over a short period, from a few hours to one to two days and may or may not occur in conjunction with high winds. The Santa Ana winds are a well-studied example of this type of phenomena. On September 27, 2010, Los Angeles, CA (LA), reached a record maximum temperature of 45°C during an extreme heating event that was not a Santa Ana event. We analyzed the event using observations, reanalysis data, and mesoscale simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to understand the mechanisms of extreme heating and provide guidance on forecasting similar events.\nOn 26 September 2010, a large synoptic ridge overturned and broke over the midwestern United States (US), driving momentum and internal energy to the southwest. A large pool of hot air at mid-levels over the four-corners region also shifted west, moving into southern California by 26 September. This hot air resided over the LA basin, just above the surface, by 00 GMT on 27 September. At this time, the pressure gradient at low levels was weak. Based on WRF model and wind profiler/RASS observations, we propose that separate mountain-plains solenoids (MPS) occurred on both 26 and 27 of September. The MPS on 26 September moved the hot air into place just above the surface over the LA basin. Overnight, the hot air is trapped near the surface due to the action of gravity waves in conjunction with orographic density currents and remnant migrating solenoids that form over the mountains surrounding LA. When the MPS forms during the late morning on the 27th, the descending return branch flow plus surface sensible heating creates a mechanism to move the heat to the surface, leading to record temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The mean state and variability of the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are of great interest because of the region's role in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global climate. We investigated changes in thermocline structure between the Late Holocene (LH) and LGM with stable isotopes of planktonic foraminifera in sediment cores from the Galápagos. We measured δ18O in two species—Globigerinoides ruber, inhabiting the surface mixed layer, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, inhabiting the deep thermocline—in order to evaluate the vertical temperature contrast between the two species. We also measured δ18O of individual N. dutertrei from modern (late 20th century) and LGM sediments in order to assess thermocline temperature variability related to ENSO activity.\nOur data indicate a reduced vertical contrast in the upper ocean during the LGM, which is most consistent with a deeper thermocline and thicker mixed layer. Additionally, δ18O of individual N. dutertrei shells shows 2.5 times greater population variance in the LGM than in the modern sample. This large variance indicates that thermocline temperatures were more variable during the LGM than today, consistent with more active ENSO. Together, these results imply that the mean state of the EEP was characterized by a deeper thermocline and greater ENSO variability. The results further show the potential for reconstructing ENSO variability from deep-sea sediments of the EEP, where other geological archives of ENSO are currently extremely limited.",

            "abstract": "The radiation environment on the Martian surface is significantly different from that on earth. Existing observation and studies reveal that the radiation environment on the Martian surface is highly variable regarding to both short- and long-term time scales. For example, its dose rate presents diurnal and seasonal variations associated with atmospheric pressure changes. Moreover, dose rate is also strongly influenced by the modulation from GCR flux. Numerical simulation and theoretical explanations are required to understand the mechanisms behind these features, and to predict the time variation of radiation environment on the Martian surface if aircraft is supposed to land on it in near future.\nThe high energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) which are ubiquitous throughout the solar system are highly penetrating and extremely difficult to shield against beyond the Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetosphere. The goal of this article is to evaluate the long term radiation risk on the Martian surface. Therefore, we need to develop a realistic time-dependent GCR model, which will be integrated with Geant4 transport code subsequently to reproduce the observed variation of surface dose rate associated with the changing heliospheric conditions. In general, the propagation of cosmic rays in the interplanetary medium can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation (or Parker equation). In last decade,we witnessed a fast development of GCR transport models within the heliosphere based on accurate gas-dynamic and MHD backgrounds from global models of the heliosphere. The global MHD simulation produces a more realistic pattern of the 3-D heliospheric structure, as well as the interface between the solar system and the surrounding interstellar space. As a consequence, integrating plasma background obtained from global-dependent 3-D MHD simulation and stochastic Parker transport simulation, we expect to produce an accurate global physical-based GCR modulation model. Combined with the Geant4 transport code, this GCR model will provide valuable insight into the long-term dose rates variation on the Martian surface.",

            "abstract": "The St. Elias Mountains in Southeastern Alaska are an active orogen that host temperate marine glaciers. Here, ice streams advancing across the continental shelf during glacial periods create wide shelf-crossing troughs and deliver large sediment volumes directly to the shelf edge, and from there to the continental slope and the deep sea Surveyor Fan. The continental slope exhibits steep morphology (~10°-30°), controlled by the Transition Fault, a transform boundary between the Yakutat micro-plate and the Pacific plate. Prior statistical analysis of continental slope morphology indicates that these steep initial slope conditions have been modified by proximal sedimentation during repeated glacial advances. Downslope of the Yakutat Sea Valley an incipient trough-mouth fan exists while between the troughs and downslope of the Alsek Sea Valley sediment slope-bypass dominates. Seismic analysis indicates that the Yakutat margin has seen significant slope sedimentation since the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation ~2.6 Ma, but it is only recently that sufficient sediment supply has existed to overwhelm the steep margin topography and form the young trough-mouth fan. The mid-Pleistocene climate transition at ~1 Ma, and its associated shift from 41Kyr to 100Kyr glacial-interglacial climate cycles, could have potentially allowed sustained ice stream advances to the shelf edge and associated high proximal sedimentation on the continental slope. Integration of seismic data and newly obtained age constraints from recent IODP cores allows for investigation into the timing of Yakutat trough-mouth fan sedimentation and its relation to climate transitions.",

            "abstract": "We examine broadband (15 – 450 Hz) seismic data from the well-studied Erlenbach stream in the Swiss Prealps, where discharge, precipitation, and bedload transport are independently constrained during flood events. We perform a general linear least squares inversion of seismic data, exploiting times with isolated discharge or rain events, to identify the spectral signals of water turbulence and raindrop impacts. This, in turn, allows us to remove the contributions of turbulence and rainfall from the seismic spectra, thereby isolating the signal of bedload transport. We use one storm to calibrate the regression for bedload transport, then use this regression along with precipitation and discharge data to predict bedload transport rates for the remainder of the two-month campaign.\nOur predicted bedload transport rates correlate well with transport rates from calibrated geophones embedded in the channel (r2~0.6, p<<10-5). We also find that rain generates a roughly broadband seismic spectrum, while water turbulence and sediment transport exhibit power primarily in lower frequency bands (<100 Hz), due in part to different attenuation path lengths. We use the varying attenuation of water turbulence and bedload transport spectra to infer the locations of the primary sources generating each signal: a downstream waterfall, and the channel bed near the seismometers, respectively. Our results indicate that deconstruction of seismic signals from rivers can provide insight into the component signals generated by water turbulence, rain, and sediment transport. Further, we find that regression of seismic spectra with precipitation, discharge and bedload transport data for a single calibration period enables the estimation of transport for subsequent periods with only precipitation, discharge and seismic data. Since precipitation and discharge are significantly easier to monitor than transport, this represents a potential application for in-field monitoring of bedload activity.",

Ordos plateau, located in the western portion of the North China craton, is a uniquely stable terrane in Asia. However, Weihe-shanxi graben and Yinchuan-hetao graben systems, around the Ordos plateau, present high-level seismic activities. We deployed a dense seismic array composed of 650 temporal stations in and around the Ordos plateau recently. The seismic array provides a good opportunity to study the deep structure and further look into its relationship with the mechanism of the seismicity differences in these areas. In this study, we applied the tomographic inversion method to determine the 3-D Vp structures of the upper mantle and transition zone beneath the Ordos plateau and the surrounding areas with teleseismic data. We have selected 2252 teleseismic events with high signal-to-noise ratio from 2006 to 2014. P-wave arrival times were extracted using waveform cross-correlation method for each earthquake. Then we calculated the relative residuals as the input data for the teleseismic inversion. The relative travel time residual was calculated from the individual station residual by removing the average residual for each event. Through the detailed deep structure obtained by the teleseismic inversion, we find out that low velocity structures in the upper mantle around the Ordos plateau probably have great influence on the occurrence of the destructive earthquakes around the Ordos plateau. Besides, the upper mantle velocity structure in the southern margin of the Ordos plateau which differs from that in other parts around the Ordos plateau may cause seismicity difference in this area.",

Because deep mixed layers can transport phytoplankton below the euphotic zone, light levels depend on mixed-layer depth (MLD), and phytoplankton growth is hypothesized to be co-limited by iron and light. Estimates of Chl-a fluorescence, particle backscattering and hydrographic profiles collected by southern elephant seals, EM-APEX, and biogeochemical Argo floats are used to evaluate the extent to which MLD influences phytoplankton bloom development and the vertical structure of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the Southern Ocean. We find that surface Chl-a (i.e., mean Chl-a for the upper light penetration depth) is a relatively good proxy of phytoplankton biomass (i.e., depth-integrated Chl-a) within the euphotic zone but gives an inadequate representation of biomass within the mixed layer, particularly in the summer. Although nearly vertically homogeneous Chl-a within the mixed layer prevails in seasonal mean profiles, subsurface Chl-a maxima are not uncommon from spring through fall. Deep Chl-a maxima that correlate with particle backscattering in summer and fall are found near the base of the mixed layer, closer to the nutrient maximum than the light maximum, suggesting that nutrient limitation (i.e., essentially iron) can play a greater role than light limitation in governing productivity.",

            "abstract": "Modeling the progression of the magnetotail configuration during a substorm growth phase is challenging because the current sheet becomes very thin, and is difficult to resolve while keeping the problem computationally tractable. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models have dealt with this problem in various ways, and many claim to be driven by physical rather than numerical considerations. The Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) is not an MHD model, and has advantages and disadvantages compared to MHD. The notable advantages are the characterization of the full energy distribution of the plasma (including the associated gradient/curvature drift), as well as its generally more comprehensive treatment of the electrodynamics of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The disadvantages include the bounce-averaging of plasma drift, which limits the domain to closed field lines, and the assumption of slow flow relative to the Alfvén speed. The RCM-E has been used in the past to model a substorm growth phase, but its assumptions do not allow it to properly treat the onset mechanism or the formation of x-lines. It can simulate the approach to onset, but is limited by its ability to resolve the thinning current sheet. In this presentation, we present advances in the technique used to calculate the self-consistent magnetic field, which allows us to resolve thinner current sheets than were previously possible. We combine this with a generalized ballooning mode analysis of specific flux tubes in order to assess the stability of the magnetotail to substorm onset.",

Also, the NPK value of the sorghum tissue was tested by Clemson Agriculture Center. After the first harvest, the result showed that the height of above ground biomass under the nanoparticles stress was higher than that of control group.

            "abstract": "Understanding spatial patterns and variability in the distribution of snow is critical in determining the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. For snowmelt hydrology modeling, due to cost limitations only several point measurements are taken within a given watershed to represent basin-scale snow processes. To necessitate this, it is often assumed that at coarse resolution there is consistency in the spatial distribution of snow. This study examines this assumption of temporal consistency in spatial snowpack patterns. The focus areas is the Southern Rockies which is a key region for water supply to millions, as it is the headwater of four major western U.S. watersheds (Colorado, Platte, Arkansas, and Rio Grande Rivers). Within this area there are 90 long-term snow telemetry (SNOTEL) stations operated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) that have measured and recorded snow water equivalent (SWE) for at least 26 years. For each year, the daily SWE time series for each SNOTEL station was compared to each other station’s time series for the period when both stations were accumulating snow, yielding an annual relative accumulation rate between each station pair. The inter-annual variability of the accumulation rate among all combinations of SNOTEL pairs was computed and evaluated as a function of distance between SNOTEL station pairs, analogous to a semi-variogram. A general additive model approach was used to explain the variations in relative accumulation rates among the SNOTEL station pairs. Variation in accumulation among station pairs is highly correlated to distance, although there is no clear abrupt change in accumulation rates explained by distance, as is often present as the correlation length in semi-variograms. Elevation and land cover differences further explain observed variations in relative accumulation rates.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal climate forecasts, commonly provided in tercile-probabilities format (below-, near- and above-normal), need to be translated into more meaningful information for decision support of practitioners in agriculture. In this paper, we will present two new novel approaches to temporally downscale probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts: one non-parametric and another parametric method. First, the non-parametric downscaling approach called FResampler1 uses the concept of ‘conditional block sampling’ of weather data to create daily weather realizations of a tercile-based seasonal climate forecasts. FResampler1 randomly draws time series of daily weather parameters (e.g., rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation) from historical records, for the season of interest from years that belong to a certain rainfall tercile category (e.g., being below-, near- and above-normal). In this way, FResampler1 preserves the covariance between rainfall and other weather parameters as if conditionally sampling maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation if that day is wet or dry. The second approach called predictWTD is a parametric method based on a conditional stochastic weather generator. The tercile-based seasonal climate forecast is converted into a theoretical forecast cumulative probability curve. Then the deviates for each percentile is converted into rainfall amount or frequency or intensity to downscale the ‘full’ distribution of probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts. Those seasonal deviates are then disaggregated on a monthly basis and used to constrain the downscaling of forecast realizations at different percentile values of the theoretical forecast curve.

            "abstract": "Spring onset is commonly characterized by plant phenophase changes among a variety of biophysical transitions and has important implications for natural and man-managed ecosystems. Here, we present a new integrated analysis of variability in gridded Northern Hemisphere spring onset metrics. We developed a set of hemispheric temperature-based spring indices spanning 1920-2013. As these were derived solely from meteorological data, they are used as a benchmark for isolating the climate system’s role in modulating spring “green up” estimated from the annual cycle of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Spatial patterns of interannual variations, teleconnections, and long-term trends were also analyzed in all metrics. At mid-to-high latitudes, all indices exhibit larger variability at interannual to decadal time scales than at spatial scales of a few kilometers. Trends of spring onset vary across space and time. However, compared to long-term trend, interannual to decadal variability generally accounts for a larger portion of the total variance in spring onset timing. Therefore, spring onset trends identified from short existing records may be aliased by decadal climate variations due to their limited temporal depth, even when these records span the entire satellite era. Based on our findings, we also demonstrated that our indices have skill in representing ecosystem-level spring phenology and may have important implications in understanding relationships between phenology, atmosphere dynamics and climate variability.",

Based on the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites observations of electron density profiles from 2009-2014, Pedersen conductivity has been calculated. A climatologic study of the height-integrated Pedersen conductivities in both E (100–150 km) and F (150–600 km) regions and their ratio in different seasons, solar and geomagnetic conditions have been conducted. A significant inter-hemispheric asymmetry is identified in the seasonal variation. Meanwhile, the conductance in both regions and the conductance ratio show a strong dependence on F10.7 and Ap indices. This result will strongly help our understanding of the inter-hemispheric difference in the high-latitude electrodynamics.",

Our current research is focused on the development of a coupled surface water / groundwater hydrology model which integrates groundwater recharge simulated by the macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model into the GFLOW analytic element groundwater model. The spatially explicit hydrologic model is applied to a lake-rich region in northern Wisconsin and Michigan in order to quantify the groundwater and surface water inputs to the many lakes that are present. Integrated model results quantify highly variable hydrologic contributions to lakes for surface water and groundwater. The simplicity of this approach is intended to facilitate application of the model to relatively large spatial scales, such as the entire Midwest, in future work.",

A significant increased trend of ET in each hemisphere was consistently revealed by observationally-constrained data and multi-model ensembles that considered historic natural and anthropogenic drivers. The climate impacts were simulated to determine the spatiotemporal variations in ET. Globally, rising CO2 ranked second in these models after the predominant climatic influences, and yielded decreased trends in canopy transpiration and ET, especially for tropical forests and high-latitude shrub land. Increased nitrogen deposition slightly amplified global ET via enhanced plant growth. Land-use-induced ET responses, albeit with substantial uncertainties across the factorial analysis, were minor globally, but pronounced locally, particularly over regions with intensive land-cover changes. Our study highlights the importance of employing multi-stream ET and ET-component estimates to quantify the strengthening anthropogenic fingerprint in the global hydrologic cycle.",

At first, the combined use of altimetry and Earth-based range measurements has been examined in a simulation study. The differences between crossover constraint in the form of height discrepancies and in the form of minimum distance are mainly discussed. It is found that both crossover constraints can improve the performance of orbit determination. However, crossover constraint in the form of minimum distance between two curves can not only improve the radial component of the satellite orbit but also the cross-track and along-track component. And also, the weighting factor of crossover is discussed in the simulation study. And then, the same method is applied into analysis of altimetry from LAM. It is shown that including laser altimeter data improves the orbit precision.",

In this study we investigated nonlinear development of the ULF waves using multi-point measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. Small amplitude waves observed at spacecraft 3 (C3) rapidly grew and became nonlinear as they were observed at spacecraft 1 (C1) located downstream from C3. The nonlinear growth occurred within a few gyro-period of protons. Ion beams with Tperp/Tpara>1 were observed with the small amplitude waves at C3. As the waves grew nonlinearly, the core of the ion beams was decelerated, but they were also scattered both in energy and pitch angle producing more energetic, diffuse particles. This results in more diffuse distributions for the ULF waves with larger amplitude. During the interaction the original solar wind ions were not much disturbed.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events will be more common in the future due to climate change. In this work, precipitation deviations were computed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which is broadly recognized because its simplicity. The SPI associates the precipitation data with standardized deviations, so long series are required to fit the distribution, then transformed into a standard normal variable. The SPI positive values point out precipitation surpluses, while negative values show precipitation deficits.\nMonthly precipitation data from Delaware University (UDATP), and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute Regional Climate Model (SMHI-RCM), were used. Both databases cover South America with 0.5° spatial resolution, and they have a shared temporary window between 1951-2005. The forecast time window of SMHI-RCM spans between 2006-2100, and the chosen Representative Concentration Pathway is the RCP-4.5.\nPrior to calculation of SPI12 (12 months-SPI), a bias correction of RCM precipitation data was done, using the period 1961-1990 as reference. The same period was used as reference for the SPI12; in this way, the forecasted values of SPI12 were compared with those computed between 1961-1990.\nThe appended figure shows the predicted changes in dry and humid spells in South America. The computed values in the reference period 1961-1990, the forecast period 2071-2100, and the change between them are presented for a) yearly average precipitation, b) number of months with SPI12<-1, and c) number of months with SPI12<+1.\nAccording to forecast, a rise of the number of dry periods are expected in Chile, the Gran Chaco region, the Andean mountain range in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, and the Amazonian forest between Peru and Colombia. On the other hand, a rise of the number of surplus periods are expected in northeast Brazil, and the Caribbean Sea coast of the continent.

During the 1991-2012, droughts affected more than 14 million Brazilians, so that the concern for the following decades is about the potential impacts triggered by climate change. To analyze the vulnerability of the Brazilian municipalities to drought disasters, we have assessed the effects of climate change to droughts until the end of 21th century. A composite index was created based on three different dimensions: i) Exposure, represented by climate anomalies related to the drought process, such as changes in accumulated rainfall averages, interannual variability of rainfall, and the frequency and magnitude of severe droughts (measured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index); ii) Sensitivity, encompassing socioeconomic, demographic, land use and water management data; iii) Adaptive Capacity, consisting of socioeconomic and institutional data from Brazilian municipalities, such as the Human Development Index (HDI), social inequality (Gini index) and illiteracy rate. The climate variables used in this study are results from simulations of the Regional Climate Model Eta (with a downscaling of 20km spatial resolution) nested with two global climate models (HadGEM ES and MIROC 5) and was provided by National Institute for Space Research. The baseline period was 1961-1990 and future periods was 2011-2040; 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. For the simulations of future climate it was used the 4.5 and 8.5 IPCC/AR5 RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios. All variables used in this study was handled, exploited and related in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The methodology allowed the identification of vulnerability hotspots, the targeting of adaptation strategies and the development of public policy to minimize the potential impacts of future droughts. The final results (see attached image) indicate that the most vulnerable regions are located in the Midwest, in the northeastern Brazilian semi-arid and also on western Amazon.",

            "abstract": "The aerosol indirect effect is the largest source of forcing uncertainty in current climate models. This effect arises from the influence of aerosols on the reflective properties and lifetimes of clouds, and its magnitude depends on how many particles can serve as cloud droplet formation sites. Assessing levels of this subset of particles (cloud condensation nuclei, or CCN) requires knowledge of aerosol levels and their global distribution, size distributions, and composition.\nA key tool necessary to advance our understanding of CCN is the use of global aerosol microphysical models, which simulate the processes that control aerosol size distributions: nucleation, condensation/evaporation, and coagulation. Previous studies have found important differences in CO (Chen, D. et al., 2009) and ozone (Jang, J., 1995) modeled at different spatial resolutions, and it is reasonable to believe that short-lived, spatially-variable aerosol species will be similarly – or more – susceptible to model resolution effects.\nThe goal of this study is to determine how CCN levels and spatial distributions change as simulations are run at higher spatial resolution – specifically, to evaluate how sensitive the model is to grid size, and how this affects comparisons against observations. Higher resolution simulations are necessary supports for model/measurement synergy. Simulations were performed using the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (v9-02). The years 2008 and 2009 were simulated at 4ox5o and 2ox2.5o globally and at 0.5ox0.667o over Europe and North America. Results were evaluated against surface-based particle size distribution measurements from the European Supersites for Atmospheric Aerosol Research project.\nThe fine-resolution model simulates more spatial and temporal variability in ultrafine levels, and better resolves topography. Results suggest that the coarse model predicts systematically lower ultrafine levels than does the fine-resolution model. Significant differences are also evident with respect to model-measurement comparisons, and will be discussed.",

Second, a stochastic model is applied to quantify the observed dynamics of tracer particles, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by self-organized clusters within the armor layer.

            "abstract": "In the numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation by the use of a discrete computing domain, dispersion analysis is preceded by the determination of the spatial grid spacings in order to ensure accurate modeling results. Grid spacing is a function of wavelength, and the wavelength depends on the minimum velocity and maximum source frequency. Therefore, as the frequency increases, the number of grids increase and this leads to computational overburden. In order to reduce the computing complexity, coordinate transformation techniques such as Riemannian coordinates and logarithmic grid sets are proposed. Riemannian wave-field extrapolation is a way to reformulate the wave-field by expressing it in Riemannian coordinates. In the logarithmic grid, grid spacing changes logarithmically, so this enables us to reduce the number of grids compared to a conventional grid set. Furthermore, this could completely remove boundary reflections by extending the model dimensions. However, numerical modeling in the logarithmic grid is still inefficient because it is performed for whole model at every individual time step.\nIn this study we applied the expanding domain method to the logarithmic modeling in order to improve computational efficiency. This method, based on amplitude comparison, excludes computations for zero wave-fields by considering a non-zero domain boundary. Numerical examples demonstrated that our new modeling method enhances computational efficiency maintaining accuracy compared with conventional modeling methods. In wider and higher-order dimensions, particularly, the efficiency of our modeling method increased. Our new modeling technique could also be applied to the generation of underwater target echo signals requiring high frequency analysis.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory work is often STEM students’ primary exposure to key creative and communicative skills in the sciences, including experimental design, trouble shooting, team work, and oral presentations. The International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT) teaches these skills by inviting high school students to investigate simple unsolved systems instead of reproducing familiar results. Students work in teams to form hypotheses, gather data, and present their results orally in a tournament format. The IYPT has published 17 questions yearly since 1988, and its archives are an efficient source of experimental problems for outreach programs and have also been used for first-year undergraduate project classes (Planisic, 2009).\nWe present insights and outcomes from two schools in which we introduced a new extracurricular program based on the IYPT model. Twenty-four students worked in small teams for three hours per day for six weeks. Surprisingly, most teams chose problems in unfamiliar subject areas such as fluid dynamics, and tailored their approaches to take advantage of individual skills including soldering, photography, and theoretical analysis. As the program progressed, students developed an increasingly intuitive understanding of the scientific method. They began to discuss the repeatability of their experiments without prompting, and were increasingly willing to describe alternative hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Glacier mass balance (i.e., accumulation and ablation) is the most direct connection between climate and glaciers. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the available global network of mass-balance measurements, with a particular interest given to mountain and valley glaciers. Each mass-balance time series is decomposed into a trend and the variability about that trend. Observed variability ranges by an order of magnitude, depending on climate setting (i.e., maritime vs. continental). For the great majority of glaciers, variability is well characterized by normally distributed, random fluctuations that are uncorrelated between seasons, or in subsequent years. The magnitude of variability for both summer and winter is well correlated with mean wintertime balance, which reflects the climatic setting. Collectively, summertime variability exceeds wintertime variability, except for maritime glaciers. Trends in annual mass balance are generally negative, driven primarily by summertime changes. Approximately 25% of annual-mean records show statistically significant negative trends when judged in isolation. In aggregate, the global trend is negative and significant. We further evaluate the magnitude of trends relative to the variability. We find that, on average, trends are approximately -0.2 standard deviations per decade, although there is a broad spread among individual glaciers. Finally, for two long records we also compare mass-balance trends and variability with nearby meteorological stations. We find significant differences among stations meaning caution is warranted in interpreting any point measurement (such as mass balance) as representative of region-wide behavior. By placing observed trends in the context of natural variability, the results are useful for interpreting past glacial history, and for placing constraints on future predictability.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have provided a framework for understanding the zonal-mean position of the tropical rain belt by documenting relationships between rain belt latitude and atmospheric heat transport across the equator (Donohoe et al., 2013). Modern seasonal and interannual variability in globally-averaged rain belt position (often referred to as ‘ITCZ position’) reflects the interhemispheric heat balance, with the rain belt’s displacement toward the warmer hemisphere directly proportional to atmospheric heat transport into the cooler hemisphere. Model simulations suggest that rain belt shifts are likely to have obeyed the same relationship with interhemispheric heat transport in response to past changes in orbital parameters, ice sheets, and ocean circulation. This relationship implies that even small (±1 degree) shifts in the mean rain belt require large changes in hemispheric heat budgets, placing tight bounds on mean rain belt shifts in past climates.\nThis work has primarily viewed tropical circulation in two dimensions, as a pair of zonal-mean Hadley cells on either side of the rain belt that are displaced north and south by perturbations in hemispheric energy budgets, causing the atmosphere to transport heat into the cooler hemisphere. Here we attempt to move beyond this zonal-mean perspective, motivated by arguments that the Asian monsoon system, rather than the zonal-mean circulation, plays the dominant role in annual-mean heat transport into the southern hemisphere in the modern climate (Heaviside and Czaja, 2012; Marshall et al., 2014). We explore a range of climate change experiments, including simulations of North Atlantic cooling and mid-Holocene climate, to test whether changes in interhemispheric atmospheric heat transport are primarily driven by the mean Hadley circulation, the Asian monsoon system, or other regional-scale atmospheric circulation changes. The scalings that this work identifies between Asian monsoon changes and atmospheric heat transport help to provide quantitative insights into Asian monsoon variability in past climates.\n",

            "abstract": "Phase transitions of minerals and rocks in the interior of the Earth, especially at elevated pressures and temperatures, can make the crystal structures and state parameters obviously changed, so it is very important for the physical and chemical properties of these materials. It is known that the transformation between solid and liquid is relatively common in nature, such as the melting of ice and the crystallization of mineral or water. The kinetics relevant to these transformations might provide valuable information on the reaction rate and the reaction mechanism involving nucleation and growth. An in-situ transformation kinetic study of n-octane, which served as an example for this type of phase transition, has been carried out using a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) and high-speed video technique, and that the overall purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and the influence of pressure on the different transformation rates. At ambient temperature, the liquid-solid transformation of n-octane first took place with increasing pressure, and then the solid phase gradually transformed into the liquid phase when the sample was heated to a certain temperature. Upon the cooling of the system, the liquid-solid transformation occurred again. According to the established quantitative assessments of the transformation rates, pressure and temperature, it showed that there was a negative pressure dependence of the solid-liquid transformation rate. However, the elevation of pressure can accelerate the liquid-solid transformation rate. Based on the calculated activation energy values, an interfacial reaction and diffusion dominated the solid-liquid transformation, but the liquid-solid transformation was mainly controlled by diffusion. This experimental technique is a powerful and effective tool for the transformation kinetics study of n-octane, and the obtained results are of great significance to the kinetics study of minerals or rocks related to solid-liquid phase transitions in geological environments.",

            "abstract": "The Mecca Hills (MH) occur in a region of transpression along the southern San Andreas Fault. These geomorphic features are a result of the interplay between uplift and erosion. The MH are mostly covered by uniform sedimentary rocks with > 70% the Pliocene-Pleistocene Palm Spring Formation, > 20% Quaternary sediments and a minor amount of crystalline rock suggesting similar denudation rate over the region. However, Gray et al. (Quat. Sci. Rev. 2014) found a wide range of denudation rates (20 to 150 m/My) by using 10Be concentrations in active-channel alluvial sediment. We investigate potential causes of erosion to understand the variation of the denudation rate and examine the maturity of watersheds in the MH. We use ArcGIS to find the best geomorphic proxy for the published erosion rates by considering elevation, lithology, mean slope and active faults by using the index value method proposed by Gray et al. We apply the best geomorphic proxy to the overall MH to predict the spatial variation of erosion rate over the region. We use hypsometric integral (HI) and basin elongation ratio (BER) to study the maturity of the overall MH watersheds. We found that active faults are the main factor influencing erosion in the MH. Drainage basins located closer to active faults have higher erosion rates than others. Most watersheds are in a mature stage of the erosion cycle. Overall, the watersheds in the central MH are in a more youthful stage of the erosion cycle than the ones to the north and south. BER values suggest that the watersheds in the central MH formed earlier and have more time to develop their stream networks. Although watersheds in the central MH formed earlier than the others, their stage of erosion cycle is more youthful due to the proximity of active faults enhancing local erosion rates.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying recharge and water availability across the Southern High Plains is a difficult, but necessary, challenge for future groundwater and agricultural projections. Overland flow is not common due to limited precipitation, dry soils, and high evapotranspiration. The majority of runoff is temporarily stored in playa lakes, leading to the bulk of recharge across the region occurring in localized infiltration zones beneath these lakes. Despite the importance of regional recharge estimates, limited information exists that integrates complex characteristics of the land, climate, and hydrology in order to quantify recharge across the entire Southern High Plains aquifer. This study applies the Landscape Hydrology Model (LHM) to capture these characteristics and simulate surface water flow and groundwater recharge. This model simulates the complete water cycle across large regions, including irrigation estimates, establishing a framework to estimate recharge and groundwater availability in the Southern High Plains region. Results from this study can be used to predict the likely impacts of climate change and improve water management strategies.",

In this study, the ET process of Typhoon Nuri has been explored with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. During October 31st to November 3rd of 2014, Typhoon Nuri began its journey as a tropical storm intensifying into a category 5 Typhoon over the Pacific Ocean. The storm then started to weaken on November 4th, and came to the east of Japan, a prime area for ET, on November 6th. The WRF model successfully captures the transformation and reintensification of Typhoon Nuri into a super strong Arctic storm over the Bering Sea. The model simulations indicate that, with the subtropical high located on the east side of the storm, a low-level jet formed, which accelerated the storm movement northward. At the same time, the resulting enhancement of warm air advection strengthend thermal contrast between the cold air in the northwest of the storm and the warm air within the storm, deforming the high-level jet streak into an orientation favoring the storm’s transformation into an extratropical cyclone. The interaction between the upper-level jet streak and storm further steered the Nuri-transformed extratropical cyclone to continue its northward journey toward the Bering Sea and intensify into a super strong Arctic storm on the November 8th, 2014.",

            "abstract": "California has been experiencing its most extreme drought in recent history due to a combination of record high temperatures and exceptionally low precipitation. An estimate for when the drought can be expected to end is needed for risk mitigation and water management. A crucial component of drought recovery assessments is the estimation of terrestrial water storage (TWS) deficit. Previous studies on drought recovery have been limited to surface water hydrology (precipitation and/or runoff) for estimating changes in TWS, neglecting the contribution of groundwater deficits to the recovery time of the system. Groundwater requires more time to recover than surface water storage; therefore, the inclusion of groundwater storage in drought recovery assessments is essential for understanding the long-term vulnerability of a region. Here we assess the probability, for varying timescales, of California’s current TWS deficit returning to its long-term historical mean. Our method consists of deriving the region’s fluctuations in TWS from changes in the gravity field observed by NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. We estimate the probability that meteorological inputs, precipitation minus evaporation and runoff, over different timespans will balance the current GRACE-derived TWS deficit (e.g. in 3, 6, 12 months). This method improves upon previous techniques as the GRACE-derived water deficit comprises all hydrologic sources, including surface water, groundwater, and snow cover. With this empirical probability assessment we expect to improve current estimates of California’s drought recovery time, thereby improving risk mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The framework of causal discovery provides algorithms that seek to identify potential cause-effect relationships from observational data. The output of such algorithms is a graph structure that indicates the potential causal connections between the observed variables. Originally developed for applications in the social sciences and economics, causal discovery has been used with great success in bioinformatics and, most recently, in climate science, primarily to identify interaction patterns between compound climate variables and to track pathways of interactions between different locations around the globe.\nHere we apply causal discovery to the output data of climate models to learn so-called causal signatures from the data that indicate interactions between the different atmospheric variables. These causal signatures can act like fingerprints for the underlying dynamics and thus serve a variety of diagnostic purposes. We study the use of the causal signatures for three applications: 1) For climate model software verification we suggest to use causal signatures as a means of detecting statistical differences between model runs, thus identifying potential errors and supplementing the Community Earth System Model Ensemble Consistency Testing (CESM-ECT) tool recently developed at NCAR for CESM verification. 2) In the context of data compression of model runs, we will test how much the causal signatures of the model outputs changes after different compression algorithms have been applied. This may result in additional means to determine which type and amount of compression is acceptable. 3) This is the first study applying causal discovery simultaneously to a large number of different atmospheric variables, and in the process of studying the resulting interaction patterns for the two aforementioned applications, we expect to gain some new insights into their relationships from this approach. We will present first results obtained for Applications 1 and 2 above.",

In this study, the proposed method is employed to reconstruct meteorological forcing dataset over Lake Michigan, bathymetry of Gull Lake, and precipitation over the Grand River watershed in the State of Michigan. In the first case study, hourly interpolated meteorological forcing parameters are used to run a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Michigan to show the improvement that results from the use of the interpolation method by comparing model results with observed data for currents. In the second case study, the bathymetry of the Gull Lake is interpolated from the scatter point data using the manifold technique. A hydrodynamic model of Gull Lake has been developed and improved by using the interpolated bathymetry. In the last case study, 13-year daily participation data are interpolated over the Grand River watershed and used as input for an integrated, distributed watershed model.

            "abstract": "We use infrasound produced by Tungurahua Volcano (Ecuador) to infer local time-varying atmospheric conditions, which can be used to improve gas flux measurements and tephra dispersal modeling. Physical properties of the atmosphere, including wind and temperature (which controls adiabatic sound speed), can be quantified by studying the travel times of acoustic waves produced during volcanic activity. The travel times between Tungurahua’s vent and five infrasound stations located in a network configuration over an area of 90 km2 were used in this study. We are able to quantify the arrival time differences of acoustic waves for ten unique station pairs and use this information to model the average speed of sound between source and receiver. To identify what parameters best fit the observed arrival times, we perform a grid search for a homogeneous two-dimensional wind velocity as well as for air temperature. Due to travel time dependence on the specific path taken by waves, we account for topography using a 5 meter resolution digital elevation model of Tungurahua. To investigate the time-varying atmospheric structure we use data recorded at Tungurahua volcano, during a strombolian eruptive phase in August 2012, however the methodology can be applied to continuous network infrasound data collected since July 2006 as part of the Japanese-Ecuadorian Cooperation Project: “Enhancement of the Volcano Monitoring Capacity in Ecuador”. We propose that the computation of wind velocities will help to improve gas flux measurements that are based on remote sensing techniques like Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS), resulting in better estimates of sulfur fluxes that can then be related to magma fluxing into the volcanic system. Further, wind field quantification close to the volcano can improve numerical models that are used to forecast tephra deposits, thereby helping to mitigate their effect on inhabitants, infrastructure, livestock, and crops.",

            "abstract": "Excess reactive nitrogen in soils of intensively managed agricultural fields causes adverse environmental impact, and continues to remain a global concern. Many novel strategies have been developed to provide better management practices and, yet, the problem remains unresolved. The objective of this study is to develop a 3-dimensional model to characterize the spatially distributed ``age\" of soil-nitrogen (nitrate and ammonia-ammonium) across a watershed. We use the general theory of age, which provides an assessment of the elapsed time since nitrogen is introduced into the soil system. Micro-topographic variability incorporates heterogeneity of nutrient transformations and transport associated with topographic depressions that form temporary ponds and produce prolonged periods of anoxic conditions, and roadside agricultural ditches that support rapid surface movement. This modeling effort utilizes 1-m Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. We find a significant correlation between hydrologic variability and mean nitrate age that enables assessment of preferential flow paths of nitrate leaching. The estimation of the mean nitrogen age can thus serve as a tool to disentangle complex nitrogen dynamics by providing the analysis of the time scales of soil-nitrogen transformation and transport processes without introducing additional parameters.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide injection into a confined saline aquifer may be modeled as an axisymmetric two-phase flow problem. Assuming the two fluids segregate in the vertical direction due to strong buoyancy, and neglecting capillary pressure and miscibility, the lubrication approximation leads to a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation that describes the evolution of the sharp fluid-fluid interface. The flow behaviors in the system are controlled by two dimensionless groups: M, the viscosity ratio of the displaced fluid relative to injected fluid, and Γ , the gravity number, which represents the relative importance of buoyancy and fluid injection. Four different analytical solutions can be derived as the asymptotic approximations, representing specific values of the parameter pairs. The four solutions correspond to: (1) Γ << 1, M <1; (2) Γ << 1, M =1; (3) Γ << 1, M >1; and (4) Γ >> 1, any M values. The first two of these solutions are new, while the third corresponds to the solution of Nordbotten and Celia (2006) for confined injections and the fourth corresponds to the solution of (Lyle et al., 2005) for gravity currents in an unconfined aquifer. Overall, the various axisymmetric flows can be summarized in a Γ-M regime diagram with five distinct dynamic behaviors including the four asymptotic regimes and an intermediate regime (Fig. 1).\nData from a number of CO2 injection sites around the world can be used to compute the two dimensionless groups Γ and M associated with each injection. When plotted on the regime diagram, these values show the flow behavior for each injection and how the values vary from site to site. For all the CO2 injections, M is always larger than 1, while Γ can range from 0.01 up to 100. The pairs of (Γ, M) with lower Γ values correspond to solution (3), while the ones with higher Γ values can move up to the intermediate regime and the flow regime for solution (4). The higher values of Γ correspond to pilot-scale injections with low injection rates; most industrial-scale injection operations are expected to have low values of Γ. Other subsurface fluid injections can also be analyzed with this regime diagram. One example of water alternating gas enhanced oil recovery (WAG EOR) falls into the flow regime corresponds to the solution (1), and an example of waste disposal falls into the flow regime for solution (3).",

            "abstract": "Integrated groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) systems in arid parts of the world respond to and recover slowly from climate changes. This creates multi-generational issues with dramatic economic, social, and ecological consequences, and could likely be the case in the future for the High Plains aquifer. Despite the semi-arid climate of the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), groundwater recharge (GR) rates are the highest in the entire High Plains aquifer region, mostly because of thick, highly permeable sand dunes. Along with the large capacity aquifer, the GR rates in the NSH contribute to relatively steady stream baseflows and a shallow water table, creating a very complex system of several thousands of shallow (about 0.8 m on average) closed-basin lakes, and wetlands, integrated with GW.\nTo explore the GW dynamics and address the possibility, and uncertainty range of impacts caused by future climate change on surface water, we quantified potential changes to GR rates resulting from three thoughtfully-selected Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections from the WCRP CMIP3 archive. Cumulative future period GR (as the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration) was used as the criterion to select GCM runs, including total cumulative GR (from 2010 to 2099) nearest to the median (±1 standard deviation). This allows for: determining the most likely GR estimates, characterization of uncertainty, retaining the temporal variability of individual GCMs, while reducing time needed to perform hydrological simulations. Future GR changes from the three selected GCM runs were averaged by decade and used to force transient groundwater model runs within a 40,000 km2 part of the NSH. Dynamics of lake and wetland spatial distribution and total areal coverage and numbers, were simulated with the GW model from 2010 to 2099. Addition model runs, with fixed end-of-century GR rates, elucidate response time required for the GW system to reach equilibrium under the changed climate regime.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen is unique among aqueous ions, both in its importance for geochemical reactions, and in its complex transport behavior through reactive media. The structure of hydrogen reaction fronts can be analyzed in the advective limit of the transport equation. At local chemical equilibrium, sorption of hydrogen onto the media surface (sorption isotherm) controls reaction front morphology. Transport modeling thus necessitates accurate knowledge of surface chemistry. Though motivated by transport, sorption models are often parameterized against batch titration experiments. The validity of these parameterizations, in a transport setting, are seldom tested. The analytic solution to the transport equation gives an algebraic relationship between concentration velocity and equilibrium sorption behavior. In this study, we conduct a suite of column flow experiments through quartz sand. Hydrogen concentration breakthrough curves at the column outlet are used to infer the “transport sorption isotherm.” These results are compared to the batch titration derived sorption isotherm. We find excellent agreement between the datasets. Our findings suggest that, for aqueous hydrogen, local chemical equilibrium is a valid assumption. With the goal of a predictive transport model, we parameterize various sorption models against this dataset. Models which incorporate electrostatic effects at the surface predict transport well. Nonelectrostatic models such as the Kd, Langmuir, and Freundlich models fail. These results are particularly compelling as nonelectrostatic models are often employed to predict hydrogen transport in many reactive transport code. ",

            "abstract": "The geomechanical processes associated with subsurface fluid injection/extraction is of central importance for many industrial operations related to energy and water resources. However, the mechanisms controlling the stability and slip motion of a preexisting geologic fault remain poorly understood and are critical for the assessment of seismic risk. In this work, we develop a coupled hydro-geomechanical model to investigate the effect of fluid injection induced pressure perturbation on the slip behavior of a sealing fault. The model couples single-phase flow in the pores and mechanics of the solid phase. Granular packs (see example in Fig. 1a) are numerically generated where the grains can be either bonded or not, depending on the degree of cementation. A pore network is extracted for each granular pack with pore body volumes and pore throat conductivities calculated rigorously based on geometry of the local pore space. The pore fluid pressure is solved via an explicit scheme, taking into account the effect of deformation of the solid matrix. The mechanics part of the model is solved using the discrete element method (DEM). We first test the validity of the model with regard to the classical one-dimensional consolidation problem where an analytical solution exists. We then demonstrate the ability of the coupled model to reproduce rock deformation behavior measured in triaxial laboratory tests under the influence of pore pressure. We proceed to study the fault stability in presence of a pressure discontinuity across the impermeable fault which is implemented as a plane with its intersected pore throats being deactivated and thus obstructing fluid flow (Fig. 1b, c). We focus on the onset of shear failure along preexisting faults. We discuss the fault stability criterion in light of the numerical results obtained from the DEM simulations coupled with pore fluid flow. The implication on how should faults be treated in a large-scale continuum model is also presented.",

Identifying particulate matter (PM) sources is important for gauging air quality, identifying issues, and creating mitigation strategies; whereas the use of stable oxygen isotopes allows for the assessment of different oxidation pathways. PM collected in Whangarei, New Zealand, was analyzed for elemental, ion, and isotope concentrations to uncover seasonal variations in both source and oxidation pathways used. Because of its location, PM collected in Whangarei was found to be a mixture of anthropogenic (motor vehicles, industry, local biomass burning, shipping) and natural sources (sea salt, DMS), with the majority of samples showing some enrichment in the heavier oxygen isotopes, suggesting ozone oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic flux ropes are characteristic twisted helical magnetic field structures seen in throughout the solar system. They have been observed even around unmagnetized planets, such as Venus and Mars. In the case of Mars, the origin of Martian flux ropes is owing to not only the interplanetary magnetic field and associated draped magnetic fields, but also crustal magnetic fields. Planetary ions are energized through the direct interaction of the solar wind with the upper atmosphere, resulting in ion escape into interplanetary space. Hence, magnetic flux ropes can contribute to the ion escape rates, because they may be able to trap large amounts of the Martian ionospheric plasmas.\nHere we present simultaneous MAVEN plasma and magnetic field observations with respect to a magnetic flux rope around Mars. This event was observed in the post-dusk southern hemisphere of the Martian induced magnetosphere, where is roughly downstream from strong crustal magnetic fields. The observed altitude was approximately 2500 km, where is more than 5 times higher than those previously detected by Mars Global Surveyor. MAVEN observed a pronounced ion composition change across the structure, with solar wind ions dominating outside and planetary ions dominating within. Therefore, multiple planetary ions species (e.g., H+, O+, and O2+) tend to be included inside the flux rope. These results infer that the observed flux rope was formed in a region with access to planetary ions but to not magnetosheath ions One likely such location is on closed magnetic field lines within the Martian ionosphere. We applied the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction (GSR) technique to the observed flux rope, in order to estimate the two-dimensional spatial structure using the MAVEN simultaneous plasma and magnetic field data. The GSR results for this event showed that the estimated axial orientation is oriented approximately parallel to the Mars-Sun line. In this presentation, we will also report the statistical results of the high-altitude magnetic flux ropes observed by MAVEN from the beginning of its primary science phase (November 2014) to date in order to understand the global characteristics of these high-altitude magnetic flux ropes around Mars including their upstream solar wind dependences.",

            "abstract": "Urban thermal environment change, especially, surface air temperature (SAT) rise in metropolitan areas, is one of the major recent issues in urban areas. The urban thermal environmental change affects not only human health such as heat stroke, but also increasing infectious disease due to spreading out virus vectors habitat and increase of industry and house energy consumption. The SAT rise is mostly caused by global climate change and urban heat island (hereafter UHI) by urbanization. The population in Tokyo metropolitan area is over 30 millions and the Tokyo metropolitan area is one of the biggest megacities in the world. The temperature rise due to urbanization seems comparable to the global climate change in the major megacities. It is important to project how the urbanization and the global climate change affect to the future change of urban thermal environment to plan the adaptation and mitigation policy. \nTo predict future SAT change in urban scale, we should estimate future UHI modified by the global climate change. This study investigates change in UHI intensity (UHII) of major metropolitan areas in Japan by effects of the global climate change. We performed a series of climate simulations. Present climate simulations with and without urban process are conducted for ten seasons using a high-resolution numerical climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Future climate projections with and without urban process are also conducted. The future projections are performed using the pseudo global warming method, assuming 2050s' initial and boundary conditions estimated by a GCM under the RCP scenario. Simulation results indicated that UHII would be enhanced more than 30% in Tokyo during the night due to the global climate change. The enhancement of urban heat island is mostly caused by change of lower atmospheric stability.",

The Indian plate (or Assam block) subducts beneath the Tibetan plateau while sliding northwards relative to northwest Myanmar and Yunnan. Present-day deformation in this 200 x 200 km2 wide zone is mostly accommodated by two nearly orthogonal thrust systems: the North dipping, N60E striking Himalayan Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) and the NE dipping, N130E striking Mishmi Thrust (MST). We have shown that the great M8.6, 1950 Assam earthquake, which triggered huge landslides and numerous aftershocks along both thrusts, ruptured the surface from at least Wakro to Pasighat, a minimum distance of ≈ 200 km. Here, we map more carefully and characterize quantitatively the surface rupture of that event. We analyze the heights, shapes, and slopes of topographic profiles leveled using Total Station and kinematic GPS across steep scarps, and atop uplifted Quaternary alluvial terraces, to document 1950 co-seismic and older cumulative surface uplifts. Co-seismic vertical throws differ between the two thrusts (≈ 7 m and ≈ 2 m, along the MST and MFT, respectively). The stratigraphy along freshly cut terrace risers and along paleo-seismological trench walls is used to constrain the distinctly different dips of the two thrusts (≈ 14° and < 8° along the MST and MFT, respectively). Both 14C and 10Be dating results are combined to assess the ages of uplifted surfaces. The results are then used to evaluate the rates of Quaternary surface uplift and shortening across both active thrusts. At two sites, our data suggests characteristic slip on either thrust for at least the last two large events, improving our estimate of the return time (≈ 1300 ± 500 at Wakro) of recent great earthquakes along these connected thrusts of the Himalayan and Burmese ranges.",

Such measurements may be taken to imply broadly characteristic increments of throw during sequences of at least five to seven events of riverbed abandonment related to co-seismic uplifts. Newly collected detrital charcoals from several pits and from a rejuvenated paleoseismological wall will help assess more precisely uplift and shortening rates over the length of segments of the MFT east and west of Bardibas.

They adversely impact field operations, and influence snowfall, the ice-sheet mass balance, and sea-air energy fluxes. Although individual mesocyclones are poorly represented on reanalyses, these datasets robustly depict the upper-ocean and troposphere environments in which multiple mesocyclones typically form. A spatial metric of mesocyclone activity—the Meso-Cyclogenesis Potential (MCP)—used ERA-40 anomaly fields of: sea surface temperature (SST) minus marine air temperature (MAT), near-surface winds, 500 hPa air temperature, and the sea-ice edge location. MCP maps composited by teleconnection phases for 1979-2001, broadly correspond to short-period satellite “climatologies” of mesocyclones. Here, we assess 3 reanalysis datasets (CFSR, ERA-I and MERRA) for their reliably to depict MCP patterns on weekly to sub-monthly periods marked by strong regional shifts in mesocyclone activity (frequencies, track densities) occurring during a La Niña winter: June 21-30, 1999 (SE Indian Ocean) and September 1-10, 1999 (Ross Sea sector). All reanalyses depict the marked variations in upper ocean and atmosphere variables between adjacent 10-day periods. Slight differences may owe to model resolution or internal components (land surface, coupled ocean models), and/or how the observations are assimilated. For June 21-30, positive SST-MAT, southerly winds, proximity to the ice edge, and negative T500, accompany increased meso-cyclogenesis. However, for September 1-10, surface forcing does not explain frequent comma cloud “polar lows” north-east of the Ross Sea. Inclusion of the upper-level diffluence (e.g., from Z300 field) in the MCP metric, better depicts the observed mesocyclone activity. MCP patterns on these “macro-weather” time scales appear relatively insensitive to the choice of reanalysis.",

            "abstract": "In order to evaluate the influence of crustal and mantle heterogeneities upon the initiation of the Malawi rift zone (MRZ) and reactivation of the Zambian Luangwa rift zone (LRZ) subject to Cenozoic plate boundary stress fields and mantle buoyancy forces, we installed and operated 33 Seismic Arrays For African Rift Initiation (SAFARI) three-component broadband seismic stations in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia from 2012 to 2014. During the twenty-four month acquisition period, nearly 6200 radial receiver functions (RFs) were recorded. Stations situated within the MRZ, either along the coastal plains or within the Shire Graben toward the south, report an average crustal thickness of 42 km relative to approximately 46 km observed at stations located along the rift flanks. This implies the juvenile MRZ is characterized by a stretching factor not exceeding 1.1. Meanwhile, P-to-S velocity ratios within the MRZ increase from 1.71 to 1.82 in southernmost Malawi, indicating a substantial modification of the crust during Recent rifting. Time-series stacking of approximately 5500 RFs recorded by the SAFARI and 44 neighboring network stations reveals an apparent uplift of 10 to 15 km along both the 410- and 660-km mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuities beneath the MRZ and LRZ which, coupled with an apparently normal 250-km MTZ thickness, implies a first-order high-velocity contribution from thickened lithosphere. Preliminary manual checking of SAFARI shear-wave splitting (SWS) measurements provides roughly 650 high-quality XKS phases following a component re-orientation to correct station misalignments. Regional azimuthal variations in SWS fast orientations are observed, from rift-parallel in the vicinity of the LRZ to rift-oblique in the MRZ. A major 60° rotation in the fast orientation occurs at approximately 31°E, possibly resulting from the modulation of mantle flow around a relatively thick lithospheric keel situated between the two rift zones.",

            "abstract": "Lakes expanding into ice-rich permafrost can rapidly re-introduce large quantities of ancient organic carbon (C) to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) or the more powerful greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Quantifying the sources of greenhouse gas emissions from arctic lakes will reduce large uncertainties in the magnitude and timing of the C-climate feedback from the Arctic, and thus trajectories of climate change.\nThis work provides the first regional assessment of integrated whole-lake radiocarbon (14C) ages of dissolved CH4 and CO2 as a proxy for C emission sources in northern Alaska. We collected water samples from below ice along two 170 km north-south transects on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of Alaska in April 2012 and 2013. These lakes represent a network monitored by the US-NSF funded project, Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON), http://www.arcticlakes.org/. Dissolved CH4 and CO2 were extracted and analyzed for their 14C content. The presence of winter ice on the surface of lakes obstructs the emission of CH4 and CO2 originating from the perennially thawed sub-lake sediments. The trapped gases are forced to mix, thus measured 14C ages are integrated signatures representing the whole-lake emissions.\nDissolved CH4 and CO2 ages do not correlate with latitude, yet seem to be driven by surficial geology. Of nearly 150 14C measurements, below-ice dissolved CH4 is the oldest (around 2145 ± 15 14C YBP) in a lake residing on “peaty, sandy lowland” on the northern ACP near the town of Barrow. Modern CH4 and CO2 dominate emissions from “eolian sandy lowlands” in the interior of the ACP. Across all lakes, dissolved CH4 (avg. 836 14C YBP) is older than dissolved CO2 (avg. 480 14C YBP) by a regional average of ca. 360 14C YBP. Results from this study indicate that decomposing Holocene-age organic material is the primary source of CH4 and CO2 emissions from the Alaskan ACP. This baseline dataset provides the foundation for future regional lake monitoring in the warming arctic climate. Our whole-lake proxy facilitates lake-to-lake comparison and regional up scaling, thereby strengthening quantitative understanding of how environmental drivers (water body size, climate, surficial geology) affect the magnitude and sources of biogenic CH4 and CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "A consensus has not been reached regarding the structure of general, high angle grain boundaries in olivine. Published high resolution transmission electron microscope images show either abutting lattice planes of the grains on either side of the boundary, or a distinct grain boundary region, about 1 nm wide, that is more disordered than the grain interiors. However, agreement exists that grain boundary region is enriched in olivine trace elements such as Ti, Ca and Al. These analytical methods can not resolve the thickness of this region.\nThe properties of grain boundaries can be interrogated by experimentation, but the interpretation of the experimental results is tied to microphysical models. Models for diffusion creep predict a square grain size dependence for diffusion through grain interiors, and a cubic grain size dependence for diffusion along grain boundaries. Experimental observations for polycrystalline, Fe-bearing olivine are best fit with a cubic grain size dependence, indicating diffusion along grain boundaries. Similarly, models for small strain, transient creep predict that time-dependent, recoverable deformation involves diffusion along grain boundaries. For this process the models predict a linear grain size dependence. Forced torsional oscillation experiments can be employed to investigate the transient creep behaviour over a range of frequencies, temperatures and grain sizes. The observed grain size dependence for the same materials used for conventional, large strain deformation experiments is near linear, indicating diffusionally assisted grain boundary sliding. Both transient and steady state deformation therefore implicate diffusion along grain boundaries as the rate-controlling mechanism.\nDiffusion and viscous sliding along grain boundaries imply that they are a separate phase with a less ordered structure, consistent with their interpretation as a (narrow) region that is distinct from grain interiors. This region likely also accommodates the enrichment in trace elements observed by analytical TEM methods.",

Here we investigate the focal depths and fault plane solutions of moderate earthquakes in the Himalayan-Tibetan region by teleseismic waveform modeling and a multi-scale double-difference earthquake relocation method.\nShallow earthquakes are widespread across the whole study region. In the central Tibet, earthquakes are restricted to the upper crust and originate dominantly by strike-slip faulting, in agreement with low velocity layers observed previously in the lower crust and strong S-wave attenuation zones observed in the uppermost mantle. In the northern and southern Tibet, where the Asian and Indian plate subduct beneath the central Tibet, earthquakes appear to be distributed throughout the thickness of the crust and exhibit dominantly reverse faulting (Bai et al., 2015a).\n Intermediate-depth earthquakes are mostly located at the eastern and western Himalayan syntaxes, which reflect the ongoing deformation along the plate interface. The continental slab beneath the Indian-Eurasian collision zone deforms in a more complex manner than the oceanic slab subduction, combining tension, shearing and oblique convergence with plate subduction (Bai et al., 2015b).\n",

            "abstract": "Iron limits primary productivity in large areas of the Southern Ocean. It has been suggested that baleen whales form a crucial part of biogeochemical cycling processes through the consumption of nutrient-rich krill and subsequent defecation, but evidence on their contribution is scarce. We analysed the concentration of iron in Antarctic krill and baleen whale faeces and muscle. Iron concentrations in Antarctic krill were over 1 million times higher, and whale faecal matter were almost 10 million times higher than typical Southern Ocean High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll seawater concentrations. This suggests that Antarctic krill act as a reservoir of in in Southern Ocean surface waters, and that baleen whales play an important role in converting this fixed iron into a liquid form in their faeces.\nWe developed an exploratory model to examine potential contribution of blue, fin and humpback whales to the Southern Ocean iron cycle to explore the effect of the recovery of great whales to historical levels. Our results suggest that pre-exploitation populations of blue whales and, to a lesser extent fin and humpback whales, could have contributed to the more effective recycling of iron in surface waters, resulting in enhanced phytoplankton production. This enhanced primary productivity is estimated to be: 8.3 x 10-5 to 15 g C m-2 yr-1 (blue whales), 7 x 10-5 to 9 g C m-2 yr-1 (fin whales), and 10-5 to 1.7 g C m-2 yr-1 (humpback whales). To put these into perspective, current estimates of primary production in the Southern Ocean from remotely sensed ocean colour are in the order of 57 g C m-2 yr-1 (south of 50°). The high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of these increases in primary productivity is mainly due to our limited quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes including iron content in krill, krill consumption rates by whales, persistence of iron in the photic zone, bioavailability of retained iron, and carbon-to-iron ratio of phytoplankton. We are actively working on addressing these unknowns.",

Even though depth and distribution of the root can substantially alter the hydrological cycle, only a few studies have dealt with rooting depth and water use of trees growing through impervious surfaces. We compared the water sources of trees growing through impervious and pervious surfaces using a non-destructive stable isotope approach. We measured oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions from stem water and other potential water sources before and during the wet season. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of stem water were measured, indicating that trees growing through the impervious surfaces used isotopically enriched water in both periods. An IsoSource model applied in the wet season showed that trees growing through impervious surfaces took most of their water from depths of around 20 cm, while the control trees took the greatest portion from a depth of 100 cm. Our results imply that urban trees growing through impervious surfaces might be vulnerable to drought and show the distinctive effect of urban plants on the redistribution of hydrological components.",

            "abstract": "In the two weeks leading up to the 1 April 2014 Mw 8.2 (USGS moment magnitude) earthquake offshore of Iquique, Chile, a sequence of foreshocks occurred south of the 1 April main shock epicenter and up-dip of the main shock moment release region. Starting on 16 March, this sequence included four Mw 6.0+ events, 17 Mw 5-6 events, and numerous smaller events. Using multiple-event relocated hypocenters and source parameters (focal planes and magnitudes) derived from regional and teleseismic data, we determine the evolution of Coulomb stress change (ΔCS) from these foreshocks on the subduction plate boundary. We assess if each event successively triggered the next, ultimately leading to the 1 April main shock rupture. The three largest foreshocks following the initial Mw 6.7 event (Mw 6.4, 6.2 and 6.3) occurred in regions of significant positive ΔCS (0.01 MPa and larger), indicating that these locations were brought closer to failure by the preceding seismicity. In addition, the net ΔCS at the main shock hypocenter accumulated during the foreshock sequence was large and positive (~0.05 MPa), implicating the foreshock sequence in aiding the initial rupture of the main shock. This initial hypocentral rupture, which preceded the rupture in the region of primary moment release by ~25 seconds, had the effect of increasing the ΔCS in that region by ~0.01 MPa.\nWe also examine the role aseismic slip may have had in the loading of the plate boundary before the main shock. Horizontal GPS displacements observed along the northern Chile coast prior to the 1 April main shock cannot be accounted for by displacements generated from the foreshock seismicity alone. Assuming aseismic slip on the subduction interface is responsible for these excess displacements, we perform a grid search for the location and magnitude of plate interface slip that can account for this difference. We find that a region with slip corresponding to a magnitude ~Mw 6.8 earthquake co-located with or up-dip of the foreshock seismicity best fits the difference. This slow slip patch adds to the positive loading in the main shock hypocentral area, and importantly in main region of moment release down-dip of the foreshocks.",

Spatially dense atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM) sites deployed at the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) allow us to observe the spatial patterns of such variables. The upcoming \"super site\" at SGP will facilitate these studies at even finer scales.

The correlations and variances at the CF and extended sites are analyzed at different frequencies extracted by the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier transform. We further exploit the possibilities of attributing the heterogeneity at SGP to dominant drivers (i.e., vegetation, land type, etc).

The antennas have been designed, fabricated, and lab tested at the Center for Environmental Technology (CET) at CU-Boulder. The radar system was also designed and integrated at CET utilizing rugged RF components and FPGA based digital processing. Field testing was performed in conjunction with VALKYRIE tests by Stone Aerospace in June, 2015 on Matanuska Glacier, Alaska.\nThe antennas are designed to operate inside ice while being immersed in a thin layer of surrounding low-conductivity melt water. Small holes in the corners of the cavities allow flooding of these cavities with the same melt-water thus allowing for quarter-wavelength cavity-backed reflection. Testing of the antenna array was first carried out by characterizing their operation inside a large ice block at the Stone Aerospace facility in Austin, TX. The complete radar system was then tested on the Matanuska glacier in Alaska, which is an effective Earth analog to Europan sub-surface exploration.",

This has been done through the creation of pre- and post-project partner assessments that capture partner needs, capabilities, and expectations. This provides both baseline data and an overview of project impacts on partners.

            "abstract": "Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided monthly geopotential fields represented by Stokes coefficients of spherical harmonics (SH). Nominally, GRACE gravity solutions exclude effects from tides, ocean dynamics and barometric pressure by incorporating geophysical models for them. However, those models are imperfect, and thus GRACE solutions include the residual gravity effects. Particularly, unmodeled gravity variations of sub-monthly or shorter time scale cause aliasing error, which produces peculiar longitudinal stripes. Those north-south patterns are removed by spatial filtering, but caution is necessary for the aliasing correction because signals with longitudinal patterns are possibly removed during the procedure. This would be particularly problematic for studies associated with Greenland ice mass balance since large ice mass variations are expected in the West and South-West coast of Greenland that are elongated along the longitudinal direction. In this study, we develop a novel method to remove the correlation error using extended Empirical Orthogonal Function (extended EOF). The extended EOF is useful to separate spatially and temporally coherent signal from high frequency variations. Since temporal variability of the correlation error is high, the error is possibly removed via the extended EOF. Ice mass variations reduced by the extended EOF show more detail patterns of ice mass loss/gain than those from the conventional spatial filtering. Large amount of ice loss has occurred along the West, South-West and East coastal area during summer. The extended EOF is potentially useful to enhance signal to noise ratio and increase spatial resolution of GRACE data.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is located at the collision boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, and there are frequent seismic activities beneath the eastern part of Taiwan. It is worth to note that most of the earthquakes are shallow earthquakes, therefore, high potential earthquake hazards must be considered. On Oct. 31, 2013, a moderate earthquake (ML=6.4; depth=15 km) occurred in Ruisui, Hulien area, Taiwan. After seven months, another moderate earthquake (ML=5.9, depth=18 km) also occurred in the northern part of this area (Fenglin) on May 21, 2014, where the location is nearby the 2013 M6.4 event. Hence, the main goal of this study is to investigate the rupture process of these two earthquakes and tomography structures beneath the Longitude Valley in eastern Taiwan. In this study, we invert a 3-D velocity structure beneath the eastern part of Taiwan. Furthermore, we accurately determine the aftershocks, the related focal mechanisms, and the local stress status from the inverted 3-D velocity model. In addition, we also use both horizontal-components records from the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) to invert the source energy radiation pattern by using the isochron method and recursive stochastic technique. The results show that the two earthquakes are energetic and short in duration; with events confined in small source volumes. Base on the above results, we suppose that there might be a NE-SW trending blind fault which dips to the west and the Central Range fault zone leads to a possible oblique slip fault and exhibit high seismic potential. These also imply that this segment of fault zone would be fully cracks before these moderate earthquakes, and then triggered by the local stress field perturbation. This behavior appears to be typical of particularly active plate boundary regions with a highly fractured upper crust under intense tectonic loading.",

            "abstract": "Since completion of Shasta Dam, migration of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the Sacramento River has been blocked, causing loss of spawning and rearing habitat. This has been a factor leading to population declines of these fish species over several decades. Winter-run Chinook salmon, spring-run Chinook salmon and steelhead trout are now listed under the Endangered Species Act. A habitat assessment of the tributaries upstream of Shasta Dam showed that the Sacramento and McCloud tributaries have suitable habitat for reintroduction of adult salmon and steelhead for spawning. Such reintroduction would require downstream passage of juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead past Shasta Dam. To evaluate the possibility of collecting and transporting juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead past Shasta Dam, a CE-QUAL-W2 model of Shasta Lake and the Sacramento River, McCloud River, Pit River and Squaw Creek tributaries was used to assess where and when conditions were favorable at head-of-reservoir locations upstream of proposed temperature curtains to collect juvenile fish. Head-of-reservoir is the zone of transition between the river and the upstream end of the reservoir. Criteria for evaluating locations suitable to collect these fish included water temperature and velocities in the Sacramento and McCloud tributaries. Model output was analyzed during months of downstream migration under dry, median and wet year conditions. Potential for proposed temperature curtains, anchored and floating, to improve conditions for fish migration was also evaluated with the CE-QUAL-W2 model. Use of temperature curtains to assist fish migration is a novel approach that to our knowledge has not previously been assessed for recovery of Chinook salmon and steelhead populations. Providing safe passage conditions is challenging, however the study findings may assist in formulation of a juvenile fish passage alternative that is suitable for Shasta Lake.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of reservoir properties like porosity and permeability in reservoir models typically relies on history matching of production data, well pressure data, and possibly other fluid-dynamical data. Calibrated (history-matched) reservoir models are then used for forecasting production, and designing effective strategies for improved oil and gas recovery. Here, we perform assimilation of both flow and deformation data for joint inversion of reservoir properties. Given the coupled nature of subsurface flow and deformation processes, joint inversion requires efficient simulation tools of coupled reservoir flow and mechanical deformation. We apply our coupled simulation tool to a real underground gas storage field in Italy. We simulate the initial gas production period, and several decades of seasonal natural gas storage and production. We perform a probabilistic estimation of rock properties by joint inversion of ground deformation data from geodetic measurements and fluid flow data from wells. Using an efficient implementation of the Ensemble Smoother as the estimator, and our coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics simulator as the forward model, we show that incorporating deformation data leads to a significant reduction of uncertainty in the prior distributions of rock properties such as porosity, permeability, and pore compressibility.",

It is thus important to understand year-to-year variability of the MJO. Connections of the interannual variability of the MJO to the surface, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation, have already been reported in literatures. However, the influence of stratospheric interannual variability, Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO), has not been carefully examined, while a recent study revealed that OLR anomalies associated with the MJO strengthen (weaken) during easterly (westerly) QBO phase. Therefore, our question is to examine whether and how the MJO activity changes in response to the changes associated with the QBO. How does the QBO set up changes in the background for MJO amplitude and propagation?",

            "abstract": "The base of the Himalayan metamorphic core is a folded reverse-sense shear zone exposed extensively along its transport direction. In west Nepal, along-transport exposures show a transition in structural style from hinterland to foreland, and sampled quartzite and pelite show variations in thermobarometry, quartz crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), monazite Th-Pb ages and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology.\nIn the hinterland region, the shear zone yields a deformation temperature gradient from > 700°C at the top of the shear zone down to 400°C at the base. Metamorphic grade also decreases downwards through the shear zone. Muscovite 40Ar/39Ar ages are ca. 6 Ma. In the transition zone separating hinterland and foreland on the north flank of the Karnali klippe, a comparable structural section yields a deformation temperature gradient that similarly decreases down structural level from ~700 to 500°C. Muscovite 40Ar/39Ar dating yield ca. 14-12 Ma cooling ages. In-situ monazite geochronology indicates prograde metamorphism at ca. 43-34 Ma and melt crystallization at ca. 26-18 Ma. In the foreland, deformation is not strictly brittle; CPO analyses on sheared quartzite on the south flank of the Karnali klippe suggest deformation temperatures decreasing from 500 to 400°C downwards through the shear zone. Muscovite from the foreland yields 40Ar/39Ar ages of ca. 17 Ma.\nDeformation temperatures decrease marginally from hinterland to foreland and structurally downward within the shear zone, and estimates suggest ductile deformation prevails well into the foreland. Hinterland 40Ar/39Ar muscovite ages in west Nepal are anomalously young, and are possibly related to recent exhumation due to the SE-propagating mid-Miocene Gurla Mandhata-Humla system. Alternatively, they could be linked to the activation of a young duplex in the footwall of the Himalayan metamorphic core due to along-strike variation in geometry of the Main Himalayan thrust ramp.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic fields constitute a natural link between the Sun, the Earth and the Heliosphere in general. The solar dynamo action maintains and strengthens the magnetic field in the solar interior. The structure of the solar corona is mostly determined by the configuration and evolution of the magnetic field. While open magnetic field lines carry plasma into the heliosphere, closed field lines confine plasma. Additionally, key physical processes that impact the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere on time-scale from days to millennia, such as the soft X-ray and EUV emission, are also determined by the solar magnetic field. However, observations of the solar spectral irradiance are restricted to the last few solar cycles and are subject to large uncertainties. Here we present a physics-based model to reconstruct in near-real time the evolution of the solar EUV emission based on the configuration of the magnetic field imprinted on the solar surface and assuming that the emission lines are optically thin. The structure of the coronal magnetic field is estimated employing a potential field source surface extrapolation based on the synoptic charts. The coronal plasma temperature and density are described by a hydrostatic model. The emission is estimated to employ the CHIANTI database. The performance of the model is compared to the emission observed by EVE instrument on board SDO spacecraft. The preliminary results and uncertainties are discussed in details. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of delivery the reconstruction of the solar spectral irradiance in near-real time using the infrastructure provided by the Brazilian Space weather program (EMBRACE/INPE).

            "abstract": "Intensity is one of the most useful measures of earthquake hazard, as it quantifies the strength of shaking produced at a given distance from the epicenter. Today, there are several data sources that could be used to determine intensity level which can be divided into two main categories. The first category is represented by social data sources, in which the intensity values are collected by interviewing people who experienced the earthquake-induced shaking. In this case, specially developed questionnaires can be used in addition to personal observations published on social networks such as Twitter. These observations are assigned to the appropriate intensity level by correlating specific details and descriptions to the Modified Mercalli Scale. The second category of data sources is represented by observations from different physical sensors installed with the specific purpose of obtaining an instrumentally-derived intensity level. These are usually based on a regression of recorded peak acceleration and/or velocity amplitudes. This approach relates the recorded ground motions to the expected felt and damage distribution through empirical relationships.\nThe goal of this work is to implement and evaluate streaming data processing separately and jointly from both social and physical sensors in order to produce near real-time intensity maps and compare and analyze their quality and evolution through 10-minute time intervals immediately following an earthquake. Results are shown for the case study of the M6.0 2014 South Napa, CA earthquake that occurred on August 24, 2014. The using of innovative streaming and pipelining computing paradigms through IBM InfoSphere Streams platform made it possible to read input data in real-time for low-latency computing of combined intensity level and production of combined intensity maps in near-real time. The results compare three types of intensity maps created based on physical, social and combined data sources. Here we correlate the count and density of Tweets with intensity level and show the importance of processing combined data sources at the earliest time stages after earthquake happens. This method can supplement existing approaches of intensity level detection, especially in the regions with high number of Twitter users and low density of seismic networks.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are regard as one of the most dynamic and valuable ecosystems in coastal zone. It is crucial to obtain accurate information on the species composition and spatial distribution of salt marshes in time since they are experiencing tremendous replacement and disappearance. However, discriminating various types of salt marshes is a rather difficult task because of the strong spectral similarities. In previous studies, salt marsh mappings were mainly focused on high-spatial and hyperspectral resolution imageries combined with auxiliary information but this method can hardly extend to a large region. With high temporal and moderate spatial resolutions, Chinese HJ-1 CCD imagery would not only allow monitoring phenological changes of salt marsh vegetation in short-time intervals, but also cover large areas of salt marshes. Taking the middle coast of Jiangsu (east China) as an example, our study first constructed a monthly NDVI time-series to classify various types of salt marshes. Then, we tested the idea of compressed time-series continuously to broaden the applicability and portability of this particular approach. The results showed that (1) the overall accuracy of salt marsh mapping based on the monthly NDVI time-series reached 90.3%, which increased approximately 16.0% in contrast with a single-phase classification strategy; (2) a compressed time-series, including NDVI from six key months (April, June to September, and November) demonstrated very little decline (2.3%) in overall accuracy but led to obvious improvements in unstable regions; (3) Spartina alterniflora identification could be achieved with only a scene NDVI image from November, which could provide an effective way to regularly monitor its distribution. Besides, by comparing the calibrated performance between HJ-1 CCD and other sensors (i.e., Landsat TM/ETM+, OLI), we certified the reliability of HJ-1 CCD imagery, which is expected to pave the way for laws expansibility from this imagery.",

            "abstract": "An unstructured storm surge-waves-tide coupled model, which was coupled through the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT), was developed based on the ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation model) ocean model and SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) wave model. The developed coupled model has high resolution in the coast area and can be run efficiently. By comparing with the existing ADCIRC and SWAN coupled model, which was coupled directly not through the MCT, the newly developed one can increase the simulation efficiency by 26.4 percent, when the computational grid and coupling processes of the two coupled model were the same.\nThe coupled model was used to simulate the storm surge and waves during the process of typhoon “Usagi” which formed in the western Pacific on September 17, 2013 and made landfall at Shanwei in Guangdong province. Three numerical experiments were done in the simulation to study the effect of wave-current interaction on the storm surge and waves. Results show that the coupled model can simulate the storm surge and waves well when considering the wave induced radiation stress, the wave effect on the wind stress drag coefficient and the modulation of current and water level on the waves. During the process of typhoon “Usagi”，the effect of wave radiation stress can result in a maximum of 0.75m increase in the extreme storm surge, and the wave induced wind stress can cause a -0.82~0.49m change of the extreme storm surge near the coastal area.\nThis study is valuable to the study of hurricane storm surge disaster assessment and the development of the operational storm surge prediction technique.",

            "abstract": "The San Andreas Fault (SAF) is the primary structure accommodating motion between the Pacific and North American plates. The Coachella Valley segment of the southern SAF has not ruptured historically, and is considered overdue for an earthquake because it has exceeded its average recurrence interval. In the northwestern Coachella Valley, this fault splits into three additional fault strands: the Mission Creek strand, which strikes northwest in the San Bernardino Mountains, and the Banning and Garnet Hill strands, which continue west, transferring slip into San Gorgonio Pass. Determining how slip is partitioned between these faults is critical for southern California seismic hazard models. Recent work near the southern end of the Mission Creek strand at Biskra Palms yielded a slip rate of ~14-17 mm/yr since 50 ka, and new measurements from Pushawalla Canyon suggest a possible rate of ~20 mm/yr since 2.5 ka and 70 ka. Slip appears to transfer away from the Mission Creek strand and to the Banning and Garnet Hill strands within the Indio Hills, but the slip rate for the Garnet Hill strand is unknown and the 4-5 mm/yr slip rate for the Banning strand is applicable only since the mid Holocene. Additional constraints on the Holocene slip rate for the Mission Creek strand are critical for resolving the total slip rate for the southern SAF, and also for comparing slip rates on all three fault strands in the northern Coachella Valley over similar time scales. We have identified a new slip rate site at the southern end of the Mission Creek strand between Pushawalla and Biskra Palms. At this site, (the Three Palms Site), three alluvial fans sourced from three distinct catchments have been displaced approximately 80 meters by the Mission Creek Strand. Initial observations from an exploratory pit excavated into the central fan show soil development consistent with Holocene fan deposition and no evidence of soil profile disruption. To more precisely constrain the minimum depositional timing of the most well-defined alluvial fan, we are currently processing samples for U-series analysis of pedogenic carbonate. We expect this to result in a maximum bound of the Holocene slip rate on the Mission Creek Strand. Future Be-10 exposure age measurements from surface cobbles will independently constrain fan age yielding a complementary Holocene slip rate.",

            "abstract": "Mesozoic climate change has been extensively studied in the Tethys, while their expression in the proto Gulf of Mexico can still be precised, especially for the time period straddling the Aptian-Albian boundary. During this time period, significant climatic events may correlate between the proto-Atlantic and the Tethys, amongst which the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1b that corresponds to a period of marine anoxia across this stage boundary. We hypothesized that this event may have impacted the shallow-marine carbonate factory that is now preserved near the town of Bisbee (Mule Mountains, southern Arizona). This sedimentary succession has been chosen because it documents a switch from a siliclastic- to carbonate-dominated sedimentation during the targeted time interval.\nUsing carbon isotope chemostratigraphy, we were able to refine the stratigraphic framework of the Mural Formation, which was previously based on benthic organisms such as rudist bivalves and orbitolinids, such as Mesorbitolina texana. The OAE1b has been identified based on its peculiar δ13C signature supported by biostratigraphic data. Concurrently, microfacies analysis helped in reconstructing variations in sea levels. In southern Arizona, the OAE1b equivalent belongs to a third-order transgressive systems tract, and extends into the following highstand systems track. The maximum flooding surface is defined within a thick rudist biostrome with chondrodonts. It thus seems that the OAE1b did not strongly affected the carbonate factory in this region of the proto Gulf of Mexico.\nAs a conclusion, limestone rocks now preserved in southeastern Arizona were deposited during the Late Aptian to Early Albian time period, during which the OAE1b developed. This paleoceanographic perturbation is expressed in the sedimentary record by its unique carbon isotope signature, with no significant impact on benthic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Drylands cover 41% of the terrestrial surface and provide > $1 trillion in ecosystem services to one-third of the global population, yet are not well studied with estimates of degradation ranging from 10 – 80%. Here I will present an abbreviated history of the use of remote sensing (RS) to monitor Dryland degradation, review contemporary applications, and provide guidance for future directions. These early monitoring attempts (and some recent efforts) assumed the social model of “Tragedy of the Commons” and the ecological model of “the Balance of Nature”. These assumptions justified a monitoring approach rather than an assessment, where land degradation was understood to be primarily a function of human action through livestock grazing management. The perceived linear impact of grazing on grassland biomass led to the early development of a remote sensing-based proxy of vegetation response: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Many RS studies of Drylands are biased towards the NDVI or variants, whereas the contemporary view of Drylands as complex systems has led to a new synthesis of approaches from ecological modeling, ecohydrology, landscape ecology, and remote sensing that now explicitly confront both multiple drivers that include land-use policy, droughts & floods, fire, and responses that include increased soil erosion and changes in soil quality, landscape composition, pattern, and structure. However, problems still abound including 1) a consensus on the definition of Drylands, 2) the need for time series of drivers to conduct assessments, 3) a lack of understanding of below-ground biomass dynamics, 4) improved mapping of grassland, shrubland, and savanna dryland cover types and their 3D structure. There are new technologies in Dryland RS including multi-frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR), RADAR, IFSAR, LIDAR, and MISR that may lead to the development of new indicators to address these issues.",

            "abstract": "Authigenic carbonate rocks from an active seep (Site F) at 1120 m water depth of the South China Sea (SCS) were studied using mineralogical and lipid biomarker analyses. Carbonate mineral compositions, in specific samples, were predominantly aragonite, high-Mg calcite (HMC), or a mixture of both. Abundant 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers (various isoprenoids) diagnostic for archaea provide evidence that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and their bacterial partners is the major process leading to formation of the carbonates. Nearly a pure suite of AOM biomarkers was preserved in aragonitic carbonate in which predominant consortia were most likely ANME-2/Desulfosarcina & Desulfococcus (DSS) assemblages and a mixture of ANME-2/DSS and ANME-1/DSS consortia in the mixed mineral sample, the predominant consortia are in good accordance with the point that the relative higher methane seepage intensity favors the precipitation of aragonite over HMC. In contrast, the completely different biomarker patterns in HMC sample were mainly composed terrestrial organic matter and marine Thaumarchaea, which most likely originally within sediments accompanied with high organic matter input and low methane supply. This environment is known to be favored for archaea of ANME-1 and precipitation of HMC. High concentrations of 13C-depleted hopanoids, including diplopterol, hopanoic acids and hopanols were observed in the aragonite sample that may be sourced by the intermittent presence of oxic conditions in an overall anoxic condition, which was possibly induced by changing seepage intensities.",

            "abstract": "We use pre-stack reverse-time migration (RTM) of converted waves to image crust and mantle structures of the Himalaya-Tibet collision zone. Multi-component seismic data are back propagated using FDTD method of elastic wave. P and SV components are separated through the divergence and curl of the reconstructed wave-field. Cross-correlation imaging condition is applied between the back propagated P and SV wave-fields to reconstruct the location of the points where conversion (e.g., P-to-S or S-to-P) occurred. Unlike traditional CCP receiver function stacking, this method does not rely on 1-D assumptions about the geometry of structures, so that it is able to cope with dipping interface, steep faults. Then we applied this method on data of the southern segment of Hi-CLIMB. The chosen seismic array consists of 76 stations and it is 260-kilometer-long extending northward from the Ganges Basin and across the Himalayas. By pre-stack RTM, we have constructed an image of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Himalayas. The image reveals that the Moho dip from a normal depth of 45 km at distance of 120 km ~ 190 km to a much deeper depth of 65 km at 200 km ~ 270 km under southern Tibet. There are also some weak signal in the crust with the same trend of Moho at this region. This may also be related to the underthrusting of Indian plate beneath Tibet. This result of pre-stack RTM consists with previous results obtained by receiver function, but has a steeper change of the depth of Moho.",

            "abstract": "Stable Mg isotopes are an emerging geochemical tool for studying dolomite-related problems. Currently available Mg isotope fractionation factors for dolomite are calibrated at hydrothermal conditions. Direct measurement of low temperature Mg isotope fractionation between dolomite and aqueous solution is hampered by the difficulty of synthesis of dolomite at ambient abiotic conditions. Dolomite analogue minerals including PbMg(CO3)2 and BaMg(CO3)2, however, can be readily synthesized at low temperatures. Therefore study of fractionation factors of Mg isotopes during PbMg(CO3)2 and BaMg(CO3)2 precipitation at low temperature conditions provides insights on Mg isotope behavior during dolomitization in geological processes..\nWe successfully synthesized PbMg(CO3)2 and BaMg(CO3)2 at 30-80ºC and characterized the products using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In general, the crystallinity of PbMg(CO3)2 and BaMg(CO3)2 correlated with temperature. PbMg(CO3)2 synthesized at below 40℃ formed aggregates of nanocrystals. The aggregates became fewer in experiments at higher temperatures, and fine-grained (200~600nm in size), euhedral rhombohedrons of PbMg(CO3)2 were produced in the experiment at 80℃. In BaMg(CO3)2 synthesis experiments, morphology of BaMg(CO3)2 was mainly granular but the crystal size increased from 20 to 100nm with increasing temperature, and 0.5-1.1µm sized euhedral to subhedral crystals were produced at 70 and 80℃. Preliminary Mg isotope analyses for the experimental products show that Δ26Mg fractionation between PbMg(CO3)2 and aqueous solution at 40℃ is -1.87‰, whereas Δ26Mg fractionation between BaMg(CO3)2 and aqueous solution at 40℃ is -1.40‰. The result is consistent with the idea that heavy Mg isotopes favor shorter and stronger Mg-O bonds in minerals.",

            "abstract": "Seismic waveform inversion is widely used, and can provide robust results with seismic data. However, in applying waveform inversion techniques to field data there are still many difficulties, such as the local minima problem, the lack of low-frequency components in seismic data, etc. To overcome these problems, several waveform inversion methods have been proposed in order to obtain a velocity model with long-wavelength features. A feature common to these inversion methods is one where they all reproduce low-frequency components, but the actual methods of reproduction of the low-frequencies are different from method to method. In particular, domain (e.g., Laplace transform) and trace (e.g., envelope function, spectral decomposition) transforms are widely utilized to reproduce the enhanced low-frequency components. Since the characteristics of a given reproduced low-frequency component depend on the transformation method, analysis of each method is needed in order to consider its effective application.\nIn this study, we compared three different inversion methods (Laplace, envelope, and spectrogram inversion) which use the reproduced low-frequency components of seismic data. Firstly, each reproduced seismic data set was analyzed by frequency analysis. It showed that each transformation method reproduces the enhanced low-frequency components. Secondly, we plotted the contours of objective functions using each transformation method. This demonstrated that these inversion methods have a global minimum. Finally, we performed waveform inversion using the modified SEG/EAGE salt A-A’ line model. Numerical examples, with three different inversion methods, indicate that long-wavelength velocity models were generated well. In particular, spectrogram inversion with several decomposed signals recovered the characteristics of subsurface structures more clearly. However, the computational efficiency of the spectrogram inversion was less than that of other approaches.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution late Holocene climate records that can resolve seasonality are essential for confirming past climatic dynamics, understanding the late 20th century global warming and predicting future climate. Here a new composite record of the sea surface temperature, SST, variation in the northern South China Sea (SCS) during the late Holocene is constructed by combining seven seasonally-resolved coral and T. gigas Sr/Ca-based SST time-windows with the instrumental SST record from modern interval between 1990 and 2000. This composite multi-proxy marine record, together with the reconstructions from mainland China and tropical western Pacific, indicates that the late Holocene warm periods, the Roman Warm Period (RWP) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP), were prominently imprinted and documented in the climatic and environmental history of the East Asia-Western Pacific region. Meanwhile, substantial and significant SST seasonality variations during the late Holocene were observed in the composite record. The observed increase in seasonality (or amplitude of seasonal cycles) during the cold periods around our study area was probably caused by the different amplitudes between winter versus summer SST variations in northern SCS, with much larger SST variation during winters than during summers for the late Holocene. In addition, the distinctive warm, cold and neutral climatic episodes identified in our northern SCS composite SST record correspond well with other paleo reconstructions from mainland China and especially well with the Northern Hemisphere-wide composites by Moberg et al. (2005) and Ljungqvist (2010). The overall agreement however also calls for more information and insights on how seasonal temperatures and their ranges vary on multidecadal to bicentennial timescales.",

            "abstract": "In order to effectively predict and mitigate the potential risks from leakage of stored CO2, we must first understand the physicochemical processes that CO2 undergoes during migration through shallow aquifers, including dissolved phase advection and dispersion as well as gas phase exsolution, multiphase flow, and dissolution. Since field sites are inherently large-scale, heterogeneous, 3-D systems, large-scale experimental data is important to validate numerical models and to make confident predictions regarding CO2 migration.\nA large, highly instrumented, two-dimensional tank was built and packed with porous media to represent a portion of a layered shallow aquifer. Flow of water across the tank was established by applying a small difference in head between the two ends. A separate stream of water was then saturated with dissolved CO2 and injected into the bottom of the tank near the upstream end. Various saturation sensors measured the spatiotemporal pattern of gas phase evolution in the tank, while an external sensor and an Ion Chromatograph were used to monitor the dissolved CO2 concentrations at various locations in the system. The top of the tank was baffled into four sealed compartments, each of which was connected to a gas flow meter to monitor the spatiotemporal pattern of gas phase CO2 release to the atmosphere.\nNumerical simulations were also performed to better understand the fundamental physics that drove the observed CO2 evolution processes, and to help validate a widely used code using the experimental data. The simulations were performed with the Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer (FEHM) software that was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The model domain, porous media properties, and initial conditions were set up to match those of the experiment, and the boundary conditions were adjusted to investigate the mass transfer between the dissolved and gaseous phases of CO2 that developed within the system.\nResults from both the experiments and the simulations indicate that the layer of fine material prevented any release of gas phase CO2 to the atmosphere. In addition, exsolved gas phase CO2 accumulated beneath the fine layer and slowly dissolved into the clean water that came from the upstream end of the tank. This led to significant attenuation of dissolved CO2 migration throughout the system.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the risk of severe wildfires has been increasing, in part due to weather phenomena such as sequences of wet and drought years and increasing urban expansion into wildland areas that are vulnerable to seasonal wildfires. This is particularly the case in Texas where grassland ecosystems accrue vegetative growth during wet years that when senesced can be vulnerable to wildfire during a subsequent drought year. The Texas Forest Service (TFS) is tasked with estimating and evaluating potential fire risk to manage and allocate resources for the prevention and containment of possible wildfires across the state. Some of the main components for assessing fire risk in this region are understanding the location and fire risk for available vegetative fuel types, as well as fuel load dynamics. NASA Earth Observations help provide a means for vegetative conditions of wildfire fuels (i.e. land cover types) and related land surface phenology across large temporal and spatial scales. The project was conducted in collaboration with the TFS, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat OLI to calculate vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and produce fuel type and fuel load maps. The relative strengths of two satellite sensors were combined, leveraging the temporal resolution of MODIS with the higher spatial resolution of Landsat OLI. The project applied data fusion techniques, resulting in wildfire fuel maps that were created for the 2010-2011 fire season, which saw some of the worst wildfires in recent history, and for the 2014-2015 season to provide a current assessment of wildfire fuels. The end products provided a means to identify and assess wildfire risk in terms of fuel load type. The TFS is using project results to assess the potential for combined use of MODIS and Landsat data in order to better understand potential wildfire fuel loads and risks across the state.",

The analyzed tropical cyclone track and intensity data set provided by Korea Meteorological Administration and 11 numerical model outputs - GDAPS, GEPS, GFS (data resolution; 50 and 100 km), GFES, HWRF, IFS(data resolution; 50 and 100 km), IFS EPS, JGSM, and TEPS - during 2011-2014 were used for this study. The procedure suggested in this study was divided into two stages: selecting and weighting process. First several numerical models were chosen based on the past model’s performances in the selecting stage. Next, weights, referred to as regression coefficients, for each model forecasts were calculated by applying the linear and nonlinear regression technique to past model forecast data in the weighting stage. Finally, tropical cyclone forecasts were determined by using both selected and weighted multi-model values at that forecast time. The preliminary result showed that selected MME’s improvement rate (%) was more than 5% comparing with non-selected MME at 72 h track forecast.",

Surprisingly bright features were first revealed in the Keck adaptive-optics images in August; this initial set of observations motivated follow-up observations around the world. One of the storms (identified as “Feature F” in Sromovsky et al. 2015, and Feature 2 in de Pater et al. 2015), which was the deepest in that dataset, was bright enough that it was detected by multiple amateur observers, permitting us to trigger a Hubble Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation on October 14th, 2014. A complex of features at this latitude was also observed by Hubble as part of the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program on November 8-9, 2014. We will present the temporal evolution of the cloud activities from August 2014 through January 2015, and analyze the vertical structure of the cloud features in the Hubble datasets.\nThe Hubble images used in our study were collected with support of HST grants GO13712 to KMS and GO13937 to AAS.\nSromovsky et al. 2015, “High S/N Keck and Gemini AO imaging of Uranus during 2012–2014: New cloud patterns, increasing activity, and improved wind measurements.” Icarus 258, 192-223.\nde Pater et al. 2014, “Record-breaking storm activity on Uranus in 2014.” Icarus 252, 121-128",

            "abstract": "The Elk River is a mountain watershed located along the eastern border of British Columbia, Canada. The Elk River is confined by railway bridges, roads, and urban areas. Flooding has been a concern in the valley for more than a century. The most recent major flood event occurred in 2013 affecting several communities. River modifications such as riprapped dykes, channelization, and dredging have occurred in an attempt to reduce inundation, with limited success. Significant changes in land cover/land use (LCLU) such as natural state to urban, forestry practices, and mining from underground to mountaintop/valley fill have changed terrain and ground surfaces thereby altering water infiltration and runoff processes in the watershed. Future climate change in this region is expected to alter air temperature and precipitation as well as produce an earlier seasonal spring freshet potentially impacting future flood events.  \nThe objective of this research is to model historical and future hydrological conditions to identify flood frequency and risk under a range of climate and LCLU change scenarios in the Elk River watershed. Historic remote sensing data, forest management plans, and mining industry production/post-mining reclamation plans will be used to create a predictive past and future LCLU time series. A range of future air temperature and precipitation scenarios will be developed based on accepted Global Climate Modelling (GCM) research to examine how the hydrometeorological conditions may be altered under a range of future climate scenarios. The GENESYS (GENerate Earth SYstems Science input) hydrometeorological model will be used to simulate climate and LCLU to assess historic and potential future flood frequency and magnitude. Results will be used to create innovative flood mitigation, adaptation, and management strategies for the Elk River with the intent of being wildlife friendly and non-destructive to ecosystems and habitats for native species.",

            "abstract": "Much of the previous work on sediment tracing has focused on determining either the initial sources of the sediment (soils derive from a particular rock type) or the erosion processes generating the sediment. However, alluvial stores can be both a source and sink for sediment transported by streams. Here geochemical and fallout radionuclide tracing of river-bed and alluvial sediments are used to determine the role of secondary sources, sediment stores, as potential sources of sediment leaving Emu Creek catchment, southeastern Queensland, Australia. Activity concentrations of 137Cs on the river sediments are consistent with channel erosion being the dominant source at all sites sampled along the river. To characterise the deposition and remobilisation cycles in the catchment, a novel geochemical tracing approach was used. Successive pockets of alluvium were treated as discrete sink terms within geochemical mixing models and their source contributions compared with those of river bed sediments collected adjacent to each alluvial pocket. Three different size fractions were examined; silts and clays (<10 μm), silts (10-63 μm), and fine sands (63-212 μm). The contribution of the initial soil/rock type sources to river bed and alluvial sediments at each sampling site was identical for all three different size fractions, but varied along the stream. Combining these findings it is concluded that proximal alluvial stores dominated the supply of sediment to the river at each location, with this being particularly evident at the catchment outlet. Identical contribution of rock type sources to both river bed and alluvial pockets together with the dominant erosion being from channel banks indicates a high degree of ‘trading’ between the fluvial space and the alluvial space. Hence, management works aimed at primarily reducing the supply of sediments to the outlet of Emu Creek should focus on rehabilitation of channel banks in the lower catchment.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has executed four close flybys of Dione during its mission at Saturn with one additional flyby planned as of this writing. The Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument observed the plasma wave spectrum during each of the four encounters and plans to make additional observations during the 17 August 2015 flyby. These observations are joined by those from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS), Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI), and the Magnetometer instrument (MAG), although neither CAPS nor MAG data were available for the fourth flyby. The first and fourth flybys were near polar passes while the second and third were near wake passes. The second flyby occurred during a time of hot plasma injections which are not thought to be specifically related to Dione. The Dione plasma wave environment is characterized by an intensification of the upper hybrid band and whistler mode chorus. The upper hybrid band shows frequency fluctuations with a period of order 1 minute that suggest density variations of up to 10%. These density variations are anti-correlated with the magnetic field magnitude, suggesting a mirror mode wave. Other than these periodic density fluctuations there appears to be no local plasma source which would be observed as a local enhancement in the density although variations in the electron distribution are apparent. Wake passages show a deep density depletion consistent with a plasma cavity downstream of the moon. Energetic particles show portions of the distribution apparently absorbed by the moon leading to anisotropies that likely drive both the intensification of the upper hybrid band as well as the whistler mode emissions. We investigate the role of electron anisotropies and enhanced hot electron fluxes in the intensification of the upper hybrid band and whistler mode emissions.",

It is implemented by national data producers such as the US Geological Survey for surface water time series, the NOAA/National Weather Service for forecast time series, the French Geological Survey for groundwater level monitoring, and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for surface water observations. But WaterML 2.0 is not “just for water”. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has recognized its potential role as a common time series description that could work for multiple application domains such as meteorology, climate, oceanography, and others. Accordingly, the WMO requested the OGC to migrate the non-hydrology parts of WaterML 2.0 to a new standard to be called TimeseriesML. This would then be considered by WMO for adoption as an operational standard globally. What does this mean for the geosciences? How far can this time series description be applied? What about time series of satellite retrievals? What will happen to WaterML 2.0 (and applications that work with it) when TimeseriesML is finished?

            "abstract": "Plume spreading promotes the molecular mixing that drives chemical reactions in porous media in general, and remediation reactions in groundwater aquifers in particular. Theoretical analysis suggests that engineered injection and extraction, a specific sequence of pumping through wells surrounding a contaminant plume, can improve groundwater remediation through chaotic advection. Selection of an engineered injection and extraction scheme is difficult, however, because the engineer is faced with the difficulty of recommending a pumping scheme for a contaminated site without having any previous knowledge of how the scheme will perform. To address this difficulty, this presentation describes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to help engineers develop, test, and observe pumping schemes as described in previous research (Mays, D.C. and Neupauer, R.M., 2012, Plume spreading in groundwater by stretching and folding, Water Resour. Res., 48, W07501, doi:10.1029/2011WR011567). The inputs allow the user to manipulate the model conditions such as number of wells, plume size, and pumping scheme. Plume evolution is modeled, assuming no diffusion or dispersion, using analytical solutions for injection or extraction through individual wells or pairs or wells (i.e., dipoles). Using the GUI, an engineered injection and extraction scheme can be determined that best fits the remediation needs of the contaminated site. By creating multiple injection and extraction schemes, the user can learn about the plume shapes created from different schemes and, ultimately, recommend a pumping scheme based on some experience of fluid flow as shown in the GUI. The pumping schemes developed through this GUI are expected to guide more advanced modeling and laboratory studies that account for the crucial role of dispersion in groundwater remediation.",

            "abstract": "Large solar events can have severe adverse global impacts at Earth. These solar events also can propagate throughout the heliopshere and into the interstellar medium. We focus on the July 2012 and Halloween 2003 solar events. We simulate these events starting from the vicinity of the Sun at 2.5 Rs. We compare our three dimensional (3D) time-dependent simulations to available spacecraft (s/c) observations at 1 AU and beyond. Based on the comparisons of the predictions from our simulations with in-situ measurements we find that the effects of these large solar events can be observed in the outer heliosphere, the heliosheath, and even into the interstellar medium. We use two simulation models. The HAFSS (HAF Source Surface) model is a kinematic model. HHMS-PI (Hybrid Heliospheric Modeling System with Pickup protons) is a numerical magnetohydrodynamic solar wind (SW) simulation model. Both HHMS-PI and HAFSS are ideally suited for these analyses since starting at 2.5 Rs from the Sun they model the slowly evolving background SW and the impulsive, time-dependent events associated with solar activity. Our models naturally reproduce dynamic 3D spatially asymmetric effects observed throughout the heliosphere. Pre-existing SW background conditions have a strong influence on the propagation of shock waves from solar events. Time-dependence is a crucial aspect of interpreting s/c data. We show comparisons of our simulation results with STEREO A, ACE, Ulysses, and Voyager s/c observations.",

Such collaboration has been exhibited between stakeholders, researchers, and a boundary organization—the Aspen Global Change Institute—since 2005 in assessing impacts and crafting policies in response with regard to climate change impacts in the mountain watershed surrounding Aspen, CO. A series of structured stakeholder interviews and town hall sessions, impact assessment reports, and intensive collaboration between various information providers and user groups has set the stage for development of both mitigation of and adaptation to climate change impacts. The most recent example of this has included the use of global scale climate model output to inform the development of resiliency strategies in response to extreme precipitation projections. The use of this kind of resource has been considered in a variety of decision-making contexts and has included the development of region- and decision-relevant qualitative scenarios that make use of quantitative model-based information.

            "abstract": "Coronal cavities are often observed as circular or elliptical-shaped, darkned regions above the solar limb in EUV coronal images. They are believed to be regions of lower density relative to the surrounding corona. The cavity surrounds the prominence: prior to the eruption and as an aspect of CMEs. We used SDO/AIA limb synoptic maps, constructed from annuli above the solar limb; best show cavities in the 211Å, 193Å and 171Å passbands. The prominence associated with each cavity is best seen in the 304Å synoptic maps. We observed 429 cavities between May 2010 - Feb 2015. We examined correlations between each cavity's height, width and length. Our findings showed that around 38% of cavities were prolate, 27% oblate and 35% circular in shape. The lengths of the cavities ranged from 0.06-2.9 R¤. When a cavity is longer than 1.5 R¤ it has a narrower height range (0.1-0.3 R¤), whereas when the cavity was shorter than 1.5 R¤, it had a wider height range (0.07-0.5 R¤). We find that the overall 3-D topology of the long stable cavities can be characterized as a long tube with an elliptical cross section. We also noticed that the circular and oblate cavities are longer in length than prolate cavities. We also studied the physical mechanisms behind the cavity drift towards the pole and found it to be tied to the meridional flow. Finally, by observing the evolution cavity regions using SDO/HMI surface magnetic field observations, we found cavity belt formed near the polar coronal hole boundary. Results showed that the cavity belt migrated towards higher latitude with time and the cavity belt disappeared after the polar magnetic field reversal. This result shows that cavity evolution provides new insight into the solar cycle. Moreover, we selected 30 random cavities from our catalog and studied their morphology, thermal properties, linear polarization signatures, precursors of eruption, and underlying magnetic field and tried to interpret the shapes and stability of the cavities.",

            "abstract": "Pinder River, one of major headstreams of River Ganga, originates in Pindari Glaciers of Kumaon Himalayas and after passing through rugged gorges meets Alaknanda at Karanprayag forming one of the five celestial confluences of Upper Ganga region. While other sub-basins of Upper Ganga are facing severe ecological losses, Pinder basin is still in its virginal state and is well known for its beautiful valleys besides being host to unique and rare biodiversity.\nA proposed 252 MW run-of-river hydroelectric project at Devsari on this river has been a major concern on account of its perceived potential for egregious environmental and social impacts. In this context, the study presented tries to analyse the expected changes in aquatic habitat conditions after this project is operational (with different operation policies). SWAT hydrological modelling platform has been used to derive stream flow simulations under various scenarios ranging from the present to the likely future conditions. To analyse the habitat conditions, a two dimensional hydraulic-habitat model 'River-2D', a module of iRIC software, is used. Snow trout has been identified as the target keystone species and its habitat preferences, in the form of flow depths, flow velocity and substrate condition, are obtained from diverse sources of related literature and are provided as Habitat Suitability Indices to River-2D.\nBed morphology constitutes an important River-2D input and has been obtained, for the designated 1 km long study reach of Pinder upto Karanprayag, from a combination of actual field observations and supplemented by SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global digital elevation data.\nMonthly Weighted Usable Area for three different life stages (Spawning, Juvenile and Adult) of Snow Trout are obtained corresponding to seven different flow discharges ranging from 10 cumec to 1000 cumec. Comparing the present and proposed future river flow conditions obtained from SWAT modelling, losses in Weighted Usable Area, for the aforementioned three life stages, are estimated for a range of possible operating policies at the proposed Devsari project. While the study suggests a limited loss of habitat for spawning and juveniles, however, results suggest that adults face the potential of up to 70% loss of their habitat.",

            "abstract": "A modeling study is performed in the Colorado River Basin by varying the ratio of dust and aerosol pollution. The Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modeling system (RAMS) version 6.0 is used for the analyses with the aerosol and dust pollution data being nudged from the GEOS-Chem. RAMS was modified to ingest GEOS-CHEM output data and periodically update aerosol fields. GEOS-CHEM is a chemical transport model which uses assimilated meteorological data from the NASA Goddard Earth Observation System (GEOS). The aerosol data comprise a sum of hydrophobic and hydrophilic black carbon and organic aerosol, hydrophilic SOAs, hydrocarbon oxidation and inorganic aerosols (nitrate, sulfate and ammonium). In addition, a RAMS-based dust source and transport model is used. The sensitivity studies are 5 different kinds. The base study has both the dust and aerosol pollution data ON. The Case 2 has dust OFF with only the aerosol sources ON. The Case 3 has the aerosol sources ON with dust multiplied by a factor of 3. Case 4 has the aerosol sources ON with dust multiplied by a factor of 10. Case 5 and Case 6 are the simulations where dust can act only as CCN and only as IN respectively. It was found that the precipitation increases when dust is increased 3 times. However, the response is non-monotonic when dust is increased 10 times and the response depends on the environmental conditions. Dust acting as CCN acts in opposition to dust acting as IN. In general, dust acting as IN tends to enhance precipitation in wintertime orographic clouds.",

Precipitation distribution differs by sub-region, and is predominantly influenced by phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Forecasters currently rely on ENSO climatologies from sparse in situ station data to inform their precipitation outlooks. This project provided an updated ENSO-based climatology of long-term precipitation patterns for each USAPI Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the NOAA PERSIANN Climate Data Record (CDR). This data provided a 30-year record (1984-2015) of daily precipitation at 0.25° resolution, which was used to calculate monthly, seasonal, and yearly precipitation. Results indicated that while the PERSIANN precipitation accurately described the monthly, seasonal, and annual trends, it under-predicted the precipitation on the islands. Additionally, maps showing percent departure from normal (30 year average) were made for each three month season based on the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for five ENSO phases (moderate-strong El Niño and La Niña, weak El Niño and La Niña, and neutral). Local weather service offices plan on using these results and maps to better understand how the different ENSO phases influence precipitation patterns.",

            "abstract": "Digital elevation models (DEMs) are commonly used for large-scale watershed hydrologic and water quality modeling. With aid of the latest LiDAR technology, submeter scale DEM data are often available for many areas in the United States. Precise characterization of the detailed variations in surface microtopography using such high-resolution DEMs is crucial to the related watershed modeling. Various methods have been developed to delineate a watershed, including determination of flow directions and accumulations, identification of subbasin boundaries, and calculation of the relevant topographic parameters. The objective of this study is to examine different DEM-based watershed delineation methods by comparing their unique features and the discrepancies in their results. Not only does this study cover the traditional watershed delineation methods, but also a new puddle-based unit (PBU) delineation method. The specific topics and issues to be presented involve flow directions (D8 single flow direction vs. multi-direction methods), segmentation of stream channel\ns, drainage systems (single “depressionless” drainage network vs. hierarchical depression-dominated drainage system), and hydrologic connectivity (static structural connectivity vs. dynamic functional connectivity). A variety of real topographic surfaces are selected and delineated by using the selected methods. Comparisons of their delineation results emphasize the importance of selection of the methods and highlight their applicability and potential impacts on watershed modeling.",

            "abstract": "On sol 991, The Curiosity rover ascended a steep slope to Marias Pass in Gale Crater. Close to the top, ChemCam analyzed the rock target Elk from an apparent bright unit. Utilizing the new elemental calibration implemented for ChemCam in the summer of 2015, four of five points on Elk were measured to contain 76-82 wt% SiO2 and >3 wt% TiO2, whereas the last point showed elevated CaSO4. The Elk target is identified to be part of the Murray formation, and hence related to the Pahrump area mudstones that were subjected to intensive studies by the Curiosity rover team over the sols 758-948. While the Murray formation west of Elk did show elevated SiO2 (~65 wt%) compared to the Pahrump area, no targets with similarly high SiO2 wt% as Elk were observed, thus prompting - together with detection of anomalously high DAN H signals in the same area - the Curiosity rover to return to the Elk target area for additional analyses. This return led to numerous additional high Si observations (targets Pistol, Mary, Shepard, Dublin Gulch and Frog) that all corroborated the initial high Si observation at Elk. Additionally, the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) analyzed the target Lamoose and found SiO2 content in excess of 72 wt% and moderately elevated TiO2. Considering the difference in footprint (1.7 cm for APXS vs ~400μm for ChemCam) and the fact that the target couldn’t be brushed, this is considered a good corroboration of the very high Si observed with ChemCam.\nThese targets suggest that the Elk-area targets represent an end-member of the Murray formation, but there are multiple working hypotheses for the origin of the high SiO2 and TiO2 in these: 1. primary precipitates from the water column of a lake, 2. a post-depositional leaching/weathering front and 3. a hydrothermal silica precipitate.",

However, their interpretation is not straightforward due to the simultaneous influences of a number of confounding factors, including carry-over effects from previous years, variable resource allocation with size, age, and canopy position, species-specific physiologies, and complex interactions between forcings such as temperature, soil moisture, and atmospheric CO2. Here we attempt to tease these factors apart and so substantially improve the interpretability of tree ring archives through the construction and application of novel approaches within a process-based model of individual tree growth. The model incorporates descriptions of xylem cell division, expansion, and secondary wall thickening, apical and lateral meristem activities with internal controls from internal signals, internal carbon storage, and the dynamics of canopy photosynthesis, stomatal movements, evapotranspiration, canopy temperatures, and soil moisture. Alternative treatments of isotopic fractionation and growth controls are evaluated using measured datasets. We demonstrate how this new model approach can be used to assess the information contained in tree rings concerning the influence of increasing atmospheric CO2 over the past century on growth and water use efficiency at a range of sites.",

            "abstract": "The use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer was rapidly growing up after the birth of Haber-Bosch process in the early 20th century. The recent N loading derived from these sources on terrestrial ecosystems was estimated 2 times higher than biogenic N fixation in terrestrial ecosystems (Gruber et al., 2009). However, there are still large uncertainties in cumulative N impacts on terrestrial impact at global scale. In this study, to assess historical N impacts at global scale, we made a new global N fertilizer input map, which was a spatial-temporal explicit map (during 1960-2010) and considered the fraction of NH4+ and NO3- in the N fertilizer inputs. With the developed N fertilizer map, we evaluated historical N20 cycling changes by land-use changes and N depositions in N cycling using ecosystem model ‘VISIT’.\nPrior to the downscaling processes for global N fertilizer map, we applied the statistical data imputation to FAOSTAT data due to there existing many missing data especially in developing countries. For the data imputation, we used multiple data imputation method proposed by Honaker & King (2010). The statistics of various types of synthetic fertilizer consumption are available in FAOSTAT, which can be sorted by the content of NH4+ and NO3-, respectively. To downscaling the country by country N fertilizer consumptions data to the 0.5˚x 0.5˚ grid-based map, we used historical land-use map in Earthstat (Rumankutty et al., 1999). Before the assignment of N fertilizer in each grid, we weighted the double cropping regions to be more N fertilizer input on to these regions. Using M3-Crops Data (Monfreda et al., 2008), we picked up the dominant cropping species in each grid cell. After that, we used Crop Calendar in SAGE dataset (Sacks et al., 2010) and determined schedule of N fertilizer input in each grid cell using dominant crop calendar. Base fertilizer was set to be 7 days before transplanting and second fertilizer to be 30 days after base fertilizer application.\nFirst, we compared the differences in historical changes of geographic distribution between the new fertilizer map and N deposition maps. Finally, we introduce how the accounting NH4+:NO3- ratio in global fertilizer changes the amount of global N2O emission in ecosystem model simulations using VISIT.",

            "abstract": "Push-pull (single-well-injection-withdrawal) tracer tests are widely used as an economical means of characterizing field-scale solute transport properties such as sorption and dispersion. Typically, these are analyzed by means of analytic solutions that assume transport obeys the radial advection-dispersion equation. We revisit this approach as: (1) Recognition of the ubiquity of anomalous transport and its impact on contaminant remediation necessitates the use of new methods to characterize it, and (2) Improved computational power and numerical methods have rendered reliance on analytical solutions obsolete. Here, we present a technique for characterizing diffusion-driven anomalous transport (i.e., anomalous transport driven by a “trapping” process whose trapping and release statistics are independent of the groundwater flow velocity). Examples include diffusion into low permeability zones, kinetic sorption, and matrix diffusion. Using field observations, we simultaneously calibrate an exponential probability distribution for time spent on a single sojourn in the mobile domain and a truncated power law probability distribution for time spent on a single sojourn in the immobile domain via a stochastic global optimization technique. The calibrated distributions, being independent of the flow regime, are applicable to the same domain under any flow conditions, including linear flow. In the context of the continuous time random walk (CTRW), one may simply define a transition to represent a single trap-and-release cycle, and directly compute the spatiotemporal transition distribution that defines the CTRW from the two calibrated distributions and the local seepage velocity (so that existing CTRW transport theory applies). A test of our methodology against a push-pull test from the MADE site demonstrated fitting performance comparable to that of a 3-D MODFLOW/MT3DMS model with a variety of hydraulic conductivity zones and explicit treatment of mobile-immobile mass transfer. In particular, our model captured the heavy tail portion of the breakthrough curve nearly perfectly. Use of the technique for characterization of dual porosity media and uncertainty analysis at a major remediation site at LANL will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Physical samples, particularly in the geosciences, are key to understanding the Earth system, its history, and its evolution. Our record of the Earth as captured by physical samples is difficult to explain and mine for understanding, due to incomplete, disconnected, and evolving metadata content. This is further complicated by differing ways of classifying, cataloguing, publishing, and searching the metadata, especially when specimens do not fit neatly into a single domain—for example, fossils cross disciplinary boundaries (mineral and biological). Sometimes even the fundamental classification systems evolve, such as the geological time scale, triggering daunting processes to update existing specimen databases. Increasingly, we need to consider ways of leveraging permanent, unique identifiers, as well as advancements in metadata publishing that link digital records with physical samples in a robust, adaptive way. An NSF EarthCube Research Coordination Network (RCN) called the Internet of Samples (iSamples) is now working to bridge the metadata schemas for biological and geological domains. We are leveraging the International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) that provides a versatile system of registering physical samples, and working to harmonize this with the DataCite schema for Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). A brokering approach for linking disparate catalogues and classification systems could help scale discovery and access to the many large collections now being managed (sometimes millions of specimens per collection).

            "abstract": "Many hydrological and ecological models use simple surface temperature threshold equations rather than coupling with a complex meteorological model to determine if precipitation is rain or snow. Some comparative studies have found, the most common rain/snow threshold variable, air temperature to have more precipitation phase error than dew-point or wet-bulb temperature, which account for the important secondary role of humidity in the melting and sublimation processes. However, just like surface air temperature, surface humidity is often effected by soil conditions and vegetation and is therefore not always representative of the atmospheric humidity precipitation falls through. A viable alternative to using surface humidity as a proxy for atmospheric moisture would be to adjust the rain snow threshold for changes in cloud height. The height of a cloud base above the ground gives the depth of an unsaturated layer. An unsaturated atmospheric layer should have much different melting and sublimation rates than a saturated cloud layer. Therefore, rain and snow percentages at a given surface air temperature should change with the height of the lowest cloud base.\nThis study uses hourly observations from 12 U.S. manually augmented meteorological stations located in the Great Plains and Midwest upwind or away from major water bodies in relatively flat areas in an attempt to limit geographical influences. The surface air temperature threshold for the ground to 200 feet (under 100m) was 0.0°C, 0.6°C for 300-600 feet (100-200m), 1.1°C for 700-1200 feet (300-400m), 1.7°C for 1300-2000 feet (500-600m), and 2.2°C for 2100-3300 feet (700-1000m). Total precipitation error for these cloud height air temperature thresholds reduced the error from the single air temperature threshold 1.1°C by 15% from 14% to 12% total error between -2.2°C and 3.9°C. These air temperature cloud height thresholds resulted in 1.5% less total error than the dew-point temperature threshold 0.0°C, and was within 0.2% of the wet-bulb temperature threshold 0.6°C. This supports the use of cloud base heights with surface air temperature thresholds for rain/snow determination, and gives a useful option to the use of wet-bulb temperatures, which are often not reported and may not be calculated if air pressure or relative humidity measurements are not available.",

            "abstract": "Discussions about the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) have focused on comparisons between different tectonic plates in order to look for clues that indicate they were part of the same supercontinent (e.g. Besse and Courtillot, 2002; Torsvik et al., 2008; Geuna et al., 2010; Domeier et al., 2011). However, before making these further advanced comparisons, we determined that the robustness of different algorithms that generate APWPs for an individual tectonic plate should be tested. This actually becomes a trajectory similarity measuring problem. The reference trajectory we chose is the Fixed Hotspot Model (Müller et al., 1993; Müller et al., 1999) predicted APWP, which is a known dataset. The subjects of comparison are the 60 paleomagnetic APWPs, which are produced using 60 algorithms (with more to come in the future) developed in this paper. These algorithms are based on different moving average methods, and also different weighting methods since not all paleomagnetic data are equal in quality. The data (from Global Paleomagnetic Database 4.6b) analyzed includes not only spatial (paleomagnetic pole longitude, latitude) and temporal (magnetic age) information, but also their errors (position error, age error, etc.). The question is what is the best way to turn a collection of individual poles, with different age constraints and uncertainties, into a smoothed APW path. Our goal is to get a reliable result, i.e. a path generated to approximate the \"real\" APWP with appropriate uncertainties. The result may help select the best APWP construction algorithm(s). As preliminary studies, the cratons of North America (PlateID 101; from Fig. 1 we actually can identify the general trend of its APWP), Australia (801) and India (501) are chosen as research objects to develop techniques we want to think about. First, the great circle distance between two poles (spatial) of the same age (temporal) respectively from the reference APWP and one paleomagnetic APWP is measured. The approach being developed to analyze the robustness of the smoothed and weighted APWPs, when compared with the predicted tectonic motion from seafloor spreading and hotspot data, is Monte Carlo simulation. This work is also relevant for comparing APWPs from different continents in future work.",

            "abstract": "Extremely small eukaryotic green algae are abundant primary producers found in diverse marine habitats. Over the last decade several studies have revealed extensive diversity within the “pico-prasinophytes” (≤2 µm diameter) that was previously unrecognized due to a lack of distinguishing morphological features. Using whole genome and marker gene analyses, distinct species have since been recognized within the Micromonas and Ostreococcus genera. Relatively little is known about environmental factors driving distributions of these species, but for Ostreococcus, laboratory studies suggested that differentiation reflects high- and low-light adapted ecotypes. Subsequent field studies indicated that Ostreococcus Clade OI and Clade OII rarely co-occur but partition according to distinct habitats - representing ‘mesotrophic’ and ‘oligotrophic’ ecotypes, respectively. Unlike Micromonas and Ostreococcus, Bathycoccus was presumed to be a single cosmopolitan species because identical 18S rRNA gene sequences are observed in cultured isolates and in environmental surveys. However, analysis of a targeted metagenome from a Bathycoccus population in the tropical Atlantic led to the hypothesis that Bathycoccus also harbors distinct ecotypes. Here, we have developed qPCR assays to enumerate the two Bathycoccus types which can be discriminated based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Statistical analysis of qPCR and environmental data from >200 North Pacific Ocean samples shows that the two Bathycoccus clades are only somewhat analogous to oligotrophic and mesotrophic Ostreococcus clades. The two Bathycoccus clades co-occurred more than twice as often as the Ostreococcus clades. Additionally, while Bathycoccus BII and oligotrophic Ostreococcus OII were found at warm temperatures up to 26°C, BII extended into colder waters than OII. Similarly, Bathycoccus BI extended into warmer waters than mesotrophic Ostreococcus OI. Currently, we are analyzing metatranscriptomes to understand niche partitioning by these ecotypes. The patterns observed thus far suggest that warming trends, or co-associated changes would differentially impact geographic distributions of these clades with possible consequences for primary production and community structure.",

This is typically necessary because of limited availability and resolution of watershed data, including precipitation, surface flows, soil distributions, land cover and drainage network hydraulic characteristics. The extent to which parameters are lumped is most often a decision made by the investigator with attention to research objectives, data availability, and model capabilities. Here we summarize the implications of parameter lumping to model efficiency using a distributed hydrologic simulation platform (MIKE SHE) applied to the Northwest River watershed in southern Maine, U.S.A. We compare parameter lumping effects on surface flows at the watershed outlet by varying the spatial scale (grid size), precipitation time step, computational time step, and agglomeration of landscape characteristics. The outcomes of these analyses are summarized relative to model efficiency with discussion of the implications to watershed management decisions and strategies.",

            "abstract": "The exospheres of small bodies in space can form when material leaves the surface through a variety of mechanisms such as heating and outgassing, micrometeorite impact, or ion bombardment. Mass spectrometers such as those carried on the LADEE, Rosetta, and Cassini spacecraft have shown that analysis of the gaseous material can provide a powerful means of determining information about the surface properties of the body being studied. However, most missions have focused on the detection of neutral gas and volatile species and were unable to provide details about the metal composition of the bodies studied. Ion mass spectrometry allows ejected ions of any type to be directly detected and has long been proposed as a means of determining the surface composition of bodies. Impacting solar wind or magnetospheric ions eject or sputter material from the surfaces, of which ~1% leaves the surface in an ionized state. Previous estimates for sputtered atomic densities have relied on popular ion implantation simulation software TRIM which has been shown to give incorrect results for light ions (H and He) at solar wind energies. Therefore, we have compared results from previous models to simulations carried out using the SDTrimSP code which was developed for low energy ion implantation. Sputtering yield estimates were then used to estimate the relative ion densities for a representative suite of meteorite compositions. Comparisons of model results with sputtering measurements from lunar soil are shown to match well, and a method of using ratios the ratios of detected elemental abundances as a means of identifying a object’s composition with a given meteorite classification will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The fast population rate growth and the unplanned urban development has created an increase of urban floods in the City of Colima. Land use change has transformed the hydrological behavior of the watersheds that participates on the runoff-infiltration processes that governs the pluvial concentrations. After the urban areas enlargement, 13% from 2010 to 2015, rainfall has caused significant damages to the downtown community. Therefore it is important to define the main hydraulic properties of the soils surrounding the city.\nThe soil of the region is derived from the debris avalanche deposits of the Volcano of Colima. The volcanic soil cover is only 10 to 15 cm depth. To test the soils of the region, sampling locations were chosen after making a land use map from a Landsat image. The map was done by selecting and dividing similar surface images patterns into three main classifications: Natural (N1), Agricultural (N5) and Urban (N4) surfaces. Thirty-Three soil samples were collected and grouped in nine out of ten land use subdivisions. The 10thsubdivision, represents the completed urbanized area. The land use model is made using spot 4 1A images from the year 2010 up to year 2015. This land use evolutionary analysis will be a base to evaluate the change of the runoff-infiltration rate, direction, and concentration areas for the future flood susceptibility model.\nTo get the parameters above, several soil analysis were performed. The results were that all the soil samples tested were classified as sandy soils. The water content values were from 7% (N4) to 45% (N1) while bulk density values for the same sample were form 0.65 (N1) to 1.50 (N4) g/cm3. The particle density and the porosity values were from 1.65 g/cm3 /5.5% (N4) - 2.65 g/cm3/ 75.40% (N1). The organic matter content was around 0.1% for urban soils and up to 6% on natural and agricultural soils. Some other test like electric conductivity and pH were performed. The obtained parameters were used to get other soil characteristics using the Pedotransfer Functions. The hydraulic conductivity measured in situ using a Drip-Infiltrometer device provide Ks values of 4.5, 2.4 and 5 cm/h for urban, agricultural and natural soils respectively. The information described is integrated on a GIS data base and it is an input for the Flood Susceptibility Model of Colima's metropolitan area on progress.",

Depending on their strength, satellite-based navigation and communication systems are adversely affected by the energetic charged particles. Like many other natural phenomena, substorms can have a severe economic impact on a technology-driven society such as ours.\nThough energization of charged particles is known to occur in the magnetosphere during substorms, the source of this population and its relation to traditional acceleration region dynamics, are not completely understood. Combining measurements of energetic charged particles within the plasmasheet and that of charged particles precipitated in to the ionosphere will provide a better understanding of the role of processes that accelerate these charged particles.\nIn the current work, we present energetic electron flux measured indirectly using data from ground-based Incoherent Scatter Radar and that measured directly at the plasmasheet by the THEMIS spacecraft. Instances of low-altitude-precipitation observed from ground suggest electrons of energy greater than 300 keV, possibly arising from particle injection events during substorms at the magnetically conjugate locations in the plasmasheet. The differences and similarities in the measurements at the plasmasheet and the ionosphere indicate the role different processes play in influencing the journey of these energetic particles form the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.\nOur observations suggest that there is a lot more to be understood of the link between magnetotail dynamics and energetic electron precipitation during substorms. Understanding this may open up novel and potentially invaluable ways of diagnosing the magnetosphere from the ground.",

            "abstract": "The >10 um fraction of surface water in ice-covered and ice-free MIZ regimes of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) was investigated to improve understanding of its source and composition as well as to provide end-member constraints on the planktonic contribution to the underlying sedimentary organic matter. Samples were collected during the SWERUS-C3 2014 expedition in outer shelf open waters (Laptev Sea) and ice-covered conditions (East Siberian Sea). Our analyses indicate a contrasting composition in the two regimes. The stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) is more enriched in the ice-covered eastern ESAS where the radiocarbon age is also slightly depleted compared to the modern atmospheric value. By contrast, the western ESAS shows opposite trends with more depleted δ13C values but modern 14C ages (Fmod >1). Because the influence of terrigenous organic carbon in these samples is negligible (as documented at molecular level by lignin biomarkers), we interpret these compositional differences as a result of the HCO3- uptake  by sea ice algae during carbon fixation due to the restricted access to CO2. This is consistent with the lipid biomarker IP25, unique for specific sea ice diatoms, which was found in relatively high concentration in the eastern shelf. Preliminary identifications of the phytoplankton taxa show also that open waters are characterized by a mixture of dinoflagellates, silicoflagellates and diatoms whereas the ice-covered region is mainly dominated by diatoms. In addition, while the distribution of nitrates in surface waters is fairly homogenous over the shelf, the nitrogen stable isotopic composition (δ15N) is more depleted in the western than in the eastern shelf, likely mirroring the difference in phytoplankton taxa. Our results indicate that, as the sea ice reduces due to Arctic warming, phytoplankton assemblages will progressively adjust to the different climate conditions which will affect both trophic chain and the biogeochemistry of pelagic-benthic couplings.",

Until now, the data from these two instruments have been used independently of each other. The new algorithm combines SSULI/SSUSI measurements of 135.6 nm emission using the tomographic technique; the resultant data product – whole-orbit reconstructions of atmospheric volume emission within the satellite orbital plane – is substantially improved over the original data sets. Tests using simulated atmospheric emission verify that the algorithm performs well in a variety of situations, including daytime, nighttime, and even in the challenging terminator regions. A comparison with ALTAIR radar data validates that the volume emission reconstructions can be inverted to yield maps of electron density. The algorithm incorporates several innovative new features, including the use of both SSULI and SSUSI data to create tomographic reconstructions, the use of an inversion algorithm (Richardson-Lucy; RL) that explicitly accounts for the Poisson statistics inherent in optical measurements, and a pseudo-diffusion based regularization scheme implemented between iterations of the RL code. The algorithm also explicitly accounts for extinction due to absorption by molecular oxygen.",

            "abstract": "Two Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) events were observed during October and November 2011 in the equatorial Indian Ocean during the DYNAMO field campaign. Precipitation rates and large-scale vertical motion profiles derived from the DYNAMO northern sounding array are simulated in a small-domain cloud-resolving model using parameterized large-scale dynamics. Three parameterizations of large-scale dynamics --- the conventional weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, vertical mode based spectral WTG (SWTG), and damped gravity wave coupling (DGW) --- are employed. The target temperature profiles and radiative heating rates are taken from a control simulation in which the large-scale vertical motion is imposed (rather than directly from observations), and the model itself is significantly modified from that used in previous work. These methodological changes lead to significant improvement in the results.Simulations using all three methods, with imposed time -dependent radiation and horizontal moisture advection, capture the time variations in precipitation associated with the two MJO events well. The three methods produce significant differences in the large-scale vertical motion profile, however. WTG produces the most top-heavy and noisy profiles, while DGW’s is smoother with a peak in midlevels. SWTG produces a smooth profile, somewhere between WTG and DGW, and in better agreement with observations than either of the others. Numerical experiments without horizontal advection of moisture suggest that that process significantly reduces the precipitation and suppresses the top-heaviness of large-scale vertical motion during the MJO active phases, while experiments in which the effect of cloud on radiation are disabled indicate that cloud-radiative interaction significantly amplifies the MJO. Experiments in which interactive radiation is used produce poorer agreement with observation than those with imposed time-varying radiative heating. Our results highlight the importance of both horizontal advection of moisture and cloud-radiative feedback to the dynamics of the MJO, as well as to accurate simulation and prediction of it in models.",

We implemented the volatility-basis set (VBS) framework into the aerosol mixing state resolving microphysical scheme Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX). This new scheme is unique and advances the representation of organic aerosols in models in that, contrary to the traditional treatment of organic aerosols as non-volatile in most climate models and in the original version of MATRIX, this new scheme treats them as semi-volatile. Such treatment is important because low-volatility organics contribute significantly to the growth of particles. The new scheme includes several classes of semi-volatile organic compounds from the VBS framework that can partition among aerosol populations in MATRIX, thus representing the growth of particles via condensation of low volatility organic vapors. Results from test cases representing Mexico City and a Finish forrest condistions show good representation of the time evolutions of concentration for VBS species in the gas phase and in the condensed particulate phase. Emitted semi-volatile primary organic aerosols evaporate almost completely in the high volatile range, and they condense more efficiently in the low volatility range.",

Such foreshocks may be triggered by aseismic processes of the mainshock nucleation at fault heterogeneities such as bumps, as inferred in some laboratory experiments. We explore a rate-and-state fault model in which potential foreshocks occur on patches of elevated normal compression (by a factor of 5 to 10) within a larger velocity-weakening (VW) region, using 3D numerical simulations of long-term earthquake sequences and aseismic slip.\nWe find that this model produces isolated microseismicity during the nucleation of a larger-scale seismic event, under the following conditions: (i) Patch diameter D is comparable to or larger than the patch nucleation size h*patch; (ii) D is much smaller than the nucleation size h*main for the larger-scale VW region; otherwise, a patch-hosted event simply starts the larger-scale event; (iii) the patches are sufficiently separated to prevent them triggering each other nearly instantaneously. Hence the nucleation sizes h*main and h*patch need to be substantially different, by a factor of around 10 in our simulations so far, and potentially much more.\nThe aforementioned separation of scales can be achieved by assigning high levels of compression on the patches. However, one would expect unrealistically large stress drops for events on such patches. Remarkably, in this model, we find that the stress drops of the patch-hosted events are reasonable and roughly constant, despite a wide variation in the patch compression, due to patch ruptures extending into the surrounding VW region.

            "abstract": "The west coast of Ireland in County Clare is famous for its Paleozoic stratigraphy containing spectacular exposures of deposits from carbonate shelf, deep marine, slope and deltaic environments, exposed at several distinctive and well-known locations including the Burren, Cliffs of Moher, and Bridges of Ross. Underlying the silty sandstones of the Gull Island Formation and overlying the Clare Shale, the Carboniferous Ross Sandstone Formation comprises a series of fine-grained sandstone and mudstone deep water turbidite deposits.\nApproximately a half-kilometer northeast of the Bridges of Ross and about 15 meters below the upper boundary of the Ross Formation is a particular stratum exhibiting an assemblage of unique circular to ovoid impressions. These features densely cover an exposed horizontal surface of approximately 100 square meters, positioned about 5 meters above and adjacent to a cluster of sand volcanoes. The impressions frequently overlap and completely cover the exposed surface of the rock unit and continue along the same plane of the buried portion of the stratum. Diameters of the impressions range between 2 and 20 centimeters, and many contain clasts of pale grey shale or claystone material. Samples were collected from the layer of interest as well as from subjacent and superjacent strata, spanning a total thickness of just over 1 meter. Thin sections were created and analyzed to determine both composition and estimated porosity of the rock in a continuous vertical cross-section through the series of strata surrounding the impressions. Characteristics of each stratum were examined to explore possible depositional relationships of each layer to the others and to indicate likely diagenetic processes of the subcircular features. Two broad possible origins are discussed: a primary sedimentary origin, i.e. turbidite channel mudflake conglomerate; or a post-depositional soft sediment deformation origin due to either (i) sediment loading and dewatering, (ii) outgassing of methane, or (iii) earthquake tremor.",

Better understanding of the sedimentary characteristics and formation of intra-platform shoals is significant for predicting the distribution of Ordovician shoal reservoirs.\nThe sedimentary characteristics, distribution patterns and formation mechanisms of carbonate intra-platform shoals in Ordovician Tarim Basin were studied based on outcrop analogue, core data, thin section observation, seismic, and well log data. Those shoals include oolitic shoal, intraclast shoal and bioclastic shoal. The intra-platform shoal consists of three sedimentary units: shoal base, shoal core and shoal cover, which are adjacent to intershoal sea faces. Laterally, the intra-platform shoals occurred as a more continuous sheet-like body.The intra-platform shoals deposited mainly in the lowstand systems tract and late stage of highstand systems tract.\nSeveral factors were probably responsible for the occurrence of intra-platform shoals, including: (i) a relatively shallow-water condition with a strong hydrodynamic environment, (ii) high-frequency oscillations of the sea level, and (iii) Subtle paleo-highs and relatively weak structural activities, which are important for the spatial distribution of reservoir facies.",

A three-dimensional, MHD-kinetic model for flows of a thermal plasma, neutral atoms and PUIs has been developed. The preliminary results from our model are in qualitative agreement with observations made by New Horizons, Ulysses, Voyager 1 and 2. All-sky maps of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) fluxes with energies of about 0.2-6 keV based on our current PUI model are qualitatively similar to IBEX-Hi distributed ENA maps. Also, simulated spectra of ENA fluxes nearly match IBEX-Hi spectra of distributed ENA fluxes. It is demonstrated that preserving some pitch-angle information of the PUI distribution is important for correctly interpreting the data. ",

            "abstract": "California is experiencing one of the most severe droughts on record. In response, the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations in May, implementing a mandatory 25% statewide reduction in potable urban water use. Prior to this, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had implemented mandatory restrictions and a pricing increase in 2009 and 2010, respectively to encourage reduced consumption. Understanding where conservation measures are having the greatest impact and how it is affecting water fluxes throughout the basin is critical, especially when considering the push for increased reliance on local water resources. Los Angeles is selected as the study area due to its high degree of urbanization, while the Ballona Creek watershed is used for runoff analysis due to the lack of dams and wastewater treatment plants altering flow in the channel. Utilizing a combination of runoff gages, groundwater monitoring well data, consumption data, and hydrologic models, we aim to evaluate how hydrologic processes have been influenced by water conservation measures. The work focuses on how changes in outdoor water use have influenced discharge patterns and groundwater recharge since most of the water conservation efforts have been focused on decreasing landscape irrigation. Previous work has shown that outdoor irrigation rates have decreased after the implementation of conservation measures, causing a decrease in vegetation greenness across the city. Runoff has also significantly decreased, especially dry season discharge. Further work is also being conducted to evaluate changes to evapotranspiration, using a combination of NLDAS model results and CIMIS reference ET data, as well as groundwater and recharge, utilizing a Bayesian Hierarchical model to fill missing groundwater monitoring well data. Results provide improved understanding of response to, and impacts of, conservation measures which ultimately allow for better water resources management for developed areas.",

This profile is made of by a network of 4 OBS and 30 land seismic stations, deployed specially for this project, which registered the air gun shots provided by RRS James Cook every 120 s. Data obtained after processing and interpretation characterize seismically the contact zone between Rivera and North American plates from 30 to 60 km of model distance. Moreover, a cortical thickening from 9 to 20 km is observed towards to the coast. In the upper mantle, P-wave velocities of 7.9-8.4 km/s up to maximum depth of 50 km have been determined.",

This limits the ability to document associated water quality conditions and predict future blooms.

Calculations were verified with in situ measurements from the Virginia Estuarine and Coastal Observing System. Imagery produced with the Chlorophyll-A calculation model will allow VIMS and ODU scientists to assess the timing, magnitude, duration and frequency of HABs in Virginia’s Chesapeake watershed and to predict the environmental and water quality conditions that favor bloom development.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, elongated, synoptic jets of water vapor that play important roles in the global water cycle and regional weather and hydrology. Previous studies have developed techniques for the identification of ARs based on intensity and/or geometry thresholds indicative of AR conditions. Such techniques have facilitated the investigation of ARs on local to regional scales. Recent advancement in the understanding of AR’s global signatures and impacts (including those in less explored areas such as Greenland and Antarctica), and the need for understanding the representation of key AR characteristics in global weather/climate models motivate the development and evaluation of AR detection techniques suitable for global climatological and model evaluation studies. In this work, an objective AR detection algorithm is developed based on thresholding global, 6-hourly fields of integrated water vapor transport (IVT) derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis. Long, narrow filaments of enhanced IVT are detected by applying a set of intensity and geometry criteria, along with other considerations. Key output of the algorithm includes the AR shape boundary, main axis, location of landfalls, and a tabulated list of the basic statistics such as length, width, and mean IVT strength/direction of each detected AR. Sensitivity of detection is examined for selected parameters, and the result is evaluated and compared with an independent database of landfalling ARs in the west coast of North America based on satellite images of integrated water vapor (Neiman et al. 2008). Global distribution of key AR characteristics, and examples of their modulation by climate variability, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Potential field data are used to construct a two-dimensional crustal model along a profile through the Tamayo Trough and Bank in the Gulf of California. The model is constrained by seismic reflection and refraction data, and field observations. The potential field data do not fit a model where the crust of the Tamayo trough is continental, but they fit well with a model where the Tamayo trough crust is oceanic. This implies that the Tamayo Bank is entirely bounded by oceanic crust and is a microcontinent. The oceanic crust of the Tamayo trough that separates the Tamayo Bank from the mainland of Mexico is thin (~4 km), so oceanic spreading was probably magma-starved before it ceased. This led us to come up with a model that explains the formation of microcontinents that are smaller in size and are not found in the proximity of hotspots. At first, seafloor spreading commences following continental breakup. When the magma supply to the ridge slows down, the plate boundary strengthens. Hence, the ridge may be abandoned while tectonic extension begins elsewhere, or slow spreading may continue while a new ridge starts to develop. The old spreading ridge becomes extinct. An asymmetric ocean basin forms if the ridge jumps within oceanic lithosphere; a microcontinent forms if the ridge jumps into a continental margin. This model for formation of continental fragments is applicable to other regions as well, eliminating the need of mantle plume impingement to facilitate rifting of a young continental margin and microcontinent formation.",

            "abstract": "Traditional floodplain inundation models typically rely on the assumption of stationary flood frequency distributions and static channel geometries. However, changes in climate, land cover, or water management have been shown to systematically shift the mean and variance of flood flows. Further, changes in flood magnitudes have been shown to cause systematic changes in channel widths and depths. Therefore, some amount of change in the flood regime will be absorbed by changes in channel conveyance, but the subsequent changes to the frequency and magnitude of floodplain inundation are not obvious. This work presents a numerical model of channel-floodplain hydrologic connectivity under non-stationary conditions. Specifically, the model predicts the width of floodplain inundation in response to a time series of synthetically generated floods. Flood time series are generated via generalized extreme value probability density functions (PDFs) with specified mean, variance, and skew parameters. To simulate non-stationary conditions, we modify the mean, variance, and/or skew systematically during each run. Throughout each model run, the geometry of the alluvial channel changes in response to flood flows according to simple hydraulic geometry relations. Results suggest that a river's inundation regime is more sensitive to changes in the variance parameter of a governing PDF than to changes in the mean parameter. Simple changes in the mean of the governing PDF result in changes to channel geometry (e.g. channel widening or narrowing), but the frequency and magnitude of inundation may adjust with time after the onset of non-stationary hydrology towards a state of dynamic equilibrium similar to the previous inundation regime. However, changes in the PDF's variance parameter can induce greater variation in channel geometry, often resulting in less frequent, but greater magnitudes of floodplain inundation.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examined the rainfall-runoff relationship of the 74.2-km2 Mae Sa watershed, a basin with mixed forest, agriculture, and peri-urban land covers in northern Thailand. Mae Sa has a distinct annual streamflow discharge (Q) hydrograph related to the strongly seasonal rainfall (RF) regime characteristic of the Asian monsoon region. Hourly RF observations during 2004-2012 from each of the 11 rain gauges in Mae Sa were adjusted for lag time with respect to Q, based on the time difference between the peak rainfall at the specific station and the peak discharge at the watershed outlet, and then integrated into a daily watershed RF time series. Quickflow (QF) and baseflow (BF) time series were obtained from hygrograph separation using the Sliding Average with Rain Record (SARR) method (Koskelo et al. 2012), with the integrated daily watershed RF and Q as input. The event quickflow runoff coefficient (RC) was calculated as total QF/total RF for each storm event identified by the SARR method. Results suggest a “switch-point” in the rainfall-runoff relationship annual cycle in some years, after which similar RF events generate higher Q than earlier, i.e., an abrupt upward shift in RC is observed. In general, the switch-point occurs in the second half of the wet season from July to August; however, the occurrence and timing of the switch-point varied from year to year during study period. This variability appears to be the result of interannual differences in total RF and the temporal RF patterns. For example, the switch-point in years with average or lower annual RF, such as 2007 and 2010, are more obvious compare to years with higher annual RF, such as 2006 and 2011, in which the RC in the early stage of wet season are already high.",

The NASA DEVELOP Georgia Disasters and Water Resources team partnered with the City of Albany and Dougherty County Planning and Development Services (PDS) and the Southwest Georgia Water Resources Task Force (SGWRTF) to assess past sinkhole development and identify areas susceptible to future sinkhole formation. Sinkhole mapping was completed utilizing a time-series of elevation data (1999 – 2011) from NASA’s SRTM and ASTER missions, as well as European Remote-Sensing (ERS-1 and 2) satellite-derived elevation data. The sinkhole inventory maps and spatial statistical techniques (i.e., geographically-weighted regression) were employed to quantify the factors most influential in sinkhole development. With those results, the susceptibility of every area within Dougherty County to future sinkhole formation was identified.

This effluent collects in a tailings storage facility (TSF) on site and seepage has contaminated local groundwater. This SCN- plume recently escaped the mine lease in a plume flowing partly through a confined aquifer and partly along buried paleochannel gravels.\nGroundwater samples were collected using a low-flow pump from two bores near the TSF. The pH of the SCN- contaminated groundwater typically varies between 4 and 6, and dissolved O2 varies between 1 and 40 ppm. SCN- concentrations in off-lease groundwater have increased from 10 ppm in 2010 to over 150 ppm in 2015.\nCultures were inoculated directly from the groundwater, and filtered groundwater was used with amendments as the basal growth medium Cultures were subjected to geochemical amendments including changes in dissolved O2, pH, SCN- concentration and additions of organic carbon, phosphate or both. The enriched microbial consortia could not degrade thiocyanate under anoxic conditions, but some could completely degrade high concentrations of SCN- (>800mg L-1) under oxic conditions. Biodegradation accelerated with the addition of phosphate, while the addition of organic carbon actually limited the rate. SCN- degrading cultures are undergoing DNA sequencing for species identification and comparison to SCN--degrading cultures inoculated from surface waters in the TSF.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen, the most abundant element in terrestrial planets link their lithospheres, hydrospheres and atmospheres, thus providing a powerful tool to fingerprint the physical and chemical processes involved in the exchange of material between these reservoirs (\n1\n). The oxygen triple isotopic composition of SNC Martian meteorites minerals provided a record of this unique interaction. Martian silicates showed an O-isotope anomaly (Δ17O = 0.4 ‰) unlike earth's silicate (Δ17O = 0‰). Additionally, there is a signficant variation in the oxygen isotopic composition of primary and secondary minerals both in the oldest (ALH84001: Δ17OCO3 = 0.7‰, Δ17Osilicates = 0.3‰)(\n2\n) and younger martian rocks (NWA7034: Δ17OCO3 = 0.0‰, Δ17Osilicates = 0.6‰)(\n3\n) indicating substantial changes in the global aqueous chemistry of Mars and its formation. These variations in oxygen isotope anomalies are important, but puzzling due to the lack of knoweldege of the intial conditions and relevant experiments. To understand the origin and nature of heterogeneity in the oxygen triple isotopes of various minerals, laboratory experiments were conducted by simulating current Martian conditions. Ozone, a martian atmospheric constituent, was used as a tracer to identify molecular reactions occurring on the mineral surfaces. The oxygen isotopic composition of decomposed ozone and water was measured following reaction over extended time under defined conditions . The decomposed O2 defines an array with a slope δ17O = 0.87 x δ18O + 5 (r2 = 0.99). The left over ozone after 18hours showed a decrease in slope (δ17O = 0.7 x δ18O + 5 (r2 = 0.97) and significant variations in Δ17O= 20 - 31‰ depending on the mineral used in the experiment. The slope did not pass through the initial ozone and water suggesting the formation of an intermediate species and its reaction and removal that is responsible for the exchange of O-isotopes between water-ozone and mineral oxides. These results coupled with the UV photochemical transformation of minerals as a function of water content adsorbed on minerals and in the vapor phase will be used to unlock the mystery of oxygen isotope anomaly in the martian rocks. \n    1.

            "abstract": "Until the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake, the role of earthquakes as agents of sediment dispersal and deposition at erosional trenches was largely under-appreciated. A series of cruises carried out after the 2011 event has revealed a variety of unsuspected sediment transport mechanisms, such as tsunami-triggered sheet turbidites, suggesting that great earthquakes may in fact be important agents for dispersing sediments across trench slopes. To complement these observational data, we have modeled the pathways of sediments across the trench slope based on bathymetric grids. Our approach assumes that transport direction is controlled by slope azimuth only, and ignores obstacles smaller than 0.6-1 km; these constraints are meant to approximate the behavior of turbidites. Results indicate that (1) most pathways issued from the upper slope terminate near the top of the small frontal wedge, and thus do not reach the trench axis; (2) in turn, sediments transported to the trench axis are likely derived from the small frontal wedge or from the subducting Pacific plate. These results are consistent with the stratigraphy imaged in seismic profiles, which reveals that the slope apron does not extend as far as the frontal wedge, and that the thickness of sediments at the trench axis is similar to that of the incoming Pacific plate.\nWe further applied this modeling technique to the Cascadia, Nankai, Middle-America, and Sumatra trenches. Where well-defined canyons carve the trench slopes, sediments from the upper slope may routinely reach the trench axis (e.g., off Costa Rica and Cascadia). In turn, slope basins that are isolated from the canyons drainage systems must mainly accumulate locally-derived sediments. Therefore, their turbiditic infill may be diagnostic of seismic activity only – and not from storm or flood activity. If correct, this would make isolated slope basins ideal targets for paleoseismological investigation.",

            "abstract": "Lake Erie, the smallest and warmest lake among the Laurentian Great Lakes, is known for its problem of eutrophication and frequent occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs). One major harmful effect of CyanoHABs is the production of cyanotoxins, especially microcystins. Microcystins (MC) are a group of hepatotoxins and the predominant variant of them is MC-LR. Field measurements and lab experiments indicate that MC degradation in Lake Erie is mainly carried out by indigenous bacteria. However, our knowledge on taxa involved in this process is very limited. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap using a culture-dependent approach. Water and surface sediment samples were collected from Lake Erie in 2014 and 2015 and enriched with MC-LR. Cells were plated on a number of culturing media. The obtained pure bacterial cultures were screened for MC degrading abilities by MT2 BIO-LOG assays and by growing cells in liquid media containing MC-LR as the sole carbon source. In the latter experiment, MC concentrations were measured using HPLC. Isolates showing positive MC degradation activities in the screening steps were designated MC+ bacteria and characterized based on their phenotypic properties, including colony pigmentation, elevation, opacity, margin, gram nature and motility. The taxonomic identity of MC+ bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene full-length DNA sequencing. The presence of mlrA, a gene encoding MC cleavage pathway, was detected by PCR. Our culturing efforts obtained 520 pure cultures; 44 of them were identified as MC+. These MC+ isolates showed diversity in taxonomic identities and differed in their morphology, gram nature, colony characteristics and motility. PCR amplification of mlrA gene yield negative results for all MC+ isolates, indicating that the primers that were used may not be ubiquitous enough to cover the heterogeneity of mlrA genes or, more likely, alternative degradative genes/pathways were employed by Lake Erie bacteria. The MC+ isolates can serve as models for future identification of MC degradation pathway and used to develop or augment biofilters for effective treatment of MC contaminated water.\nKey Words: CyanoHAB, microcystins, degradation",

Results showed that the total amount of ammonium oxidation, nitrite oxidation, denitrification, and anammox increased with the elevated dissolved oxygen levels, but the amount of ammonium release decreased inversely. The increasing DO level also raised the total amount of nitrogen loss (from 6.12 mg N to 35.44 mg N) and its proportion to ammonium liberated (from 12.96% to 99.84%), but the contributions of anammox to nitrogen loss in each incubation showed no significant difference (83.36% to 89.19%).\nThe dissolved oxygen facilitated an exponential increasing of the anammox oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and raised the denitrifiers (nirK and nirS gene) abundance by an order, but its influence on anammox (hzsB) was insignificant. Four quantitative response relationships between nitrogen transformation rates, nitrogen functional genes abundances, and nitrogen concentrations were established by stepwise linear regression analysis. These relationships confirmed that different nitrogen transformation processes were coupled at the molecular level (functional genes), especially for the coupling of ammonium oxidation and anammox.",

Previous analog experiments simulating the India-Asia collision successfully modeled the development and kinematics of large strike-slip faults within the Eurasian plate. However, these 2D experiments were dynamically unscaled with gravity and did not allow the development of topographic relief. We use the YADE discrete element (DEM) code to alleviate these problems, producing a suite of 3D models. These 3D DEM models also involve the extrusion and rotation of coherent blocks by generating two large strike-slip faults. The location, size and offsets of these faults are consistent with those of the Red River and Altyn Tagh mega-faults. In addition, concurrently with strike-slip movement, the large scale deformation includes the successive formation, from South to North, of thrust faults that bound a growing plateau which may be considered analogous to the Tibet-Qinghai plateau. While based on very simplified boundary conditions and mechanical properties, such modeling results are therefore consistent with the topographic, tectonic and geological evolution of Eastern Asia in the last ~50 million years.",

For the past few decades, different observation-based estimates and modeling of biomass in above- and below-ground vegetation components have been comprehensively conducted. However, uncertainties still exist, in particular for the simulation of biomass magnitude, tendency, and the response of biomass to natural and anthropogenic drivers. To elucidate these uncertainties, this study compares vegetation biomass of sixteen Earth System Models (ESMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive with latest observation-based data over the Northern High-Latitudes. Results demonstrate that the models exhibit large variability of vegetation biomass, and the model ensemble mean underestimates temperate forest total biomass but overestimates boreal forest total biomass compared to the observational data. Moreover, both the model outputs and the observational data show individual biomass components are highly sensitive to the change of precipitation across different biomes. Possible causes behind inter-model and model-observation differences, such as the discrepancies of climatic conditions, the carbon allocation schemes, prescribed vegetation distributions, representation of disturbances as well as spin-up processes in the ESMs, are investigated and will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires have profound and variable impacts on erosion, channel morphology, and aquatic habitat. Previous research has quantified post-fire geomorphic response on event and millennial timescales. While these studies have informed our understanding of post-fire geomorphic response during the Holocene, we have yet to fully understand the variability of post-wildfire geomorphic response and how it might change in response to changing climate. Response of aquatic biota is just as variable as post-wildfire response yet we know very little about effects on metapopulations and how management decisions affect aquatic populations. Barriers to movement are installed to isolate native fish populations and prescribed fire and thinning are used to try to reduce future wildfire severity and extent. In order to improve understanding of the implications of management decisions, we evaluated geomorphic response and synchronicity of wildfires over the Holocene relative to the impact to the metapopulation of Bonneville cutthroat trout from a recent wildfire.\nThe Twitchell Canyon fire burned 45,000 acres near Beaver, UT in July 2010. Over 30% of the area burned at high severity, which included two major headwater streams that sustained a trout population. In summer 2011, monsoonal thunderstorms caused massive debris flows and sheetflow erosion that altered channel morphology and aquatic habitat in the burned area. A previously robust, non-native trout fishery was nearly extirpated as a result of the geomorphic response to the wildfire. We used radiocarbon dating of burned material to determine how often headwater streams burned synchronously over the Holocene. Radiocarbon dates are associated with field observations of stratigraphy in order to infer geomorphic response to historic wildfires. Thirty samples were collected from sediment layers in 10 alluvial fans distributed among three watersheds (two burned and one unburned in the 2010 fire). Preliminary results suggest that we sampled 10-15 individual wildfires and radiocarbon ages range from 150-8,100 years.",

            "abstract": "A frequency distribution of snow and sea ice is generated by counting and then binning the number of thicknesses into contiguous intervals (typically in 10 cm bins). Because sea ice is only meters thick but spans thousands of kilometers, these distributions serve as a \"Rosetta Stone\" to communicate proportions of thickness across scales - especially for characterizing deformation processes. Because the frequency distribution is such an important communication tool, we explore the impact of spatial aliasing on non-Gaussian distributions of snow and sea ice thickness. Using a heuristic model and >1000 in situ measurements, we show how different instrument footprint sizes and shapes can cluster thickness distributions into artificial modes, thereby distorting frequency distributions and making it difficult to compare and communicate information across spatial scales. This problem has not been dealt with systematically for sea ice until now, largely because it appears to incur no significant change in integrated thickness, which often serves as a volume proxy. The problem is of second order at any one scale but becomes a first order problem for non-Gaussian distributions when data are collected at different scales. We quantify the impact of spatial aliasing by computing resolution error (Er) over a range of horizontal scales (x) from 5 to 500 m. Results are summarized through a power law (Er=bxm) with distinct exponents (m) from 0.3 to 0.5 using example mathematical functions including Gaussian, inverse linear, and running mean filters. The most important finding is that a running mean filter introduces a great deal of aliasing and should be avoided whenever possible. A simple and effective substitute for the running mean is an inverse linear filter which is commonly used in numerical model data interpolation. In this study, inverse linear filters were as effective as a Gaussian filter in terms of minimizing aliasing. There is much to be gained at the community level by eliminating running-mean filters especially during underway data reduction field experiments. Removing this one filter alone will significantly decrease a number of aliasing problems that currently make it very difficult to compare and combine different in situ and airborne measurements.",

Precipitation is considered as a trigger to natural phenomena such as landslides, avalanches and floods, which occur as a result of the nonlinear interaction of hydrological dynamics. For the study and analysis of precipitation there are technological tools such as hydrological modeling, characterized by the transformation of input variables, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration rate. Therefore, precipitation is one of the most important variables because the quality and distribution of water resources depends upon it, thus a better understanding of the uncertainties associated with it is required.\nThe precipitation in the tropics has a high variability at all spatial scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale, as happens in the time scale (Poveda and Mejia 2004; Zawadzki, 1973). This space-time variability has implications for the modeling and simulation of storms, and in extreme flows. This fact, coupled with the hydrological models are calibrated setting, usually simulated flow against the flow observed using the recorded rainfall, which generates uncertainties.\nThe main goal of this work was evaluate the uncertainty associated with the precipitation variable performing multiple simulations of synthetic events both in space and time, using the distributed hydrological model TETIS (Velez et al, 2002; Frances et al, 2007). A case study at the Watershed Andean high of Combeima River, in the city of Ibague (Colombia), was used to assess the uncertainty associated with the daily scale simulations.",

Water outputs consisted of a simplified evapotranspiration model and stream runoff data. Fifty-six linear combinations of precipitation and evaporation were used to develop water balance models.

            "abstract": "Inversion and joint inversion are very popular methods for geophysical parameter estimation. Different algorithms can be used to calibrate one or several models during an inversion process, including statistical and stochastic, evolutionary and gradient descendant algorithms. Stochastic and evolutionary methods can be classified as global search algorithms, as they search for the best solution in a wide parameter space, often the full system domain. The main advantages of global search methods are the ability to avoid local minima regions and estimate parameters with non-linear relationship with physical observations, while their disadvantages include high computational effort and low performance to find the overall best solution. Gradient descendant algorithms nevertheless simplify the problem linearizing the system and minimizing the differences between field and synthetic observations (objective function), being able to find the actual best solution. However, this method works mainly for one minima region, being highly susceptible to local minima solutions, and the system derivatives must exist in all searchable parameter space.\nApplying both methods in a sequential procedure can combine their advantages while avoiding their weaknesses. This work proposes a hybrid inversion procedure based on Genetic Algorithm and Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg numerical modeling for geophysical inversion problems.",

            "abstract": "Caspar Creek is a gravel-bedded stream near Fort Bragg in Jackson Demonstration State Forest in Northern California’s Coast Range. Since 1962, detailed measurements of streamflow, turbidity, and rainfall have been made at a weir just below the study area by the Pacific Southwest Research Station and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). However, little research has been done to identify how gravel-sized sediment moves through the system during storm flows. The North Fork of Caspar Creek drains a relatively small and steep watershed providing fast residence times that allow direct correlation between rainfall events and movement of the gravel-dominated (<20% sand) bed material. The study reach has an average discharge of 3.8x10-2 m3/s, yet over the past two years has had 4 storm events with flows greater than 1.0 m3/s, a flow that has shown to be a minimum needed for bedload movement. Gravel sized rocks inserted with HDX pit tags were placed throughout the study reach and surveyed after each storm to track their movement through the system. The results show that bed movement responds nonlinearly to increased peak storm discharge with larger storms disproportionately moving sediment further downstream. The movement distances appear independent of local slope, and the distribution of transported sediment sizes does not show significant variance between different storm events. This info will contribute to a better understanding of gravel deposition and bar formation in rainfall-driven watersheds and may help predict sediment fluxes during storm events.",

            "abstract": "The 2015 spring transition in Barrow, AK, was notable with the second earliest date of snow melt on record (JD148, May 28) and earliest ice free conditions on a local lagoon (JD178, June 27). The 73-year time series from the NOAA Global Monitoring Division’s Barrow Observatory (BRW) has shown a trend toward earlier spring snowmelt, reinforced in 2015. Anomalous early snowmelt was also observed at nearby Cooper Island where a colony of sea birds, the Black Guillemot, nests each year once snow disappears. The appearance of \"first egg\" is well correlated with the date of snowmelt at BRW (Fig. 1), as is the ice-out date at the Isaktoak Lagoon (ISK). In 2015, the first egg was observed on JD159 (June 8), the earliest in the 40-year record (source: Friends of Cooper Island,\nhttp://cooperisland.org/\n).\nEach day of advance in the melt date at BRW results in an annual net radiation increase at the surface of about 1%. The documented changes can influence biogeochemical cycles, permafrost temperatures, and potentially the release of stored carbon. By mid July 2015, a 1°C increase in soil temperature at 0.5-m depth was measured compared to prior years; therefore, the active layer is expected to be unusually deep by autumn. The anomalous warmth that prevailed during spring 2015 can be attributed, in part, to atmospheric circulation, influenced by two typhoons in the North Pacific and the onset of El Niño. Warming was likely amplified locally as the early melting of snow increased absorption of solar radiation. Key factors influencing the trend toward earlier spring snowmelt will be presented as well as those contributing to the anomalous 2015 spring at BRW (e.g., winter snowfall, cloud cover, advection, local sea ice extent), and the impact early melt had on the 2015 summer surface radiation budget. Analysis of interactions underlying this anomaly will aid in developing strategies for improving predictability of interannual variability of the melt season and long-term change.",

Our approach lies in the integration of professional and amateur astronomers, educators, students, and communicators to identify multiple paths for the student to become a scientist. I report on the ensuing project, also known as the PACA Project, which is an ecosystem of various activities that take advantage of the social media and immediate connectivity amongst amateur astronomers worldwide and that can be galvanized to participate in a given observing campaign. The PACA Project has participated in organized campaigns such as NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign in 2013; NASA Comet Integrated Observations Campaign to observe Comet Siding Spring as it flew by very close to Mars on 19 October 2014. Currently the PACA Project is involved in the Ground-based Amateur campaign to observer ESA/Rosetta mission’s target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) that is en route to its perihelion on 13 August 2015 (at the time of abstract submission). The PACA Project provides access to the professional community and the student/educator and informal/public communities via various social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Pinterest, Vimeo, Google+. With the popularity of mobile platforms and instant connections with other peers globally, the multi-faceted social universe has become a vital part of engagement of multiple communities. The PACA project currently has initiated a Comet Tails and Disconnection Events campaign to relate to the changing solar wind conditions. Other PACA projects include Saturn Solstice 2017 and outreach projects with Astroproject (India). These and other citizen-science enabled activities and their integration with S2S project will be discussed.",

Taklamkan and Gobi deserts in China and Mongolia are the major contributors for East Asia dust storm, which significantly affect air quality and regional climate over downwind areas in China, Japan and Korea. Understanding the mixing of dust and intensive anthropogenic emissions would require a regional chemistry transport model which can simulate both the emission and transport of the natural and anthropogenic particles, and also their chemical interactions as well as the particles evolutions. In this study, we conducted model development of the WRF/CMAQ modeling system by revising the dust emission scheme and implementing source-dependent speciation profiles of dust aerosol and heterogeneous chemistry. With the revised modeling system, East Asia dust impact on atmospheric chemistry and regional climate has been investigated for the period of March and April from 2006 to 2010. The revised modeling system has been demonstrated to greatly improve model's capability of reproducing dust emission and transport over East Asia by comparing with surface measurements and satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "Big remotely sensed data, the heterogeneity of satellite platforms and file formats along with increasing volumes and velocities, offers new types of analyses. This makes big remotely sensed data a good candidate for CyberGIS, the aim of which is to enable knowledge discovery of big data in the cloud. We apply CyberGIS to feature-based multi-scale land use/cover change (LUCC) detection. There have been attempts to do multi-scale LUCC. However, studies were done with small data and could not consider the mismatch between multi-scale analysis and computational scale. They have yet to consider the possibilities for scalar research across numerous temporal and spatial scales afforded by big data, especially if we want to advance beyond pixel-based analysis and also reduce preprocessing requirements.\nWe create a geospatial cyberinfrastructure (GCI) to handle multi-spatio-temporal scale change detection. We first clarify different meanings of scale in CyberGIS and LUCC to derive a feature scope layer in the GCI based on Stommel modelling. Our analysis layer contains a multi-scale segmentation–based method based on normalized cut image segmentation and wavelet-based image scaling algorithms. Our computer resource utilization layer uses Wang and Armstrong’s (2009) method for mainly for memory, I/O and CPU time. Our case is urban-rural change detection in the Greater Montreal Area (5 time periods, 2006-2012, 100 virtual machines), 36,000km2 and varying from 0.6m to 38m resolution. We present a ground truthed accuracy assessment of a change matrix that is composed of 6 feature classes at 12 different spatio-temporal scales, and the performance of the change detection GCI for multi-scale LUCC study. The GCI allows us to extract and coordinate different types of changes by varying spatio-temporal scales from the big imagery datasets.",

            "abstract": "Dust inputs play an important role in soil formation, especially for thick soils developed on tropical volcanic islands. In these regions, soils are highly depleted due to intensive chemical weathering, and mineral nutrients from dusts have been known to be important in sustaining soil fertility and productivity. Tropical volcanic soils are an ideal system to study the impacts of dust inputs on the ecosystem. Sr and U-series isotopes are excellent tracers to identify sources of materials in an open system if the end-members have distinctive isotope signatures. These two isotope systems are particularly useful to trace the origin of atmospheric inputs into soils and to determine rates and timescales of soil formation.\nThis study analyzes major elemental concentrations, Sr and U-series isotope ratios in highly depleted soils in the tropical volcanic island of Basse-Terre in French Guadeloupe to determine atmospheric input sources and identify key soil formation processes. We focus on three soil profiles (8 to 12 m thick) from the Bras-David, Moustique Petit-Bourg, and Deshaies watersheds; and on the adjacent rivers to these sites. Results have shown a significant depletion of U, Sr, and major elements in the deep profile (12 to 4 m) attributed to rapid chemical weathering. The top soil profiles (4 m to the surface) all show addition of elements such as Ca, Mg, U, and Sr due to atmospheric dust.\nMore importantly, the topsoil profiles have distinct Sr and U-series isotope compositions from the deep soils. Sr and U-series isotope ratios of the top soils and sequential extraction fractions confirm that the sources of the dust are from the Saharan dessert, through long distance transport from Africa to the Caribbean region across the Atlantic Ocean. During the transport, some dust isotope signatures may also have been modified by local volcanic ashes and marine aerosols. Our study highlights that dusts and marine aerosols play important roles in element cycles and nutrient sources in the highly depleted surface soils of tropical oceanic islands.",

An objective metric will be presented and exploited to define which AEWs were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis and those which were not. A more detailed analysis, combining model outputs and observations, will be presented that compares notable developing AEWs (e.g. Nadine and Edouard) and their preceding non-developing AEWs.Emphasis will be given to the evolving dynamical AEW structures at low-levels as they move from the continent into the Atlantic. It will be shown that there is a short \"window\" when the low-level monsoon westerly flow in the eastern Atlantic establishes a west-to-east flow under the mid-level trough making the trough vulnerable to advection of dry-air from ahead of the trough. It will be shown that if their is relatively moist air ahead at low-levels the probability of tropical cyclogenesis increases even with a west-to-east flow under the trough.

As such there is a growing need to identify factors that contribute to an ecosystem’s ability to recover from disturbance, commonly referred to as ecosystem resilience. In trees, drought-induced growth declines may signal decreased ecosystem resilience if mature trees are able to survive in stressful environmental conditions that do not permit successful post-disturbance recruitment and survival. Here we explore links between ecosystem resilience and the growth-climate relationships of pre-fire trees, specifically drought stress signals, across topographic moisture gradients within the boreal forest. We sampled 72 recently (2004) burned black spruce stands within interior Alaska and found the proportion of black spruce relative to deciduous trees decreased post-fire, ranging from almost no change to a 90% decrease. The largest shifts in post-fire species composition occurred in sites where trees showed negative growth responses to warm spring temperatures, and shallow post-fire organic layer depths due to dry site conditions or high fire severity. These sites were generally located at warmer and drier landscape positions, suggesting they are less resilient to disturbance than sites at the wetter end of the gradient. Tree growth-climate responses can provide an estimate of stand environmental stress to ongoing climate change and as such are a valuable tool for predicting landscape variations in forest ecosystem resilience and forecasting future forest composition.",

For these earthquakes, we applied a joint inversion method for estimating focal mechanisms in order to determine fault trends and the stress tensor in the area, which defines a maximum stress with Normal tendency. Focal mechanisms also represent in most of the cases Normal faults with NW orientation that match well with the tracking rupture deduced from the Back Projection Imaging modeling.

Complex topography and heavy forest cover, conditions common in British Columbia, Canada, can make these assessments challenging. A number of readily available gridded products that include surface SWE (ERA-Interim, MERRA, GLDAS and GlobSnow) have been used to build a statistical SWE estimation model using machine learning methods. Evaluated methods include artificial neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, support vector regression and random forests. Cross-validated SWE estimates from the statistical model and the individual data products were compared against in-situ snow measurements at manual snow course stations throughout BC. In addition, SWE values simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model were also evaluated against these in-situ data. Mean station RMSEs for the data products ranged from 319 to 431 mm SWE, while that of the VIC runs was 211 mm. Runs of the statistical model achieved a mean station RMSE as low as 190 mm SWE, an improvement of 40% to 56% over the individual products and 10% over VIC. Nonlinear machine learning methods outperformed linear regression by 16% to 19%. These results demonstrate that the skill of SWE estimates in mountainous regions may be increased by employing a fusion of available gridded products and relevant covariates.",

In particular, we apply an STA/LTA approach for 154 M ≥ 7 earthquakes and use local earthquake catalogs (magnitude of completeness 0.8) to investigate triggered seismicity in the Coso Geothermal Field (CGF). Of 154 remote mainshocks, we find 34 mainshocks (22%) show triggered seismicity based on the increase in the magnitude and frequency (rate) from pre-mainshock to post-mainshock auto-detection rates and cataloged seismicity. We observe both instantaneous (16) and delayed (18) triggering within ± 5 hours of the mainshock. We also find that remote triggering in the CGF region is enhanced by the orientation (back-azimuth) of the passing seismic (mostly surface) waves in relation to the local stress field (NNE-SSW trending faults), and there appears little correlation between the peak dynamic stress and event triggering. Our results suggest that remote dynamic triggering strongly depends on the regional stress orientation, and for the CGF region the stress threshold for remote M ≥ 7 earthquakes is not critically important for dynamic triggering.",

            "abstract": "We describe a new technology that can provide real-time telemetry of sensor data from the ocean bottom. The breakthrough technology that makes this system possible is an autonomous surface vehicle called the Wave Glider developed by Liquid Robotics, Inc. of Sunnyvale, CA., which harvests wave and solar energy for motive and electrical power.\nThe free-floating surface communications gateway uses a Liquid Robotics wave glider comprising a surfboard-sized float towed by a tethered, submerged glider, which converts wave motion into thrust. For navigation, the wave glider is equipped with a small computer, a GPS receiver, a rudder, solar panels and batteries, and an Iridium satellite modem. Acoustic communications connect the subsea instruments and the surface gateway while communications between the gateway and land are provided by the Iridium satellite constellation. Wave gliders have demonstrated trans-oceanic range and long-term station keeping capabilities.\nThe topside acoustics communications package is mounted in a shallow tow body, which uses a WHOI micro modem and a Benthos low frequency, directional transducer. A matching bottom side modem and transducer are mounted on the ocean bottom package.\nTests of the surface gateway in 4000 m of water demonstrated an acoustic efficiency of approximately 256 bits/J. For example, it has the ability to send four channels of compressed, one sample per second data from the ocean bottom to the gateway with an average power draw of approximately 0.36 W and a latency of about three minutes.\nThis gateway is used to send near-real-time data from a broadband ocean bottom seismic observatory; we are presently designing and constructing a seafloor package with a two-year operational life. We have found that for frequencies f where f<10mHz, 35mHz < f < 120mHz and f>~3Hz, the vertical component, seafloor system noise characteristics are generally superior to similar observatories on land. Increasing the density of these stations over the majority of the surface of Earth; that is, the oceans will greatly enhance the resolution of deep Earth structure and serve civil needs including tsunami warning. The robotic technology is readily applicable for other ocean observations.",

            "abstract": "The lithospheric stress states and interlayer coupling interaction is of great significant in studying plate driven mechanism and seismogenic environment. The coupling relationship between mantle convection generated drag stress in the lithospheric base and seismogenic layer stress in the crust represents the lithospheric mechanical coupling intensity level. We calculate the lithospheric bottom mantle convection stress field of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau using 11~36 spherical harmonic coefficients of gravity model EGM2008. Meanwhile we collect and organize the focal mechanism of 1131 earthquakes that occurred from 2000 to now in Sichuan-Yunnan region. The current seismogenic layer stress and stress field before Lushan earthquake are calculated by the damping regional stress tensor inversion. We further analyze the correlation between the two kinds of stress fields, then discuss the relation between mechanics coupling situation and strong earthquakes in different regions. The results show that: (1) Most of Sichuan-Yunnan region is located in the coupling and decoupling intermediate zone. Coupling zones distribute on the basis of block, the eastern South China block has strong coupling, and the coupling phenomenon also exists in parts of the northern Tibet block, Balyanlkalla block in the northwest and southwest Yunnan block. The decoupling mainly occurs in Songpan-Ganzi block, connecting with the strong coupling South China block and Longmenshan fault zone is their boundary. (2) We have analyzed seismogenic mechanism, then proposed the border zone of strong and weak coupling relation between mantle convection stress and seismogenic layer stress exists high seismic risk. The current coupling situation shows that Longmenshan fault zone is still in the large varying gradient area of coupling intensity level, it has conditions to accumulate energy and develop earthquakes. Other dangerous areas are: Mingjiang, Xianshuihe, Anninghe, Zemuhe, the Red River, Nantinghe fault zone and their neighboring areas.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative constraints on melt transport in upper mantle are critical to understanding various dynamic processes at ocean ridges. In this study, we propose that thermodynamic gradients, resulting from spatial variations in mineralogy, can unevenly partition melt between olivine and orthopyroxene (opx), the two most abundant minerals in the upper mantle. The lithologic melt partitioning leads to higher melt fraction in olivine-rich regions compared to opx-rich regions, which may have important implications for melt transport.\nLithologic partitioning has been experimentally confirmed in analogue systems, such as quartz/fluorite-H2O (Watson, 1999), but has never been observed in olivine/opx-melt samples. We synthesized olivine/opx-melt (harzburgite) samples by isostatically pressing oxide-high alumina basalt mixtures at 1350 °C and 1.5 GPa in a piston-cylinder apparatus. Nominal melt fractions of 0.02 to 0.20 and a constant 3 to 2 (olivine to opx) volume ratio were tested. Experimental charges were quenched, cored, and imaged using synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The resulting 3-D images constitute digital rock samples on which local melt fraction distributions, permeabilities, and electrical conductivities were numerically quantified.\nOur results are strong evidence for melt partitioning between olivine and opx: local melt fractions are 10 to 50% higher around olivine than opx grains. At the same melt fraction, permeabilities of whole harzburgite samples are lower compared to monomineralic olivine-melt samples (Miller et al., 2014). However, the presence of opx negligibly affects the permeability-porosity relation unless the abundance of opx is more than 40 vol. %. In contrast, electrical conductivities of harzburgites are systematically lower than those of olivine-melt samples. Lithological melt partitioning could be another mechanism responsible for forming high-porosity melt pathways in addition to reaction infiltration instability and deformation melt bands.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges in understanding the air quality over forested regions has been the uncertainties in estimating the biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. Biogenic volatile organic compounds, BVOCs, play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in ozone and particulate matter (PM) formation. In southeastern United States, BVOCs (mostly as isoprene) are the dominant summertime source of reactive hydrocarbon. Despite significant efforts in improving BVOC estimates, the errors in emission inventories remain a concern. Since BVOC emissions are particularly sensitive to the available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), model errors in PAR result in large errors in emission estimates. Thus, utilization of satellite observations to estimate PAR can help in reducing emission uncertainties.\nSatellite-based PAR estimates rely on the technique used to derive insolation from satellite visible brightness measurements. In this study we evaluate several insolation products against surface pyranometer observations and offer a bias correction to generate a more accurate PAR product. The improved PAR product is then used in biogenic emission estimates. The improved biogenic emission estimates are compared to the emission inventories over Texas and used in air quality simulation over the period of August-September 2013 (NASA’s Discover-AQ field campaign). A series of sensitivity simulations will be performed and evaluated against Discover-AQ observations to test the impact of satellite-derived PAR on air quality simulations.",

            "abstract": "Integration of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) policies, their implementation measures and the contribution of these to development has been gaining attention recently. Due to the shared objectives of CCA and particularly Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), a component of DRM, their integration provides many benefits. At the implementation level, DRR and CCA are usually integrated. Policy integration, however, is often lacking.\nThis study presents a novel analysis of the policy integration of DRR and CCA by 1) suggesting a definition for their integration at a general and further at horizontal and vertical levels, 2) using an analysis framework for policy integration cycle, which separates the policy formulation and implementation processes, and 3) applying these to a case study in Zambia. Moreover, the study identifies the key gaps in the integration process, obtains an understanding of identified key factors for creating an enabling environment for the integration, and provides recommendations for further progress. The study is based on a document analysis of the relevant DRM, climate change (CC), agriculture, forestry, water management and meteorology policy documents and Acts, and 21 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders.\nHorizontal integration has occurred both ways, as the revised DRM policy draft has incorporated CCA, and the new CC policy draft has incorporated DRR. This is not necessarily an optimal strategy and unless carefully implemented, it may create pressure on institutional structures and duplication of efforts in the implementation. Much less vertical integration takes place, and where it does, no guidance on how potential goal conflicts with sectorial and development objectives ought to be handled. The objectives of the instruments show convergence. At the programme stage, the measures are fully integrated as they can be classified as robust CCA measures, providing benefits in the current and future climates.",

            "abstract": "Intensively managed landscapes (IMLs) in the Midwestern United States have been shaped by repeated glacial events over geologic time scales followed by rapid human modifications for agriculture and artificial drainage that were overlaid on extremely low gradient stream networks. These landscapes are heavily modified by agriculture, artificial drainage, deforestation, urbanization, and wetland destruction. Channel head extension and periodic dredging for channel straightening not only strongly affected hydrologic and geomorphologic response, but also fundamentally alter the energy consumption in the whole river basin. However, it is unclear how the landscape consumes and responds to the extra energy from human activities. Therefore, we evaluate the present-day dynamics of river network from the perspective of of geomorphic equilibrium, hydrological response, and the rate of energy dissipation. Then, we simulate the landscape evolution to discover the tendency of the system. We find that channel head extension and straightening increases the rate of energy dissipation and pushes the river network further away from equilibrium condition. From our numerical model simulation, extending and maintaining the ditches in the river network can cause large ridge migration, river network redistribution, and enlargement of the drainage basin area. Our research demonstrates how the river basin responds to human activities in glaciated landscape, and how it is likely to behave with artificial modifications on the topography in the future. We attribute the legacy to drainage basin reorganization and theorized that humans can have a lasting impact on the landscape even after active management has ceased.",

We will present preliminary results of a study incorporating of hydrometric information, water stable isotopes (δ18O), and concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia (NH3), and nitrate (NO3) within 4 sites in a nested framework at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA), OR. Preliminary analysis of 2 storms (54mm and 145mm) indicate highly variable responses across space along with a positive relation between transit time of event water and storm magnitude in all catchments. In addition there appears to be a moisture threshold after which transit time scales with drainage area across the landscape likely related to higher degree of connectivity. We also found a strong correlation between transit times computed based on temporal variability of δ18O and electrical connectivity (EC). This lead to the analysis of over 50 storm across 10 catchments in the HJA during the last 3 years. In-stream NO3- during storm response are highest within the smaller catchments (1-5 km2) and tend to remain elevated throughout the response period. The larger catchments (15-64 km2) demonstrate smaller increases in NO3-, the response time lags behind that of the smaller catchments, and the concentration returns rapidly to baseflow conditions rather than remaining elevated. In contrast, in-stream NH3 show a higher degree of similarity between sites in terms of magnitude and timing of increases in concentration over the duration of the response period. Ultimately we found that fractions of inorganic nitrogen correlate with transit time and drainage area, opening the possibility of a catchment wide model of nutrient export prediction.",

In this paper, we use ARTEMIS observations and numerical simulations to study the role of ADFs in accelerating and reflecting ions in the ambient plasma sheet. Both case and statistical observations show that the first signature one would observe before ADF arrival is the tailward-streaming, energy-dispersed ions; after about 1 minute, the ion fluxes are enhanced significantly with the peak direction shifted duskward, and then the peak direction gradually shifts back to the tailward direction until the ADF arrives. All these signatures are reproduced by our simulation model of ion acceleration and reflection on ADFs. We further examine typical trajectories of plasma sheet ions before and after their ADF reflection, to understand these seemingly complicated ion signatures as well as their similarities and differences with those characteristics ahead of DFs.",

We present near-real time response models developed within hours of the event using a simplified Newmark analysis. These rapid response models were used to prioritize early scientific efforts and to guide rescue and recovery efforts by US and international agencies. Analyses included prediction of regional landslide occurrence and identification of potential landslide dam locations, which could cause flooding upstream and downstream if the dam is catastrophically breached.\nSubsequent investigations have included mapping of coseismic landslides using pre- and post- event satellite imagery and field observations, and inversion of mapped landslide distributions for estimates of near-surface rock strength. Compared to model predictions using regionally uniform rock strength, observed landslides are more concentrated north of the physiographic transition between the Lesser and Greater Himalaya where hillslope gradients suddenly steepen. Fewer landslides than predicted occurred in the high elevation, steep glaciated terrain and in areas of highest modeled PGA, just to the south of this physiographic transition. Discrepancies between model predictions and observations could arise from spatial variability in rock strength, in PGA or frequency content at specific site locations, or by pre-conditioning (topographic or otherwise) for landslide hazard.\nCo-seismic landsliding produces a prolonged hazard for years to come. In the near term, more frequent landslides are expected to occur during the summer monsoon seasons by remobilization of debris and due to a dynamic increase in pore-pressure on hillsides or near ridge tops that were pervasively cracked during the main earthquake or aftershocks, but did not previously fail. Numerous small valley-blocking slides attest to the ready delivery of sediment to stream channels during this event. Because larger seismic events are known to occur in the Himalaya, we anticipate that feedbacks between the seismic cycle and sediment transport influence long-term erosion patterns.",

            "abstract": "Taking advantage of the rich diversity of Nepal’s tree species and their distribution over a steep topographical gradient, we carried out a dendroclimatological study in the Himalaya with the objective of identifying the response of various tree species to climate changes and to reconstruct the past hydro-climate of the region. We developed ring-width chronologies dating back to AD 1334 by analyzing tree core samples of Abies spectabilis, Abies pindrow, Betula utilis, Juniperus recurva, Larix griffithiana, Picea smithiana and Tsuga dumosa. We found a significant positive correlation among the chronologies of different species within and between different sites suggesting that common climatic factors limit the growth of these trees, which is a needed basis to produce a climate reconstruction. Response function analysis revealed that pre-monsoon temperature (March-May) had a negative relationship to growth for most of the species, and that tree growth was positively correlated with precipitation of pre-monsoon to monsoon (March-July) in certain sites. In some sites near the treeline, winter climate had significant influence on the growth of the subsequent growing period. The March–May average temperature and precipitation of the past 400 years was reconstructed. The temperature reconstruction identified several periods of warming and cooling; however, it did not show a significant pattern of cooling during the Little Ice Age. Similarly, the reconstructed precipitation showed several wet and dry periods. We tested the correlation between the reconstructed spring temperatures with indexes of sea surface temperature of the equatorial Pacific and extended multivariate ENSO Index, revealing a significant negative correlation with monsoon and post monsoons seasons. This relationship demonstrates that the climate of Nepal Himalaya has spatio-temporal linkages with global scale climatic variability.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur isotopic (δ34S) analysis is used as one of the methods of Precambrian environmental reconstruction. It has been pointed out that δ34S fluctuations of sulfate and sulfide have close relationship with rise of oxygen level and increase in biological activity of sulfate reducing bacteria. For example, the difference of δ34S between sulfate and sulfide is small in Archean while it gets larger after evolution of oxygen level and biological activity (e.g. Canfield and Farquhar, 2009).\nHowever, evidence of δ34S difference between sulfate and sulfide in Archean is scarce. In this study, we focused on barite and pyrite occurred at the layer in the 3.2 Ga Dixon Island Formation in coastal Pilbara terrane, Western Australia.\nWe found pyrites in from the bottom of the Black Chert Member to the Varicolored Chert Member of the Dixon Island Formation. Particularly, we can see pyrite layers of a few millimeters thick which make an alternate layers with black chert layers in the Varicolored Chert Member. The bulk δ34S values of these layers are -10.1~+26.8‰ (Sakamoto, 2010MS) and micro-meter scale heterogeneity of δ34S can be seen in minute spherical shell pyrite which was formed at early stage of diagenesis (Miki, 2015MS).\nOn the other hand, barite layers are remained in the lower part of the Black Chert Member in the Dixon Island Formation. In these layers, columnar quartz crystals were representative which are considered to be a pseudomorph of barite. Such equigranular occurrences of barite are typical character in submarine hydrothermal system (Kiyokawa et al., 2006). There exist small crystals of barite (less than 200 um in diameter) which are expected to be remnants of original barite. We performed microscale sulfur isotope analyses using a NanoSIMS.\nAs a preliminary result, we obtained δ34S value of +3.4~+9.1‰ (n=11). These values are similar to the reported values of barite which are considered to be a hydrothermal origin in 3.47 Ga North Pole, Pilbara (+3.2~+8.7‰, Shen et al. 2001). Our data reflects that of seawater at that time, and is lower than that of pyrite in the same place (Sakamoto, MS2010). This indicates that there was an event to make sulfide heavier than seawater sulfate.",

Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO\nDuring summer months, the Northern Front Range Metropolitan Area (NFRMA) of Colorado consistently violates the 75 ppbv 8-hour EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ambient ozone (O3), despite continued reduction in anthropogenic emissions. The region has been deemed an O3 non-attainment zone since 2008. Ground-level O3 is produced from photochemical catalytic cycles involving OH radicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and NOx (NO + NO2). VOC emissions in the NFRMA are dominated by anthropogenic sources and influenced by biogenic and agricultural sources, while NOx emissions are mainly from automobile exhaust. A growing concern in the region is the role of oil and natural gas (ONG) on VOC concentrations and the potential for O3 production. Increases in local VOC emissions will likely cause subsequent increase in local O3 concentrations as PO3 increases in a region that is already affected by high O3episodes.\nAs a part of the SONGNEX 2015 (Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus) campaign, we measured a broad suite of speciated VOCs during two 8-week deployments (March-May 2015, July-September 2015) at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Erie, CO. VOC measurements were made with a custom-online multichannel gas chromatography system (50+ compounds hourly), along with measurements of O3, SO2, NOx, NOy, PAN, CO, CO2, and CH4. We use these data to investigate the role of different VOC sources, and ONG in particular, in contributing to VOC reactivity and thus instantaneous O3 production. Preliminary analysis of the Spring VOC data indicates that VOC reactivity is dominated by light alkanes typical of ONG emissions - specifically propane, consistent with previous winter-time studies. We will use the observed temperature-dependence of VOC concentrations and reactivity, along with weekday-weekend relationships of O3 and precursors, to examine the impact of ONG on O3 production in the Front Range.",

A value of 0.4471±0.0013 (2SD, n=37) for the 65Cu/63Cu ratio was obtained with a value of +0.18±0.04 ‰ (2SD, n=5) for δ65Cu relative to NIST 976.The availability of the NIST SRM 3114 material, now with the absolute value of the 65Cu/63Cu ratio and a δ65Cu value relative to NIST 976 makes it suitable as a new candidate reference material for Cu isotope studies. In addition, a protocol is described for the accurate and precise determination of δ65Cu values of geological reference materials. Purification of Cu from the sample matrix was performed using the AG MP-1M Bio-Rad resin. The column recovery for geological samples was found to be 100±2% (2SD, n=15).A modified method of standard-sample bracketing with internal normalization for mass bias correction was employed by adding natural Ga to both the sample and the solution of NIST SRM 3114, which was used as the bracketing standard. An absolute value of 0.4471±0.0013 (2SD, n=37) for 65Cu/63Cu quantified in this study was used to calibrate the 69Ga/71Ga ratio in the two adjacent bracketing standards of SRM 3114,their average value of 69Ga/71Ga was then used to correct the 65Cu/63Cu ratio in the sample. Measured δ65Cu values of 0.18±0.04‰ (2SD, n=20),0.13±0.04‰ (2SD, n=9),0.08±0.03‰ (2SD, n=6),0.01±0.06‰(2SD, n=4) and 0.26±0.04‰ (2SD, n=7) were obtained for five geological reference materials of BCR-2,BHVO-2,AGV-2,BIR-1a,and GSP-2,respectively,in agreement with values obtained in previous studies.",

            "abstract": "Podcasts are downloadable web-hosted audio programs (radio on demand). The medium’s popularity has grown immensely since its beginning 10+ years ago. “Science and Medicine” remains a prominent category in iTunes (the most popular podcast marketplace), but is unfortunately inundated with non-scientific and dubious content (e.g. the paranormal, health fads, etc.). It seems unlikely that legitimate science content would thrive in such an environment. However, our experience as an independent science podcast shows it is possible to successfully present authentic science to a general audience and maintain popularity. Our show, Science… sort of, began in the fall of 2009, and we have since produced episodes regularly. As of July 31, 2015, our feed hosts 235 episodes, with an average ~6,700 downloads per episode, and over 1.6 million total downloads originating from all across the globe. Thanks to listener involvement and contribution, the show is financially self-sustaining. While production requires a significant time input, no external financial support from the creators or other granting agencies is needed. Traditional media outlets rely on advertisers, thus pressuring shows to produce “popular” content featuring science celebrities. In contrast, independent podcasts can interview big name science communicators, such as Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, while also exploring the research of graduate students and early career scientists. This level playing field provides an unprecedented opportunity for studies to reach a global audience and share research that previously may have only be seen by those at a specialized conference or subscribed to niche journals. Further, direct public engagement helps the audience personally connect to the research and researcher. In combination with other social media platforms, podcasting is a powerful tool in the outreach arsenal, enabling one to share science directly with the world in a way that both educates and excites listeners.",

A preliminary map of the Fejokoo quadrangle is presented here. This region, located between 21˚-66˚N and 270-0˚E, hosts four primary features: (1) the centrally located, 90 km diameter, distinctly hexagonal impact crater Fejokoo; (2) a small unnamed crater midway up the eastern boundary of the quadrangle which contains and is surrounded by bright material; (3) an unnamed degraded crater NW of Fejokoo that contains lobate material deposits on both sides of the crater’s S rim; and (4) a heavily cratered unit in the NW portion of the quadrangle. Key objectives for the ongoing mapping of this quadrangle are to assess the types of processes that may be responsible for the creation of the hexagonal Fejokoo crater, identifying the source and nature of the bright material on the eastern boundary, establishing possible mechanisms for the emplacement of lobate material deposits in Fejokoo and the unnamed crater to its NW, and establishing a detailed geological history of the quadrangle. The Fejokoo region is not associated with any major albedo feature identified by the Hubble Space Telescope (Li et al., 2006). At the time of this writing geologic mapping was performed using Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits, including grayscale and color images and digital terrain models derived from stereo images. Future images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (140 m/px) and Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (35 m/px) will be used to refine the maps.\nSupport of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams is acknowledged.

            "abstract": "One of the primary goals of the MAVEN mission is to characterize rates of atmospheric escape from Mars at the present epoch and relate those escape rates to solar drivers. One of the known escape processes is photochemical escape, where a) an exothermic chemical reaction in the atmosphere results in an upward-traveling neutral particle whose velocity exceeds planetary escape velocity and b) the particle is not prevented from escaping through any subsequent collisions.\nBecause escaping hot atoms are not directly measured, models of production and transport (through the atmosphere) of such atoms must be used to constrain photochemical escape rates. These models require altitude profiles of neutral densities and electron and ion densities and temperatures, as well as compositional information, all of which are measured by MAVEN instruments at the relevant altitudes (150-300 km). For every altitude profile:\nProfiles of O2+ dissociative recombination (DR) rates will be calculated from electron temperature, electron density and O2+ density.\nProfiles of energy distributions of hot O atoms will be calculated from profiles of electron and ion temperatures.\nProfiles of all neutral densities will be input into models of hot O transport in order to calculate photochemical escape fluxes from DR of O2+.\nWe will present photochemical escape fluxes as a function of several factors, in particular solar zenith angle and EUV flux. This, combined with further simulations with progressively higher EUV fluxes, will eventually enable a total integrated loss estimate over the course of Martian history and hence a determination of the impact of this loss process on the evolution of the Martian climate.",

            "abstract": "The quantity of total organic carbon (TOC) and its type determine the ability of source rocks to generate hydrocarbons. Thus, the quantification of TOC content is an essential part of any reservoir characterisation project. Traditionally TOC is estimated from geochemical analysis of core samples. In this case the results are limited spatially by a well location as well as vertically by a number of tested samples. At the same time TOC vertical variability might be very high, changing every 1-3 m. The several methods have been deployed to estimate TOC from well-log data which provides continuous vertical profile estimations. The basin wide information might be provided by the utilization of seismic surveys. The methodology of mapping source rocks based on seismic data has been lately reported to be successful for the thick source rocks (>20 m) with relatively high TOC values up to 3-4% (Løseth et al., 2011).\nWe employ the described approach and demonstrate our findings for a case study from Ceduna Basin (Great Australian Bight, Australia). The reported TOC values estimated from the cores go up to only 1.3%. The organic matter is contained in thin layers of claystones interlayered with sandstones.\nThe workflow included TOC estimation from the well-log data and then seismic data inversion performed in JasonTM software. The inverted acoustic impedance decreases nonlinearly with increasing TOC content. The obtained results comprises 2D section of TOC distribution. The calculated TOC values are in a good agreement with the results of laboratory measurements.\nThe results of this study show that TOC can be successfully estimated from seismic data inversion even in the case of low organic matter values. Further work has to be done to understand whether this approach works for different types of organic matter and stages of its maturation.\nLøseth H., Wensaas L., Gading M., Duffaut K., Springer M. 2001.

The Pliocene-Pleistocene Waucobi Lake Beds in the Owens Valley east of Big Pine, CA and Sierra Nevada Mountains are uplifted onto the western White-Inyo Mountain piedmont with a tephrochronology age of 2.2-2 Ma. We present 40Ar/39Ar and paleomagnetic chronology, isotopic analysis of clays and seismic data to evaluate the climate and tectonic controls on the Waucobi basin.\nWithin the 130-m-thick lake beds, we determined ages of 2.6-2 Ma on sanidine from intercalated tuff beds by 40Ar/39Ar single-crystal laser step-heating method. A paleomagnetic reversal identifies the Gauss/Matuyama boundary at 2.5-2.6 Ma. Clay mineral analysis shows phillipsite, an alkaline clay, dominating the lower section of Waucobi whereas the upper section contains montmorillonite, a fresh water clay. Deuterium isotopic analyses were performed on clay showing δD values for phillipsite increasing between 2.6-2.5 Ma from -105 ‰ to -60 ‰ indicating a wet climate, whereas δD values in montmorillonite decrease between 2.3-2.2 Ma from -70 ‰ to -90 ‰ implying a drier climate. Shallow active seismic studies suggest a basement depth of 300 m near the locality Duchess canyon.\nClay mineral and isotopic analyses indicate that Waucobi records an environment that does not reflect climate change represented by other lake systems in the eastern Sierra. This suggests that Waucobi records tectonic changes occurring between the Sierra Nevada and White-Inyo Mountains. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate calculated from the Duchess canyon exposure of 91 m and ages of 2.6-2.3 Ma, the seismic data indicates that the base of the lake section may be as old as 3.5 Ma. We suggest that lake formation coincides with extension-strike slip tectonics along the western Basin and Range, and uplift of the Sierra from the mid-Pliocene to Pleistocene.",

Uranus’ large obliquity, coupled with the fact that its dipole moment is off-centered and highly tilted relative to the rotation axis, leads to unique and seasonally dependent interaction geometries with the solar wind. We present results from adapting a multifluid MHD simulation to examine these seasonally dependent geometries in terms of the global magnetospheric structure, magnetopause and bow shock location, and magnetotail configuration. The Voyager 2 spacecraft encountered Uranus near solstice, and was able to observe the magnetic field structure and plasma characteristics of a twisted magnetotail [Behannon et al., 1987]. We use such magnetometer and plasma observations as a basis for benchmarking our simulations for the solstice scenario. Auroral observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope during equinox [Lamy et al.,2012] give some indication of the magnetospheric interaction with the solar wind. We also demonstrate the structural difference of the magnetosphere between solstice and equinox seasons. The magnetosphere at equinox is quite distinct due to the orientation and rotation of the magnetic axis relative to the solar wind direction.",

            "abstract": "Fog samples have been collected throughout the fall-winter season during each dense fog episode since 1989 at the field station of San Pietro Capofiume (Bologna, Italy) located in a rural area in the south-eastern part of the Po Valley. Since the fall-winter season 1997/98 both soluble and insoluble carbon content was also measured and now a sixteen years long dataset is available. Carbonaceous matter accounts for a significant fraction of the insoluble material suspended in fog water. The sum of EC and water insoluble organic mass accounts on average for 46%-56% of the mass of total suspended material. Insoluble carbonaceous material is composed mainly by organic matter, EC accounting on average only for 17% of the total insoluble carbon. A good correlation observed between EC and OC through the different years, suggests that anthropogenic combustion processes, which represent the main source of EC, are also the most important source of OC in fog droplets. Recent results also show that a potential important contribution to WSOC in for water is derived by aqueous secondary organic aerosol from biomass burning emissions. The water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) represents on average 25% of the total solute mass and its contribution to the total organic carbon (TOC) ranges from 52 to 95% with an average of 86%.\nThe high amount of carbonaceous compounds in the Po Valley fog detected and the simultaneous decrease of the main inorganic species concentration (Giulianelli et al., 2014) in the last two decades highlight the potential influence of organics on the decrease of fog frequency.\n Giulianelli L., Gilardoni S., Tarozzi L., Rinaldi M., Decesari S, Carbone C., Facchini M.C. and Fuzzi S., Atmos.

            "abstract": "The interplanetary dust cloud is visible through its scattered light (the zodiacal light) at visible wavelengths. Brightness observations lead to equilibrium temperature and albedo of the particles and their variation as a function of the heliocentric distance. The light scattered by this optically thin medium is linearly polarized with negative values of the degree of linear polarization, PQ, in the backscattering region. We will review the zodiacal light photopolarimetric observations from the whole line–of-sight integrated values to the local values retrieved by inversion. Whenever available, the local PQ variation as a function of the phase angle presents a phase curve with a small negative branch and large positive branch similar to comets or asteroids. PQ does not seem to show a wavelength variation. The maximum of polarization decreases with decreasing heliocentric distance. A circular polarization signal may be present in parts of the sky.\nBoth numerical simulations and laboratory experiments of light scattering by irregular particles have been performed to constrain the interplanetary dust properties based on their polarimetric signature. These studies indicate that mixtures of low-absorption (Mg-silicates) and high-absorption (carbonaceous) particles can explain the intensity and polarimetric observations of the zodiacal cloud. The variations with the heliocentric distance may be due to decreasing carbonaceous content of the dust cloud. Such models would favor a significant proportion of aggregates and absorbing particles in the interplanetary dust medium, indicative of a major cometary dust contribution. The exact origin (asteroidal, cometary, interstellar) and physical properties of the dust particles contributing to the zodiacal cloud is still debated and will be more constrained with future observations. New high-resolution systems will monitor the zodiacal light from the ground and new results are expected from upcoming space missions.",

            "abstract": "Fires play a major role in the carbon-cycle and the development of global vegetation, especially on the continent of Australia, where vegetation is prone to frequent fire occurences and where regional composition and stand-age distribution is regulated by fire. Furthermore, the probable changes of fire behaviour under a changing climate are still poorly understood and require further investigation.\nIn this presentation we introduce the fire-model BLAZE (BLAZe induced land-atmosphere flux Estimator), designed for a novel approach to simulate fire-frequencies, fire-intensities, fire related fluxes and the responses in vegetation. Fire frequencies are prescribed using SIMFIRE (Knorr et al., 2014) or GFED3 (e.g. Giglio et al., 2013). Fire-Line-Intensity (FLI) is computed from meteorological information and fuel loads which are state variables within the C-cycle component of CABLE (Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land Exchange model). This FLI is used as an input to the tree-demography model POP\n(Population-Order-Physiology; Haverd et al., 2014). Within POP the fire-mortality depends on FLI and tree height distribution. Intensity-dependent combustion factors (CF) are then generated for and applied to live and litter carbon pools as well as the transfers from live pools to litter caused by fire. Thus, both fire and stand characteristics are taken into account which has a legacy effect on future events.\nGross C-CO2 emissions from Australian wild fires are larger than Australian territorial fossil fuel emissions. However, the net effect of fire on the Australian terrestrial carbon budget is unknown. We address this by applying the newly-developed fire module, integrated within the CABLE land surface model, and optimised for the Australian region, to a reassessment of the Australian Terrestrial Carbon Budget.",

            "abstract": "A series of injection-withdrawl (push-pull) well tests were conducted at the Otway CO2CRC field site using the CRC-2 well to determine the impact of injecting impurities (54 ppm SO2, 9 ppm NO2, 1100 ppm N2 and 6150 ppm O2) with a CO2 stream on mineral dissolution/precipitation processes in a siliciclastic reservoir.\nFour geochemical tracers were added to the injection waters of two sequential tests to monitor for any fluid mixing in the reservoir during the tests. Bromide and strontium were added as tracers to the injection water of test 1, and fluoresceine and lithium were added as tracers to the injection water of test 2. Injection waters in both tests were allowed to soak in the reservoir before they were back-produced to monitor for any water-rock interactions that took place.\nThe results suggest mixing of injection and in situ formation waters as well as reactivity of some of the tracers. Bromide behaves as an inert tracer and the concentration decreases by 6 and 15% after 11 and 21 days of soaking, respectively, suggesting minor fluid mixing in the reservoir. Fluorescein drops by about 50% after two days of soaking, which may be due to adsorption onto minerals under acidic conditions. Strontium and lithium concentrations decrease over time in excess to the bromide concentration decrease, this may indicate the precipitation of Sr and Li bearing mineral phases that are calculated to be supersaturated with respect to the composition of back-produced waters.\nThe decrease in bromide tracer concentration over time can be explained by preferential flow paths and hydrodynamic mixing during the soak period. Importantly, ideal tracer behavior was observed during a subsequent experiment where water was continuously back-produced. Our results show that typical (shallow) groundwater tracers need to be applied with caution when studying the hydrodynamics in a CO2 storage reservoir. Further geochemical and hydrodynamic modelling is underway to fully explain our observations.",

            "abstract": "On 21 April 1935, a large earthquake with a local magnitude of ML7.1 struck central Taiwan, named the Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake. Its epicenter was located in Miaoli County and the surface rupture went through the Taichung metropolitan area. The focal depth was estimated to be less than 10 km. This earthquake was associated with two major seismic faults: the northern one is the Shihtan thrust fault; the southern one is the Tuntzuchiao right-lateral strike-slip fault which separated from the Shihtan fault by about 30 km. This earthquake have been investigated by several studies and various fault models were been proposed. However, due to complicate regional structures in the source area, the detailed fault geometry and coseismic slip distribution of this event are still not clear. In this study, we investigated the influence of fault geometry and source slip distribution based on these previously proposed fault models for the Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake. There are three main types of fault models: (1) two-segment fault planes without a blind fault, (2) complicate fault planes with three blind faults, and (3) four-segment fault planes with two blind faults. We investigated the spatial slip distribution based on these fault models from source inversion analysis by using the triangulation data. The preferred fault geometry and slip distribution derived from the inversion results were discussed. Finally, a forward 3D ground motion simulation based on the inverted source model was carried out to reconstruct the ShakeMap and ground motion time history during the Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Global tropical cyclone climate has been investigated with indicators of frequency, intensity and activity. However, a full understanding of global warming's influence on tropical cyclone climate remains elusive because of the incomplete nature of these indicators. Here we form a complete three-dimensional variability space of tropical cyclone climate where the variabilities are continuously linked and find that global ocean warmth best explains the out-of-phase relationship between intensity and frequency of global tropical cyclones. In a year with greater ocean warmth, the tropical troposphere is capped by higher pressure anomaly in the middle and upper troposphere even with higher moist static energy anomaly in the lower troposphere, which is thought to inhibit overall tropical cyclone occurrences but lead to greater intensities. Statistical consequence is the trade-off between intensity and frequency. We calculate an average increase in global tropical cyclone intensity of 1.3 m/s over the past 30 years of ocean warming occurring at the expense of 6.1 tropical cyclones worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The urban heat island has received much attention as an important environmental problem. Urban parks have abilities to mitigate the urban heat island, because surface and surrounding air temperature are often lower in urban parks than urban built-up. In this study, we have conducted a comparative measurements of the surface energy balance at an urban built-up and a large urban park. We clarify the important factors mitigating surface temperatures by creating the urban park based on a methodology called the temperature decomposition (Lee et al., 2011). Two observation sites have been set at the urban built-up and the large urban park, Oizumiryokuchi, in Sakai, Japan. Sensible and latent heat fluxes have been measured by the eddy covariance method. Ground heat flux was estimated using the Objective Hysteresis Model (Grimmond et al., 1991). Anthropogenic heat flux was estimated by the inventory data for the urban built-up area. To decompose the change in surface temperatures due to a land use change from the urban built-up to the urban park, the temperature decomposition method was applied for daytime and nighttime. We separated the contributions of the surface temperature changes by change in albedo, surface roughness, Bowen ratio, ground heat flux, and anthropogenic heat. The result indicates that increasing surface roughness in the urban park was the most effective factor in cooling daytime surface temperature. For nighttime, decreasing ground heat flux due to increasing vegetation cover was the most effective factor in cooling surface temperature. The comparative measurement in the urban area is a powerful tool for developing mitigation strategies for the urban heat island. ",

            "abstract": "May 30, 2015 Bonin Islands, Japan earthquake (Mw 7.8, depth 679.9km GCMT) was one of the deepest earthquakes ever recorded. We apply the waveform inversion technique (Kikuchi & Kanamori, 1991) to obtain slip distribution in the source fault of this earthquake in the same manner as our previous work (Nakamura et al., 2010). We use 60 broadband seismograms of IRIS GSN seismic stations with epicentral distance between 30 and 90 degrees. The broadband original data are integrated into ground displacement and band-pass filtered in the frequency band 0.002-1 Hz. We use the velocity structure model IASP91 to calculate the wavefield near source and stations. We assume that the fault is squared with the length 50 km. We obtain source rupture model for both nodal planes with high dip angle (74 degree) and low dip angle (26 degree) and compare the synthetic seismograms with the observations to determine which source rupture model would explain the observations better. We calculate broadband synthetic seismograms with these source propagation models using the spectral-element method (Komatitsch & Tromp, 2001). We use new Earth Simulator system in JAMSTEC to compute synthetic seismograms using the spectral-element method. The simulations are performed on 7,776 processors, which require 1,944 nodes of the Earth Simulator. On this number of nodes, a simulation of 50 minutes of wave propagation accurate at periods of 3.8 seconds and longer requires about 5 hours of CPU time. Comparisons of the synthetic waveforms with the observation at teleseismic stations show that the arrival time of pP wave calculated for depth 679km matches well with the observation, which demonstrates that the earthquake really happened below the 660 km discontinuity. In our present forward simulations, the source rupture model with the low-angle fault dipping is likely to better explain the observations.",

            "abstract": "High-altitude lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) showed strong spatio-temporal variability during past decades. The lake dynamics can be associated with several key factors including lake type, supply of glacial meltwater, local climate variations. It is important to differentiate these factors when analyzing the driving force of lakes dynamics. With a focus on lakes over the Tanggula Mountains of the central TP, this study investigates the temporal evolution patterns of lake area and water level of different types: glacier-fed closed lake, non-glacier-fed closed lake and upstream lake (draining into closed lakes). We collected all available Landsat archive data and quantified the inter-annual variability of lake extents. Results show accelerated expansions of both glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes during 1970s-2013, and different temporal patterns of the two types of lakes: the non-glacier-fed lakes displayed a batch-wise growth pattern, with obvious growth in 2002, 2005 and 2011 and slight changes in other years, while glacier-fed lakes showed steady expanding tendency. The contrasting patterns are confirmed by the distinction of lake level change between the two groups derived from satellite altimetry during 2003–2009. The upstream lakes remained largely stable due to natural drainage regulation. The intermittent expansions for non-glacier-fed lakes were found to be related to excessive precipitation events and positive “precipitation–evaporation”. In contrast, glacier-fed lake changes showed weak correlations with precipitation variations, which imply a joint contribution from glacial meltwater to water budgets. A simple estimation reveals that the increased water storage for all of examined lakes contributed from precipitation/evaporation (0.31±0.09 Gt/yr) slightly overweighed the glacial meltwater supply (0.26±0.08 Gt/yr).",

            "abstract": "Although it is well known that δ56Fe of igneous rocks dramatically increase when the SiO2 content is above 71wt. %, there are still debates on the reason for Fe isotope fractionation at high temperature conditions. Previous studies proposed that crystal fractionation, partial melting, volatile exsolution, and thermal diffusion could result in the enrichment of heavy Fe isotopes in high-SiO2magma. In order to better understand the mechanism for Fe isotope fractionation in magmatism, here we present a systematic Fe isotope study for a suit of well-characterized bimodal volcanic rocks. The samples are from the late Mesozoic Hailar and Songliao basin, NE China, including basaltic-trachyandesites, I-type Trachytes and rhyodacites, and A-type rhyolites. Based on major and trace elements, radiogenic isotopes and geochronological data, it was suggested that the I-type rocks were produced by patial melting of the basaltic-trachyandesites, while the A-type rhyolites resulted from melting of the I-type rocks.\nFe isotope measurements were conducted using a Neptune Plus MC- ICP- MS in the USTC. The long-term external precision of δ56Fe is ±0.05‰ (2SD).The δ56Fe values for all the three types of rocks are positively correlated with SiO2 contents and inversely correlated with total Fe contents, consistent with previous studies. This suggests that partial melting can produce isotopically heavier partial melt than their source rocks. Notably, rhyolite samples have the highest δ56Fe (up to 0.63± 0.05 ‰) among the previously reported data for igneous rocks at a given silica content. Wet chemical analysis reveals high Fe3+/FeT in all samples, likely suggesting that partial melting occurred at an oxidizing condition. This can explain the high δ56Fe in rhyolite rocks. In summary, our results indicate that partitioning of ferric iron between mineral and melt during partial melting is critical for enrichment of heavy Fe isotopes in high silica igneous rocks.",

We investigate the extent to which several low-dimensional models can explain the Earth's dipole dynamics by comparing them to the signed relative paleointensity over the past 2 million years. Our comparisons of models and data are done by Bayesian statistics, which allows us to incorporate nonlinearity and uncertainty into the computations. The comparison, or data assimilation, reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each low-dimensional model and suggests improvements to the low-dimensional models. We also investigate if low-dimensional models can predict dipole reversals by performing extensive numerical experiments, and by hind-casting the Laschamp event, the Bruhnes-Matuyama reversal, as well as four other reversals documented over the past two million years. Our analysis stresses the need for models of geomagnetic reversals to faithfully account for the full spectrum of variability of paleomagnetic intensity.",

In the development, we focus on the extended parts of XBIEM in comparison to the conventional BIEM, and derive all the 2D displacement and stress kernels in response to a unit boundary traction in explicit discretized forms, which are the ingredients in the extension of BIEM. The final forms of kernels are compact and easy to evaluate numerically. They are implemented in simulating dynamic anti-plane rupture propagation across a bimaterial interface allowing secondary interfacial rupture. Our analysis shows a significant effect of an interfacial medium contrast on the control of dynamic rupture propagation.",

            "abstract": "Comparative studies of the gas giant and ice giant planets are needed to reliably discriminate among competing theories of the origin and evolution of giant planets and the solar system, but we lack critical measurements. A Saturn atmospheric entry probe mission would fill a vital part of that gap, allowing comparative studies of Jupiter and Saturn, providing the basis for later comparisons with the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, and informing studies of extrasolar planetary systems now being characterized. The Galileo Probe mission provided the first in situ studies of Jupiter’s atmosphere. Similar measurements at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would provide an important comparative planetology context for the Galileo results. Cassini's “Proximal Orbits” in 2017 will reveal Saturn’s internal structure to complement the Juno mission’s similar measurements at Jupiter. A Saturn entry probe, complementing the Galileo Probe investigations at Jupiter, would complete a solid basis for improved understanding of both Jupiter and Saturn, an important stepping stone to understanding Uranus and Neptune and solar system formation and evolution.\nThe 2012 Decadal Survey (\"DS\") added Saturn Probe science objectives to NASA's New Frontiers Program: highest-priority Tier 1 objectives any New Frontiers implementation must achieve, and Tier 2, high priority but lower than Tier 1. A DS mission concept study using extremely conservative assumptions concluded that a Saturn Probe project could fit within New Frontiers resource constraints, giving a PI confidence that they could pursue some Tier 2 objectives, customizing for the proper balance of science return, science team composition, procured or contributed instruments, etc. Contributed instruments could significantly enhance the payload and the science team for greater science return. They also provide international collaboration opportunities, with science benefits well demonstrated by missions such as Cassini-Huygens and Rosetta.",

            "abstract": "Authors have observed the current waveform of lightning flashes by the Rogowski coils installed at the wind turbines located in southern Kyushu, Japan. We succeeded in observing three sets of lightning current waveforms of negative downward flashes hit to the wind turbine and estimated the location error by comparing the actual position with the positions located by the Japanese Lightning Detection Network (JLDN) in two summer seasons between 2013 and 2014. The JLDN is a Lightning Locating System consisting of 30 LF sensors installed for observing lightning in the whole area of Japan. According to our estimation, the mean location error of the first strokes was 557m and that of subsequent ones was 316 m in the JLDN, respectively. This means the location accuracy of the JLDN was slightly less than that of the NALDN and the EUCLID. We found out location errors were less than 400 m when only information from sensors within 700 km from lightning strokes was used for locating stroke positions. Therefore, we recalculated locations of those lightning strokes without information from sensors at more than 700 km from them. In the results of the recalculation, the mean location error of the first strokes was improved by 219 m and that of subsequent ones was improved by 48 m, respectively. This indicates eliminating large deviation data from distant sensors for lightning location reduced the standard deviation of the time differences between actually measured time at sensors and calculated time and thus improved location error of the JLDN. We found out that there were strong positive relations between the location errors and the standard deviation of the time differences. The standard deviations of the time difference were less than 1.5 micro-seconds when location errors were within 400 m. Therefore, locating lightning strokes without information from distant sensors is a useful method for reducing the standard deviation and improving location error.",

            "abstract": "In a region with little understanding in terms of active faults and seismicity, two large-magnitude reverse-fault related earthquakes occurred within 100km of each other in separate islands of the Central Philippines—the Mw=6.7 February 2012 Negros earthquake and the Mw=7.2 October 2013 Bohol earthquake. Based on source faults that were defined using onshore, offshore seismic reflection, and seismicity data, stress transfer models for both earthquakes were calculated using the software Coulomb. Coulomb stress triggering between the two main shocks is unlikely as the stress change caused by Negros earthquake on the Bohol fault was -0.03 bars. Correlating the stress changes on optimally-oriented reverse faults with seismicity rate changes shows that areas that decreased both in static stress and seismicity rate after the first earthquake were then areas with increased static stress and increased seismicity rate caused by the second earthquake. These areas with now increased stress, especially those with seismicity showing reactivity to static stress changes caused by the two earthquakes, indicate the presence of active structures in the island of Cebu. Comparing the history of instrumentally recorded seismicity and the recent large earthquakes of Negros and Bohol, these structures in Cebu have the potential to generate large earthquakes. Given that the Philippines’ second largest metropolitan area (Metro Cebu) is in close proximity, detailed analysis of the earthquake potential and seismic hazards in these areas should be undertaken.",

            "abstract": "Recent work on podiform chromitite from the Luobusa massif, Tibet, suggests that a lithospheric slab containing the chromitite was driven into the Transition Zone (>400 km) after primary crystallisation at shallow depth [1]. Exsolution of coesite and pyroxenes from chromite is believed to reflect conversion from the spinel structure to the ultra-high pressure (UHP) calcium ferrite (CF) polymorph below 400 km [2]. Experimental studies report that UHP polymorphs can have a high affinity for Fe3+, leading to disproportionation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ + Fe0 [3], despite low fO2 as evidenced by inclusions of diamond, native metals and alloys, moissanite, and Cr2+-bearing chromite. Luobusa chromitites may be the first natural example of this phenomenon; one study reported a massive chromitite with higher Fe3+/∑Fe than nodular or disseminated varieties with lower modal chromite [4]. The absence of indicators of oxidation implies that the high Fe3+/∑Fe was not produced by formation or alteration of chromite at Earth’s surface. A study using samples from Luobusa and the low-pressure Antalya Complex, Turkey was carried out to investigate relationships between pressure, fO2 and Fe3+/∑Fe. In the first application of μ-X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy to measure chromite Fe3+/∑Fe, we constructed calibration curves for the pre-edge centroid and main edge maximum features using Fe3+/∑Fe (from Mössbauer spectroscopy) in synthetic and natural spinels. Pre-edge results show that Fe3+/∑Fe increases with vol.% chromite in chromitites from Luobusa, but not from Antalya (fig. 1). High Fe3+/∑Fe thus appears to be a consequence of crystallographic stabilisation of Fe3+ in the UHP polymorph stable below 400 km, despite low-fO2 conditions. The rapid upwelling of the Luobusa chromitite to the uppermost mantle (<10 Ma) has preserved the high Fe3+/∑Fe in samples where re-equilibration with olivine was limited.\n[1] McGowan et al., Geology (2015) 43, 179–182; [2] Chen et al., PNAS (2003) 100, 14651–14654; [3] McCammon, Science (2005) 308, 807-808; [4] Ruskov et al., J.

Results indicated that the national averaged forest LAI was characterized by quasi-3-year, quasi-7-year, and quasi 14-15 year oscillations, which generally exhibited a rising trend with an increasing rate. When compared with 1982, forest LAI change by 2010 was more evident than that by 1990 and 2000. The largest increment of forest LAI occurred in Central and South China, while along the southeastern coastal areas LAI increased at the fastest pace. During the study period, forest LAI experienced from decrease to increase or vice versa across much of China, and varied monotonically for only a few areas. Focusing on regional averaged trend processes, almost all eco-geographical regions showed continuously increasing trends in forest LAI with different magnitudes and speeds, other than tropical humid region and temperate humid/sub-humid region, where LAI decreased initially and increased afterwards.",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea Region is an exceptional ecosystem whose seismic activity has influenced all facets of the development, from ground water availability to human evolution. Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians living in the Dead Sea region are exposed to severe earthquake hazard. Repeatedly large earthquakes (e.g. 1927, magnitude 6.0; (Ambraseys, 2009)) shook the whole Dead Sea region proving that earthquake hazard knows no borders and damaging seismic events can strike anytime. Combined with the high vulnerability of cities in the region and with the enormous concentration of historical values this natural hazard results in an extreme earthquake risk. Thus, an integration of earthquake parameters at all scales (size and time) and their combination with data of infrastructure are needed with the specific aim of providing a state-of-the-art seismic hazard assessment for the Dead Sea region as well as a first quantitative estimate of vulnerability and risk.\nA strong motivation for our research is the lack of reliable multi-parameter ground-based geophysical information on earthquakes in the Dead Sea region. The proposed set up of a number of observatories with on-line data access will enable to derive the present-day seismicity and deformation pattern in the Dead Sea region.\nThe first multi-parameter stations were installed in Jordan, Israel and Palestine for long-time monitoring.

We report the application of SEM (scanning electron microscopy) imaging coupled with EDS mapping for direct and quick detection of sulfur oxidizer in contaminated environmental water samples. The presence of sulfur bacteria can be confirmed within 24 hours after sampling. Subsequent 16S RNA gene sequencing results found the bacteria detected had over 99% similarity to Chromatium Okenii, confirming the bacterium was a sulfur oxidizer.

            "abstract": "The state of the Pliocene tropical Pacific is currently the subject of heated debate. The debate hinges on the veracity of planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca temperatures from the west Pacific warm pool (WPWP) and the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) that show Pliocene WPWP temperatures similar to today but a warmer Pliocene EEP, resulting in a much reduced east-west gradient [Wara et al., 2005]. These findings form the basis of the “permanent El Niño-like state” paradigm of Pliocene climate. However, recent studies using organic biomarker proxies produce temperature records that indicate a WPWP cooling trend since the Pliocene that differs markedly from Mg/Ca-temperature records [O’Brien et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014]. Though much of the debate has focused on changes in seawater Mg/Ca, spatial variations in proxy agreement point to dissolution as a key factor. Dissolution, which imparts a cool bias to Mg/Ca temperatures, varies across ocean basins depending on Δ[CO32-], the difference from the carbonate ion concentration needed for calcite saturation. By necessity, dissolution corrections use the modern value of Δ[CO32-] for the entire record, so it is possible that Pliocene proxy discrepancies could stem from varying Δ[CO32-] over time.\nHere we present benthic foraminiferal B/Ca data (a proxy for Δ[CO32-]) from the EEP and WEP spanning the past 5 Myr, to constrain the effect of dissolution on Pliocene Mg/Ca records. To account for possible changes in seawater B/Ca, we present paired epifaunal-infaunal B/Ca data. Infaunal species are much less sensitive to Δ[CO32-] than epifaunal species, but would still record long-term changes in seawater B/Ca. The true Δ[CO32-] can thus be calculated from the epifaunal-infaunal B/Ca difference [Brown et al., 2011]. Our study is the first to apply this approach downcore; by accounting for long-term changes in seawater, it greatly expands use of the B/Ca proxy and enables a first attempt at correcting for time-varying dissolution in a Mg/Ca record.",

The parameterization is based on Lindzen’s linear saturation theory which can better describe inertia-gravity waves (IGW) by taking the Coriolis effects into consideration. In this work we improve the parameterization by importing a more realistic double Gaussian distribution IGW spectrum, which is calculated from tropical radiosonde observations. A series of WACCM simulations are performed to determine the relationship between the period and amplitude of equatorial zonal wind oscillations and the feature of parameterized IGW. All of these simulations are capable of generating equatorial wind oscillations in the stratosphere using the standard spatial resolution settings. The period of the oscillation is associate inversely with the strength of the IGW forcing, but the central values of double Gaussian distribution IGW have influence both on the magnitude and period of the oscillation. In fact, the eastward and westward IGWs affect the amplitude of the QBO wind, respectively, and the strength of IGWs forcing determines the accelerating rate of the QBO wind. Furthermore, stronger forcing of IGWs can lead to a deeper propagate of the QBO phase, which can extend the lowest altitude of the constant zonal wind amplitudes to about 100 hPa.",

            "abstract": "The crustal dichotomy [1] is the dominant geological feature on planet Mars. The exogenic approach to the origin of the crustal dichotomy [2-6] assumes that the northern lowlands correspond to a giant impact basin formed after primordial crust formation. However these simulations only consider the impact phase without studying the long-term repercussions of such a collision.\nThe endogenic approach [7], suggesting a degree-1 mantle upwelling underneath the southern highlands [8-11], relies on a high Rayleigh number and a particular viscosity profile to form a low degree convective pattern within the geological constraints for the dichotomy formation. Such vigorous convection, however, results in continuous magmatic resurfacing, destroying the initially dichotomous crustal structure in the long-term.\nA further option is a hybrid exogenic-endogenic approach [12-15], which proposes an impact-induced magma ocean and subsequent superplume in the southern hemisphere. However these models rely on simple scaling laws to impose the thermal effects of the collision.\nHere we present the first results of impact simulations performed with a SPH code [16,17] serially coupled with geodynamical computations performed using the code I3VIS [18] to improve the latter approach and test it against observations. We are exploring collisions varying the impactor velocities, impact angles and target body properties, and are gauging the sensitivity to the handoff from SPH to I3VIS.\nAs expected, our first results indicate the formation of a transient hemispherical magma ocean in the impacted hemisphere, and the merging of the cores. We also find that impact angle and velocity have a strong effect on the post-impact temperature field [5] and on the timescale and nature of core merger.",

As the occurrence of large size Reticulofenestra indicate the oligotrophic and stable sea surface condition, the drastic decreasing of maximum size of Reticulofenestra fond in 2.75Ma, 3.6Ma, 5.4Ma, 9Ma and 13Ma, indicates the collapse of stable and low nutrient sea surface conditions at these ages in both Caribbean Sea and western Pacific Ocean. The events found in the sequences are correlated to closure of Central American seaway, Messinian salinity crisis, intensify the Asian Monsoon, and closure of Indonesian Sea way.",

            "abstract": "Slow transient slip that releases stress along the deep roots of plate interfaces is most often observed on regional GPS networks installed at the surface. The detection of slow slip is not trivial if the dislocation along the fault at depth does not generate a geodetic signal greater than the observational noise level. Instead of the typical workflow of comparing independently gathered seismic and geodetic observations to study slow slip, we use repeating low-frequency earthquakes to reveal a previously unobserved slow slip event. By aligning GPS time series with episodes of low-frequency earthquake activity and stacking, we identify a repeating transient slip event that generates a displacement at the surface that is hidden under noise prior to stacking. Our results suggest that the geodetic investigation of transient slip guided by seismological information is essential in exploring the spectrum of fault slip.",

            "abstract": "Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in 2013 is a major warming event under moderate-high solar activity. Based on the observations of a meridianal chain of ionosondes covering a latitude range from 30.5°N to 42.8°N in China, we find ionospheric response to 2013 SSW is latitude dependent and comparable to that of low-latitude and equatorial region with f0F2 enhancement more than 80% and hmF2 elevation more than 60km. Typical semidiurnal variations are found consistently in all the 8 stations in early and middle January during SSW. However, the expected depressions in afternoon hours are not so impressive and the enhancements after sunset become more frequent and evident, which may be due to the higher F region Pedersen conductivity during high solar activity. Wavelet results show that f0F2 perturbations during SSW exhibit rich oscillations like tidal components especially semidiurnal tides and planetary waves (< 5 days), especially 3-day periodicities maybe associated to ‘Ultra-fast’ Kelvin waves (UFKW) in lower atmosphere and the average of f0F2 in 8-18LT displays 16-day planetary wave like oscillations, suggesting interaction of tides and planetary waves . Also, diurnal, semidiurnal and termidiurnal tides in f0F2 are amplified during the warming in good agreement with earlier studies. Importantly, the amplitudes of semidiurnal tides in f0F2 exhibit 16-day periodicities, confirming the theory that the modulated semidiurnal tides bring the 16-day planetary wave like oscillations to the F region through electrodynamic effects during the SSW event.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash particles encompass a diverse spectrum of shapes as a consequence of differences in the magma properties and the magma ascent and eruption conditions. We show how the quantitative analysis of ash particle shapes can be a valuable tool for deciphering magma fragmentation and transport processes. Importantly, integrating morphological data with ash texture (e.g. bubble and crystal sizes) and dissolved volatile data provides valuable insights into the physical and chemical controls on the resulting ash deposit.\nTo explore the influence of magma-water interaction (MWI) on fine ash generation, we apply this multi-component characterisation to tephra from the 2500BC Hverfjall Fires, Iceland. Here, coeval fissure vents spanned sub-aerial to shallow lacustrine environments. Differences in the size and morphology of pyroclasts thus reflect fragmentation mechanisms under different near-surface conditions. Using shape parameters sensitive to both particle roughness and internal vesicularity, we quantify the relative proportions of dense fragments, bubble shards, and vesicular grains from 2-D SEM images. We show that componentry (and particle morphology) varies as a function of grain size, and that this variation can be related back to the bubble size distribution. Although both magmatic and hydromagmatic deposits exhibit similar component assemblages, they differ in how these assemblages change with grain size. These results highlight the benefits of characterising ash deposits over a wide range of grain sizes, and caution against inferring fragmentation mechanism from a narrow grain size range. Elevated matrix glass S concentrations in hydromagmatic ash (600–1500 ppm) compared to those in magmatic ash and scoria lapilli (200–500 ppm) indicate interrupted vesiculation. In contrast to the subaerial ‘dry’ deposits, fragmentation during MWI likely occurred over a greater range of depths with quench rates sufficient to prevent post-fragmentation degassing. High thermal stresses resulting from rapid quenching of glass may have contributed to the finer grain size (higher fragmentation efficiency) of this deposit.",

            "abstract": "We present homogenization procedure and results for Germany’s historical radiosonde records, dating back to the 1950s. Our manual homogenization makes use of the different RS networks existing in East and West-Germany from the 1950s until 1990. The largest temperature adjustments, up to 2.5K, are applied to Freiberg sondes used in the East in the 1950s and 1960s. Adjustments for Graw H50 and M60 sondes, used in the West from the 1950s to the late 1980s, and for RKZ sondes, used in the East in the 1970s and 1980s, are also significant, 0.3 to 0.5K. Small differences between Vaisala RS80 and RS92 sondes used throughout Germany since 1990 and 2005, respectively, were not corrected for at levels from the ground to 300 hPa. Comparison of the homogenized data with other radiosonde datasets, RICH (Haimberger et al., 2012) and HadAT2 (McCarthy et al., 2008), and with Microwave Sounding Unit satellite data (Mears and Wentz, 2009), shows generally good agreement. HadAT2 data exhibit a few suspicious spikes in the 1970s and 1980s, and some suspicious offsets up to 1K after 1995. Compared to RICH, our homogenized data show slightly different temperatures in the 1960s and 1970s. We find that the troposphere over Germany has been warming by 0.25 ± 0.1K per decade since the early 1960s, slightly more than reported in other studies (Hartmann et al., 2013). The stratosphere has been cooling, with the trend increasing from almost no change near 230hPa (the tropopause) to -0.5 ± 0.2K per decade near 50hPa. Trends from the homogenized data are more positive by about 0.1K per decade compared to the original data, both in troposphere and stratosphere.\n",

            "abstract": "To utilize the shallow geothermal energy, heat pumps are often coupled with Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE) to provide heating and cooling for buildings. In cold regions, soil freezing around the BHE is a potential problem which will dramatically influence the underground soil temperature distribution, subsequently the inlet and outlet refrigerant temperature of the BHE, and finally the efficiency of the heat pump. In this study, a numerical model has been developed to simulate the coupled temperature evolution both inside the BHE, and the propagating freezing front in the surrounding soil. The coupled model was validated against analytical solutions and experimental data. The influence of the freezing process on the overall system performance is investigated by comparing one long BHE configuration without freezing and another short one with latent heat from the frozen groundwater. It is found that when freezing happens, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump will decrease by around 0.5, leading to more electricity consumption. Furthermore, analysis of the simulation result reveals that the exploitation of latent heat through groundwater freezing is only economically attractive if electricity price is low and interest rate high, and it is not the case is most European countries.",

            "abstract": "Australia is an extensive country, of which 70% is covered by arid or semi-arid ecosystems. These ecosystems are influenced by the Australian monsoon, which occurs in summer (December-February). The Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are two weather systems that most influence weather patterns in this region, and both systems have been shown to be affected by climate change. Two biomes dominate in this region: (1) Mulga, a low woodland dominated by species of the genus Acacia; and (2) open Corymbia-savanna where the dominant cover is Spinifex (C4 grass) with widely spaced tall evergreen Corymbia trees. Within each biome an eddy covariance tower has been in operation for the past 3–5 years. The aim of this study is to understand water-use efficiency (WUE) of those ecosystems, by using the indicator: WUE= Gross Primary Production (GPP) / Evapotranspiration (ET). We analysed continuous measurements of ecosystem WUE during dry (May-November) and wet (December–February) seasons from September 2012 to May 2015. At the Mulga site, 765mm of rain was received, with more than 80% (633mm) occurring during the wet season. Similarly 80% (706mm) of total rainfall (844mm) was received by the Corymbia-savanna in the wet season. ET accounted for 82% of rainfall for the Mulga site and for the Corymbia-savanna site ET was 87% of total rainfall for the study period. Total GPP for the last three wet seasons at the Mulga site was 1590 gC·m-2, while in the dry seasons was a total of 65.5 gC m-2. By contrast total GPP at the Corymbia-savanna site was 424 gC m-2 and 22.4 gC·m-2 for wet and dry seasons respectively. WUE during the wet seasons was 3.1 and 0.7 and, 1.3 and 0.4 (gC m-2 mm-1 H2O) in dry seasons for Mulga and Corymbia-savanna sites respectively. We found the Mulga site is the most water efficient ecosystem, these quantifications of the WUE in central Australia where similar to other studies in arid regions, where WUE decreased with increasing aridity.",

Variance has been calculated to determine the magnitude of change in sea level variation over two decades. Increasing trend of variance of ADT suggests an enhanced fluctuation as well as geostrophic shear of global ocean. To further determine on what scale does the increasing fluctuation dominate, the global absolute dynamic topography (ADT) has been separated into two distinguished parts: the global five-year mean sea surface (MSS) and the residual absolute dynamic topography (RADT). Increased variance of MSS can be ascribed to the nonuniform rising of global sea level and an enhancement of ocean gyres in the Pacific Ocean. While trend in the variance of RADT is found to be close to zero which suggests an unchanged ocean mesoscale variability. The Gaussian-like distribution of global ADT are used to study the change in extreme sea levels. Information entropy has also been adapted in our study. Increasing trend of information entropy which measures the degree of dispersion of a probability distribution suggests more appearance of extreme sea levels. Extreme high sea levels are increasing with a higher growing rate than the mean sea level rise.",

We acquired magnetic and bathymetry datasets by using Overhouser Proton Magnetometer SeaSPY(Marine Magnetics Co.) and Multi-Beam Echo Sounder EM120(Kongsberg Co.). We conducted the data processing to obtain detailed seabed topography, magnetic anomaly and reduction to the pole(RTP). The Lau basin is one of the youngest back–arc basins in the Southwest Pacific. This region was a lot of hydrothermal activities and hydrothermal deposits. In particular, Tofua Arc(TA) in the Lau basin consists of various and complex stratovolcanos(from Massoth et al., 2007).), We calculated the magnetic susceptibility distribution of the TA19-1 seamount(longitude:176°23.5’W, latitude: 22°42.5’W)area using the RTP data by 3-D magnetic inversion from Jung’s previous study(2013). Based on 2D 'compact gravity inversion' by Last & Kubik(1983), we expend it to the 3D algorithm using iterative reweighted least squares method with some weight matrices. The used weight matrices are two types: 1) the minimum gradient support(MGS) that controls the spatial distribution of the solution from Porniaguine and Zhdanov(1999); 2) the depth weight that are used according to the shape of subsurface structures. From the modeling, we derived the appropriate scale factor for the use of depth weight and setting magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, we have to enter a very small error value to control the computation of the singular point of the inversion model that was able to be easily calculated for modeling. In addition, we applied separately weighted value for the correct shape and depth of the magnetic source. We selected the best results model by change to converge of RMS. Compared between the final modeled result and RTP values in this study, they are generally similar to the each other. But the input values and the modeled values have slightly little difference. This difference is expected to have been caused by various and complex stratovolcanos, misunderstanding of regional geology distribution, modeling design, limited vertical resolution from non-uniqueness in potential field and etc. We can expect to have the better results of advanced modeling design with more geological survey data.",

[1], we conducted spherical shock experiments at the RFNC-VNIIFT (Snezhinsk, Russia) on (titano)magnetite-bearing basaltic lava flow and diabase dike samples from the Osler Volcanic Group of the 1.1 Ga North American Midcontinent Rift [2]. The experimental setup allows for rock magnetic and petrographic changes to be assessed for a range of shock pressures 20 GPa and above.\nConsistent with prior spherical shock experiments on the Saratov ordinary chondrite [1], both shocked samples exhibited concentric zonation: a central void space was surrounded by an inner layer of impact melt (Zone I, most shocked), a middle partially melted layer (Zone II), and an outer layer of unmelted rock with solid-state shock features (Zones III and IV, least shocked). These zones are petrographically different. Like Zone IV, Zone III is characterized by an intact texture, but the plagioclase grains have been transformed into diaplectic glass. Zones I-III acquired thermoremanent magnetization from shock heating. Zone IV may have undergone shock demagnetization of the pre-shock magnetization without substantial remagnetization. Shocked samples had higher coercivities than unshocked samples of the same rocks. Magnetic force and electron microscopy reveal fracturing of the Fe-Ti oxides, which likely contributes to the observed increase in coercivity in the shocked samples.\nOur spherical shock experiments build on prior work to show that shock at pressures greater than 20 GPa results in coercivity increase, shock demagnetization and thermal remagnetization. This work can guide future interpretations of the remanent magnetization and bulk magnetic properties of highly shocked materials from planetary surfaces.\n",

            "abstract": "Iceland has long been considered a natural laboratory for processes related to seafloor spreading, including propagating rifts, migrating transforms and rotating microplates. The thick, hot, weak crust and subaerial processes of Iceland result in variations on the themes developed along more typical parts of the global MOR system. Compared to most other parts of the MOR, Icelandic rift zones and transform faults are wider and more complex. Rift zones are defined by overlapping arrays of volcanic/tectonic spreading segments as much as 50 km wide. The most active rift zones propagate N and S away from the Iceland hot spot causing migration of transform faults. A trail of crust deformed by bookshelf faulting forms in their wakes. Dead or dying transform strands are truncated along pseudofaults that define propagation rates close to the full spreading rate of ~20 mm/yr. Pseudofaults are blurred by spreading across wide rift zones and laterally extensive subaerial lava flows. Propagation, with decreasing spreading toward the propagator tips causes rotation of crustal blocks on both sides of the active rift zones. The blocks deform internally by the widespread reactivation of spreading-related faults and zones of weakness along dike margins. The sense of slip on these rift-parallel strike-slip faults is inconsistent with transform-fault deformation. These various deformation features as well as subaxial subsidence that accommodate the thickening of the volcanic upper crustal units are probably confined to the brittle, seismogenic, upper 10 km of the crust. At least beneath the active rift zones, the upper crust is probably decoupled from hot, mechanically weak middle and lower gabbroic crust resulting in a broad plate boundary zone between the diverging lithosphere plates. Similar processes may occur at other types of propagating spreading centers and magmatic rifts.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that low-frequency Alfven waves are unstable to parametric instabilities, in which these waves are nonlinearly coupled with density fluctuations [e.g, Nariyuki+Hada, JGR, 2007 and references therein]. In solar wind plasmas, low-frequency fluctuations with non-zero cross-helicity are frequently observed [e.g., Bruno+Carbone, Living Rev. Solar Phys. (2013) and references therein]. When the absolute values of normalized cross helicities are close to the unity, the fluctuations may be composed of uni-directionally (anti-sunward) propagating Alfven waves. The derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLS) has been known as the mode of modulational instabilities of unidirectional Alfven waves [Mio et al, JPSJ, 1976; Mjolhus, JPP, 1976]. In the DNLS, the density fluctuations are assumed to be the quasi-static state, which is determined according to the ponderomotive force of envelope-modulated Alfven waves. The DNLS was extended to include the obliquely propagating, compressional component of magnetic field by Mjolhus and Wyller (JPP, 1988). The kinetically modified DNLS (KDNLS) has also been discussed by many authors [Rogister, POF, 1971; Mjolhus and Wyller, Phys. Scr, 1986; JPP, 1988; Spangler, POF B, 1989; 1990; Medvedev+Diamond, POP, 1996; Nariyuki et al, POP, 2013]. On the other hand, ion acoustic modes [Hada, 1993], large scale inhomogeneity of plasmas [Buti et al, APJ, 1999; Nariyuki, POP, 2015] and random density fluctuations [Ruderman, POP, 2002] can also affect nonlinear evolution of Alfven waves. At the present time, combined effects of these effects are not fully understood. In this presentation, we discuss two models: one of them is the model including both ion kinetic effects and ion acoustic mode and another is the model including finite thermal effects and random density fluctuations. In the former case, ion kinetic effects on both longitudinal [Nariyuki+Hada, JPSJ, 2007] and transverse modulational instabilities are discussed, while the effects of type of density fluctuations (thermal noise, large scale density fluctuations) on longitudinal modulational instability are discussed in the latter case.",

Satellite data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), combined with atmosphere-ice-ocean forecasting models, navigation models and automatic identification system (AIS) transponder data from ships are essential components of such systems. Here we present first results from the SONARC project (project term: 2015-2017), an international multidisciplinary effort to develop novel and complementary ice monitoring and forecasting systems for vessels and offshore platforms in the Arctic. Automated classification methods (Zakhvatkina et al., 2012) are applied to Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR images from the Barents and Kara Sea region to identify ice types (e.g. multi-year ice, level first-year ice, deformed first-year ice, new/young ice, open water) and ridges. Short-term (1-3 days) ice drift forecasts are computed from SAR images using feature tracking and pattern tracking methods (Berg & Eriksson, 2014). Ice classification and drift forecast products are combined with ship positions based on AIS data from a selected period of 3-4 weeks to determine optimal vessel speed and routing in ice. Results illustrate the potential of high-resolution SAR data for near-real-time monitoring and forecasting of Arctic ice conditions. Over the next 3 years, SONARC findings will contribute new knowledge about sea ice in the Arctic while promoting safe and cost-effective shipping, domain awareness, resource management, and environmental protection.",

            "abstract": "Climate change threatens many of the coastal areas all over the world. In the Arctic, the warming happens at a rate which is three times faster than the global average increasing the pressure on the coast. Arctic coasts differ from coasts in lower latitude in terms of the natural conditions prevailing, i.e. sea-ice, permafrost, and thermal erosion. These factors are likely to change with an increasing temperature, and thereby the erodibility of the shores and the erosivity of the coastal processes are changing.\nThe majority of studies on arctic coasts focus on tundra coasts. Here, there is a general increase of coastal erosion rates over the last decades. However, the arctic coastal areas of Greenland differ; they are often close to hard rock protrusions and are characterized by large differences in geomorphology, erodibility of sediments, and erosivity by coastal processes. Sedimentary coasts in Greenland are only sporadically investigated, and it is thus difficult to predict the impact of climate changes in these areas.\nWith this work we focus on sedimentary coasts in Greenland and present shoreline analysis of two sedimentary coastal sites. We show how the position of the shoreline has changed since the 1930’ies and we address the responsible factors controlling this evolution. The hotspots of coastal change are all located near delta mouths and the detected changes are coupled to dominating process occurring here.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of carbon storage is crucial to better understand the processes of global and regional carbon cycles and to more precisely project ecological and economic scenarios for the future. Southwestern China has broadly and continuously distribution of karst landscapes with harsh and fragile habitats which might lead to rocky desertification, an ecological disaster which has significantly hindered vegetation succession and economic development in karst regions of southwestern China. In this study we evaluated the carbon storage in eight political divisions of southwestern China based on four methods: forest inventory, carbon density based on field investigations, CASA model driven by remote sensing data, and BIOME4/LPJ global vegetation models driven by climate data. The results show that: (1) The total vegetation carbon storage (including agricultural ecosystem) is 6763.97 Tg C based on the carbon density, and the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage (above 20cm depth) is 12475.72 Tg C. Sichuan Province (including Chongqing) possess the highest carbon storage in both vegetation and soil (1736.47 Tg C and 4056.56 Tg C, respectively) among the eight political divisions because of the higher carbon density and larger distribution area. The vegetation carbon storage in Hunan Province is the smallest (565.30 Tg C), and the smallest SOC storage (1127.40 Tg C) is in Guangdong Province; (2) Based on forest inventory data, the total aboveground carbon storage in the woody vegetation is 2103.29 Tg C. The carbon storage in Yunnan Province (819.01 Tg C) is significantly higher than other areas while tropical rainforests and seasonal forests in Yunnan contribute the maximum of the woody vegetation carbon storage (account for 62.40% of the total). (3) The net primary production (NPP) simulated by the CASA model is 68.57 Tg C/yr, while the forest NPP in the non-karst region (account for 72.50% of the total) is higher than that in the karst region. (4) BIOME4 and LPJ models predicted higher carbon storages than the CASA model with various spatial patterns. More investigations should be further performed to clarify processes of carbon cycle in ecosystems on karst terrain and to accelerate the development of a regional dynamic vegetation model which was appropriate for karst ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "We used receiver functions to examine lateral topographical variations on the 410- and 660-km beneath northeast China and particularly the Kuril-Japan arc junctions. Compared to other receiver functions studies, our analysis was based on greater station coverage of higher density by combining all recent seismic arrays so far deployed in northeast China. Our image shows that the 410-km is featured by a ~10-20 km uplift extending in the NNE direction beneath some areas of the Quaternary basaltic rocks distributed at Abaga and at Wudalianchi. The Clapeyron slope of the olivine phase transiton at 410-km suggests that the uplift is compatible with a negative thermal anomaly. We also confirm a significant depression of the 660 from the Changbai volcanism in the north to Korea in the south along the NW-SE direction. The depression is also accompanied by an uplift of the 660 to the west. The shallow 660-km discontinuity is also particularly detected beneath the Kuril-Japan arc junctions, while it was not detected before. The thermal anomaly at 410 km depth is most likely a remnant of a detached mantle lithosphere that recently sank to depth, thus providing robust evidence for the source and evolution of these basalts. The depression of the 660-km discontinuity may support that the subducting Pacific slab bends sharply and becomes stagnant when it meets strong resistance at a depth of about 670 km. After accumulation to a great extent the stagnant slab finally penetrates into the lower mantle. Combined with the previous triplicated studies, the shallow 660-km may suggest that descending Pacific slab at its leading and junction edges might be accommodated by a tearing near a depth of 660 km.\nAcknowledgements.

The quadrangle is located in the southern hemisphere of Ceres between 21-66°S and 0-90°E Results of our geologic mapping will contribute to the understanding of the geologic history and surface-forming processes of this quadrangle. The dominant feature is an alignment of three craters in the topographically lower center of the quadrangle. These craters illustrate the diversity of crater forms, inner structures and symmetries, such as terraced walls and elongated central structures. There are numerous central peaks inside craters of different sizes. The largest craters in the quadrangle reveal more complex inner structures and flat floors. Great variation in the slopes of crater walls and degradation states of crater rims can be found, as well as mass wasting features, such as landslides. Several linear structures are evident, which will be distinguished and analyzed. Possible explanations for these structures include secondary crater chains and pit chains. A positive topography feature is found to the south of the Sintana crater. Examining aforementioned features will help to assess surface composition and local tectonics. Different ratios of color-filter images suggest a major geological boundary in the NE of the quadrangle. Visible and infrared spectroscopic data will contribute to the compositional interpretation.\nThe mapping is based on a stereo digital terrain model, clear-filter images and images of different color-filter ratios derived from the Framing Camera onboard the Dawn spacecraft. To date, resolutions of 1.3 km/px from the approach phase in Spring 2015, and 415 m/px from the Survey Orbit, in June 2015, are used in geological mapping.

            "abstract": "How long a river remembers its past is still an open question. Perturbations occurring in large catchments may impact the flow regime for several weeks and months, therefore providing a physical explanation for the occasional tendency of floods to occur in clusters. The research question explored in this paper may be stated as follows: can higher than usual river discharges in the low flow season be associated to a higher probability of floods in the subsequent high flow season? The physical explanation for such association may be related to the presence of a higher storage at the beginning of the high flow season, which may induce lower infiltration rates and therefore higher river runoff. It is well known that larger catchments have longer memory and therefore we focus on two European river basins with large extension: the Po River at Pontelagoscuro and the Danube River at Bratislava, whose catchment areas amount to 70.000 km2 and 131.331 km2, respectively. We look at the stochastic connection between average river flows in the pre-flood season and the peak flows in the flood season, by using a bivariate probability distribution. We found that the shape of the flood frequency distribution is significantly impacted by the river flow regime in the low flow season, with different dynamics depending on the physical properties of the catchment and the human impact on the river flows. The proposed technique, which can be classified as a data assimilation and Bayesian approach, may allow one to reduce the uncertainty associated to the estimation of the flood probability.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere have adverse impacts via three main pathways: photochemical ozone formation, secondary organic aerosol production, and direct toxicity to humans. Few studies have integrated these effects to prioritize control measures for VOCs sources. In this study, we developed a multi-effect evaluation methodology based on updated emission inventories and source profiles, which was combined with ozone formation potential (OFP), secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP), and VOC toxicity data to identify important emission sources and key species. We derived species-specific emission inventories for 152 sources. The OFPs, SOAPs, and toxicity of each source were determined, and the contribution and share of each source to each of these adverse effects was calculated. Weightings were given to the three adverse effects by expert scoring, and the integrated impact was determined.\nUsing 2012 as the base year, solvent usage and industrial process were found to be the most important anthropogenic sources, accounting for 24.2 and 23.1% of the integrated environmental effect, respectively. This was followed by biomass burning, transportation, and fossil fuel combustion, all of which had a similar contribution ranging from 16.7 to 18.6%. The top five industrial sources, including plastic products, rubber products, chemical fiber products, the chemical industry, and oil refining, accounted for nearly 70.0% of industrial emissions. In China, emissions reductions are required for styrene, toluene, ethylene, benzene, and m/p-xylene. The 10 most abundant chemical species contributed 76.5% of the integrated impact. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong were the five leading provinces when considering the integrated effects. Besides, the chemical mass balance model (CMB) was used to verify the VOCs inventories of 47 cities in China, so as to optimize our evaluation results. We suggest that multi-effect evaluation is necessary to identify the need for abatement at the source type and substance levels.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic sea ice cover depends strongly on the stratification of the underlying ocean, which itself depends on processes over a range of spatial scales, from circulation to shelf processes and vertical mixing. Also important for the stratification are the freshwater sources to the Arctic Ocean, including river runoff, low evaporation, and exchange with the Pacific Ocean. In the future, we expect even larger freshwater input as the global hydrological cycle accelerates, increasing high latitude precipitation and river runoff. Previous modelling studies show some robust responses to high latitude freshwater perturbations, including a strengthening of Arctic stratification and a weakening of the large-scale ocean circulation; some idealized modelling studies also document a stronger cyclonic circulation within the Arctic Ocean itself. Here, we adopt a more comprehensive modelling approach to better understand both the local processes and the broader linkages between the Arctic and surrounding oceans. We increase river runoff to the Arctic Ocean in a coupled ice--ocean general circulation model, and show contrasting responses in the polar and subpolar regions. Within the Arctic, the stratification strengthens, the halocline and Atlantic Water layer warm, and the cyclonic circulation spins up, in agreement with previous work. In the subpolar gyre region of the North Atlantic, the model simulates a colder and fresher water column with weaker barotropic circulation. In contrast to the estuarine circulation theory, the volume exchange between the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding oceans does not increase with increasing runoff. Changes in atmosphere-ocean heat exchange outside the sea ice-covered regions of the Arctic can influence the ocean-ice heat exchange within the Arctic. While these results are robust in our model, we require experiments with other model systems and more complete observational syntheses to better constrain the sensitivity of the climate system to high latitude freshwater perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Construction of reservoirs, especially in the last half of the 20th century, has greatly contributed to the prevention of riverine disasters and the security of water supplies in the world. Since reservoirs markedly alter the river flow in downstream, precise modeling of reservoir operation is necessary for the improvement of river flow simulations. Yet global hydrological simulations considering reservoir operation are still immature - although actual reservoirs are practically operated by considering both meteorological conditions and regional requests within each river basin, modeled reservoirs are operated according to simplified operation schemes optimized for global applicability with less regional variety. Thus, checking the performance of global hydrological models based on the comparison of model outputs with historical observation records is important for better understanding of uncertainties in the hydrological simulation.\nIn this study, we conducted long-term historical hydrological simulations considering 6862 reservoirs worldwide. Simulation settings were based on the protocol of the model intercomparison project, termed ISI-MIP2.1A. We compared time-series of observed and simulated reservoir storage to examine the performance of reservoir operation schemes adopted in the H08 global hydrological model for 29 reservoirs, most of which are located in the United States and Canada, selected by considering data availability on the reservoir operation. We ran the hydrological model under four different meteorological forcing data sets distributed for ISI-MIP2.1A simulations for a historical period. By examining whether the observed water storage lies within the spread of simulated water storage with the four sets of meteorological forcing, we identified a prevailing source of errors in the simulation of the river discharge - reservoir operation schemes or meteorological forcing data.",

European and international polar research has contributed critical knowledge to identifying the processes behind these rapid changes but datasets from the Polar Regions are still insufficient to fully understand and more effectively predict the effects of change on our climate and society. This situation can only be improved by a more holistic integrated scientific approach, a higher degree of coordination of polar research and closer cooperation with all relevant actors on an international level.\nThe objectives of EU-PolarNet are to establish an on-going dialogue between policy-makers, business and industry leaders, local communities and scientists to increase mutual understanding and identify new ways of working that will deliver economic and societal benefits. The results of this dialogue will be brought together in an Integrated European Research Programme that will be co-designed with all relevant stakeholders and coordinated with the activities of polar research nations beyond Europe. This programme will be accompanied by a feasible implementation plan to provide the Polar community with the capability to define the nature of environmental risks so that governments can design policy measures to mitigate them and businesses and other stakeholders benefit from the opportunities that are opening up in the Polar Regions.",

Among the natural disasters, salinity intrusion due to climate change and sea level rise in the coastal agriculture land is the major unpleasant incident now days. Because of that wide area of the coastal agricultural land, coastal forest, drinking water facilities and fresh water availability are in critical condition which may cause 40 million people of 147 coastal districts covering 47201 km area are placed in danger. The nation wide assessment on the detected of coastal soil and water salinity is not conducted since 9 years. The survey on the coastal soil salinity on 1973 and 2000 found that the saline effected land is increased from 0.83 million ha to 1.20 million ha within 27 years. It is assumed that at present the rate of salinity intrusion in the coastal agriculture land will be higher than those of 1973 and 2000. The soil salinity was recorded 18-20 psu after AILA in the south-eastern coast of Bangladesh and increased further 2-4 psu due to low precipitation which causes crop burning. This paper aims to know the salinity intrusion in the coastal soil and water of Bangladesh, which would help to plan and improvement of the sustainable agriculture production. Study revealed that to face any extra stresses on the coastal agriculture land due to climate change requires extensive inventory, awareness activities, mitigation measures, adaptation techniques and extension of indigenous technology.",

Moewover, for the detailed analysis of forest carbon dynamics and CO2 fluxes of urban area, the CO2 concentration measurement techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the lower atmosphere. A differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is expected to measure atmospheric CO2 concentration profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer from a ground platform. We have succeeded to develop a compact direct detection 1.6 μm DIAL system for measuring CO2 concentration profiles in the lower atmosphere. This DIAL system consists of the optical parametric generator (OPG) transmitter that excited by the LD pumped Nd:YAG laser with high repetition rate and the receiving optics that included the near-infrared photomultiplier tube operating at the analog mode and the 25 cm telescope. We have succeeded in observing the daytime temporal change of vertical CO2 concentration profiles for the range from 0.25 to 2.5 km with integration time of 30 minutes and range resolution of 300 m. This compact direct detection CO2 DIAL is usefull for the estimation of CO2 flux.\nThis work was financially supported by the System Development Program for Advanced Measurement and Analysis of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.",

            "abstract": "Growth of tropospheric ozone, causing health and climate impacts, is concerned over East Asia, because emissions of precursors have dramatically increased. Photochemical production rates of ozone and limiting factors, primarily studied for urban locations, have been poorly assessed within a perspective of regional-scale air pollution over East Asia. We performed comprehensive observations of ozone precursors at several locations with regional representativeness and made such assessment based on the observation-based modeling approach. Here, diagnosis at Fukue Island (32.75°N, 128.68°E) remotely located in western Japan (May 2009) is highlighted, where the highest 10% of hourly ozone concentrations reached 72‒118 ppb during May influenced by Asian continental outflow. The average in-situ ozone production rate was estimated to be 6.8 ppb per day, suggesting that in-travel production was still active, while larger buildup must have occurred beforehand. Information on the chemical status of the air mass arriving in Japan is important, because it affects how further ozone production occurs after precursor addition from Japanese domestic emissions. The main limiting factor of ozone production was usually NOx, suggesting that domestic NOx emission control is important in reducing further ozone production and the incidence of warning issuance (>120 ppb). VOCs also increased the ozone production rate, and occasionally (14% of time) became dominant. This analysis implies that the VOC reduction legislation recently enacted should be effective. The uncertainty in the radical chemistry mechanism governing ozone production had a non-negligible impact, but the main conclusion relevant to policy was not altered. When chain termination was augmented by HO2-H2O + NO/NO2 reactions and by heterogeneous loss of HO2 on aerosol particle surfaces, the daily ozone production rate decreased by <24%, and the fraction of hours when the VOC-limited condition occurred varied from 14% to 13‒26%.",

            "abstract": "The evolution and present-day structure of tectonic provinces within the western portion of U.S remains the subject of much debate. Despite significant recent progress towards its geophysical characterisation and deformation styles, numerous competing hypotheses exist about the origin and focusing of deformation, evolution of topography, crustal composition, mantle contributions to high elevations, etc. For instance, in the Southern Rocky Mountains, mutually exclusive isostatic mechanisms have been proposed and the relative roles of felsic material vs partial melting/hydration of the lower crust in focusing deformation remain controversial. Here, we use a novel multi-observable inversion method (Afonso et al.,2013a;b) to gain insights into the processes that drive major tectonic deformations in these regions. To obtain a well-constrained crustal model, we jointly invert surface wave dispersion curves from ambient noise and earthquake data, geoid anomalies, gravity anomalies, receiver functions, surface heat flow and elevations. The internally-consistent use of these key constraining datasets, all with different sensitivities and linked through a thermodynamic formalism, ascribes to our method a unique sensitivity to the internal structure of the crust, and to its thermal and chemical signatures that are otherwise difficult to assess unambiguously. Additionally, the probabilistic formalism offers a natural platform from which to estimate representative model uncertainties. We find substantial local and regional variations in crustal properties among tectonic provinces, especially in the Southern Rocky Mountains. These findings provide important insights into the physical processes responsible for tectonic deformations in the Intermountain West region and can be used to test proposed evolutionary models and deformation mechanisms.\n",

            "abstract": "ESA’s Swarm mission aims at studying all sources of Earth’s magnetic field. It consists of two satellites (Alpha and Charlie), which fly side-by-side on near polar orbits at an altitude of slightly less than 500 km, and of a third satellite (Bravo) on a similar but slightly more polar and higher orbit, which progressively drifts with respect to that of Alpha and Charlie. This orbital configuration has proven extremely valuable, as evidenced by the many results already obtained from the first two years of the mission. These results, however, also reveal that geomagnetic field modeling and investigation efforts are now hampered by the still limited local time coverage provided by this constellation. This affects our ability to accurately characterize time changes in the ionospheric and magnetospheric field contributions, and to model the electrical conductivity of the Earth’s mantle. It also indirectly limits our ability to model the core and lithospheric field. More generally, many of the “residual signals” detected in the very accurate magnetic data of the Swarm mission can still not fully be exploited. Further increasing the scientific return of the Swarm mission by squeezing more out of these data, however, would be possible if a fourth “Delta” satellite were to be launched soon enough to join the constellation at a similar altitude but much lower inclination orbit (such as 60°). Such a satellite would provide less geographical coverage but a much faster mapping of all local times over these latitudes. In this presentation we will present the rational for such a Delta mission and discuss the benefit it would bring, as well as plans currently under consideration to build a small satellite that could meet the corresponding requirements.",

Some data from different basins at home and abroad showed the bigger solubility of carbonate type (such as calcite) and aluminum silicate type (such as feldspar) and good development of secondary pore in oil-bearing sandstone than that in the no oil-bearing sandstone. And, calcite cementation, dolomite cementation, quartz cementation in the oil reservoir are more than that of the no oil-bearing reservoir. The effect of oil and gas charging on the diagenetic evolution is complicated. The degree of mineral cementation is also relevant to the saturation of oil and gas, influence of low oil saturation on diagenetic environment was not distinct. By studying different basin, different geology, we found that the oil and gas filling impacts on deep sandstone properties by influencing the diagenetic compaction, cementation and dissolution of deep reservoir: (1) the overpressure of oil and gas charging can buffer compaction of overlying strata; (2) the early oil and gas filling inhibit or slow down the cementation process, especially to illite and quartz, (3) the organic acid dissolution in oil and gas can improve the physical properties of deep reservoir. These three aspects are essentially improved reservoir for deep hydrocarbon accumulation, having very realistic significance for the deep oil and gas exploration.",

            "abstract": "Astronomical tuning using the 405-kyr eccentricity component as a prime target has been established as a standard technique for the Cenozoic timescale. There is an astronomically-tuned time scale across most of the Cenozoic. However, no definite astronomical tuning exists in the so-called “Eocene gap”. The main reason for the existence of this Eocene gap is the very shallow carbonate compensation depth (CCD) during this time (Pälike et al., 2012), preventing the deposition of cyclic carbonate-rich sediments. IODP Expedition 342 however drilled Eocene cyclic carbonate-rich sequences, which were deposited in sediment drifts offshore Newfoundland at a palaeodepth above the CCD while large parts of the ocean were starved of carbonate. As the variations in the studied sites are predominantly obliquity induced, we assess and use the 173-kyr obliquity amplitude modulation cycle as a tuning target. These 173-kyr cycles result from the resonance or “beat” between the (present-day) 41 and 53 kyr obliquity cycles, determined by the precession constant and the frequency of the ascending node precession of the Earth and Saturn (p+s3)-(p+s6). We use physical property measurements, as well as the ratio between the elemental intensities of calcium and iron (Ca/Fe) of the sediments from sites U1408, U1409 and U1410 to construct an astronomically-tuned chronology between (and including) magnetochrons C19r and C22n (~41 – 50 Ma), spanning the “Eocene gap”.",

            "abstract": "Colli Albani (Italy) is an alkali-potassic volcanic district located about 20 km SE of Rome (3 M inhabitants) and lastly erupted 36 ka ago. Its eruptive activity is characterized by well-clustered, regularly spaced time cycles, with an average recurrence time of 45±5 ka. Since the modern volcanic activity at Colli Albani seems not particularly intense, scientists have interpreted this volcano to be quiescent. Therefore, unlike other Italian volcanoes, the area has not undergone extensive monitoring. However, a seismic swarm during 1989-1990 has been related to a local uplift of ca. 30 cm since the 1950's along a line crossing the western side of the volcano, giving rise to a debate about its possible interpretation in terms of unrest. Furthermore, recent geological investigations indicate a coupling of eruption history, uplift history, and changes in the regional stress field, pointing to the conclusion that Colli Albani is in unrest. As a result, an evaluation of the volcanic hazard of such a strongly inhabited and vulnerable area is needed. We present the results from the analysis of 20 years of SAR interferometry. The time series show a linear trending displacement (3 mm/yr maximum ground velocity) affecting the western flank of the volcano. In addition, results from gravimetric surveys conducted during 2005-2007 reveal a different behavior between the eastern and western sectors. In an attempt of understanding the dynamics of Colli Albani from the available geodetic and gravimetric data, we build a finite element model incorporating local structural and lithological features, such as mapped faults and elastic discontinuities. Our results suggest that magma is accumulating beneath the Colli Albani western flank, where uplift and positive microgravity anomalies are observed and where the recent seismic swarm took place. Our model constrains the location and geometry of the magmatic source, which is below the vents responsible for the last eruptive activity, while the older central construct seems to be not affected by magma recharge phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Several recent studies have suggested that abrupt late Pleistocene climatic events in the northern North Atlantic have influenced the intensity of the Indian Monsoon. Cold climate events in the North Atlantic are thought to have generated a weaker Indian Monsoon with less precipitation. This teleconnection, however, remains debated. Knowledge of how the vegetation in the Indo Pacific Warm Pool has responded to past rainfall variations is limited since there are few well dated paleoclimate archives from the area. Here data are presented from a sediment sequence from a lake in southern Thailand. An age model has been established, revealing that the sequence encompasses the last deglaciation and most of the Holocene. Sediment composition, geochemical parameters and macrofossil remains in this sequence revealed three abrupt shifts. The first shift occurred at the transition from a late glacial stadial period with a weaker Indian Monsoon and a drier climate, to the Bølling-Allerød interstadial with a strengthening of the Indian Monsoon and a wetter climate. The second shift occurred at the transition from the Bølling-Allerød interstadial to the Younger Dryas stadial and involves a clear change from a C4-dominated to a C3-dominated ecosystem. The change can be explained by a weakened Indian Monsoon together with flooding of the Sunda Shelf, leading to less seasonal variability in precipitation that resulted in an advantage for C3 plants. The third shift occurred during the Younger Dryas stadial and reflects a change to a more terrestrial ecosystem. This supports the idea of a weaker Indian Monsoon, which may have been caused by climate events in the Northern Hemisphere. These distinct shifts are considered to be linked to the intensity of the Indian Monsoon. They ultimately appear to be caused by the combined effect of temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and to changes in sea level due to flooding of the Sundaland Shelf.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a land surface model with coupled snow and frozen soil physics has been developed by improving the formulations of snow and frozen soil for a hydrologically-improved land surface model (HydroSiB2). First, an energy-balance based 3-layer snow model has been incorporated into the HydroSiB2 (hereafter HydroSiB2-S) for an improved description of internal processes of snow pack. Second, a universal and simplified soil model has been coupled with HydroSiB2-S to enable the calculation of soil water freezing and thawing (hereafter HydroSiB2-SF). In order to avoid the instability caused by the uncertainty in estimating water phase changes, enthalpy is adopted as a prognostic variable instead of snow/soil temperature in the energy balance equation of the snow/frozen soil module. The newly developed models were then rigorously evaluated at two typical sites over Tibetan Plateau (one snowy and the other non-snowy, with both underlying frozen soil). At the snowy site in northeast TP (DY in the upper Hei River), HydroSiB2-SF demonstrated significant improvements over HydroSiB2-F (that is the model same as HydroSiB2-SF but using the original single-layer snow module of HydroSiB2), showing the importance of snow internal processes described by 3-layer snow parameterization. At the non-snowy site in southwest TP (Ngari, extremely dry), HydroSiB2-SF gave reasonable simulations of soil water phase changes while HydroSiB2-S did not, indicating the crucial role of frozen soil module in depicting the soil thermal and water dynamics. Finally, HydroSiB2-SF was proved capable of simulating upward moisture fluxes towards freezing front from the unfrozen soil layers below in winter.",

            "abstract": "Eastern Asia has the fastest growing anthropogenic emissions in the world, possibly affecting both the pollution in the local troposphere as well as in the trans-Pacific region. Local measurements over Asia show that tropospheric ozone (O3) has increased by 1 to 3% per year since the start of the millennium. This increase is often invoked to explain positive tropospheric O3 trends observed in western US, but to date there is no unambiguous evidence showing that enhanced Asian pollution is responsible for these trends.\nIn this research we use observations of tropospheric O3 from TES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer, onboard AURA), tropospheric NO2 measurements from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument, onboard AURA) and lower stratospheric observations of O3 from MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder, onboard AURA) in combination with the TM5 CTM.\nSatellite-based studies focusing on tropospheric O3 and NO2 have the potential to close the gap left by previous studies on air quality since spaceborne data provide large-scale observational evidence that both O3 precursor concentrations and tropospheric O3 levels are rapidly changing over source receptor areas.\nWe show the increased ability of TM5 to reproduce the 2005-2010 observed rapid rise in free tropospheric O3 of 7% over China from TES, once OMI NO2 measurements were implemented in TM5 to update NOX emissions. MLS observations on lower stratospheric O3 have the potential to improve the stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) estimate in TM5 which is mainly driven by ECMWF meteorological fields. Constraining the TM5 modelled trend of the STE contribution to the 3-9 km partial O3 column using MLS observations of stratospheric O3 lead to a better explanation of the sources of the free tropospheric O3 trends over China.\nBased on the OMI inferred TM5 updates in NOX emissions, the impact of Asian O3 and its precursors on the free troposphere (3-9 km) over the western US could be quantified. Large import from China offsets the local efforts to improve air quality in the 3-9 km partial column over the western US with more than 40%. The issue of export and long-range transport of pollution from other countries indicates that global efforts may be required to address both the global as well as the regional air quality and climate change.",

            "abstract": "There is strong connection from atomic structure (sub-nm scale) to microstructure (mm scale); for example the elastic properties of minerals are directly linked to their atomic arrangement. This link between atomic arrangement and elastic properties has been extensively exploited in recent years with ab initio methods providing the elastic tensors of many minerals in extreme conditions. The use of ab initio modeling to predict the behavior of dislocations pioneered by Patrick Cordier’s group in Lille provides another link between atomic structure and deformation at the crystal scale. These data may be further up-scaled via the prediction of the evolution of crystal preferred orientations (CPO) using polycrystalline modeling codes (e.g.,VPSC) to complete the link to anisotropic physical properties at the scale of the Earth deformation patterns.\nThe link between upper mantle seismology and the microstructure of peridotite rocks recovered at the Earth’s surface was one the first cases where a quantitative estimate of anisotropy measured by seismology could be directly compared with rock samples to provide results in good agreement, even though the length scales measurement differed by several orders of magnitude. The agreement between seismology with propagation path lengths of hundreds to thousands of km and physical properties of rock samples of a few cm3implies that in the upper mantle the flow field must be coherent over large distances. Large-scale convection currents at the planetary scale are clearly a key factor in creating this coherence, but analysis of seismic data also points to coherence in the deformation patterns at the scale of hundreds to thousands of km in the lithospheric mantle.\nYet the interpretation of seismic anisotropy data in terms of flow patterns in the mantle relies on our knowledge of the crystal scale plasticity and on the CPO evolution. Ab-initio modelling of crystal plasticity is an essential tool here. In the upper mantle, this knowledge may be constrained by the direct analysis of deformed peridotites. To contribute to this effort we have been compiling a database of mantle rocks microstructures and CPO.",

The system consists of four major functional units: subsurface monitoring sensors sending data directly through the internet, centralized servers capable of collecting and processing big data, computational modules providing physical and statistical models for predicting high-risk areas, and geologic information service platforms visualizing underground safety maps for the public.\nThe target urban area will be regionally covered by multi-sensors monitoring soil and groundwater conditions, and by high resolution satellite InSAR images filtering vertical land movements in a centimeter scale. Integrity of buried water supply and sewer lines are also monitored for the possibility of underground cavity formation. Once high-risk area is predicted, more tangible surveying methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and resistivity survey can be applied for locating the cavities.\nAdditionally, laboratory and field experiments are performed to understand overall road collapsing mechanism from the initial cavity creation to its progressive development depending on soil types, degree of compaction, and groundwater condition. Acquired results will update existing fully-coupled hydromechanical models for more accurate prediction of the collapsing-vulnerable area. Preliminary laboratory experiments show that the upward propagation of subsurface cavity is closely related to the soil properties, such as sand-clay ratios and moisture contents, and groundwater dynamics.",

            "abstract": "We combined time series of inferred DOC (from optical sensors) and stable isotopes in streams and watershed source areas to assess the link between water age and C fluxes. We monitored temporal dynamics of FDOM for 2 yrs at nested scales (0.9, 3.0 and 30km2) in a montane Scottish watershed. FDOM was strongly correlated (r2 ~ 0.8) with DOC allowing inference of 15 min timeseries. Marked seasonality was observed, with highest DOC concentrations (~25 mg l-1) in summer events and lower concentrations (~5mg l-1) in winter. During events, anticlockwise hysteresis was observed; consistent with expansion of the riparian saturation zone, increasing hydrological connectivity across peat soils and mobilizing DOC. Lag times for peak discharge and DOC were 1-12 hrs depending on event characteristics and antecedent conditions. Isotope time series from precipitation, streams and catchment source waters (overland flow and hillslope drainage) were also generated. These allowed us to model the non-stationary characteristics of their ages. Stream water age ranges from 3 months at high flows when overland flow dominates runoff to 4 yrs under baseflow. Overland flow age was a dominant influence on DOC transport. Highest concentrations occurred in small summer events with relatively young (<1 month old) overland flow waters generated after dry antecedent conditions, reflecting displacement of DOC-rich soil water. With wetting up in late summer/fall, overland flow is younger (< 1 week) diluting soil water DOC. Similar patterns occur across scales, though at 0.9km2 the dominance of a large peatland limits hysteresis, and maintains more constant DOC levels. At larger scales, DOC was more responsive but decreased more rapidly, reflecting a greater, but more transient influence of young overland flow. This shows the importance of riparian wetlands in regulating the quality and age of streams and the need to incorporate these sensitive areas in land management strategies.",

LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of the basement sedimentary sequences (e.g. Xiajiang Group and Sibao Group) and the relevant granitic pluton (Motianling pluton) provides new information about the pre-Cambrian evolution of the southeastern Yangtze block margin along the western Jiangnan orogen. The depositional age of Sibao Group located in the Southeast Guizhou Province can be constrained at 825-835 Ma by the youngest detrital zircon ages and crystallization age of the intrusive Motianling granitic pluton. The maximum depositional age of the Xiajiang Group is estimated to be ca. 795 Ma. Four main age populations are evident in Sibao Group: 0.83-1.0 Ga, 1.3-1.5 Ga, 1.6-1.8 Ga and 2.2-2.6 Ga. The distinguished age populations in the Xiajiang Group are identical to those in the Sibao Group but lack in ranges of 1.3-1.5 Ga. Local abundant (<0.9 Ga) granitoid outcrops, distant early-Neoproterozoic (0.9-1.0 Ga) components and pre-Neoproterozoic recycled materials from the interior of the Yangtze Block both contribute to the sedimentation of the Neoproterozoic basement sequences. We suggest that a rapid exhumation and uplift occurred after 820 Ma along the southeastern margin of Yangtze Block, and provided abundant detritus to the Neoproterozoic basin between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, after which the assembly process gradually ceased till ca. 800 Ma rather than immediately paused or switched to extension after ca. 820 Ma. Regarding the location of the South China Block in the breakup the Rodinia, it is more reasonable to place Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks on the western margin rather than the center of Rodinia supercontinent during the late-Neoproterozoic time.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion has accelerated as a result of land use change, increasing the sediment supply to rivers worldwide. A thorough knowledge of sediment dynamics is required to design efficient management measures to control erosion and reduce sediment delivery from catchments. Fallout radionuclides are often used separately to provide spatial (137Cs) or temporal (7Be, 210Pbxs) information on sediment sources. In this study, we examine their combined application to simultaneously model spatial and temporal sediment source dynamics. To this end, potential sediment sources (n=84) and suspended sediment (n=16) were collected at two stations in a 12 km² catchment in Northern Laos during the first flood of the 2014 wet season. Part of the source material was directly sampled in ephemeral flow occurring on hillslopes to avoid the grain size selectivity problems that may occur during erosion and river transport processes. A distribution modelling approach quantified the relative contributions of recently eroded surface (labelled with both 7Be and 137Cs), recently eroded subsurface (depleted in both 7Be and 137Cs), re-suspended surface (depleted in 7Be and labelled with 137Cs) and re-suspended subsurface sources (enriched in 7Be and depleted in 137Cs). At an upstream sampling location, surface sources contributed the majority of sediment (55%) whereas subsurface sources dominated the supply of sediment downstream (74%). Importantly, re-suspended subsurface sources, labelled with 7Be, were a significant sediment source at the catchment outlet (60%). This approach demonstrates the utility of combining multiple radionuclides when investigating spatial and temporal sediment source dynamics in tropical catchments. In the future, sampling of source material in ephemeral flows occurring on hillslopes should be encouraged. Furthermore, the proposed approach should be tested in larger catchments to guide the implementation of efficient erosion control measures.",

            "abstract": "Remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been considered an ideal probe in monitoring global vegetation photosynthesis. However, challenges in accurate estimate of faint SIF (less than 5% of the total reflected radiation in near infrared bands) from the observed apparent reflected radiation greatly limit its wide applications. Currently, the telluric O2-B (~688nm) and O2-A (~761nm) have been proved to be capable of SIF retrieval based on Fraunhofer line depth (FLD) principle. They may still work well even using conventional ground-based commercial spectrometers with typical spectral resolutions of 2~5 nm and high enough signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., the ASD spectrometer). Nevertheless, almost all current FLD based algorithms were mainly developed for O2-A, a few concentrating on the other SIF emission peak in O2-B. One of the critical reasons is that it is very difficult to model the sudden varying reflectance around O2-B band located in the red-edge spectral region (about 680-800 nm).\nThis study investigates a new method by combining the established inverted Gaussian reflectance model (IGM) and FLD principle using diurnal canopy spectra with relative low spectral resolutions of 1 nm (FluorMOD simulations) and 3 nm (measured by ASD spectrometer) respectively. The IGM has been reported to be an objective and good method to characterize the entire vegetation red-edge reflectance. Consequently, the proposed SIF retrieval method (hereinafter called IGMFLD) could exploit all the spectral information along the whole red-edge (680-800 nm) to obtain more reasonable reflectance and fluorescence correction coefficients than traditional FLD methods such as the iFLD. Initial results show that the IGMFLD can better capture the spectrally non-linear characterization of the reflectance in 680-800 nm and thereby yields much more accurate SIFs in O2-B than typical FLD methods, including sFLD, 3FLD and iFLD (see figure 1).

In order to get a better understanding of these mechanisms, we investigate the isolated problems of rotating thermal,chemical and thermochemical convection, and then thermally, chemically and thermochemically driven hydromagnetic dynamos in spherical shells. The underlying model equations describe the evolution of the flow, thermal and compositional fields in the first case, and flow, thermal, compositional and magnetic fields in the second case within the Boussinesq approximation. A uniform distribution of heat sources within the shell are assumed. The effects of solidification at the inner core boundary are accounted for by prescribing the latent heat and solutal fluxes at the bottom of the shell. In the limit of small Ekman and Prandtl numbers, we provide asymptotic results for the onset of convection and dynamos, in which case the system can be approximated to leading order by an inertial-wave convection and dynamos. The full set of governing equations is then solved numerically.",

            "abstract": "The Sumatra subduction zone is one of the most seismically active zone on Earth. In the last one decade alone, it has hosted three Mw>8.4 great earthquakes (2004, 2005, 2007) along with 2010 tsunami earthquake. Although the 2007 Mentawai earthquake had Mw=8.4, it did not produce tsunami whereas the 2010 earthquake had Mw=7.8 only in the same region, it produced a large tsunami with a run up height of up to 8 m on Pagai Island, taking 800 lives. Therefore, understanding why an earthquake produce tsunami is fundamental for risk assessment as well for subduction zone processes. Prior to the 2010 earthquake we had acquired ultra-long offsets seismic reflection data in 2009 in the co-seismic slip zone using a 15 km long streamer, the longest streamer ever used, and found that the earth ruptured the frontal section of the subduction zone, which is normally believed to be aseismic, and possibly produced the tsunami. In order to quantify the nature of the co-seismic rupture zone and its link with the tsunami generation, we performed full waveform inversion of seismic reflection data. In order to obtain the high-resolution velocity model for the full waveform inversion, we first downward continue the data to the seafloor, picked first arrivals, and performed tomography. We used the tomographic velocity model as an input to the full waveform inversion. This process also reduced the computation cost significantly as the water depth in this area is 5.5 km. The resulting models shows the presence of thrust faults extending up to the subducting oceanic plate, suggesting that the frontal section of the subduction in this region was indeed locked, capable of hosting great earthquakes. Our inverted model provides the resolution of tens of meters, allowing to characterize the nature of the megathrust and other faults, and hence estimate the effective porosity, permeability and stress along these faults, subsequently the pore pressure.",

            "abstract": "The enhanced central and eastern Pacific SST warming and the associated ocean processes under global warming are investigated using the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2). The tropical SST warming pattern in the coupled CESM can be faithfully reproduced by the POP2 forced with surface fluxes computed using the aerodynamic bulk formula. By prescribing the wind stress and/or wind speed through the bulk formula, the effects of wind stress change and/or the wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback are isolated and their linearity is evaluated in this ocean-alone setting. Result shows that, although the weakening of the equatorial easterlies contributes positively to the El Niño-like SST warming, 80% of which can be simulated by the POP2 without considering the effects of wind change in both mechanical and thermodynamic fluxes. This result points to the importance of the air-sea thermal interaction and the relative feebleness of the ocean dynamical process in the El Niño-like equatorial Pacific SST response to global warming.\nOn the other hand, the wind stress change is found to play a dominant role in the oceanic response in the tropical Pacific, accounting for most of the changes in the equatorial ocean current system and thermal structures, including the weakening of the surface westward currents, the enhancement of the near-surface stratification and the shoaling of the equatorial thermocline. Interestingly, greenhouse gas warming in the absence of wind stress change and WES feedback also contributes substantially to the changes at the subsurface equatorial Pacific. Further, this warming impact can be largely replicated by an idealized ocean experiment forced by a uniform surface heat flux, whereby, arguably, a purest form of oceanic dynamical thermostat is revealed.",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea fault in the Levant represents a simple, segmented plate boundary from the Gulf of Aqaba northward to the Sea of Galilee, where it changes its character into a complex plate boundary with multiple sub-parallel faults in northern Israel, Lebanon and Syria. The studied Jordan Gorge (JG) segment is the northernmost part of the simple section, before the fault becomes more complex. Seven fault-crossing buried paleo-channels, offset by the Dead Sea fault, were investigated using paleoseismic and geophysical methods. The mapped offsets capture the long-term rupture history and slip-rate behavior on the JG fault segment for the past 4000 years.\nThe ~20 km long JG segment appears to be more active (in term of number of earthquakes) than its neighboring segments to the south and north. The rate of movement on this segment varies considerably over the studied period: the long-term slip-rate for the entire 4000 years is similar to previously observed rates (~4 mm/yr), yet over shorter time periods the rate varies from 3-8 mm/yr. Paleoseismic data on both timing and displacement indicate a high COV >1 (clustered) with displacement per event varying by nearly an order of magnitude. The rate of earthquake production does not produce a time predictable pattern over a period of 2 kyr. We postulate that the seismic behavior of the JG fault is influenced by stress interactions with its neighboring faults to the north and south. Coulomb stress modelling demonstrates that an earthquake on any neighboring fault will increase the Coulomb stress on the JG fault and thus promote rupture. We conclude that deriving on-fault slip-rates and earthquake recurrence patterns from a single site and/or over a short time period can produce misleading results. The definition of an adequately long time period to resolve slip-rate is a question that needs to be addressed and requires further work.",

The rate of instrumental seismicity is lower than the average along the orogen, there is no record of large historical events, but both paleoseismology and GPS studies point to potentially large (M>8) earthquakes. Due to the lack of a permanent seismic monitoring system in the area, our current level of understanding is inappropriate to create a reliable quantitative seismic hazard model for the region. Existing maps are based on questionable hypotheses and show major inconsistencies when compared to each other.\nHere we present results on national and regional scales from a 38-station broadband seismological network we operated for almost 2 years in the Kingdom of Bhutan. A thorough, state-of-the-art analysis of local and regional earthquakes builds a comprehensive catalogue that reveals significantly (2-to-3 orders of magnitude) more events than detected from global networks. The seismotectonic analysis reveals new patterns of seismic activity as well as striking differences over relatively short distances within the Himalayas, only partly explained by surface observations such as geology. We compare a priori and a posteriori (BMC) magnitude of completeness maps and show that our network was able to detect all felt events during its operation. Some of these events could be felt at surprisingly large distances. Based on our experiment and experience, we draft the pillars on which a permanent seismological observatory for Bhutan could be constructed. Such a continuous monitoring system of seismic activity could then lead to a reliable quantitative seismic hazard model for Bhutan and surrounding regions, and serve as a base to improve building codes and general preparedness.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands are major ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere and have a significant role in global biogeochemical processes. Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding past, present and future peatland dynamics. However, chronological and geographical data on peatland initiation are scattered, impeding the reliable establishment of postglacial spatiotemporal peatland formation patterns and their possible connection to climate. In order to present a comprehensive account of postglacial peatland formation histories in North America and northern Europe, we collected a data set of 1400 basal peat ages accompanied by below-peat sediment-type interpretations from literature. Our data indicate that all peatland initiation processes (i.e. primary mire formation, terrestrialization and paludification) co-occurred throughout North America and northern Europe during the Holocene, and almost equal amounts of peatlands formed via these three processes. Furthermore, the data suggest that the processes exhibited some spatiotemporal patterns. On both continents, primary mire formation seems to occur first, soon followed by terrestrialization and later paludification. Primary mire formation appears mostly restricted to coastal areas, whereas terrestrialization and paludification were more evenly distributed across the continents. Primary mire formation seems mainly connected with physical processes, such as ice sheet retreat. Terrestrialization probably reflected progressive infilling of water bodies on longer timescales but was presumably drought driven on shorter timescales. Paludification seems affected by climate as it slowed down in Europe during the driest phase of the Holocene between 6 and 5 ka. Lateral expansion of existing peatlands accelerated c. 5000 years ago on both continents, which was likely connected to an increase in relative moisture.",

            "abstract": "A complete theory of episodic volcanism is lacking. Melt generation related to large scale tectonic processes is likely continuous but surface volcanic activity is typically episodic; for most volcanoes short-lived eruptions alternate with long periods of dormancy. Many models of volcanic activity and geophysical unrest are framed by a conceptual model of shallow magma chamber recharge, in which various phenomena are attributed to magma transport from deeper levels. While many aspects of volcanism are explained by this concept it has little explanatory power for key aspects of volcanism, including time scales of dormancy, eruption duration and eruption magnitude. Extensive trans-crustal igneous systems develop beneath active volcanoes in which much of the system is in a mushy state in which buoyancy-driven segregation of melt and magmatic fluid occurs to form layers, which are inherently unstable. We postulate that such systems are prone to destabilisation in which segregating layers amalgamate to form ephemeral magma chambers and in which melts and magmatic fluids decouple. Periods of dormancy relate to slow processes of segregation while short periods of volcanic unrest and eruption relate to episodic and rapid processes of destabilisation of the mush system. In this conceptual framework volatiles rather than magma recharge plays the key role in the dynamics of the shallow parts of the magmatic systems. Magma ascent during episodes of destabilisation does not itself cause pressurisation because melts and crystals are near incompressible, while volatile exsolution and decompression results in major pressure changes that can lead to unrest and eruption. These concepts are applied to the interpretation of stratigraphic, geochronological, geophysical, geochemical, petrological and volcanological data of volcanic activity at the Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat.",

Utilizing a newly developed event detection method named the Match and Locate (M&L) method, we study the seismicity around the reservoir from 2009 to 2015. We detect over 700 earthquakes from 2009 to 2015 nearby Hutubi gas storage, with the largest event magnitude of ML 3.6. On the contrary, only one probable event is detected during the year before Hutubi gas field began operational in 1998. More than 200 earthquakes are detected during injection operations conducted between 2013 and 2014. Most of these earthquakes can be grouped into two clusters, located within 1-3 km of the injection wells and exhibiting strong waveform similarity within each cluster. There is a short time delay (12 days) from the rapid rise of well pressure to the onset of seismicity. We suggest that those detected earthquakes are most likely caused by the gas injection of Hutubi gas reservoir.",

Its migration is primarily by soil erosion and sediment transport within surface water during times of heavy rainfall and flooding. In order to predict the future distribution of radioactive cesium and resulting air dose rate at any location in Fukushima, we have integrated a number of mathematical models covering different time and spatial scales. In this presentation we report our overall scheme of prediction starting from sediment and radioactive cesium movement and resulting long term air dose rate changes. Specifically, we present simulation results of sediment movement and radioactive cesium migration using semi-empirical and physics based watershed models, and that of sediment and radioactive cesium behavior in a dam reservoir using one and two dimensional river simulation models.

            "abstract": "One of the pending questions in the context of global change is whether climatic drivers or other factors have a stronger influence on water availability. Here we present an idealised approach that allows to estimate the probability that changes in the aridity index have a larger effect on water availability than any other factor. The analysis builds upon a recent probabilistic extension of the Budyko framework, which is subject to an analytical sensitivity assessment. The results highlight the nonlinearity of the coupled water and energy balance. We further show that changes in water availability are dominated by changes in the aridity index in humid conditions, without making any assumptions on future climate change. In arid conditions other factors are dominating. A global application suggests that changes water availability are dominated by the aridity-index in 73% of the global land-area, implying that climate change is likely to alter water availability in most populated regions.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the Nares-Strait (NS), a seaway between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, is important to understand the plate tectonic history of the Arctic region. As it is clear that rifting and seafloor spreading took place between Greenland and Baffin Island, it is unclear how the extension was compensated between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. Already Alfred Wegener suggested some kind of left lateral transform fault along the NS, a straight seaway separating the Greenland Plate from the North American Plate, nowadays proposed as the Wegener-Fault. Plate tectonic reconstruction models require a transform fault for the compensation of several hundred km of extension and seafloor spreading from Late Cretaceous to Eocene times. However, land geological data do not support this thesis and let assume that no lateral displacement occurred between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. With the formation of the recent Midatlantic Ridge System between Greenland and Europe since the early Eocene, the western branch became inactive and consequently the proposed transform fault, too. Northeast motion of Greenland replaced the left lateral transform and caused compression. The inactive transform fault was overprinted and as a consequence it was altered, probably displaced and is difficult to recognize.\nThe Kane Basin is one of a series of basins that are aligned along the NS. It resembles probably a pull-apart basin following the approach that NS developed as transform fault.\nThis paper presents insight into the Kane Basin by means of 2D seismic data, sonobuoy data, gravity and magnetic data acquired during surveys of BGR in 2001 and 2010. The eastern Kane Basin is characterized by a deeper rim and a more shallow central part. Most of it is floored by Proterozoic crust without any sediment on top of it. Only in the western part of the Kane Basin a sedimentary infill can be recorded which terminates with an erosional truncation on to the seafloor. Because of the mapped sediment and fault pattern, a pull-apart development of the Kane Basin can’t be supported. However, the steepening of the sedimentary beds towards Ellesmere Island and anticlinal deformation parallel to the NS point to the presence of a strike-slip fault that runs parallel to the Ellesmere Island coastline.",

The continuous and high temporal resolution records of ground surface solar radiation are presented, including global (GR), ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared radiation (NIR). The corresponding albedos are analyzed over three typical non-vegetated underlying surfaces in arid and semiarid and semihumid regions of northwestern China. The preliminary investigations were carried out. The results show that the variation trends of UV, VIS, and NIR are coincident with the GR, and the irradiances are gradually decreasing throughout the IOP at each site; the energy ratios of VIS/GR are all approximately 40.2%, and the ratios of NIR/GR are all approximately 54.4% at the Gobi, desert, and bare loess zones; and the averaged albedos of the soil for VIS are 0.231, 0.211, and 0.142 and for the NIR are 0.266, 0.252, and 0.255 over the Gobi, desert, and bare loess land surfaces, respectively. The energy ratios of VIS/GR and NIR/GR are not 50% as prescribed for all of the soil color classes in most of land surface models (LSMs). The observational soil albedo values for NIR are not twice to that of the VIS as predicted in some LSMs for the underlying surface at the three sites. GR albedo is determined by the energy ratios of SR/GR and SR albedos.",

            "abstract": "A record of 27 historical earthquakes in central Italy extending back to 1349 AD on faults with known geological slip-rates enables us to investigate the effect of Coulomb stress interactions between faults over long time scales. Modeling the effect of these interactions between active faults in low strain-rate regions is challenging due to a paucity of long earthquake records and poorly constrained long-term strain rates, yet this is key if we are to understand the effect of these interactions on earthquake occurrence. The central Apennines, Italy, with 27 well constrained historical earthquakes over 660 years and over 100 measurements of fault slip rate, provides a natural laboratory for testing models of fault interaction and determining how Coulomb stress interactions between faults affect the timing and location of future earthquakes.\nThe central Apennines has parallel sets of NW-SE striking active normal faults. Since 1349, earthquakes have clustered along the northeast side of the fault system whereas Holocene averaged strain-rates are more evenly distributed across strike. We model the Coulomb stress changes caused by each of the 27 events and resolve stresses on all faults in the region. Our modeling includes interseismic loading over this period, with stress accumulating on shear zones beneath the seismogenic portion of each fault constrained by the measurements of fault slip-rate, and measurements of fault kinematics from frictional wear striae on bedrock fault scarps.\nWe show that earthquakes occurred on faults where the net accumulation of stress was positive over the timescale modeled. Co-seismic Coulomb stress increases on the order of 0.01-0.1 MPa along strike appear to occasionally trigger large earthquakes yet are more often eclipsed by interseismic loading stresses on the order of 10-3 MPa/yr. Importantly, the effect of across strike co-seismic Coulomb stress decreases is more pervasive and can cause changes in earthquake recurrence of 102-103 years.",

            "abstract": "The generation of heat during faulting – i.e. the shear heating - has been extensively studied (e.g. Brun and Cobbold, 1980; Scholz, 1980; Leloup et al., 1999; Schmalholz et al., 2009). However, several more traceable mechanisms can generate fault zone heating, including advection, upwelling of hot fluids, and selective enrichment of heat-producing elements. The difficulty in recognizing the thermal effect of mechanical work often leads to an underestimation, or even total neglect, of the contribution of shear heating to the thermal budget. Quantifying how each mechanism contributes to heating is a challenge, which may be addressed by a comprehensive thermal characterization of the fault zone. Furthermore, recognizing the contribution of shear heating is a fundamental pre-requisite for dating the fault motion through thermochronometric techniques. In this talk, I show an approach that integrates field and micro-structural observations, clay mineralogy, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometry to estimate the temperatures experienced by a fault zone and the surrounding wall rocks. The ZHe thermochronometer has a well-defined He partial retention zone of 130–200°C and a closure temperature (Tc) of ~180°C. Consequently, it is ideally suited to dating large heat-producing faults that were active at shallow depths (<6-7 km) where wall-rock temperature does not exceed Tc. This approach has been addressed to the Penninic Front in the Western Alps. The large dataset provides the necessary constraints to explore the potential causes of heating, and how they are related to fault motion. The thermal history is verified by numerical models that simulate the deformation at variable strain rates and the circulation of hot fluids in the fault damage zone.",

            "abstract": "The layered structure of the Earth's interior is generally believed to develop through the magma ocean differentiation in the early Earth. Previous seismic studies revealed the existence of ultra low velocity zones above the core mantle boundary (CMB) which was inferred to be associated with the remnant of a deep magma ocean. The heat flux through the core mantle boundary therefore would strongly depend on the thermal conductivity, both lattice (klat) and radiative (krad) of dense silicate melts and major constituent minerals of the lower mantle. Recent experimental results on the radiative thermal conductivity of dense silicate glasses and lower-mantle minerals suggest that krad of dense silicate glasses could be remarkably lower than krad of the surrounding solid mantle phases. In this case, the dense silicate melts will act as a trap for heat from the Earth’s outer core. However, this conclusion remains uncertain because of the lack of direct measurements on lattice thermal conductivities of silicate glasses/melts under lower mantle pressures up to date. Here we report experimental results on lattice thermal conductivities of dense silicate glass with basaltic composition under pressures relevant to the Earth’s lower mantle in a diamond-anvil cell using time-domain thermoreflectance method. The study will assist the comprehension of thermal transport properties of silicate melts in the Earth’s deep interior and is crucial for understanding the dynamic and thermal evolution of the Earth’s internal structure.",

However, the structural details and potential records of coeval synorogenic sedimentation remain elusive. We report results from new geologic mapping (1:50,000), cross-section construction, and U-Pb geochronology for the Matucana-Ticlio region at 11-12°S along the Lima-La Oroya highway. Zircon U-Pb age data from volcanic rocks and clastic basin fill provide a maximum depositional age of ~43 Ma for a middle Eocene syndeformational unit that we identify as the Anta Formation, which overlies the Paleocene Casapalca Formation. Sedimentary lithofacies and unconformable relationships within the volcaniclastic Anta Formation reveal mixed fluvial, alluvial-fan, and volcanic depositional conditions during shortening accommodated by a NE-verging thrust/reverse fault and corresponding backthrust (here named the Chonta fault system). Our cross-section reconstruction and geochronological data indicate that the region is a critical, possibly unique, zone of the broader NE-directed Marañon fold-thrust belt where pre-Neogene synorogenic sediments and their associated structures are preserved. We interpret this combined structural and basin system as an Eocene-age (Incaic) frontal thrust belt and corresponding foredeep to wedge-top depozone in central Peru. As one of the better-constrained segments of the Marañon fold-thrust belt, this zone provides insight into potential linkages with elusive early Cenozoic (Incaic) structures and foreland basin fill of the Western Cordillera and Altiplano farther south in the central Andean plateau.",

Three types of instruments (SO2 camera, whisk and push broom imager) proceeded ground-based and airborne data acquisition as part of the AROMAT ESA project (monitoring of SO2 plume from a large thermoelectric plant). The SO2 camera used is an imaging system composed of two UV cameras (synchronised in space and time) allowing fast acquisitions of intensity. Each camera is equipped with the same lens and a specific narrow band-pass filter (one at the wavelength at which SO2 absorbs and one at an off-band wavelength). The combination of two UV cameras provides a 2D image of the integrated content of SO2. The Small Whisk broom Imager for trace gases monitoriNG (SWING) used in this study and developed at the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA), is based on a compact ultra-violet visible spectrometer and a scanning mirror. The Airborne imaging instrument for Measurements of Atmospheric Pollution (AirMAP) constructed at the Institute of Environmental Physics of the University of Bremen (IUP), performed SO2 measurements in the UV-visible spectral range. Both whisk and push broom scanner use the DOAS technique, that is based on the relationship between the quantity of light absorbed and the number of SO2 molecules in the light path. SWING and AirMAP instruments provide scans of SO2 column density. Quantification of 2D field contents and fluxes of anthropogenic SO2 emissions from Turceni power station (Romania) are shown.

Petrographic and rock-magnetic analyses revealed that the ferromagnetic carriers are dominated by metamorphic pyrrhotite and Low-Ti magnetite. Simultaneous in situ laser ablation 40Ar/39Ar age determination of the samples indicate that a 426-380 Ma Caledonian sensu lato thermal overprint was followed by younger events in the 377-326 Ma and ca. 300 Ma intervals (Fig. 1B). The latter two ages appear to coincide with recently published seismic data indicating that Late Devonian - Carboniferous rifting was followed by similar crustal extension in the SW Barents shelf area in Late Carboniferous time. Published in situ palaeomagnetic directions from Hornsund area in SW Svalbard fit the Silurian sector of the Baltica reference path suggesting that the geometry of the sampled Caledonian Sofekammen Syncline was not modified during following Svalbardian or Eurekan deformation events (Fig. 1C). In contrast, palaeomagnetic directions obtained from Oscar II Land are distant from Caledonian sector of Baltica reference path (Fig. 1C). It is suggested here, that the most significant mechanism responsible for the rotation of the palaeomagnetic directions and modification of geometry of Caledonian tectonic structures of Oscar II Land was listric normal faulting related to the opening of the North Atlantic -Arctic Ocean Basins.

            "abstract": "Migration and storage of partial melt in the Earth's mantle are controlled by an interplay of compaction, gravity, surface tension, and phase change (e.g. melting and freezing). At temperatures close to the solidus, the volume fraction of the melt is typically small. The mobility of such small volume fractions of melt depend on the permeability and melt viscosity. In addition, surface tension at grain-grain-melt triple junctions can influence the efficiency of melt extraction from the source region. Finally, deformation of the matrix creates melt-rich bands, rendering the mobility anisotropic. Dissolution-precipitation controlled diffusive mass transfer, however, can homogenize such melt segregation in small length scales.\nIn this work, we present results from linear stability analyses and finite elements model outlining the influence of these competing processes on the migration of partial melt in the Earth's mantle. We also present results outlining the efficiency of our massively parallel finite elements solver for the two phase flow and comparison between different preconditioners.",

            "abstract": "Mainland Portugal, on the SW edge of the European continent, is located directly north of the boundary between the Eurasian and Nubian plates. It lies in a region of slow lithospheric deformation, which has generated some of the largest earthquakes in Europe, both intraplate (mainland) and interplate (offshore). The seismicity of mainland Portugal and its adjacent offshore has been repeatedly classified as diffuse. We analyse the instrumental earthquake catalog for western Iberia, enriched with data from recent dense broadband deployments. We show that although the plate boundary south of Portugal is diffuse, in that deformation is accommodated along several distributed faults rather than along one long linear plate boundary, the seismicity itself is not diffuse. Rather, when located using high quality data, earthquakes collapse into well-defined clusters and lineations.\nWe then present a new joint focal mechanism and hypocenter cluster algorithm that is able to extract coherent information between hypocenter locations and focal mechanisms. We apply the method to the Azores-western Mediterranean region, with emphasis on western Iberia. In addition to identifying well-known seismo-tectonic features, the joint clustering algorithm identifies eight new clusters of earthquakes with a good match between the directions of epicentre lineations and focal mechanism fault planes. These clusters may signal single active faults or wider fault zones accommodating a consistent type of faulting. Mainland Portugal is dominated by strike-slip faulting, consistent with the NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE oriented lineations. The region offshore SW Iberia displays clusters that are either predominantly strike-slip or reverse, indicating slip partitioning.\nThis work shows that the study of low-magnitude earthquakes using dense seismic deployments is a powerful tool to study lithospheric deformation in slowly deforming regions, where high-magnitude earthquakes occur with long recurrence intervals.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic property in subsurface has been a target of the magnetic method for a wide variety of geophysical applications in mineral, hydrocarbon, groundwater, and environmental arenas. Anomalous magnetic property also affects controlled source electromagnetic (EM) data due to source-driven induced magnetization. At very low frequencies, a few to tens of hertz, the EM response predominantly consists of static-like magnetic field due to induced magnetization. Taking advantage of this property we have developed a numerical procedure to image subsurface magnetic heterogeneity with much improved resolutions. Incidentally, sensitivities of commercially available sensors and geomagnetic noise spectra at these frequencies are reasonably manageable compared to the anticipated magnetic field strength generated by numerical modeling. We, in this study, show that the resolution of three-dimensional inversion result(s) of controlled source magnetic data (fig. 1(a)) is better than that of geomagnetic data (fig. 1(b)). This is because use of EM excitations from different directions reduces non-uniqueness of inverse problem. These results show that a controlled source magnetic method can be a useful exploration tool when higher resolution of magnetic property is needed or strong remnant magnetization hinders the interpretation of magnetic method.",

            "abstract": "The earliest Oligocene is considered the time that the Cenozoic icehouse world was initiated when the Antarctic continental ice sheet first reached sea level. Subsequently during the Oligocene, climate then fluctuated between glacial (Oi) and warming events as recorded by stable isotopes. Relatively little is known about the paleoecological response of calcareous nannoplankton at low latitudes during these climate deteriorations. Here we investigate the biotic response along with the stable-isotope (δ18O and δ13C) record and multivariate analyses from four ODP and IODP sites cored in three oceans along the tropical belt through strata 24-30 Ma in age. Within this time frame, two major climatic shifts occurred, the Oi-2b glacial event and the Late Oligocene Warming Event (LOWE). During the Oi-events (26.5-30 Ma) temperate-water taxa associated with eutrophic taxa dominated the overall assemblage, suggesting that relatively cooler water rich in nutrients invaded the tropical region. In contrast, during the LOWE (24-26.5 Ma), a major turnover between temperate-water taxa and warm-water taxa occurred when the surface waters became warm and oligotrophic in nature. Additionally, several increases in both abundance and size were recorded through the upper Oligocene including increased abundance in Sphenolithus predistentus, a major biostratigraphic marker in the upper Oligocene, and increased size in S. moriformis. Moreover, a new additional major biostratigraphic event in the upper Oligocene was recorded; Crassidiscus backmanii shows a very short range at low latitudes. These paleoecological responses can be utilized to construct a detailed global late Oligocene biostratigraphy throughout the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of interseismic deformation traditionally relies on GPS and alignment arrays (AA) providing precise but spatially sparse measurements. Here, we resolve with a high spatial resolution interseismic strain accumulation and fault creep associated with the Hayward and Calaveras Faults (HF and CF) in the Eastern San Francisco Bay Area using InSAR. The large 1992-2011 ascending and descending ERS-Envisat dataset enables characterization of short- and long-wavelength horizontal and vertical deformation as small as 2 mm/yr without alignment to a GPS-based model. A comparison between independent InSAR, GPS, and AA datasets shows that the remaining noise is negligible in mean velocity maps and that the creep rates are mostly constant between 1992-2011.\nCreep rates vary from 0±2 mm/yr on the northern CF to 14±2 mm/yr on the central CF south of the HF surface junction. The high spatial resolution velocity map also highlights the southernmost occurrence of creep on the HF, located ~15 km farther south than prior determinations based on AA and field mapping. We remove the long-wavelength deformation using a deep-dislocation model and estimate the shallow slip due to creep by inverting the remaining InSAR fault-parallel motion. We confirm a good agreement between our model and surface slip rates measured with AA and slip at depth from characteristically repeating earthquakes. The distribution of aseismic slip is comparable to previous models focused on the HF, confirming that the distribution of creeping and locked patches is stable. We find that the northern CF is mostly locked, explaining the absence of seismicity and that most of the aseismic slip is limited to the shallowest 5 km on the HF and CF, suggesting partial or full locking at deeper levels. Considering the time since the last earthquakes and the difference between the long-term slip rates and the shallow aseismic slip, we infer that a joint rupture of the HF and central CF could currently produce a M7.1±0.1.",

            "abstract": "The movement of fluids beneath a volcano can cause deformation, and therefore changes to the subsurface stress field that manifest in swarms of low magnitude (<M4) volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes. Moderate VT earthquakes (M 5-6) are unusual, but have the potential to alter the local stress field, affecting the propagation of magmatic fluids and resulting in magma- earthquake feedback.\nHere, we present InSAR and GPS measurements of deformation during the height of an episode of unrest in October 2014 at Chiles-Cerro Negro volcanoes on the Ecuador-Colombian border. These volcanoes were previously considered to be historically inactive, but between 2013 and early 2015 there were three episodes of unrest characterised by VT swarms of increasing energy and duration.\nGPS measurements at two stations near Volcán Chiles show inflation over a time period of approximately twenty days prior to the 20th October, consistent with the intrusion of magma at half space depths >13 km. This inflation took place during a swarm of VT seismicity with thousands of low magnitude events per day and culminated in a M 5.6 earthquake on the 20th October, when inflation abruptly ceased.\nWe measure coseismic displacements from the M 5.6 earthquake with data from three independent InSAR platforms and find that they are consistent with shallow slip of 1.2 m on an oblique reverse fault. This fault plane would have experienced positive Coulomb stress changes from some of the range of potential sources consistent with the inflation. Magmatic intrusion could therefore have contributed to the loading on the fault directly through stress changes caused by pressurisation, and indirectly through the decrease in effective friction coefficient due to elevated pore fluid pressure.\nThe cessation of inflation immediately after the moderate earthquake suggests a link between the two events. We expect slip on the fault plane identified from the InSAR data to have resulted in compression in the shallow crust south of Volcán Chiles, above the source that had previously been inflating. This would have inhibited further ascent of magma.\nThe Chiles-Cerro Nego unrest provides rare observations of interaction between magmatic intrusion and a moderate earthquake during volcanic unrest.",

            "abstract": "In Turkey the experience and data required for a hydrological model setup is limited and very often not available. Moreover there are many ungauged catchments where there are also many planned projects aimed at utilization of water resources including development of existing hydropower potential. This situation makes runoff prediction at locations with lack of data and ungauged locations where small hydropower plants, reservoirs, etc. are planned an increasingly significant challenge and concern in the country. Flow duration curves have many practical applications in hydrology and integrated water resources management. Estimation of flood duration curve (FDC) at ungauged locations is essential, particularly for hydropower feasibility studies and selection of the installed capacities. In this study, we test and compare the performances of two methods for estimating FDCs in the Western Black Sea catchment, Turkey: (i) FDC based on Map Correlation Method (MCM) flow estimates. MCM is a recently proposed method (Archfield and Vogel, 2010) which uses geospatial information to estimate flow. Flow measurements of stream gauging stations nearby the ungauged location are the only data requirement for this method. This fact makes MCM very attractive for flow estimation in Turkey, (ii) Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is a data-driven method which is used to relate FDC to a number of variables representing catchment and climate characteristics. However, it`s ease of implementation makes it very useful for practical purposes. Both methods use easily collectable data and are computationally efficient. Comparison of the results is realized based on two different measures: the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) value.\nRef: Archfield, S. A., and R. M.

            "abstract": "Most natural samples originating from the mantle contain traces of water. It can be observed that water content varies laterally as a function of the geodynamic context, but also with depth in cratons. Basalts from mid-ocean ridges, which sample the convecting upper mantle, contain generally below 0.6 wt% H2O leading to 50-330 parts per million by weight in the source. Oceanic Islands Basalts are more hydrated with contents ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 wt%, leading to 350-1100 ppm wt H2O in the source. Arc basalts are even more hydrated with water contents ranging from 0.2 to 5-6 wt% H2O testifying of the recycling of water by subduction. Kimberlite magmas are also the proof that local saturation in volatiles is possible.\nAmong xenoliths, the samples from cratons are very interesting because they may provide a depth profile of water. However, the variation of water content in olivine with depth differs from craton to craton, and is the result of a complex geological history. Also, olivine inclusions in diamond and olivine from peridotite xenoliths do not give the same message regarding to water activity.\nThe water storage capacity of the mantle is defined as the maximum water or hydroxyl that can be incorporated in its constitutive minerals before a free fluid phase appears. It can be determined experimentally and confronted to geophysical observations, such as low seismic velocities, and electrical conductivity. In this talk we will review our current knowledge of water incorporation in NAMs as determined experimentally and compare it with available observations. New data concerning clinopyroxenes will be shown. The aim being to understand the deep water cycle.",

Here, we develop a simple physics-based model of vertical CO2 transport within the vadose zone of a karst or fissured aquifer. Dimensional analysis of this model suggests that advective processes frequently dominate, effectively controlling the vertical distribution of CO2 concentrations in a variety of common settings. Buoyantly driven flow of gases through open fractures and vertical film flow of water are both important advective processes. We also consider the presence of a soil cover and its potential control on buoyant flow of gases. Ultimately, advective processes influence the distribution of chemical weathering within the vadose zone and may play an important role in the rates and patterns of further karst flow path development. Consequently, models of Critical Zone dynamics within karst and fissured aquifers need to consider the function of such advective processes and their influence on weathering patterns and resulting aquifer and landscape evolution.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has experienced an increase of surface meltwater production over the last decades, with the latest record set in the summer of 2012. For current and future ice sheet mass balance assessments, it is important to quantify what part of this meltwater reaches the ocean and contributes to sea level change. Meltwater produced at the surface has several options: it can infiltrate the local firn pack, where it is either stored temporarily or refrozen, or it can run off along the surface or via en-glacial drainage systems. In this study, we focus on the first; more specifically, in which manner meltwater percolates the firn column. Over the past years, GrIS research has shown that meltwater does not infiltrate the firn pack homogeneously (i.e. matrix flow), but that inhomogeneities in horizontal firn layers causes preferential flow paths for meltwater (i.e. piping). Although this process has been observed and studied on a few isolated sites, it has never been examined on the entire GrIS. To do so, we use the firn model IMAU-FDM with new parameterizations for preferential flow, impermeable ice lenses and sub-surface runoff. At the surface, IMAU-FDM is forced with realistic climate data from the regional climate model RACMO2.3. The model results are evaluated with temperatures and density measurements from firn cores across the GrIS. By allowing for heterogeneous meltwater percolation, the model is able to store heat and mass much deeper in the firn column. This is, however, in part counteracted by the inclusion of impermeability of ice lenses, which causes part of the meltwater to run off horizontally.",

            "abstract": "Sunspots represent the Sun’s magnetic activity which flips ~11 years. It is known that different solar activity indices are not symmetric between northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun and a phase lag exists which varies from cycle to cycle. The north-south asymmetry of the sunspot activity provides an important clue to understanding the solar dynamo action, especially with regard to the modern non-linear dynamo models. In this paper, we make a systematic analysis to investigate the phase lag between northern and southern hemispheric sunspot activity. The dominant hemisphere in each cycle from 21 to first 6 years of the current cycle 24 has been identified by calculating the statistical probability of hemispheric distribution of sunspot areas. The trend analysis have shown a southern hemisphere dominancy during cycles 21 and 23; whereas northern hemisphere dominates during cycles 22 and in the ascending phase of cycle 24.A detailed cross-correlative analysis has shown that during cycles 21 and 22 southern hemisphere was leading , but the reverse happened during solar cycles 23 and 24. We also investigate the periodic behavior of north-south asymmetry data of sunspot activity for solar cycles 21 -24. Power spectrum analysis exhibits a number of mid and long-term quasi-periodicities including well known Rieger type, annual and quasi biennial(QBO) periods and most of them are found to be time variable. Further, we have made a detailed study about the asymmetric nature and periodicities during prolonged minima of cycles 23/24. We discuss the possible explanations with the help of previous results, zonal flows, magnetic flux emergence and r-mode oscillations occurred inside the Sun.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming in arctic tundra has been associated with increased plant productivity and a shift in plant community composition, specifically an increase in shrub cover, which can impact soil organic matter through changes in the size and composition of the leaf litter pool. Shifts in litter quantity and quality will in turn interact with changes in the soil environment as the climate continues to warm. We examined the effects of permafrost thaw, soil moisture changes, and plant community composition on leaf litter decomposition in an upland tundra ecosystem in Interior Alaska. We present warming and drying effects on decomposition rates of graminoid-dominated and shrub-dominated leaf litter mixtures over three years (2 cm depth), and annual decomposition of a common cellulose substrate (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) over five years at a permafrost thaw and soil drying experiment. We expected that warming and drying would increase decomposition, and that decomposition would be greater in the shrub litter than in the graminoid litter mix. Decomposition of Betula nana, the dominant shrub, was 50% greater in the shrub-dominated litter mix compared to the graminoid-dominated litter. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in total litter mass loss between graminoid and shrub litter mixtures, despite significant differences in decomposition rates of the dominant plant species when decomposed alone and in community mixtures. Drying decreased decomposition of B. nana and of the shrub community litter overall, but after two years there was no detected warming effect on shrub-community decomposition. In contrast to leaf litter decomposition, both warming and drying increased decomposition of the common substrate. Warming caused an almost twofold increase in cellulose decomposition in surface soil (0-10cm), and drying caused a twofold increase in cellulose decomposition from deeper organic layer soils (10-20cm). These results demonstrate the importance of interactions among temperature, moisture and vegetation changes on organic matter decomposition, and the potential for increased plant productivity and vegetation changes to alter the size and composition of the soil organic matter pool.",

            "abstract": "The GPS/acoustic sea-floor crustal deformation measurement system has developed as a useful tool to observe tectonic deformation especially at subduction zones. One of the factors preventing accurate GPS/acoustic sea-floor crustal deformation measurement is horizontal heterogeneity of sound speed in the ocean. It is therefore necessary to measure the gradient directly from sound speed structure. We report results of high-frequency CTD measurements using Underway CTD (UCTD) in the Kuroshio region.\nWe perform the UCTD measurements on May 2nd, 2015 at two stations (TCA and TOA) above the sea-floor benchmarks installed across the Nankai Trough, off the south-east of Kii Peninsula, middle Japan. The number of measurement points is six at each station along circles with a diameter of 1.8 nautical miles around the sea-floor benchmark. The stations TCA and TOA are located on the edge and the interior of the Kuroshio current, respectively, judging from difference in sea water density measured at the two stations, as well as a satellite image of sea-surface temperature distribution.\nWe detect a sound speed gradient of high speeds in the southern part and low speeds in the northern part at the two stations. At the TCA station, the gradient is noticeable down to 300 m in depth; the maximum difference in sound speed is +/- 5 m/s. The sound speed difference is as small as +/- 1.3 m/s at depths below 300 m, which causes seafloor benchmark positioning error as large as 1 m. At the TOA station, the gradient is extremely small down to 100 m in depth. The maximum difference in sound speed is less than +/- 0.3 m/s that is negligible small for seafloor benchmark positioning error. Clear gradient of high speed is observed to the depths; the maximum difference in sound speed is +/- 0.8-0.9 m/s, causing seafloor benchmark positioning error of several tens centimeters.\nThe UCTD measurement is effective tool to detect sound speed gradient. We establish a method for accurate sea-floor crustal deformation measurement using data of high-frequency CTD measurements.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “Enhancement of societal resiliency against natural disasters” (Funding agency: JST).",

It is assumed that the substances investigate are with respect to these measurements isotropic and single measurement of one sample is sufficient for interpretation. This assumption is valid for powdered samples, but solid rock samples in general behave anisotropically. In our contribution we report on magnetic measurements of hematite ore samples deformed in torsion, which show significant anisotropy of shape of hysteresis loops and IRM acquisition curves; the degree of anisotropy reflecting the degree of deformation. Samples, measured in different directions, showed different shape of hysteresis loop, from regular, which may be interpreted either as randomly oriented multi-domain grains, or with different degree of distortion (wasp-waistedness), reflecting different distribution of contrasting coercivities. Also decomposition of IRM acquisition curves, measured in different direction, yielded different interpretation in terms of relative contributions of components with different coercivities. We interpret this anisotropy as result of deformation, causing preferred orientation of basal planes of hematite. Moreover, the anisotropy is asymmetric. Our results suggest that, at least in deformed rocks containing minerals with high shape and/or magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the effect of anisotropy should be considered and verified before induced and remanent magnetization measurements are interpreted.",

To provide a quantitative research method for the loss evaluation of crops due to typhoon disaster，we first revised two vulnerability curves for crops under comprehensive intensity of typhoon based on the simulated hazard data and loss data related to historical typhoon events landing on China from 1949 to 2014；and then established a storm surge vulnerability matrix of crops，regarding Zhanjiang City of Guangdong Province as the study area ; finally, we put forward three storm surge fragility curves for crops representing different states of loss.

            "abstract": "This work aims to study the co-evolution of the flooding risk and land use to better understand how, through land use patterns, human societies have adapted to their environment or influenced it. A rereading of the coevolution of floods and society is important to understand both the nature and society and question the issue of land use and human activities in flood areas. River morphology evolution and extreme events occurrence during the last 200 years have been analyzed focusing on the influence of anthropic constructions during the same period of time. We have used these data sets to discuss the co-evolution of nature and societies. The Rhone valley has been significantly constructed (dam, embankment, nuclear power station). These constructions have been built since 1850-1860 in relation with the economic development but also after the decision to better control flooding events which have been taken after the 1856 floods.\nIf the first traces of civilization, especially in the Rhone Valley, show that man has established safe from floods - on the high altitude points, for example - several factors (hydrological period of calm, high population and economic activities growth...) led them to develop their cities and activities in areas submitted to flood risks. If the urbanization of flooding areas has happened and continues to happen, that is mean that some factors have a more decisive influence on the choice of location than the risk presence. Why and when the human has been installed in areas liable to natural hazards? The idea is to identify these factors and prioritize them. In other cases, some major flood could permanently change the human implantation strategies on its territory: according to the impact of floods and the human risk perception, some communities have chosen to leave the risk areas or to change their land uses (agriculture / housing). This study aims to clarify these choices and understand their construction.",

            "abstract": "A Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model for the Thur basin (1703 km2, situated in Switzerland) was set-up and run with four different spatial resolutions (1x1 km, 5x5 km, 10x10 km, lumped) and evaluated at an hourly, daily, and monthly time step. We used the novel Hierarchical Latin Hypercube Sample (HLHS) methodology (Vorechovsky, 2014) to efficiently sample the most sensitive parameters of the VIC model. The model was run 3150 times with the HLHS and the best 10% of the runs based on the NSE(Q) and NSE(logQ) was selected as behavioral and used for further analysis. This whole exercise was conducted both with homogeneously applied forcing (equal precipitation over the whole catchment) and with distributed forcing (specific for each grid cell). We ran the model for the period August 2002 to August 2003. This period is characterised by three very high peaks (August, September 2002) and the 2003 heatwave and associated drought (June, July, August 2003). The 2002 peaks are the highest measured in the past 39 years (1974-2012) at the outlet of the Thur. The peaks were caused by a larger weather system that also caused the heavy floods in the Elbe and the Danube. In contrast, the 2003 summer was extremely warm and dry in Western and Central Europe, with Switzerland being among the hottest and driest regions. For each of the four spatial resolutions we selected the behavioral sets. A large overlap in behavioral sets implies that the model is not very sensitive to spatial resolution. The model was shown not to be very sensitive to spatial resolution if the forcing was applied homogeneously over the catchment, i.e. there was a large overlap in behavioral sets. The model became slightly more sensitive to spatial resolution if the forcing was applied in a distributed fashion. Both for the distributed and for the homogeneously applied forcing the model was shown to be highly sensitive to the temporal resolution, but the sensitivity for temporal resolution decreased with heterogeneous forcing. In this case study it was shown that the VIC model is more sensitive to temporal resolution than to spatial resolution. When the forcing is applied homogeneously over the catchment, this signal is strengthened (even more sensitive to temporal resolution, even less sensitive to spatial resolution), while distributed forcing slightly weakens this signal.",

            "abstract": "One of the most expensive natural disasters in Switzerland consists in floods related to heavy precipitation. The occurrence of heavy rainfall may induce landslides and debris flows, as observed during three major precipitation events that occurred recently in the Swiss Alps (August 1987, September 1993 and October 2000). Even though all these events took place under a southerly circulation, especially in autumn, not all southerly circulations lead to heavy precipitation. Although many studies tried to understand them, they are still difficult to forecast. Therefore, this work aims to identify synoptic precursors to such events throughout backward trajectories analysis.\nPart one tests as many combinations of tools, datasets and methods as possible in order to compare the trajectories in the case of heavy precipitations in the Alps and to reduce the number of models to be assessed for the second part by selecting the most relevant. As a result, we removed models yielding to similar results by using an absolute horizontal transport deviation measure (ATEH). The trajectories were processed with tools (HYSPLIT, a Matlab script developed at the University of Lausanne, and METEX) based on different Reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR, ECMWF, Japanese and NASA). Moreover, different types of trajectories (3D, isobaric, isentropic, isosigma, and constant density) have been used. As a result, 21 trajectory models were compared, and 9 were selected. Results show that most of the differences between trajectories are mainly related to the dataset rather than to the model.\nIn part two, the 9 selected models were used to search precursors leading to heavy precipitations. 10-days backward trajectories were processed for the Binn station at different pressure levels, for all the days between 1961 and 2014 characterized by a southerly circulation in autumn. Based on these trajectories, two analysis for the identification of precursors were conducted. First, the ATEH was used to assess similarities between extreme events and non-extreme events. Results show that trajectories leading to heavy precipitation tend to be more similar than trajectories leading to non-rainy days. Finally, further analysis showed that trajectories run at 700 hPa for a short duration (up to 3 days) are the most relevant for precipitation analysis.",

This imbalance, largely caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, has engendered a multi-decade increase in stored thermal energy within the Earth system, manifest principally as an increase in ocean heat content. Consequently, in order to quantify the rate of global warming, it is necessary to measure the rate of increase of ocean heat content. The historical record of ocean heat content is extracted from a history of various devices and spatial/temporal coverage across the globe. One of the most important historical devices is the eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) which has been used for decades to measure ocean temperatures to depths of 700m and deeper. Here, recent progress in improving the XBT record of upper ocean heat content is described including corrections to systematic biases, filling in spatial gaps where data does not exist, and the selection of a proper climatology. In addition, comparisons of the revised historical record and CMIP5 climate models are made. It is seen that there is very good agreement between the models and measurements, with the models slightly under-predicting the increase of ocean heat content in the upper water layers over the past 45 years.",

During this time period, the 18 April Papanoa earthquake (Mw7.2) occurred on the western limit of the Guerrero gap.\nWe invert the continuous GPS time series using the PCAIM (Principal Component Analysis Inversion Method) to assess the space and time evolution of slip on the subduction. To focus on the aseismic processes, we correct the cGPS time series from the co-seismic offsets. Our results show that the slow slip event initiated in the Guerrero gap region, as already observed during the previous SSEs. The Mw7.2 Papanoa earthquake occurred on the western limit of the region that was slipping aseismically before the earthquake. After the Papanoa earthquake, the aseismic slip rate increases. This geodetic signal consists of both the ongoing SSE and the postseismic (afterslip) response due to the Papanoa earthquake. The majority of the post-earthquake aseismic slip is concentrated downdip from the main earthquake asperity, but significant slip is also observed in the Guerrero gap region.\nCompared to previous SSEs in that region, the 2014 SSE produced a larger aseismic slip and the maximum slip is located downdip from the main brittle asperity corresponding to the Papanoa earthquake, a region that was not identified as active during the previous SSEs. Since the Mw 7.2 Papanoa earthquake occurred about 2 months after the onset of the SSE, it is likely that the nucleation of this seismic event has been for the least accelerated, if not triggered, by the 2014 SSE. In return, the co- and postseismic slip of this earthquake has significantly modified the characteristics of the ongoing SSE. Those results suggest complex interactions between the 2014 SSE and the Papanoa earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The Alborz mountain range, located south of the Caspian Sea, accommodates 30% of the 25 mm/yr convergence between Arabia and Eurasia. The resulting shortening and left lateral motion is distributed over several active fault zones within the Central Alborz. Despite earlier efforts using only GPS data, little is known about the long term rate of vertical deformation and aseismic slip. Several historical earthquakes have affected this region, some of the largest of these events occurred on the Mosha fault which is close to the capital city, Tehran, which has a population of over eight million. Thus, constraining the interseismic slip rates in this region is particularly important. In this study we complement existing horizontal velocities from a regional GPS network, with line of sight velocities from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), to provide additional constraints on the vertical deformation and enhance the spatial coverage. Assuming a seismogenic depth of 30 km, based on microseismicity data, we solve for the geometry and long term slip rates on four major fault strands in this region. We obtain a long term slip rate of ~ 3 mm/yr for the Mosha and North Alborz faults, and ~ 10 mm/yr for the Khazar fault and Parchin faults. These rates and fault geometries are in agreement with earlier works, and fit the GPS data well. However, close to the fault traces there are large residuals in the InSAR data, suggesting that there is shallow creep (< 30 km). Therefore, we carry out a subsequent inversion using only the residual InSAR displacements to solve for the distribution of creep within the seismogenic zones on these faults. We find that the Mosha and North Alborz faults remain locked between 0 – 30 km depth, whilst the Parchin and Khazar faults are creeping. This new observation of fault creep has direct implications for the seismic hazard in the region. On the Mosha fault we estimate a slip deficit equivalent to a Mw 7.0 event. The combination of InSAR and GPS provide vital information for assessing the interseismic deformation in the Central Alborz, and these results highlight the importance of closer monitoring of this region to better understand the seismic hazard.",

            "abstract": "In geophysics numerical simulations are a key tool to understand the processes of earth. For example, global simulations of seismic waves excited by earthquakes are essential to infer the velocity structure within the earth. Furthermore, numerical investigations can be helpful on local scales in order to find and characterize oil and gas reservoirs. Moreover, simulations enable a better understanding of wave propagation in borehole and tunnel seismic applications. Even on microscopic scales, numerical simulations of elastic waves can help to increase knowledge about the behaviour of materials, e.g. to understand the mechanism of crack propagation in rocks. To deal with highly complex heterogeneous models, here the Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Method (NDG) is used to calculate synthetic seismograms. The advantage of this method is that complex mesh geometries can be computed by using triangular or tetrahedral elements for domain discretization together with a high order spatial approximation of the wave field. The simulation tool NEXD is presented which has the capability of simulating elastic and anelastic wave fields for seismic experiments for one-, two- and three- dimensional settings. The implementation of poroelasticity and simulation of slip interfaces are currently in progress and are working for the one dimensional part. External models provided by e.g. Trelis/Cubit can be used for parallelized computations on triangular or tetrahedral meshes. For absorbing boundary conditions either a fluxes based approach or a Nearly Perfectly Matched Layer (NPML) can be used. Examples are presented to validate the method and to show the capability of the software for complex models such as the simulation of a tunnel seismic experiment.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical studies of submarine magmatic features have identified diversity in their crustal and upper mantle structure resulting in two end-members: the first showing magmatic underplating of high density material at the pre-existing Moho; the second characterised by less dense material being vertically intruded to shallow depths. The age of the underlying seafloor at the time of emplacement is thought to control the internal structure, as the vulnerability of the crust to magmatism may depend on thickness and temperature. The Louisville Ridge Seamount Chain (LRSC) intersects the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone at ~26˚S. At this point the LRSC is located proximal to an extinct oceanic spreading center, with the underlying seafloor suggested to be ~10 Ma older than the seamounts.\nMultichannel seismic (MCS) reflection and wide-angle (WA) refraction data were acquired along a series of profiles over the LRSC. The bathymetry makes seismic phase identification challenging due to a high degree of lateral variability and scattering. A forward ray-tracing approach, permitting testing of phase identifications, is applied to the refracted first arrivals to develop a crustal and upper mantle velocity model. Constraint on the positioning of upper crustal layers is provided by comparison of model boundaries with reflectors in the MCS data, and identification and modeling of secondary phases, e.g. Moho reflections.\nWe present velocity models used to establish the nature of the crustal and sub-crustal dynamic support of the LRSC, and whether it displays any along-ridge variation. Profiles acquired perpendicular to the LRSC enable us to investigate the three-dimensionality of structures. In particular, we seek to determine whether the seamount interior structure and 3-D geometry of the crust-mantle interface provide any insight into the controls on the emplacement of the LRSC, and how this fits within the range that has been suggested by studies at other seamount chains.",

            "abstract": "The Black Sea is a large intercontinental back-arc basin with relatively high sedimentation rate. The basin was formed as two different sub-basins divided by Mid-Black Sea Ridge. The ridge is completely buried today and the Black Sea became a single basin in the early Miocene that is currently anoxic. Recent acoustic investigations in the Black Sea indicate potential for gas hydrate formation and gas venting.\nA total of 2500 km multichannel seismic, Chirp sub-bottom profiler and multibeam bathymetry data were collected during three different expeditions in 2010 and 2012 along the southwestern margin of the Black Sea. Box core sediment samples were collected for gas cromatography analysis. Wide spread BSRs and multiple BSRs are observed in the seismic profiles and may be categorized into two different types: cross-cutting BSRs (transecting sedimentary strata) and amplitude BSRs (enhanced reflections). Both types mimic the seabed reflection with polarity reversal. Some undulations of the BSR are observed along seismic profiles probably caused by local pressure and/or temperature changes. Shallow gas sources and chimney vents are clearly indicated by bright reflection anomalies in the seismic data. Gas cromatography results indicate the presence of methane and various components of heavy hydrocarbons, including Hexane. These observations suggest that the gas forming hydrate in the southwestern Black Sea may originate from deeper thermogenic hydrocarbon sources.\n* This study is supported by 2214-A programme of The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK).",

Radiocarbon dates on mollusks and benthic foraminifera indicate that sediments were deposited during the late deglacial from at least 13 ka to about 10 ka. The dominant foraminiferal species include Buccella frigida, Cassidulina reniforme, Elphidium spp., and Islandiella teretis; ostracodes include Acanthocythereis dunelmensis, Cytheromorpha macchesneyi, Sarsicytheridea punctillata and Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata. These species generally represent shallow, inner continental shelf environments signifying deposition during the last deglacial sea-level rise. The relatively sparse occurrence of planktic foraminifera (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma] supports the interpretation of a shallow water environment. Changes in microfaunal assemblages and associated patterns in sediment physical properties will be discussed in terms of rates of deglacial regional sea-level rise during the Younger Dryas climate reversal and the early Holocene [Preboreal] period.

            "abstract": "We present a new set of functions, Vector Cartesian Harmonics (VCH), analogous to the Vector Spherical Harmonics that we have applied recently to global models of crustal and lithospheric magnetisation. Like their spherical counterpart, the VCH form a complete, orthogonal set: planar models of magnetisation can be expanded in them. There are 3 distinct types of VCH, one representing that part of the magnetisation which generates the potential magnetic field above the surface, another the potential magnetic field below the surface, and a toroidal function that generates only a non-potential field. One function therefore describes the magnetisation detected by observations of the magnetic anomaly while the other two describe the null space of an inversion of magnetic observations for magnetisation. The formalism is therefore ideal for analysing the results of inversions for magnetic structures in plane layers such as local or regional surveys where Earth’s curvature can be ignored.\nThe null space is in general very large, being an arbitrary combination of a doubly-infinite set of vector functions. However, in the absence of remanence and when the inducing field is uniform the null space reduces to only 2 types of structure, uniform susceptibility (Runcorn’s Theorem) and a pattern of susceptibility induced by a uniform field, the null space is restricted to uniform magnetisation and 1D patterns of susceptibility aligned with a horizontal inducing field. Both these cases are already well known, but this analysis shows them to be the ONLY members of the null space. We also give results for familiar text-book structures to show the nature of the null space in each case. Curiously, inversion of the magnetic field from a buried dipole returns exactly half the correct magnitude plus a spurious distributed magnetisation. A more complex application is the topographic structure based on the Bishop formation in California (Fairhead and Williams, SEG exp. abstr. 25, 845, 2006).\nThe functions involve standard Fourier transfoms and exponential functions and is easily implemented in Python or commercial packages such as Geosoft.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is one of the most rapidly changing regions on earth, but limited detailed information is available about AP climate due to a lack of observational data. Here, we present a high-resolution (5.5 km) estimate of the surface mass balance (SMB) for the AP, from 1979 to 2014, calculated by the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2.3, that is specifically adapted for use over the polar regions. Next to this, a firn densification model is used to calculate the processes in the snowpack, such as firn compaction and meltwater percolation, refreezing, and runoff. A comparison with the few available in-situ observations shows that the AP SMB is well modeled, but that discrepancies remain that are mainly related to the highly variable AP topography compared to the model resolution.\nIntegrated over an ice sheet area of 4.1 105 km2, the climatological (1979-2014) SMB of the AP amounts to 351 Gt y-1 (with interannual variability = 58 Gt y-1), which mostly consists of snowfall (363 ± 56 Gt y-1). The other SMB components, sublimation, drifting snow erosion and meltwater runoff, are small (11, 0.5 and 4 Gt y-1, respectively).\nThe AP mountains act as an important climate barrier, leading to distinct differences between the climate of the western AP (WAP) and the eastern AP (EAP). For instance, 77% of all AP snowfall falls over the WAP, where strong orographic forcing leads to snowfall rates >4 m w.e. y-1 on the northwestern slopes, while snowfall rates are <400 mm w.e. y-1 over the EAP ice shelves. These results, and further investigations of this sharp west-to-east climate distinction, clearly highlight the different forcing mechanisms of the SMB over the WAP and the EAP: over the WAP most snowfall is orographically induced, while over the EAP it is generated by depressions over the Weddell Sea. Furthermore, no significant trends are found in any of the SMB components, except for a slight decrease in snowmelt.",

The DFDP-2B borehole, drilled in late 2014, reached a depth of 893 m (measured depth) and provides an opportunity to describe the protolith and structure of ductilely deformed schists in the hangingwall of this active fault. A total of 19 km of wireline logging data were acquired in the borehole, including 4.8 km of borehole televiewer (BHTV) acoustic image logs. The high resolution of the BHTV logs and the borehole’s inclination, which reached a maximum of 46° from vertical near the base of the hole, provide good conditions in which to intersect the predominant foliation, which dips SE at a high angle to the hole as well as other feature sets. Here, we present a detailed structural analysis and lithological interpretation of the BHTV logs from the 264–886 m interval. The borehole’s inclination and the attenuation caused by the drilling mud reduces the image quality in places. However, some zones of poor image quality also concur with indications of permeable fractures and are related to fractured zones with localized borehole wall damage.\nFoliation can be regularly identified to a depth of 808 m (n=406). The mean orientation of foliation planes (dip of 57° towards 145) remains quite consistent throughout the drilled interval and is similar to that inferred for the structurally underlying Alpine Fault. Larger-scale changes in image amplitude suggest lithological or petrophysical variations not yet identified on cuttings. The majority of the 1650 planar features identified as fractures are subparallel to the foliation and may represent deformed veins or other mineral segregations that contribute to the foliation's internal structure. Other planar features have dominantly NW–SE strikes, approximately orthogonal to the foliation and are inferred to be fractures. Truncations or offsets are observed on ~20 features suggesting faulting or relative chronology between features.",

            "abstract": "Pacific oceanic lithosphere has been subducting along the Tonga-Kermadec Trench for at least 28 Myr. Variations in the sediment thickness, subduction angle and roughness of the subducting plate over this time have controlled deformation along the forearc. This constant process of forearc evolution has been punctuated since at least 7 Ma by the subduction of seamounts, as the trench-oblique Louisville Seamount Chain (LSC) migrates southward along the trench. The subduction of these seamounts is associated with accelerated tectonic erosion, the tilting of sedimentary units and 80 km of forearc shortening north of the present-day collision zone at 26°S. South of this collision zone, the overriding and subducting plates exhibit structures expected of normal Pacific plate subduction.\nIn 2011, a series of integrated geophysical profiles were acquired to image the crustal and upper mantle structure along the Tonga-Kermadec subduction system and LSC, with the aim of: a) establishing the nature of major structural variations along the forearc; b) resolving the flexural state of the overriding and underthrusting plates in regions of normal subduction and at the point of LSC-collision; and from these c) determining the primary influences on the flexural behaviour and nature of deformation in the underthrusting and overriding plates along the Tonga-Kermadec subduction system.\nFrom the 2011 acquisition, we present multichannel reflection and wide-angle refraction seismic data that reveal the dominant structural differences between the Kermadec forearc and the raised Tonga Platform. Superimposed on these are structures associated with differing modes and extents of tectonic deformation that have occurred more recently along the margin. Most notably, the increased crustal strength around the seamounts results in an ~2 km shallowing of the trench and the development of an ~100 km-wide complex network of faulting on the overriding plate in the area of seamount collision.",

            "abstract": "A fracture can be seen as a void space between two rough surfaces in partial contact. Transmissivity and conductivity can be determined numerically by solving the Stokes and Laplace equations between these two surfaces. These problems were first solved and published by the same authors between 1995 and 2001. Updated, more complete and precise results are presented here.\nEach surface of a fracture can be schematized as a random surface oscillating around an average plane, characterized by the probability density and autocorrelation function C(u) of the heights; their standard deviation is the roughness sigma. The two surfaces are separated by a mean distance b_m and their heights are correlated with an intercorrelation coefficient theta. The two major classes for C(u), namely the Gaussian and the self-affine autocorrelations with Hurst exponent H, are both characterized by a length scale l_c, which is a typical scale for the surface features in the Gaussian case and a cut-off length in the self-affine case. Gaussian surfaces are statistically homogeneous while the mean properties in the self-affine case are size-dependent.\nSystematic calculations were performed for these two classes, with recent emphasis put on the Gaussian fractures. The results are modeled as functions of b_m/sigma, l_c/sigma and theta. Cubic law applies for large b_m/sigma in terms of the aperture reduced by the hydraulic thickness of the surface rugosity. Another cubic law applies in the opposite limit of tight fractures with an offset depending on theta and a prefactor which depends on theta and l_c. A transition takes place between these two regimes. It is also shown that the Reynolds approximation may overestimate the true transmissivity by almost an order of magnitude. Similar calculations were performed for conductivity. The whole work is summarized by a series of master curves and models which can be used to estimate the properties of real fractures.",

            "abstract": "Kuju volcano is an active volcano located on the volcanic front on Kyushu Island and also in the Beppu-Shimabara Graben. It consists of small stratovolcanoes and lava domes, and the volcanic edifices are surrounded by gently sloping skirts composed of pyroclastic flow, debris avalanche and debris flow deposits.\nIn order to reconstruct the evolutional history of Kuju volcano under the geological mapping project (Kawanabe et al., 2015), we measured unspiked K-Ar ages for 10 lava samples from 7 volcanic units. Unspiked K-Ar dating procedure enables the correction for mass fractionated initial 40Ar/36Ar ratios, and has been successfully applied to young volcanic samples, especially younger than 0.5 Ma. The ages obtained were evaluated by the fraction of non-radiogenic 40Ar, the volume of 36Ar, and in comparison with already reported conventional K-Ar, TL, FT and 14C ages.\nBased on the ages and stratigraphic relationships, the volcanic stages of Kuju volcano can be reconstructed as follows; Stage I: small andesitic edifices were formed in the western and central part during ca. 200-90 ka. Unspiked K-Ar ages show that some edifices were simultaneously formed around ca. 150 ka (Kutsukakesan volcano and Iozan lava) and ca. 90 ka (Kuroiwasan volcano and Narukoyama volcano). Stage II: the largest eruption in the volcano associate with the Handa pyroclastic flow was occurred (ca. 54 ka; 14C age, Okuno et al., 2013). Stage III: several dacitic lava domes and andesitic lava flows were formed in the central part during ca. 54-15 ka. Unspiked K-Ar age data for Nakadake volcano (46 ± 12 ka) and Ogigahana volcano (34 ± 3 ka) are agree well with stratigraphic relationships. During the stage III, large debris avalanche deposit formed within the evolutional process of the north-central region. Stage IV: the latest stage started with mafic magma in the eastern part (<15 ka; Kawanabe et al.,2015).",

            "abstract": "For common crustal structures and melt compositions, basalts are buoyant in the lower crust and negatively buoyant in the upper crust. Intrusion and storage can occur at a depth or an interface where the density of magma becomes larger than that of the overlying rocks. After emplacement, magma density typically increases due to the formation of dense minerals. Fully solidified mafic bodies have bulk densities between 3000-3100 kg m$^{-3}$ which are much higher than those of the continental rocks they intruded. This negative density contrast is much stronger than the positive one that drove magma ascent. We investigate the dynamical consequences of this marked buoyancy reversal using 3D laboratory experiments on viscous fluids and 2D numerical calculations with complex crustal rheologies. Material is emplaced at a density interface, such that its density is between those of the upper and lower layers. Its bulk density increases as temperature decreases and eventually exceeds that of the lower layer. We observe that the intrusion tends to spread laterally in an initial phase and to sag, and in some cases sink, in a later phase when its density exceeds that of the host. We identified two distinct instability modes. One consists of a single diapiric-like sinker and the other takes the form of spectacular nearly axisymmetric Rayleigh-Taylor-type downwellings. An intermediate mode consists of several long wavelength blobs which disrupt the initial symmetrical arrangement. The transition between the two modes is mainly determined by the aspect ratio of the intrusion at the onset of instability. Sagging can lead to full-fledged sinking to the base of the crust depending mainly on the temperature of country rocks. This proceeds over timescales that are relevant for true magmatic systems (in a range of a few kyr to a few Myr). At shallow crustal depths, cold temperatures and stiff country rocks are able to withstand the load of a large and dense intrusion. Significant post-emplacement deformation and sagging can occur, however, if the intrusion is due to repeated injections over a long time interval. These findings are discussed with reference to a few large igneous complexes for which extensive petrological, geophysical and geochemical data are available, with a focus on their shapes and density relationships with surrounding rocks.",

            "abstract": "A physically-based frozen soil model was developed based on the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological model (WEB-DHM) for the simulation of water and energy transfer in cold regions. In order to simulate the soil freezing/thawing processes stably and efficiently, a two-step algorithm is applied to solve the non-linear energy governing equations: 1) the thermal diffusion equation is used to simulate the heat fluxes between soil layers without considering liquid-ice phase change; 2) a freezing/thawing scheme is used to derive soil temperature, liquid water content and ice content from enthalpy conservation, mass conservation, and freezing point depression equations. In the algorithm, a parameterization set is adopted to update hydraulic and thermal properties by considering the presence of ice and low soil temperatures. The performance of the frozen soil model was validated at point scale in a typical mountainous permafrost region of Binggou Watershed, Heihe Basin, Northwest China. Results show that the model can achieve a convergent solution at a typical time step (hourly) and layer sizes (centimeters) of current land process models. It is able to reproduce the observed soil freezing/thawing processes and hydrological processes. The simulated profiles of soil temperature, liquid water content, ice content and thawing front depth are in good agreement with the observations and the characteristics of permafrost. The freeze-thaw cycle in frozen soil evolution was continuously represented by the contour map of soil temperature and ice content of all soil layers. Therefore, this model can be coupled with hydrological, ecological and climate models to deepen our physical understanding in permafrost regions.",

            "abstract": "The long-range transport of dust and anthropogenic aerosols to the Western US has received considerable attention due to the growing disparity between North American and Asian air quality. Using MODIS and space-borne LIDAR measurements some have argued that the transcontinental transport of dust from Asia, Africa, and Europe outweighs that of locally produced combustion aerosols (Yu et al. 2012). This study seeks to compare the aerosol composition, number, and size distribution of locally derived submicron aerosols (including particle nucleation events) vs. long-range transported aerosols observed at a remote mountain site near the Pacific Coast. Toward this aim, rotating drum impactor (RDI) and scanning mobility particle size (SMPS) measurements of size-segregated elemental compositions and size spectra were collected from February to November of 2012 at Chews Ridge (elevation 1450 m) in Monterey County, California. This mountaintop site experiences two main wind modes. The main mode is ohshore-directed winds from the southwest, which are most likely to bring trans-Pacific aerosols to the site; and offshore-directed, northeasterly winds that bring continental aerosols to the site from the interior of California. Elemental ratios (normalized to Al), matrix factorization, and a k-cluster analysis of these data suggest distinct crustal, combustion, and marine sources with considerable seasonal as well as short-term variability. HYSPLIT model back trajectories support the hypothesized sources of these submicron aerosols. Locally, SMPS data reveal consistent nucleation bursts and subsequent growth in the 20-60 nm range during the afternoons. A distinct but weaker diel cycle was observed in the 70 – 100 nm range, corresponding to the smallest RDI impactor stage. Finally, the Pb isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb) of aerosol samples from selected dates will be measured by MC-ICPMS to further identify aerosol origins (e.g. Ewing et al. 2010).",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather events such as cold air outbreaks (CAOs) pose great threats to human life and socioeconomic well-being of the modern society. In the past, our capability to predict their occurrences is constrained by the 2-week predictability limit for weather. We demonstrate here for the first time that a rapid increase of air mass transported into the polar stratosphere, referred to as “the pulse of the stratosphere (PULSE)”, can be predicted with a useful skill 4–6 weeks in advance by operational forecast models. We further show that the probability of the occurrence of continental-scale CAOs in mid-latitudes increases substantially above the normal condition within a short time period from one week before to 1-2 weeks after the peak day of a PULSE event. In particular, we reveal that the three massive CAOs over North America in January and February of 2014 were preceded by three episodes of extreme mass transport into the polar stratosphere with peak intensities reaching a trillion tons per day, twice of that on an average winter day. Therefore, our capability to predict the PULSEs with operational forecast models, in conjunction with its linkage to continental-scale CAOs, opens up a new opportunity for 30-day forecasts of continental-scale CAOs, such as those occurring over North America in the 2013–14 winter. A real time forecast experiment inaugurated in the winter of 2014–15 has confirmed the feasibility of forecasting CAOs one month in advance.",

Credibility, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility are important features of global MRV efforts that can support implementation of climate change mitigation programs such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Sustainable Forest Management (REDD+). Applications of MRV technology may be tailored to individual country circumstances following guidance provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; hence, there is no single approach that is uniquely viable but rather a range of ways to integrate new MRV methods. MRV technology is advancing rapidly with new remote sensing and advanced measurement of atmospheric CO2, and in situ terrestrial and ocean measurements, coupled with improvements in data analysis, modeling, and assessing uncertainty. Here we briefly summarize some of the most application-ready MRV technologies being developed under NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) program, and illustrate how these technologies may be applied for monitoring forests using several case studies that span a range of scales, country circumstances, and stakeholder reporting requirements. We also include remarks about the potential role of advanced monitoring technology in the context of the global climate accord that is expected to result from the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is expected to take place in December 2015, in Paris, France.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions eject large quantities of gas and particles into the atmosphere. The portion directly above the vent commonly shows characteristics of underexpanded jets. Understanding the factors that influence the initial pyroclast ejection dynamics is necessary in order to better assess the resulting near- and far-field hazards. Field observations are often insufficient for the characterization of volcanic explosions due to lack of safe access to such environments. Fortunately, their dynamics can be simulated in the laboratory where experiments are performed under controlled conditions.\nWe ejected loose natural particles from a shock-tube while controlling temperature (25˚ and 500˚C), overpressure (15MPa), starting grain size distribution (1-2 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 0.125-0.250 mm), sample-to-vent distance and vent geometry. For each explosion we quantified the velocity of individual particles, the jet spreading angle and the production of fines. Further, we varied the setup to allow for different sample-to-gas ratios and deployed four different vent geometries: 1) cylindrical, 2) funnel with a flaring of 30˚, 3) funnel with a flaring of 15˚ and 4) nozzle.\nThe results showed maximum particle velocities up to 296 m/s, gas spreading angles varying from 21˚ to 37˚ and particle spreading angles from 3˚ to 40˚. Moreover we observed dynamically evolving ejection characteristics and variations in the production of fines during the course of individual experiments. Our experiments mechanistically mimic the process of pyroclast ejection. Thus the capability for constraining the effects of input parameters (fragmentation conditions) and conduit/vent geometry on ballistic pyroclastic plumes has been clearly established. These data obtained in the presence of well-documented conduit and vent conditions, should greatly enhance our ability to numerically model explosive ejecta in nature.",

            "abstract": "The young Himalayan orogen is the perfect laboratory to study the interactions between tectonics, erosion and climate. The major force driving the evolution of this mountain belt is the India-Asia convergence. Whilst the Himalayas has a major influence on global and regional climate, it is suggested that the monsoonal climate plays a major role in the erosion and relief pattern. Understanding the past variations in monsoonal strength along strike is crucial to understand the role of climate in the evolution of the mountain belt.\nThe Neogene sedimentary foreland basin of the Himalaya contains a record of tectonics and paleoclimate since Miocene times, within the so called molassic Siwalik Group. Therefore several sedimentary sections within the foreland basin along strike in the Himalayan range have previously been dated and studied with respect to determining hinterland exhumation rates, provenance and paleoclimatology. Lateral variations in hinterland exhumation rates have been observed but climate change in the past, especially the strengthening of the Asian summer monsoon along strike of the range, is still debated.\nIn order to track vegetation as a marker of monsoon intensity and seasonality, we analyzed δ13C on soil carbonate and associated δ13C on bulk organic carbon from previously dated Siwalik Group sedimentary sections in the West and the East of the Himalayan foreland basin. Sedimentary records span from 20-1 Myr in the West and 13-1 Myr in the East.\nThe presence of soil carbonate in the West, but its absence in the East is a first indication of lateral climatic variation. δ13C on soil carbonate shows a shift from around -10 ‰ to -2 ‰ at 6 Ma in the West. This is confirmed by δ13C analyses on bulk organic carbon which shows a shift from around -23 ‰ to -19 ‰ at the same time. Such a shift in isotopic value is likely to be associated with a change in vegetation type from C3 to C4. By contrast δ13C on bulk organic carbon remains at around -23 ‰ in the East. Whether the lateral difference in change of vegetation is caused by relief building or climate remains to be discussed.",

We will present our current best estimate for CO2 fluxes and a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of individual GAUGE data sources to spatially resolve CO2 flux estimates over the UK.

            "abstract": "Open software is essential for reproducible scientific exchange. R-packages provide a platform for development of seismological investigation software that can be properly documented and traced for data processing. A suite of R packages designed for a wide range of seismic analysis is currently available in the free software platform called R. R is a software platform based on the S-language developed at Bell Labs decades ago. Routines in R can be run as standalone function calls, or developed in object-oriented mode. R comes with a base set of routines, and thousands of user developed packages. The packages developed at UNC include subroutines and interactive codes for processing seismic data, analyzing geographic information (GIS) and inverting data involved in a variety of geophysical applications. On CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network,\nhttp://www.r-project.org/\n) currently available packages related to seismic analysis are RSEIS, Rquake, GEOmap, RFOC, zoeppritz, RTOMO, and geophys, Rwave, PEIP, hht, rFDSN. These include signal processing, data management, mapping, earthquake location, deconvolution, focal mechanisms, wavelet transforms, Hilbert-Huang Transforms, tomographic inversion, and Mogi deformation among other useful functionality. All software in R packages is required to have detailed documentation, making the exchange and modification of existing software easy. In this presentation, I will focus on packages RSEIS and RFOC, showing examples from a variety of seismic analyses. The R approach has similarities to the popular (and expensive) MATLAB platform, although R is open source and free to down load.",

            "abstract": "Stratovolcanoes consist of some of the most unstable terrain in the world, and mass wasting processes are a major contributor to volcanic hazards. These hazards persist even during periods of volcanic quiescence and, unlike volcanic activity, events often occur without warning. Mass movements range in scale from small daily rock and icefall events to extremely rare sector collapses. Many events generate observable seismic waves that are frequently picked up by seismic networks at volcanoes. Seismic waves from surface events are different than those from earthquakes and are not nearly as well-characterized or understood. Traditional seismologic methods (e.g., location, magnitude) can rarely be applied, and therefore surface events are not often included in earthquake catalogs. For this reason, many investigations of seismogenic surface processes are limited to case studies of individual events and/or single event types. In order to improve our understanding of typical characteristics of different types of events, we have compiled a catalog of over 30 significant historical events (1997-present), mainly from North American stratovolcanoes, that were well-recorded seismically and also have complementary data. Event types range widely from outburst floods and debris flows/lahars to rock avalanches, rock falls, and dome collapses. We summarize the general seismic characteristics of each event type (e.g., frequency content, attenuation, duration, scaling relations, waveform patterns) and discuss the possibilities and limitations of how seismic recordings of surface events can be used to better understand the surface dynamics of volcanoes. Finally, we discuss what might be needed to institute surface event monitoring and/or early warning systems.",

            "abstract": "Climate of the tropical North Atlantic and West Africa is sensitive to dust optical properties as shown by our previous work (Strong et al., 2015) using a fully coupled global climate model (GCM). However, that study was limited by the relatively coarse resolution of the GCM which could not resolve explicitly sub-scale processes important to the simulation of tropical cyclones (TCs).\nUsing simulations with the higher resolution, fully coupled GFDL Climate Model 2.5, Forecast-oriented Low Ocean Resolution version (CM2.5-FLOR), for several realistic sets of optical properties, we investigate the climatic response across the tropical Atlantic basin to an idealized aerosol radiative forcing from Saharan-born mineral dust, comparable to the observed changes between the 1960s and 1990s, with a focus on the hydrological cycle and TCs. CM2.5-FLOR has a higher resolution atmosphere which is able to resolve TCs and has been shown to accurately reproduce the observed tropical cyclone climatology.\nIn the first part, we will show that the sign of the radiative response at the top of the atmosphere (ToA) changes between the more absorbing dust and more scattering dust simulations, in agreement with previous studies. Conversely, the radiative response at the surface is generally comparable between sets of optical properties. These differences result in opposing regional hydrologic and thermodynamic effects of dust both in the atmosphere and in the upper ocean.\nIn the second part, the effect of Saharan-born mineral dust on TCs will be analyzed. In all simulations, dust causes a decrease in tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic with the largest response occurring in the most absorbing and scattering optical regimes. We also note significant changes in the West Pacific in these simulations. The changes in tropical cyclone activity are found to not be explained by common genesis potential indexes, but a relationship between accumulated cyclone energy and ToA radiative flux anomalies proves promising.\nStrong, J., G.

Human factors act as a supplementary key process. Therefore the mass-balance for the budget of catchments and river basins include anthropogenic disturbances. In the present study, we investigate waste water tracing by the use of Li isotopes in a small river basin near Orléans in France (l’Egoutier, 15 km² and 5 km long).\nIt is well known that Li has strategic importance for numerous industrial applications including its use in the production of batteries for both mobile devices (computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.) and electric vehicles, but also in pharmaceutical formulations. In the present work, we collected river waters samples before and after the release from a waste water treatment plant connected to an hospital.\nLithium isotopic compositions are rather homogeneous in river waters with δ7Li values around -0.5‰ ± 1 along the main course of the stream (n=7). The waste water sample is very different from the natural background of the river basin with Li concentration being twice of the values without pollution and significant heavy lithium contribution (δ7Li = +4‰). These preliminary results will be discussed in relation with factors controlling the distribution of Li and its isotopes in this specific system and compared with the release of other metals such as Pb or Zn.",

            "abstract": "Extreme climate events such as droughts, floods, or heat waves affect agricultural production in major cropping regions and therefore impact the world market prices of staple crops. In the last decade, crop prices exhibited two very prominent price peaks in 2007-2008 and 2010-2011, threatening food security especially for poorer countries that are net importers of grain. There is evidence that these spikes in grain prices were at least partly triggered by actual supply shortages and the expectation of bad harvests. However, the response of the market to supply shocks is nonlinear and depends on complex and interlinked processes such as warehousing, speculation, and trade policies. Quantifying the contributions of such different factors to short-term price variability remains difficult, not least because many existing models ignore the role of storage which becomes important on short timescales. This in turn impedes the assessment of future climate change impacts on food prices.\nHere, we present a simple model of annual world grain prices that integrates grain stocks into the supply and demand functions. This firstly allows us to model explicitly the effect of storage strategies on world market price, and thus, for the first time, to quantify the potential contribution of trade policies to price variability in a simple global framework. Driven only by reported production and by long--term demand trends of the past ca. 40 years, the model reproduces observed variations in both the global storage volume and price of wheat. We demonstrate how recent price peaks can be reproduced by accounting for documented changes in storage strategies and trade policies, contrasting and complementing previous explanations based on different mechanisms such as speculation. Secondly, we show how the integration of storage allows long-term projections of grain price variability under climate change, based on existing crop yield scenarios.",

            "abstract": "In-situ major and trace elements and Sr isotopic compositions of peridotite xenoliths carried by the Datong Quaternary alkaline basalt were analyzed. These peridotite xenoliths were classified into three groups. The type 1 peridotites preserve depleted trace element and Sr isotopic signatures and record the lowest temperature (930 - 980 °C). Clinopyroxenes in these peridotites exhibit LREE-depleted REE patterns, and have the lowest 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70243 - 0.70411. The types 2 and 3 peridotites are featured by enriched trace element and Sr isotopic signatures and record a higher temperature (1003 - 1032 °C). Clinopyroxenes in the type 2 peridotite have U-shaped REE patterns and relatively higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70418 - 0.70465. Clinopyroxenes in the type 3 peridotite have concave-downward REE patterns and unusually high 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70769 - 0.70929. Carbonatitic veinlets are found in the type 1 peridotites. They show steep LREE-enriched REE patterns with enrichments in LILE and depletions in HFSE, and have the highest 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.71147 - 0.71285.\nThe types 2 and 3 peridotites suffered latter cryptic carbonatitic metasomatism, as indicated by the decreased Ti/Eu and increased Zr/Hf and CaO/Al2O3 ratios of clinopyroxenes. The carbonatitic veinlets have generally consistent trace element patterns and Sr isotopic ratios with the calculated melts being equilibrated with the clinopyroxenes in the type 3 peridotite, and may represent the metasoamtic agent solidified in the relatively cold and shallow mantle. The negative Eu anomalies (0.37 - 0.61) and high 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the calculated melts indicate a crustal sedimentary origin. It is speculated that the REE-rich and high-87Sr/86Sr metasoamtic agent should be carbonatitic melt derived from the carbonated pelite carried by the subducted PAOP, which could have contributed to the transformation of the lithospheric mantle beneath the NCC.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and thus have a powerful effect on cloud properties. Increased aerosol concentrations resulting from pollution lead to higher cloud droplet concentrations, but smaller droplet sizes. This in turn affects the physical processes inside clouds that lead to the initiation of precipitation. Depending on a number of factors, including aerosol composition, atmospheric stability, and cloud water content, increasing CCN concentrations may either decrease or increase rainfall. In convective clouds, early rain formation is suppressed, which makes more water and energy available to rise higher in the atmosphere and form ice particles. This may invigorate the dynamics of convection, encourage the formation of hail and lightning, and enhance the transport of materials to the upper troposphere. In turn, cloud processing also affects the concentrations, composition, and distribution of atmospheric aerosols. In order to understand and quantify the effects of air pollution on climate, and precipitation in particular, knowledge of natural abundance and characteristics of aerosols is as essential as the observation of perturbed conditions. I will present recent advances in the conceptual understanding of aerosol-precipitation interactions, as well as results of measurements on aerosol and cloud characteristics in pristine and polluted conditions.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are the main oxidants of atmospheric pollutants. The quantification of their sources and sinks is necessary to fully comprehend the measured OH concentration. Due to difficulties quantifying all the individual compounds contributing to the OH loss, the direct quantification of the OH loss is a crucial means to have predictive capability of atmospheric OH concentrations and thus oxidation rates. Especially in forested areas, where OH reactivity is dominated by highly reactive organic compounds, the directly measured OH loss rate often exceeds the calculated total OH reactivity.\nHere we present the total OH loss data and data for the individual sinks of OH measured on board of the Zeppelin NT in summer 2012 and 2013. The campaigns were part of the Pan-European Gas AeroSOls-climate interaction Study (PEGASOS) and were performed from May – July 2012 in the area of Rotterdam (the Netherlands) and Bologna (Italy) and from April – July 2013 over Finland. Total OH reactivity was measured monitoring the decay of photolytically produced OH with laser induced fluorescence (LIF). OH, HO2, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), CO, formaldehyde, NOx, HONO and ozone were analyzed online together with photolysis frequencies, particle number concentrations and meteorological parameters. The Zeppelin NT was flying at low speed at altitudes of up to 900 m which provided insight into the vertical structure of the lower troposphere.\nOn average, the total OH reactivity was 6.1 ± 1.2 s-1 over the area of Rotterdam, 3.8 ± 1.4 s-1 over the region of Bologna and only 2.1 ± 1.1 s-1 over Finland.\nDuring almost the entire campaigns, the measured total OH reactivity could be explained by the contributions of measured species.\nOxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) contributed the major part of the total OH reactivity measured with a percentage share of 30% over the Rotterdam area and 40% over the area of Bologna. In the morning hours when layered structures had been built up over night, large gradients of the total OH reactivity were observed. The contribution of OVOC was especially large in the residual layer, which was decoupled from emissions from the ground.\nAcknowledgement: PEGASOS project funded by the European Commission und the Framework Program 7 (FP7-ENV-2010-265148) and NSF-AGS (1051338).",

With sea level rise, coastal topography and land cover (hereafter “landscape”) is expected to change and tropical cyclone flood hazard is expected to accelerate (e.g., Irish et al. 2010 [Ocean Eng], Woodruff et al. 2013 [Nature], Bilskie et al. 2014 [Geophys Res Lett], Ferreira et al. 2014 [Coast Eng], Passeri et al. 2015 [Nat Hazards]). Yet, the relative importance of sea-level rise induced landscape change on future tropical cyclone flood hazard assessment is not known. In this paper, idealized scenarios are used to evaluate the relative impact of one class of landscape change on future tropical cyclone extreme-value statistics in back-barrier regions: sea level rise induced vegetation migration and loss. The joint probability method with optimal sampling (JPM-OS) (Resio et al. 2009 [Nat Hazards]) with idealized surge response functions (e.g., Irish et al. 2009 [Nat Hazards]) is used to quantify the present-day and future flood hazard under various sea level rise scenarios. Results are evaluated in terms of their impact on the flood statistics (a) when projected flood elevations are included directly in the JPM analysis (Figure 1) and (b) when represented as additional uncertainty within the JPM integral (Resio et al. 2013 [Nat Hazards]), i.e., as random error. Findings are expected to aid in determining the level of effort required to reasonably account for future landscape change in hazard assessments, namely in determining when such processes are sufficiently captured by added uncertainty and when sea level rise induced vegetation changes must be considered dynamically, via detailed modeling initiatives.\nAcknowledgements: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI-1206271 and by the National Sea Grant College Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Grant No. NA10OAR4170099.

We tested, on two critical zone observatories with distinct hydrogeological characteristics, the simultaneous estimation of pressure (P-) and shear (S-) wave seismic velocities (VP and VS, respectively) from P-wave travel-time tomography and surface-wave dispersion inversion respectively. On both sites, e.g. a fractured environment with strong discontinuities and a continuous multi-layered hydrosystem, we were able to image spatial and/or temporal variations of VP/VS ratio, whose evolution was strongly associated to the water content observed locally.",

            "abstract": "Cold pools are fundamental ingredients of deep convection. They contribute to organizing the sub-cloud layer and are considered key elements in triggering new convective cells. Suitable diagnostics applied to numerically simulated cold pools offer a great opportunity to gain much information on these structures. We have previously used Lagrangian tracking to study the mechanisms through which cold pools trigger new convective cells in a case of radiative-convective equilibrium, and found that particles reach their level of free convection through a cooperation between gust front lifting and thermodynamic forcing. We have further used Lagrangian methods to investigate the dynamics of the unsaturated downdrafts which give rise to cold pools, and will show that they originate at very low altitudes and condensate loading plays a much bigger role than rain evaporation in maintaining such downdrafts. Finally, we will also explore how the Lagrangian tracking can be used to study entrainment of boundary layer air in the gust front of cold pools and quantify its importance for cold pool recovery compared to surface fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Extremes in the water cycle, such as drought and flood, threaten the sustainability of water resources and cause significant impacts on society that will likely increase due to growing populations and a changing climate. Reducing the impact of extreme events requires preparations enabled by reliable and relevant predictions of the climate. Climate predictions are made using Global Climate Models (GCMs) that typically have spatial resolutions that are too course for application at the local level where the prediction is needed to ensure a society resilient to extremes. Therefore, a common practice is to dynamically downscale results from GCM’s using a regional model that can provide predictions at scales consistent with the application. Downscaled predictions are dependent on model physics and model setup (e.g. boundary conditions, nudging) and as a result the overall validity of dynamically downscaling has not been fully demonstrated to date.\nNASA has recently sponsored an intra-agency downscaling project to better understand the validity of dynamical downscaling. As part of this project, several 10-year simulations of the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecast (NU-WRF) model that vary in resolution and large scale nudging were used to downscale MERRA-2 reanalyses over the continental U.S. This work leverages these model runs in order to understand the impact of model resolution and nudging on the representation of land-atmosphere coupling strength and its impact on downscaled predictions of the water cycle. The representation of land-atmosphere coupling strength is analyzed through a suite of local land-atmosphere coupling (LoCo) metrics that are compared across downscaling runs as well as coarse scale predictions from GEOS-5 and MERRA-2. The impact of downscaling approaches and resolution on the representation of land-atmosphere coupling is presented and the implications for future downscaling applications are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Stormwater runoff is a conduit for several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into surface and ground water bodies. The control of runoff and pollutants is typically addressed by best management practices, such as retention/detention ponds. While the effectiveness of catchment basins in runoff volume reduction and removal of some contaminants has been established, very little is known about contaminant fate within these structures. Particularly in coastal regions and places with shallow groundwater tables PAH accumulation in the bottom sediments poses a potential threat for groundwater contamination. The concentrations of PAHs accumulated in the sediments of these catchment basins will primarily depend on the sources of runoff origin and the surrounding land use.\nHere, five stormwater catchment basins along the I-95 corridor in Rhode Island were selected based on the stormwater runoff origin and land use (industrial, urban, highway, and commercial). To study the stratification of PAHs one foot sediment cores were collected and analyzed for 17 PAHs (16 EPA parent PAH and Retene). The concentrations of PAHs in sediments of detention ponds in urban and industrial land use areas ranged from 20 µg/g to 200 µg/g. Generally higher concentrations of contaminants were found in sediments near the pond inlet and a decreasing concentration gradient is observed laterally and vertically throughout the pond. To compare stormwater ponds in various land use settings a new index based on sediment contamination, pond size and age, and catchment area will be presented. Further, it will be investigated whether BMP maintenance has to be targeted towards pollutant removal to maintain an effective stormwater treatment system.",

            "abstract": "Headwater areas are critical in the hydrological mosaic of the global landscape. In mid-latitude regions, higher elevation headwater basins are usually snowmelt dominated. Due to diurnal fluctuations in temperature and thus incoming longwave radiation plus solar loading, snowmelt and evaporation can both start and end over the course of a 24-hour period. These processes yield an increase or decrease in the daily diurnal streamflow. We examined the diurnal fluctuations in streamflow from eight years of sub-daily resolution data at a number of small headwater basins located across the Southern Rocky Mountains of the Western United States. For each station-year, the shifting of the dominant hydrological process from snowmelt to evaporation was identified from the diurnal increase or decrease in streamflow. The magnitude and timing of this diurnal change was also estimated. The analysis included high and low snow years to determine the variation in process shifting, magnitude and timing of the diurnal change. Future climate scenarios were also considered to evaluate possible future changes.",

A number of studies have demonstrated critical sensitivities of the climate system to the water vapor content of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) and it is therefore important to assess how well the MERRA-2 reanalysis represents the mean structure and variability of water vapor in this part of the atmosphere. Recent comparisons with MLS water vapor indicate that the ECMWF and original MERRA reanalyses overestimate water vapor throughout the global upper troposphere by 50-80%. These overestimates are particularly acute at 147 hPa and 215 hPa and occur in all seasons. In this presentation, we analyze differences between the MLS v.4.2 water vapor data and the new MERRA-2 reanalysis to assess improvements in the treatment of water vapor in the GEOS-5 system since MERRA. We also include in our analysis a comparison of MERRA-2 profiles with water vapor and relative humidity profiles from frostpoint hygrometers at five sites with long-term records and a sixth with an intensive campaign of one month. Three of the long-term sites, Boulder, Colorado, Lindenburg, Germany and Lauder, New Zealand, lie in middle latitudes, and two sites, San José, Costa Rica and Hilo, Hawaii, are in the tropics and subtropics, respectively.

            "abstract": "The microstructure of partially molten rocks strongly influences the macroscopic physical properties. Contiguity, a geometric parameter, is a tensorial quantity that describes the area fraction of intergranular contact in a partially molten aggregate. It is also a key parameter that controls the effective elastic strength of the grain network. As the shape of the grains evolve during deformation, so does the contiguity of each grain. We present the first set of numerical simulations of evolution of grain-scale contiguity of an aggregate during matrix deformation using a Fast Multipole Boundary Elements Method (FMBEM) based model. Using the results of contiguity, we calculate the seismic anisotropy resulting from melt redistribution during pure and simple shear deformation. Deformation strongly modifies the geometry of melts initially occupying three grain junctions. The initially isotropic fractional area of intergranular contact, contiguity, becomes anisotropic due to deformation. Consequently, the component of contiguity evaluated on the plane parallel to axis of maximum compressive stress decreases. In pure shear deformation, the principal contiguity directions remain stationary while they rotate during simple shear. The ratio between the principal components of the contiguity tensor decrease from 1 in an undeformed aggregate to 0.1 after 45% shortening in pure shear and to 0.3 after a shear strain of 0.75 in simple shear. In both pure and simple shear experiments anisotropy in the shear wave velocity increases with the strain in a strongly nonlinear fashion. In pure shear deformation, the steady-state microstructure produces nearly 4% anisotropy between shear waves vibrating perpendicular and parallel to the planes of melt films.",

            "abstract": "The 2010-2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence began with the 4th September 2010 Darfield earthquake (Mw 7.1). Perhaps because there were no deaths, the mood of the city and the government was that high standards of earthquake engineering in New Zealand protected us, and there was a confident attitude to response and recovery. The demand for science and engineering information was of interest but not seen as crucial to policy, business or the public. The 22nd February 2011 Christchurch earthquake (Mw 6.2) changed all that; there was a significant death toll and many injuries. There was widespread collapse of older unreinforced and two relatively modern multi-storey buildings, and major disruption to infrastructure. The contrast in the interest and relevance of the science could not have been greater compared to 5 months previously. Magnitude 5+ aftershocks over a 20 month period resulted in confusion, stress, an inability to define a recovery trajectory, major concerns about whether insurers and reinsurers would continue to provide cover, very high levels of media interest from New Zealand and around the world, and high levels of political risk. As the aftershocks continued there was widespread speculation as to what the future held. During the sequence, the science and engineering sector sought to coordinate and offer timely and integrated advice. However, other than GeoNet, the national geophysical monitoring network, there were few resources devoted to communication, with the result that it was almost always reactive. With hindsight we have identified the need to resource information gathering and synthesis, execute strategic assessments of stakeholder needs, undertake proactive communication, and develop specific information packages for the diversity of users. Overall this means substantially increased resources. Planning is now underway for the science sector to adopt the New Zealand standardised CIMS (Coordinated Incident Management System) structure for management and communication during a crisis, which should help structure and resource the science response needs in future major events.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault accommodates up to 75% of the total relative Australia-Pacific plate boundary motion and ruptures episodically in large magnitude (Mw~8) earthquakes. An aim of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) is to understand the processes that govern earthquake rupture nucleation and propagation on the Alpine Fault. In January 2011, DFDP-1A drilling recovered a c. 25 cm-thick principal slip zone (PSZ) at Gaunt Creek. Assuming serial partitioning occurred at c. 2 km depth, this narrow PSZ has accommodated up to 5 km of displacement. We document the frictional, hydrological, structural, mineralogical, and chemical attributes of an 8 cm x 8.5 cm cylindrical section of PSZ core containing the oblique thrust contact (055/29SE, lin. 23/109) between hanging wall gouges and footwall gravels. Two main gouge types comprise the DFDP-1A core: smectitic brown gouges and chloritic, micaceous blue gouges. Smectitic gouges occur primarily at the plate boundary contact. However, smectitic gouges are also present as injection veins, lenses, recumbent folds, and clasts within overlying blue gouges, providing evidence for cyclical slip and material mixing within the PSZ. The room-temperature frictional properties of PSZ gouges were measured at 30 MPa effective normal stress (σn’) and varying sliding velocities (v=0.1-10 μm/s) using the direct-shear configuration. The friction coefficient (μ=0.60) of a blue gouge agrees with that published in Boulton et al. (2014). Two brown gouges are slightly stronger (μ=0.49 and 0.54) than similar gouges recovered in a nearby borehole (DFDP-1B). All gouges exhibit velocity-strengthening behavior in 0.3-10 μm/s velocity steps. These results indicate that although they are not frictionally weak at low sliding velocities, fault slip repeatedly localizes in the PSZ gouges. Additional measurements of fault gouge physical and chemical properties will elucidate the pre-seismic, interseismic, and post-seismic behavior this major plate boundary structure.",

            "abstract": "Iron oxide-apatite (IOA) and iron oxide-copper-gold deposits (IOCG) are important sources of their namesake metals and increasingly for rare earth metals in apatite. Studies of natural systems document that IOA and IOCG deposits are often spatially and temporally related with one another and coeval magmatism. However, a genetic model that accounts for observations of natural systems remains elusive, with few observational data able to distinguish among working hypotheses that invoke meteoric fluid, magmatic-hydrothermal fluid, and immiscible melts. Here, we use Fe and O isotope data and high-resolution trace element (e.g., Ti, V, Mn, Al) data of individual magnetite grains from the world-class Los Colorados (LC) IOA deposit in the Chilean Iron Belt to elucidate the origin of IOA and IOCG deposits. Values of d56Fe range from 0.08‰ to 0.26‰, which are within the global range of ~0.06‰ to 0.5‰ for magnetite formed at magmatic conditions. Values of δ18O for magnetite and actinolite are 2.04‰ and 6.08‰, respectively, consistent with magmatic values. Ti, V, Al, and Mn are enriched in magnetite cores and decrease systematically from core to rim. Plotting [Al + Mn] vs. [Ti + V] indicates that magnetite cores are consistent with magmatic and/or magmatic-hydrothermal (i.e., porphyry) magnetites. Decreasing Al, Mn, Ti, V is consistent with a cooling trend from porphyry to Kiruna to IOCG systems. The data from LC are consistent with the following new genetic model for IOA and IOCG systems: 1) magnetite cores crystallize from silicate melt; 2) these magnetite crystals are nucleation sites for aqueous fluid that exsolves and scavenges inter alia Fe, P, S, Cu, Au from silicate melt; 3) the magnetite-fluid suspension is less dense that the surrounding magma, allowing ascent; 4) as the suspension ascends, magnetite grows in equilibrium with the fluid and takes on a magmatic-hydrothermal character (i.e., lower Al, Mn, Ti, V); 5) during ascent, magnetite, apatite and actinolite are deposited to form IOA deposits; 6) the further ascending fluid transports Fe, Cu, Au and S toward the surface where metal-oxides and metal-sulfides precipitate to form IOCG deposits. This model is globally applicable and explains the observed temporal and spatial relationship between magmatism and formation of IOA and IOCG deposits.",

Our previous results based on the first 3 years of IBEX observations showed that the ENA spectral indices at the two lowest energies (~0.89 and 1.47 keV) exhibit no clear trend with ecliptic latitude θ, while those at ~2.29 and ~3.41 keV exhibit a clear latitudinal pattern; flatter spectra occur above 60° latitude and steeper spectra occur ±30° of the equator. While these results confirmed the previously reported latitudinal organization of the ENA spectra and their remarkable similarity to that of the solar wind (SW) speed observed by Ulysses in the inner heliosphere, we also showed that, unlike previous reports, the ~0.5–6 keV globally distributed ENA spectral indices could not be represented as single power laws over much of the sky, and that they depend on energy and latitude. In this work we extend the above results to include years 4 and 5 of IBEX observations and investigate if the spectral indices vary as a function of time. Finally, we discuss implications of our results on models and simulations that seek to map the IBEX ENA observations back to the latitudinal profile of the SW speed structure observed in the inner heliosphere.",

The purpose of such reconstructions is to provide quantitative data needed to verify computer simulations of tsunamis which are used to guide mitigation efforts during the critical time interval following a potentially tsunamigenic earthquake.\nMore than ten years have passed since the tsunami catastrophe in Thailand 2004, and there are almost no visible signs left from the damage it caused. Many of the buildings in Thailand were rebuilt precisely as they were before the catastrophe. This allowed us to use amateur videos made a decade ago, during the tsunami to estimate tsunami height, direction and velocity. We also made an analogue experiment in a lab at Stockholm University to examine how the tsunami was affected entering a narrow passage (e.g. a street).\nThe results of this study is an overview of tsunami height data and velocity. Our tsunami height results show an average and standard deviation of (6.8+/-0.1 m) and are remarkably uniform across the 100 km x 100 km study area although the height is increasing slightly on its way north. Tsunami velocity is also increasing on its way north while the velocity is decreasing on its way east. Based on these observations, which are unexpected because the velocity and height are more powerful in the northern parts which are further away from the epicentre than the southern parts of the study area, we interpret that this is a result of that the southern parts are shielded by the northern parts of Sumatra. Our analogue experiment showed that tsunami height and velocity are essentially unaffected by entering a narrow passage (e.g. a street) perpendicular to the beach. This indicates that measurements done in this environment are indeed reliable because it avoids the influence of back flow as the tsunami hits a barrier.",

            "abstract": "The northern Sub-Saharan African region (NSSA) is an area of intense focus due to periodic severe droughts that have dire consequences on the growing population, which relies mostly on rain fed agriculture for its food supply. This region’s weather and hydrologic cycle are very complex and are dependent on the West African Monsoon. Different regional processes affect the West African Monsoon cycle and variability. One of the areas of current investigation is the water cycle response to the variability of land surface characteristics. Land surface characteristics are often altered in NSSA due to agricultural practices, grazing, and the fires that occur during the dry season. To better understand the effects of biomass burning on the hydrologic cycle of the sub-Saharan environment, an interdisciplinary team sponsored by NASA is analyzing potential feedback mechanisms due to the fires. As part of this research, this study focuses on the effects of land surface changes, particularly albedo and skin temperature, that are influenced by biomass burning. Surface temperature anomalies can influence the initiation of convective rainfall and surface albedo is linked to the absorption of solar radiation. To capture the effects of fire perturbations on the land surface, NASA’s Unified Weather and Research Forecasting (NU-WRF) model coupled with NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) is being used to simulate burned area surface albedo inducing surface temperature anomalies and other potential effects to environmental processes. Preliminary sensitivity results suggest an altered surface radiation budget, regional warming of the surface temperature, slight increase in average rainfall, and a change in precipitation locations.",

            "abstract": "The most pronounced local impacts of climate change would occur in association with extreme weather events superimposed on the altered climate. Thus a major thrust of recent efforts in the climate community has been to assess how extreme regional events such as cold air outbreaks, heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and severe weather might change with the climate. Many of these types of events are poorly simulated in climate models because of insufficient spatial resolution and insufficient quality parameterization of sub grid scale convection and radiation processes. This talk summarizes examples selected from those discussed below of how weather and climate events can be interconnected so that the physics of natural climate and weather phenomena depend on each other, thereby complicating our ability to simulate extreme events. A major focus of the chapter is on the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO), which is associated with alternating eastward-moving planetary scale regions of enhanced and suppressed moist deep convection favoring warm pool regions in the tropics. The MJO modulates weather events around the world and influences the evolution of interannual climate variability. We first discuss how the MJO evolves together with the seasonal cycle, the El Niño/southern oscillation (ENSO), and the extratropical circulation, then continue with a case study illustration of how El Niño is intrinsically coupled to intraseasonal and synoptic weather events such as the MJO and westerly wind bursts. This interconnectedness in the system implies that modeling many types of regional extreme weather events requires more than simply downscaling coarse climate model signals to nested regional models because extreme outcomes in a region can depend on poorly simulated extreme weather in distant parts of the world.\nThe authors hope that an improved understanding of these types of interactions between signals across scales of time and space will ultimately yield conversation about how to better simulate these signals in climate models to yield better understanding and more informed prediction of the broader climate system and regional climate change.",

            "abstract": "Rational projection of water demand is critically important to the future development of society. Achieving the desired accuracy for long-term water demand projection (WDP) is challenging due to the complex and uncertain relationships between water demand and various socio-economic indicators. At the same time, traditional forecasting methods, such as multivariate statistical analysis and time series analysis methods, are not adequate for long-term WDP because of the limitations in modelling structures. In this study, a five-staged WDP model is proposed and applied to the global WDPs. The hypothesis for the new model is that water demand is related to socio-economic development level. From the historic data in the Western Europe and United States, the five stages of water demand can be clearly observed. These stages are marked by evident change in water demand trend, and are categorized by the per capita GDP at that stage. The proposed WDP model is then validated with historic water consumption data in United Kingdom and Hong Kong, and the proposed model can explain the historic water consumption well. The developed five-staged WDP model is applied to the WDPs in Hong Kong and Pearl River Basin. Further, using the newly developed water consumption algorithm, this study investigates the global future water demand.",

The ECPC describes the relationship between magnetopause reconnection and substorm growth phase, magnetotail reconnection and substorm expansion phase, associated changes in auroral morphology, and ionospheric convective motions. Despite the many successes of the model, there has yet to be a rigorous test of the predictions made regarding ionospheric convection, which remains a final hurdle for the validation of the ECPC. In this study we undertake a comparison of ionospheric convection, as measured by ion driftmeters on board DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) satellites, with motions predicted by a theoretical model (Milan, 2013). The model is coupled to measurements of changes in the size of the polar cap made using global auroral imagery from the IMAGE FUV (Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration Far Ultraviolet) instrument, as well as the dayside reconnection rate, calculated using the OMNI dataset. The results show that we can largely predict the magnitudes of ionospheric convection flows using the context of our understanding of magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail.",

In this study we have reconstructed the total refractivity profiles over Poland using the least-squares collocation software COMEDIE (Collocation of Meteorological Data for Interpretation and Estimation of Tropospheric Pathdelays). Profiles were calculated from different combinations of data sets from following sources: meteorological parameters from Numerical Weather Prediction Model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) or EUREF Permanent Network (EPN) stations and zenith total delay (ZTD) from ground-based GNSS products on ASG-EUPOS stations. The combinations of data sets included into this study are: 'WRF only', 'WRF/GNSS', 'WRF/GNSS/EPN' and 'GNSS only'. To find the data set with the best accuracy, profiles were compared with the reference radiosonde observations.\nThe data set with the best accuracy is the combined ‘WRF/GNSS' with mean bias close to 0 and standard deviation of 3 ppm. The data set 'WRF/GNSS/EPN' shows very similar accuracy so, there is no need to include the additional ground-based meteorological information from EPN stations. The data set 'GNSS only' shows much worse accuracy with the discrepancies at lower altitudes even at the level of -30 ppm. The data set 'WRF only' shows as good agreement with reference data as 'WRF/GNSS' in term of total refractivity, but when we calculated ZTD from all sets, we found that standard deviations from residuals are almost two times larger for the 'WRF only' dataset. We continue advancing the collocation algorithms, so the ZTD from the model can be useful as a priori troposphere information for example in PPP (Precise Point Positioning) technique.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and modelling mantle convection requires knowledge of many mantle properties, such as viscosity, chemical structure and thermal proerties such as radiogenic heating rate. However, many of these parameters are only poorly constrained.\nWe demonstrate a new method for inverting present day Earth observations for mantle properties. We use neural networks to represent the posterior probability density functions of many different mantle properties given the present structure of the mantle. We construct these probability density functions by sampling a wide range of possible mantle properties and running forward simulations, using the convection code StagYY. Our approach is particularly powerful because of its flexibility. Our samples are selected in the prior space, rather than being targeted towards a particular observation, as would normally be the case for probabilistic inversion. This means that the same suite of simulations can be used for inversions using a wide range of geophysical observations without the need to resample. Our method is probabilistic and non-linear and is therefore compatible with non-linear convection, avoiding some of the limitations associated with other methods for inverting mantle flow. This allows us to consider the entire history of the mantle. We also need relatively few samples for our inversion, making our approach computationally tractable when considering long periods of mantle history.\nUsing the present thermal and density structure of the mantle, we can constrain rheological and compositional parameters such as viscosity and yield stress. We can also use the present day mantle structure to make inferences about the initial conditions for convection 4.5 Gyr ago. We can constrain initial mantle conditions including the initial concentration of heat producing elements in the mantle and the initial thickness of primordial material at the CMB. Currently we use density and temperature structure for our inversions, but we can extend this method to many other geophysical observables, such as inferred viscosity structure, continent distribution and surface heat flux.",

            "abstract": "In a perfect-deficit approach (Yi, 2012), the daily maximum carbon storage capacity (CPC) of a given ecosystem for each year defines the perfect annual CPC curve. Deficits are the differences in the daily observational data for a given year against a perfect curve. The area between this curve and instantaneous canopy photosynthetic rates represents the potential productivity. Using an 11-year (2004 – 2014) eddy covariance flux and meteorological data, this perfect-deficit approach was used to examine the relationship between potential productivity and droughts occurring in 2005 and 2010 in a tropical rainforest of French Guiana, South America. Surprisingly, CPC deficits were only reduced by 24% (2005) and 19% (2010) from their respective perfect CPCs, indicating a subtle effect of drought to ecosystem productivity. Highest precipitation occurred in 2010 but precipitation deficits dropped drastically during this year (71% reduction from its perfect value) which reflects a drought condition. However, its deficits showed no correlation annually and seasonally. Soil water content (SWC) appeared to be the single driver for CPC deficits during long dry periods but is weakly correlated (r = 0.30; P <0.01 and r = 0.31; P <0.01, in 2005 and 2010, respectively). These results indicate that soil water is not a major limiting factor for productivity of this ecosystem during drought periods. In contrast, global radiation (Rg) corresponds to the peak of CPC deficits in 2010, but only 19% had been reduced from its ideal value. Yet, highest gross primary production (GPP) of 4106±231 gCm−2yr−1 occurred this year (mean 3753±231 gCm−2yr−1). Therefore, smaller deficits in Rg coupled with sufficient water may have induced higher productivity in 2010. Nevertheless, weaker correlations between potential productivity and climatic drivers may imply that other controlling aspects such as biological constraints may also have an effect to the dynamics of potential productivity during drought events, hence, must also be considered.",

Past observations were limited to a few high-velocity flybys, so some regions remain poorly understood. Various modeling techniques provide important insight, but do not answer all questions. One unusual region that is difficult to explain with models is called the “Mystery” region. This region was observed on a few flybys on the sunward side beginning well after the bow shock and terminating with a “Mystery” boundary located halfway between the bow shock and the comet. Within this region there is a significant increase in “hot” electrons (> 800 eV) and solar wind He++. The “Mystery” boundary is characterized by a rapid decrease in hot electrons, solar wind He++, and total ion mass flux, along with an increase in cometary ions. The magnetic field did not vary within this region or across the boundary. Rosetta is uniquely placed to improve understanding of plasma interaction regions because the spacecraft remains close (< 1500 km) to comet 67P for an extended period of time. Recent observations by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) Ion Electron Spectrometer (IES) suggest that the spacecraft frequently crosses a boundary between two interaction regions that bears some resemblance to the “Mystery” boundary. The timing and location of these boundary crossings appear to correlate with solar wind activity extrapolated to the Rosetta location, suggesting a complex and dynamic plasma interaction environment.",

Hillslopes and channels respond to these changes with different rates, and the dissonance between hillslope and channel response times can be exploited to gain information about the nature and timing of landscape transience. I explore the limits to which differences between channel and hillslope processes can be used to detect transience. Slowing channel erosion rates are difficult to detect, whereas increased erosion rates can be detected if erosion rates more than double. Signals of transient erosion driven by upslope propagation of channel incision can persist for thousands to tens of thousands of years; the time perturbations can be detected is proportional to the square of the hillslope length and the inverse of the hillslope sediment transport coefficient. Climate driven (“top down”) and tectonic driven (“bottom up”) have different responses to transient perturbation, and lead to different sediment flux responses that are reflected in basinwide cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. Climate driven perturbations are mirrored in cosmogenic concentrations leaving basins whereas tectonic perturbations tend to be averaged when estimated from basinwide cosmogenics.",

            "abstract": "The term “quiet magnetosphere” has been accepted as a descriptor of a magnetospheric state under small solar wind driving conditions. Observations indicate that such a state entails a substantial reduction of field-aligned currents, the polar cap potential, polar cap size, and general convection in the magnetosphere. While this paradigm is often discussed, little research has been applied to determine the detailed state of the structure of the magnetosphere. Due to basic constraints, such as entropy conservation, it appears, for example, very likely that the state of the quiet magnetosphere depends on the dynamic history. Relaxation to a unique relaxed state, should, if at all, only be possible on some yet undetermined relaxation time scale. Finally, the quiet state should depend on residual fluctuations in the solar wind driver, even if the IMF is northward. This presentation is shedding some first light on the issue of the quiet magnetosphere. We are using global MHD simulations to study the relaxation process starting from different driven states. By studying different key parameters, we derive estimates for relaxation time scales, and we will demonstrate the role solar wind fluctuations play in shaping the typical behavior of a relaxed magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "NOAA & NASA are acquiring the next-generation civilian operational weather satellite: Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). Replacing the p.m. orbit & ground system (GS) of POES satellites, JPSS sensors will collect weather, ocean & climate data. JPSS’s Common Ground System (CGS), made up of C3 & IDP parts and developed by Raytheon, now flies the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, transfers data between ground facilities, processes them into Environmental Data Records for NOAA’s weather centers and evolves to support JPSS-1 in 2017. CGS processed S-NPP data creates many TBs/day across >2 dozen environmental data products (EDPs), doubling after JPSS launch. But CGS goes beyond this by providing data routing to other missions: GCOM-W1, Coriolis/Windsat, EOS, NSF’s McMurdo Station, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, and POES & MetOp satellites. Each system orbits 14 times/day, downlinking data 1-2 times/orbit at up to 100s of MBs/sec, to support the creation of 10s of TBs of data/day across 100s of EDPs. CGS’s flexible, multimission capabilities offer major chances for cost reduction & improved information integration across the missions. CGS gives a vital flexible-expandable-virtualized modern GS architecture. Using 5 global ground stations to receive S-NPP & JPSS-1 data, CGS links with high-bandwidth commercial fiber to rapidly move data to the IDP for EDP creation & delivery and leverages these networks to provide added support to more missions. CGS data latency will be < 80 minutes. JPSS CGS is a mature, tested solution for support to operational weather forecasting for civil, military and international partners and climate research. It features a flexible design handling order-of-magnitude increases in data over legacy systems and meets tough science accuracy needs. The Raytheon-built CGS gives the full GS capability, from design & development through operations & sustainment, facilitating future evolution to support more missions.",

For instance today AMDA helps scientists all over the world accessing and analyzing data from ancient to very recent missions (from Voyager, Galileo, Geotail, ... to Maven, Rosetta, MMS, ...) as well as results from models and numerical simulations. Other tools like the Propagation Tool or 3DView allow users to put their data in context and interconnect with other databases (CDAWeb, MEDOC) and tools (Topcat).

The methods are applied to the Parkfield's section along the San Andreas Fault at the transition zone between the SAF creeping segment in the North and the locked section to the south, where a Mw~6 earthquake has occurred every 24.5 years on average since the M7.7 Fort Tejon event in 1857. We compare the moment released by all the known earthquakes and associated postseismic deformation with the moment deficit accumulated during the interseismic period. We find that the recurrence of Mw6 earthquakes is insufficient to close the slip budget and that larger events are probably needed. We will discuss and evaluate various possible scenarios which might account for the residual moment deficit and implications of the possible magnitude and return period of Mw6 earthquakes on that fault segment.",

            "abstract": "Understanding large spatio-temporal hydrometeorological variabilities is critical in the present context of climate change. Large scale information analyses require long and numerous times series as input data. It is often met with difficulty because good quality time series are scarce and often not available over a large area. Reconstructions offer an interesting alternative to alleviate this problem. An original reconstruction method for rainfall and temperature called ANATEM has been developed by Electricité de France in 2013 (Kuentz et al., 2015) combining both a nearby time series (TEM) and a climate field (i.e: geopotential height)(ANA) as predictors. By using large scale information, this method should allow improving on the TEM regression model both in spatial and temporal dimensions. ANATEM was used to reconstruct daily rainfall time series from 25 stations of the Durance watershed in South of France, spanning 1883-2010. This study focused on extracting the large scale information contained in the reconstructed series. Wavelet analyses were used to break down the signal and extract its long-term component (out of 4 different time scales) while composite map analyses enabled to show the links between mean rainfall over the durance and climate fields in the Euro-Atlantic sector. The study showed that ANATEM reconstruction can indeed improve on long term/large scale reconstructions and thus that  reconstructions can be used to infer climate processes. Wavelet Multiresolution analysis over the Durance watershed showed a dip in long-term rainfall from 1950 to the end of the 20th century. Composite analysis revealed that rainfall variation (from low to high rainfall) over the Durance watershed is mainly associated with transition from positive NAO-like pattern to negative NAO-like one. The spatial large scale information shows a strong variability with season. In summer, large scale forcings seem less apparent. Long term oscillations showed distinct spatio-temporal patterns compared to shorter term oscillations highlighting the role of local morphology such as relief. Future work should focus on important topics such as rainfall extremes evolution or non linearity/non stationarity in local-large scale relationship and many others.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of zeta potential have been used to monitor subsurface flows in many natural brine systems. Numerous studies report zeta potentials in carbonates using crushed samples at low ionic strength and laboratory temperatures. However, natural brines have much higher salinity; moreover, temperatures are considerably higher in many subsurface settings. The variation of zeta potentials with temperature has not been examined in natural carbonates. We report zeta potential values interpreted from streaming potential measurements in two intact carbonate rock samples, saturated with artificial brines at elevated temperatures. We measure streaming potential using an experimental set-up that incorporates in-situ measurements of saturated rock conductivity, brine temperature, brine pH, brine electrical conductivity, pressure difference and voltage at temperatures up to 120oC. The streaming potential measurements are complemented with brine effluent studies.\nWe find that the interpreted zeta potential is negative and decreases in magnitude with increasing temperature at low ionic strength (0.01M) and independent of temperature at high ionic strength (0.5M); consistent with published zeta potential in intact natural sandstones. The concentration of Ca2+ (main potential determining ion) also decreases with temperature at low ionic strength, but remains constant at high ionic strength. The temperature dependence of the zeta potential is consistent between two different natural carbonate samples and can be explained by the temperature dependence of pCa2+. We suggest that zeta potential of carbonate is independent of temperature or pH when pCa2+ remains constant. A linear variation of pH vs. pCa2+ is exhibited, at ambient and elevated temperatures, when pCa2+ is allowed to change with pH. This linear variation explains the numerous published data that shows apparent relationship between zeta potential of carbonates and pH.",

In particular, changes in the trace constituent and/or particulate composition of the stratosphere, as well as the temperature distribution of the troposphere and stratosphere can both take place (and persist over a period of time), as has been observed in several eruptions in recent years (e.g., the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991). Characterizing the impacts of these eruptions and predicting their impacts on the evolution of the atmosphere requires observations of gas and particle distributions over time period from as soon after eruption as possible to the longer time period over which the Earth system is affected. This characterization may make use of observation capabilities from ongoing surface-based and existing satellite-based observing systems, and can also benefit significantly from focused airborne campaigns that make use of both in situ and remote sensing instrumentation. This presentation will review the relevant surface- and space-based observing capability operated by NASA in the broader context of the global observing capabilities of the international community, and and will discuss potential approaches to airborne campaigns (platforms, sensors, systems, logistical consideration) that would provide the data most useful for both characterization and forecasting of both the chemical and climatic forcing and impacts associated with the eruption.",

            "abstract": "On May 30, 2015, a major Mw7.8 great deep earthquake occurred at the base of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), approximately 680 km deep within the Pacific Plate which subducts westward under the Philippine Sea Plate along the Izu-Bonin trench. A global P wave tomographic image indicates that a tabular high-velocity structure delineated by ~1% faster than the ambient mantle plunges nearly vertical to a depth at most 600 km and afterword flattens and stagnates within the MTZ. Almost all the deep earthquakes in this region are clustered inside this fast anomaly corresponding to the cold core of the subducting slab. Those occurring at depth between 400~500 km close to the hinge of the bending slab show down-dip compressional focal mechanisms and reflect episodic release of compressive strain accumulated in the slab. The 2015 deep event, however, separated from the others, occurred uniquely near the base of the lithosphere with a down-dip extension mechanism, consistent with the notion that the outer portion of the folded slab experiences extensional bending stress. Here we perform a 3D MUSIC back-projection (BP) rupture imaging for this isolated deep event using P and pP waveforms individually from the European, North American and Australian array data. By integrating P- and pP- BP images in frequencies of 0.1-1 Hz obtained from three array observations with different azimuth, we first ascertain the most possible fault plan is the SW-dipping subhorizontal one. Then, from back-projecting higher frequency waveforms at 1-1.5 Hz onto the obtained fault plane, we find the rupture initially propagates slowly along the strike (SW-direction), and makes a turn to the NNW-direction at ~12s after the onset of rupture. The MUSIC psudospectrum over totally 20s rupture duration reveals that most seismic energy radiation takes place at the initial 8s of the first rupture along the strike, 10-15 km long region, while the along-updip second rupture lasting for 6-10s has a rupture length of 15-20 km and weaker radiated energy. The overall rupture speed is about 1.5-2 km/s. As it rarely struck the area close to the outer periphery of the slab under the condition of relatively high-temperature and downdip extension, thermally-induced shear instability may play an important role in the genesis of this deep-focus earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Model-data fusion approaches, such as global inverse modeling for surface flux estimation, have traditionally been performed at spatial resolutions of several tens to a few hundreds of kilometers. Use of such coarse scales presents a fundamental limitation in reconciling the modeled field with both the atmospheric observations and the distribution of surface emissions and uptake. Emissions typically occur on small scales, including point sources (e.g. power plants, forest fires) or with inhomegeneous structure. Biological uptake can have spatial variations related to complex, diverse vegetation, etc. Atmospheric observations of CO2 are either surface based, providing information at a single point, or space based with a finite-sized footprint. For instance, GOSAT and OCO-2 have footprint sizes of around 10km and proposed active sensors (such as ASCENDS) will likely have even finer footprints. One important aspect of reconciling models to measurements is the representativeness of the observation for the model field, and this depends on the generally unknown spatio-temporal variations of the CO2 field around the measurement location and time. This work presents an assessment of the global spatio-temporal variations of the CO2 field using the “7km GEOS-5 Nature Run” (7km-G5NR), which includes CO2 emissions and uptake mapped to the finest possible resolution. Results are shown for surface CO2 concentrations, total-column CO2, and separate upper and lower tropospheric columns. Spatial variability is shown to be largest in regions with strong point sources and at night in regions with complex terrain, especially where biological processes dominate the local CO2 fluxes, where the day-night differences are also most marked. The spatio-temporal variations are strongest for surface concentrations and for lower tropospheric CO2. While these results are largely anticipated, these high resolution simulations provide quantitative estimates of the global nature of spatio-temporal CO2 variability. Implications for characterizing representativeness of passive CO2 observations will be discussed. Differences between daytime and nighttime structures will be considered in light of active CO2 sensors. Finally, some possible limitations of the model will be highlighted, using some global 3-km simulations.",

NASA also is planning a decadal survey mission-The GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE). However, NASA has initiated scientific studies to determine if TEMPO can meet both its and GEO-CAPE's requirements by synergistically retrieving aerosol properties using TEMPO and GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) measurements. Because TEMPO does not have a cloud camera or needed spectral channels to identify clouds and a Shortwave IR band to characterize the surface that are essential for aerosol retrievals, GOES-R ABI can supplement those measurements. GOES-R aerosol team conducted a study to determine idealistic position of TEMPO and GOES-R (in its both east and west location) for scene overlap and projection of ABI Shortwave IR (2.25 um) reflectance and cloud mask to TEMPO pixels. The BRDF effect was taken into consideration in determining the spatial coverage of pixels ideal for aerosol retrievals using ABI shortwave IR reflectance in TEMPO pixels to extrapolate reflectance at visible spectral bands. Analysis shows that GOES-R (in its west location, 135W) and TEMPO do not overlap over eastern part of the United States (US) and Atlantic Ocean, while GOES-R (in its east location, 75W) overlaps with TEMPO over most part of the United States (US) except for small part of Pacific Ocean. In addition, retrievals in the early morning and late afternoon are not possible due to BRDF effects rendering the surface reflectance too bright. Cloud mask information from GOES-R observations in both its east and west location seems to be sufficient for TEMPO. In summary, GOES-R ABI Shortwave IR radiances and cloud mask information are adequate to be used with TEMPO measurements to retrieve aerosol optical depth product several times during the sunlit portion of the continental US.",

            "abstract": "Europa exists in a complicated plasma environment where the tilt of Jupiter’s magnetic field and rapid rotation rate leads to a dynamic interaction with Europa’s ionospheric plasma. While understanding this plasma interaction is interesting in its own right, it is crucial for successfully magnetically sounding Europa’s subsurface ocean. . In magnetic sounding, currents induced in Europa by the changing Jovian plasma produce a detectable secondary magnetic field that reflects properties of Europa’s subsurface ocean such as depth and conductivity. This technique was successfully employed with Galileo observations of Europa to demonstrate that Europa indeed has a subsurface ocean containing more liquid water than Earth’s oceans. While these Galileo observations contributed to the renewed interest in Europa, the results raised major questions that remain unanswered, in part due to the large uncertainties in the ice shell thickness, ocean depth, and ocean salinity due to limitations in the observations. Here we present the scientific goals of the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of the 9 instruments selected for the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission. We specifically address how PIMS plasma measurements will transform the accuracy of magnetic sounding of Europa’s subsurface oceans. We also present synergistic science with other Europa instrumentation such as the ultraviolet spectrometer, mass spectrometer, and the radar.",

            "abstract": "Recent paleomagnetic measurements of meteorites suggest that asteroidal magnetic fields are a common feature of the early solar system [1,2]. The iron cores of different asteroids may solidify in different ways [3]. For the IVA iron meteorite parent body the rapid cooling rates and correlation with Ni concentrations further suggest that their parent body was entirely metal, and that solidification of their parent asteroid proceeded from the top down. Here we present model constraints on the thermo-chemical evolution of such rapidly cooled iron asteroids. We show that the temperature of the liquid is rapidly well mixed, and equal to the composition-dependent freezing point, and that thermal convection contributes only at early times to generation of intense magnetic fields and is therefore not sufficient to explain the generation of a dynamo. Instead, we propose that viscous delamination [4] at the base of the solidifying, dense crust provides a sufficient buoyancy flux to generate a magnetic field with properties consistent with those inferred from paleomagnetic measurements of the two IVA meteorites [5]. A model that captures the aggregate effect of episodic delamination events predicts the evolution of the crust and the formation and growth of the asteroid core, the intensity and directional evolution of the magnetic field through time, and the times at which magnetic field generation ceases and total asteroid solidification occur. These predictions can be compared directly with recent measurements of IVA iron meteorites [5] with implications for top-down solidification, the solid structure of the IVA parent core, and magnetic field generation both on the IVA parent body, and wider implications for top-down core solidification generally.\n[1] Weiss et al.

            "abstract": "The MODIS imagers on the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua satellites have generated accurate and well-used cloud climate data records for 15 years. Both missions are expected to continue until the end of this decade and perhaps beyond. The Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagers on the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) mission (launched in October 2011) and future NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) platforms are the successors for imager-based cloud climate records from polar orbiting satellites after MODIS. To ensure product continuity across a broad suite of EOS products, NASA has funded a SNPP science team to develop EOS-like algorithms that can be use with SNPP and JPSS observations, including two teams to work on cloud products. Cloud data record continuity between MODIS and VIIRS is particularly challenging due to the lack of VIIRS CO2-slicing channels, which reduces information content for cloud detection and cloud-top property products, as well as down-stream cloud optical products that rely on both.\nHere we report on our approach to providing continuity specifically for the MODIS/VIIRS cloud-top and infrared-derived thermodynamic phase products by combining elements of the NASA MODIS science team (MOD) and the NOAA Algorithm Working Group (AWG) algorithms. The combined approach is referred to as the MODAWG processing package. In collaboration with the NASA Atmospheric SIPS located at the University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center, the MODAWG code has been exercised on one year of SNPP VIIRS data. In addition to cloud-top and phase, MODAWG provides a full suite of cloud products that are physically consistent with MODIS and have a similar data format. Further, the SIPS has developed tools to allow use of Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) observations in the MODAWG processing that can ameliorate the loss of the CO2 absorption channels on VIIRS. Examples will be given that demonstrate the positive impact that the CrIS data can provide when combined with VIIRS for cloud height and IR-phase retrievals.",

            "abstract": "Observations of pollutants are central to the study of air quality. Much focus has been placed on local-scale observations that can help specific geographic areas document their air quality issues, plan abatement strategies, and understand potential impacts. In addition, long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants can cause downwind regions to not meet attainment standards. Satellite observations have shed significant light on air quality from local to regional to global scales, especially for pollutants such as ozone, aerosols, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. These observations have made use of multiple techniques and in some cases multiple satellite sensors. The satellite observations are complemented by surface observations, as well as atmospheric (in situ) observations typically made as part of focused airborne field campaigns. The synergy between satellite observations and field campaigns has been an important theme for recent and upcoming activities and plans. In this talk, a review of NASA’s investments in observations relevant to global air quality will be presented, with examples given for a range of pollutants and measurement approaches covering the last twenty-five years. These investments have helped build national and international collaborations such that the global satellite community is now preparing to deploy a constellation of satellites that together will provide fundamental advances in global observations for air quality.",

            "abstract": "Observations of past plate tectonic - like motions in Europa’s icy lithosphere have been reported in previous studies. Quantifying the nature, age, and amount of plate motion is important for geophysical models of Europa’s ice shell and for astrobiology, since subsumed pates could drive the flow of nutrients into the subsurface ocean. We have used GPlates software (Williams et al., GSA Today 2012) and a mosaic of regional-resolution Galileo SSI data from orbits E11, E15, E17, and E19 to make interactive reconstructions of both the Northern Falga region (60N, 220W) and the Castalia Macula region (0N, 225W). The advantage of this method is that plate motions are calculated on a sphere, while still maintaining the original Galileo image pieces in their proper geographic locations.\nPrevious work on the Castalia Macula region (Patterson et al. J.Struct.Geol. 2006) and the adjacent Phaidra Linea region (Patterson and Ernst, LPSC 2011) found offsets along spreading boundaries, and then calculated the best fit finite rotations to close those offsets. Though this method is mathematically rigorous and gives a statistical goodness of fit, it is not easy to test multiple hypotheses for candidate piercing points or divisions of candidate plate boundaries. Through the interactive environment, we found that we could better account for observed offsets in this region by breaking it into 32 different plates. Patterson and Ernst broke the Phaidra region into 6 plates which exhibited nonrigid behavior, where our study breaks it into 16 rigid plates.\nThe Northern Falga Regio area is interesting due to the potential for large amounts of subsumption of Europa’s icy crust in this location. The previous reconstruction (Kattenhorn and Prockter, Nat.Geosci. 2014) was based on planar geometry, and we have replicated these results using a spherically-based reconstruction. We will present the plate maps and reconstructions for both of these regions, along with the best fit rotation poles.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed 64 high quality magnetic profiles crossing the Central Indian Ridge and the Southeast Indian Ridge between 21°S and 28°S. All profiles cover the entire Anomaly 1 and they do not cross discontinuities, major faults, or significant isolated bathymetric features. When stacked over single ridge segments, correlated variations in the magnetic field become apparent. However, these variations change from one ridge segment to the next and when stacked over the entire ridge, all correlated variations are lost. Therefore we conclude that the correlated variations represent local effects, in this case mainly caused by bathymetry and irregularities of the spreading process which are typically limited to one ridge segment. Since we do not see any anomalies associated to geomagnetic excursions, we carried out forward modelling which shows that any excursion lasting for longer than 10.000 years should become visible in our data, thus putting an upper limit of 10.000 years to the maximum duration of geomagnetic excursions during the Brunhes.",

To meet the demand of water supply, the East River basin administration has conducted the water quantity operation over the basin since 2008. However, the operation target has been hardly achieved largely due to poor precipitation predictions. We try to improve seasonal precipitation predictions by correcting the bias of the NCEP CFSv2 forecasts. A variety of bias correction methods are applied to correct CFSv2 forecasts based on a long term datasets of gauge observations and CFSv2 reforecasts. The proper bias methods are selected for the flood and the dry season respectively based on evaluation results.

            "abstract": "Risk of extreme weather events like storms, heat extremes, and floods has already risen due to anthropogenic climate change and is likely to increase further under future global warming. Additionally, the structure of the global economy has changed importantly in the last decades. In the process of globalization, local economies have become more and more interwoven forming a complex network. Together with a trend towards lean production, this has resulted in a strong dependency of local manufacturers on global supply and value added chains, which may render the economic network more vulnerable to climatic extremes; outages of local manufacturers trigger indirect losses, which spread along supply chains and can even outstrip direct losses.\nAccordingly, in a comprehensive climate risk assessment these inter-linkages should be considered. Here, we present acclimate, an agent based dynamic damage propagation model. Its agents are production and consumption sites, which are interlinked by economic flows accounting for the complexity as well as the heterogeneity of the global supply network. Assessing the economic response on the timescale of the adverse event, the model permits to study temporal and spatial evolution of indirect production losses during the disaster and in the subsequent recovery phase of the economy.\nIn this study, we focus on the dynamic economic resilience defined here as the ratio of direct to total losses. This implies that the resilience of the system under consideration is low if the high indirect losses are high. We find and assess a nonlinear dependence of the resilience on the disaster size. Further, we analyze the influence of the network structure upon resilience and discuss the potential of warehousing as an adaptation option.",

Emission inventories are a key tool for air quality management, with the United Kingdom’s National and London Atmospheric Emission Inventories (NAEI & LAEI) being good examples. Assessing the validity of such inventoried is important. Here we report on the technical methodology of matching flux measurements of NOx over a city to inventory estimates.\nWe used an eddy covariance technique to directly measure NOx fluxes from central London on an aircraft flown at low altitude. NOx mixing ratios were measured at 10 Hz time resolution using chemiluminescence (to measure NO) and highly specific photolytic conversion of NO2 to NO (to measure NO2). Wavelet transformation was used to calculate instantaneous fluxes along the flight track for each flight leg. The transformation allows for both frequency and time information to be extracted from a signal, where we quantify the covariance between the de-trended vertical wind and concentration to derive a flux.\nComparison between the calculated fluxes and emission inventory data was achieved using a footprint model, which accounts for contributing source. Using both a backwards lagrangian model and cross-wind dispersion function, we find the footprint extent ranges from 5 to 11 Km in distance from the sample point. We then calculate a relative weighting matrix for each emission inventory within the calculated footprint. The inventories are split into their contributing source sectors with each scaled using up to date emission factors, giving a month; day and hourly scaled estimate which is then compared to the measurement.",

            "abstract": "Aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation in upland soils is the only known terrestrial sink for atmospheric CH4. It is mediated by methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) that possess a high-affinity form of the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO), allowing utilization of CH4 at near-atmospheric, low concentrations (≤ 1.9 µL/L). As cultivation attempts for high-affinity MOB have shown little success to date, there remains much speculation regarding their functioning in different environmental systems.\nFor quantification of microbial functions at the field scale, inhibition experiments are often used as a control and to verify that observed substrate turnover is microbially mediated. Targeting MMO, several compounds have been proposed as inhibitors of CH4 oxidation. However, previous inhibition experiments were mostly conducted in systems dominated by low-affinity MOB, which mediate CH4 oxidation at elevated CH4 concentrations. On the contrary, inhibition experiments targeting high-affinity MOB are scare, particularly at the field scale.\nWe present results of field-scale experiments to investigate effectiveness of and recovery from inhibition of atmospheric CH4 oxidation using the competitive inhibitors CH3F and CH2F2, as well as the non-competitive inhibitor C2H2. The latter is of particular interest, because C2H2 irreversibly binds to MMO, requiring de-novo synthesis of MMO for recovery of CH4 oxidation activity. Experiments were conducted during both winter and summer seasons in a sandy soil. Atmospheric CH4 oxidation was quantified in regular intervals at reference and treatment locations using the soil-profile method with concurrent measurements of soil-water contents and -temperature. Whereas C2H2 inhibition was highly effective in both seasons, the time required for recovery to the level of the reference location was much shorter during the summer experiment (~1 mo compared with 4 mo during winter). Our data provide new insights into the physiology of high-affinity MOB.",

The crustal structures in the source areas of the 2008 Ms 8.0 Wenchuan and the 2013 Ms 7.0 Lushan earthquakes are similar and exhibit prominent low-velocity (low-V) and high-Poisson's ratio anomalies in the source areas, indicating that in addition to compositional variations, fluid-filled rock matrices exist in the Longmenshan fault zone, which may have influenced the nucleation of the two earthquakes. Significant low-V anomalies are revealed between the Wenchuan and Lushan mainshocks, which may explain why their aftershock zones extend northward and southward, respectively. The relocated aftershocks of the 2011 Ms 5.8 Yingjiang and the 2014 Ms 6.5 Ludian earthquakes show a conjugate-shaped distribution, which may explain why the two moderate-sized earthquakes caused heavy damage. The large earthquakes in eastern Tibet are located at boundaries of low- or high-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle. The structural heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle are associated with hot and wet upwelling and corner flows in the big mantle wedge above the subducting Indian slab beneath eastern Tibet, as well as slab dehydration, which affect the seismogenesis in the region.",

            "abstract": "To date, there has been little attention focused on how the value and effectiveness of groundwater management is influenced by the timing of regulatory intervention relative to aquifer depletion. To address this question, we develop an integrated framework that couples an agro-economic model of farmers’ field-level irrigation decision-making with a model of a groundwater abstraction borehole. Unlike existing models that only consider the impact of aquifer depletion on groundwater extraction costs, our model also captures the dynamic changes in well productivity and how these in turn affect crop yields and farmer incomes. We use our model to analyze how the value of imposing groundwater quotas is affected by the prior level of depletion before regulations are introduced. Our results demonstrate that there is a range of aquifer conditions within which regulating groundwater use will deliver long-term economic benefits for farmers. In this range, restricting abstraction rates slows the rate of change in well yields and, as a result, increases agricultural production over the simulated planning horizon. Contrastingly, when current saturated thickness is outside this range, regulating groundwater use will provide negligible social benefits and will impose large negative impacts on farm-level profits. We suggest that there are ‘windows of opportunity’ for managing aquifer depletion that are a function of local hydrology as well as economic characteristics. Regulation that is too early will harm the rural economy needlessly, while regulation that is too late will be unable to prevent aquifer exhaustion. The insights from our model can be a valuable tool to help inform policy decisions about when, and at what level, regulations should be implemented in order to maximize the benefits obtained from limited groundwater resources.",

            "abstract": "The short duration of instrumental SST records makes it difficult to reliably separate anthropogenic-related trends from natural variability, especially in the tropical Pacific. The Sr/Ca ratio of massive corals has been used to lengthen the record and fill data gaps but its reliability has been questioned because different coral colonies on the same reef can have different Sr/Ca-temperature relationships and yield opposing derived SST trends. We exploited a unique multi-year dataset of in situ temperature data to assess whether inter-colony differences are attributable to small-scale oceanographic variability or “vital effects” and to quantify the effect of these differences on temperature estimates and uncertainties. Sr/Ca records from four massive Porites colonies growing on the east and west sides of Jarvis Island, central equatorial Pacific, were compared with temperature data from in situ loggers also placed on the east and west sides. In general, Sr/Ca captured – albeit inconsistently – the occurrence of inter-annual SST events but their amplitude was not consistently recorded by any of the corals. However, the Sr/Ca-temperature regressions derived from the four different colonies were statistically distinct. Assuming these relationships represent the full range of Sr/Ca-temperature calibrations in Jarvis Porites, we assessed how well Sr/Ca of a fossil coral with an unknown Sr/Ca-temperature relationship can constrain past temperatures. Our results indicate that the standard error of prediction methods underestimate the actual error as we could not reliably reconstruct the amplitude or frequency of ENSO events as large as ±2°C. Further, Sr/Ca of one coral implied a statistically significant cooling trend while that of its neighbor implied a warming trend whereas no long-term trend was identified in the instrumental data. This observation of a derived trend where none exists is consistent with observations made independently at other coral reef sites in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing the full range of temperature-Sr/Ca relationships at each study site to estimate the true uncertainty associated with this proxy.",

            "abstract": "Physical and chemical properties of Earth’s mantle are affected by the interactions with volatiles, and especially by water and water-derived species. Thus, the characterization of solubility and kinetics of incorporation for hydrogen in nominally anhydrous minerals is important to understand the behavior of Earth’s deep material under hydrous conditions. Experimental studies on the olivine-water system indicate that significant amounts of hydrogen can be incoporated within olivine as point defects. Extending previous studies, we have focused on the kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in the iron-bearing olivine-water system, performing experiments of hydrogenation of crystallographically oriented olivine single crystals using multi-anvils apparatus at high temperature (900-1200°C) and high pressure (3 GPa). We use polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to characterize the speciation and the quantify the mobility water-derived defects in olivine, to determine diffusion coefficients under upper mantle conditions. Hydrogen diffusivities are obtained by fitting the hydrogen content measured as a function of position along [100] and [001] direction of the olivine sample, by a 1D and 3D numerical models of diffusion,\nOur current results indicate that incorporation of hydroxyl species into iron-bearing olivine is a one-stage process with hydrogen chemical diffusion coefficients around 2.10-12 m2/s at 900 °C parallel to [001] (with E // to [001]). The diffusivities are in the same order of magnitude than previous results from iron-bearing olivine at low pressure. The analysis of the different concentration profiles show an anisotropy of diffusion, with diffusion parallel to [001] faster than [100]. Consequences for electrical conductivity in the uppermost mantle will be discussed.\nThis study was financially supported by ANR JCJC “HyDeep” awarded to NBC.",

Geophysical and geochemical studies find evidence for either of the models. The crust is cooled by a combination of heat diffusion and advection, and hydrothermal circulation is thought to play a key role in distinguishing between both models.\nWe use our numerical model for joint modeling of crustal accretion and hydrothermal circulation1 to test different accretion and hydrothermal cooling scenarios. The results match the seismic and structural observations from the East Pacific Rise2 and the Oman Ophiolite3, with a shallow melt lens at the correct location overlaying a narrow volume of partially molten rocks. Our results show that no more than 25-50% of the lower crust crystallizes in situ and that deep circulation is likely to occur at fast and intermediate spreading ridges. The occurrence of deep hydrothermal cooling however does not rule out that a major portion of the lower crust is formed in the shallow melt lens; our simulations rather suggest that it is necessary independent of where in the lower crust crystallization takes place.\n1 Theissen-Krah, S., Iyer, K., Rupke, L.

            "abstract": "Calcite is an important hydrothermal alteration product in a wide range of environments. The role of calcite in hydrothermal alteration depends on its solubility in geologic fluids, especially H2O. At ambient T and P, calcite solubility is low and it exhibits well-known declining, or “reverse”, solubility with rising T. However, experimental and theoretical studies show that increasing P yields higher solubility and restricts the region of reverse solubility behavior to higher temperature. At 0.2 GPa the reverse solubility region lies at T>600°C; at 0.5 GPa, >800°C. Thus, whereas calcite possesses relatively low solubility in pure H2O in shallow hydrothermal systems (typically <10 ppm C), it is substantially more soluble at conditions of middle and lower crustal metamorphism and magmatism, reaching concentrations ≥1000 ppm. At the higher P of subduction zones, aragonite solubility in H2O is even greater. Thus, neglecting other solubility controls, calcite precipitation is favored as crustal fluids cool and/or decompress. However, the solubility of calcite in H2O also depends strongly on other solutes, pH, and fO2. Sources of alkalinity decrease calcite solubility. In contrast, sources of acidity such as CO2 and Cl increase solubility. Crustal fluids can be enriched in alkali halides such as NaCl. Calcite solubility increases with increasing salt content at a given P and T. From approximately seawater salinity to salt saturation, the fluid behaves as a dilute molten salt and calcite solubility increases as the square of the salt mole fraction regardless of the alkali (Li, Na, K, Cs) or halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) considered. Similar behavior is seen in mixed salt solutions. At lower salinities, solubility behavior is as expected in dilute electrolyte solutions. The transition from dilute electrolyte to molten salt is fundamental to the properties of crustal fluids. Reduction of carbonate species or CO2 in the fluid to CH4, which is common during serpentinization of peridotite, will also increase calcite solubility. Consideration of these effects can yield high CaCO3 solubility and generate complex mobility and deposition patterns in environments ranging from the middle crust to the upper mantle.",

GA is an objective and empirical Bayes method. The emphasis of this talk is on methods to reduce the computational cost of implementing this approach. We will show examples of application of the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach (PCGA). PCGA is Jacobian-free and uses forward solvers as black boxes.

Placing the δ18O and δ13C time series on an orbital-scale age model provides the chronological basis for high-resolution proxy records spanning the Early Pliocene to Early Pleistocene. By comparison with previous published records (DSDP 607, ODP 1090/704, ODP 849, MV0502-AJC), we examine long-term changes in intra and inter-basinal benthic δ13C records in order to trace the ventilation history of deep-water masses. These comparisons highlight that during the warm Early to mid-Pliocene (3.6 to 2.7 Ma) South Atlantic and southwest Pacific gradients where much larger than during the Pleistocene. These findings are not consistent with Late Pleistocene and modern reconstructions in which South Atlantic δ13C values are slightly lower than south Pacific values at depths bathed by LCDW. Thus, indicating that while LCDW bathing the South Atlantic may have had an enhanced NADW signature, such a situation in the southwest Pacific did not exist during the warm mid-Pliocene. Furthermore, while the δ18O record from Site 1123 demonstrates an overall agreement with the global benthic δ18O stack LR04 exhibiting 40-kyr oscillations in ice volume/temperature, the mid to Late Pliocene interval (~3.3 to 2.8 Ma) demonstrates low frequency ice volume/temperature variability consistent with 100-kyr eccentricity. Eustatic sea-level estimates from δ18O values are consistent with all higher-end (22±10 m compared to modern) values for peak interglacial highstands between 2.9-3.2 Ma. Thus, inferring 100-kyr Antarctic ice sheet variability from marine based margins of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) during the mid to Late Pliocene contributed to sea level, whereas after ~2.9 Ma (post interglacial G17) ODP Site δ18O values are inline with eustatic sea-level estimates derived from the benthic δ18O stack, LR04.",

This study compares learning outcomes in both formats and describes resources that make engaging, effective and efficient learning experiences for large classes in an asynchronous online environment.\nOur two hypotheses are: 1) a hands-on geology lab exercise can be converted for efficient fully online use without sacrificing feedback and assessment opportunities; 2) students find either the f2f or DE versions equally effective and enjoyable as learning experiences. Key components are an authentic context, interactive resources including sketching, strategies that enable efficient assessment and feedback on solo and group work, and asynchronous yet productive interaction with peers.\nStudents in the f2f class handle real rock and fossil specimens, work with peers in the lab and classroom, and deliver most results including annotated figures on paper. DE students complete identical tasks using interactive high resolution figures and videos of specimens. Solo work is first delivered for automated assessment and feedback, then students engage asynchronously in small groups to improve results and discuss implications. Chronostratigraphy and other interpretations are sketched on prepared template images using a simple open-source sketching app that ensures equal access and consistent results that are efficient to assess by peers and instructors.\nLearning outcomes based on subsequent quizzes, sketches, and lab results (paper for f2f students and automated data entry for DE students), show that f2f and online students demonstrate knowledge and scientific interpretations of comparable quality. Effective engagement and group work are demonstrated for f2f students using video and survey data, and for DE students using learning management system tracking data and similar survey data. Finally, these initiatives are shown to be scalable to classes of many students by comparing the time required for instructors to run and grade the lab in both settings.",

            "abstract": "It is essential that a strong conceptual model underlies numerical modelling of basin fluxes and is inclusive of all factors and routeways through the system. Even under stable environmental conditions river fluxes in large basins vary spatially and temporally. Spatial variations arise due to location in the basin, relation to sources and connectivity, and due to morphology, boundary resistance and hydraulics of successive reaches. Temporal variations at a range of scales, from seasonal to decadal, occur within averaged ’stable’ conditions, which produce changes in morphology and flux and subsequent feedback effects. Sediment flux in a reach can differ between similar peak magnitude events, depending on duration, season, connectivity and supply state, and existing morphology. Autogenic processes such as channel pattern and position changes, vegetation changes, and floodplain cyclicity also take place within the system. The major drivers of change at decadal-centennial timescales are assumed to be climate, land use cover and practices, and direct catchment and channel modification. Different parts of the system will have different trajectories of adjustment, depending on their location and spatial relation to connectivity within the system and on the reach morphological and resistance characteristics. These will govern the rate and extent of transmission of changes. The changes will also be influenced by the occurrence and sequence of flow events and their feedback effects, in relation to changing thresholds produced by the response to the environmental changes. It is essential that the underlying dynamics and inherent variability are recognised in numerical modelling and river management and that spatial sequencing of changes and their feedbacks are incorporated. The challenge is to produce quantifiable relations of the rate or propagation of changes through a basin given spatial variability of reach characteristics, under dynamic flow scenarios.",

Here we studied expansion of the nine largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the Great Plains from 2000 to 2009 period using QuikSCAT backscatter data processed with the Dense Sampling Method (DSM). A 5x5 Gaussian Kernel Smoothing (with sigma=1) was applied to reduce noise in DSM backscatter images, which have a nominal spatial posting of 1 km. The outputs were then converted into vector files and coupled with the percent impervious surface area (ISA) data from the 2001 and 2011 National Land Cover Datasets to show changes in urban extent using two independent sources. The results demonstrate the capability of DSM scatterometer data to delineate urban extent and change. For instance, the Dallas – Fort Worth (DFW) MSA was separated into three sub-regions based on backscatter (cf. figure). The urban core area is identified by large commercial and industrial structures correspond to a high backscatter center greater than -6 dB. The urban built-up area consisting of smaller buildings falls within the -6 dB and -8 dB contours. Backscatter of the urban edge, where residential and other land uses are mixed, falls within the -8 dB and -10 dB contours. From 2000 to 2009, total urban area in DFW increased from 3484 to 5066 square kilometers, according to the filtered scatterometer data. The change in ISA between 2001 and 2011 within the -8 to -10 dB contour was 101 square kilometers, of which 73% occurred in the northern half of the DFW MSA. The Mann-Kendall trend test applied to the area time series indicates expanding spatial trends in every sub-region. Most changes occurred along the northern suburban edge. The distance between the 2000 and 2009 -10 dB contours ranged from 1.5 to 14.6 km with an average of 6 km and a coefficient of variation of 48%.

To better understand the effect of the near-stream zones on stream biogeochemistry, we conducted a field study on a groundwater-fed stream located in the rare Charitable Research Reserve, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. This study focused on monitoring the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrient elements within the riparian and hyporheic zones of the stream. Several piezometer nests and a series of passive (diffusion) water samplers, known as peepers, were installed along longitudinal and lateral transects centered on the stream to obtain data on the groundwater chemistry. Groundwater upwelling along the stream resulted in distinctly different groundwater types and associated nitrate concentrations between small distances in the riparian zone (<4m). After the upstream source of the stream surface water, concentrations of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, SO42- and carbon) did not significantly change before the downstream outlet. Although reduction of nitrate and sulphate were found in the riparian zone of the stream, this did not significantly influence the chemistry of the adjacent stream water. Also, minimal retention in the hyporheic zones limited reduction of reactive compounds (NO3- and SO42-) within the stream channel. The results showed that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and residence time of water in the hyporheic zone and in surface water limited denitrification.",

The Ar/N2 ratio remains constant over seasons, as expected for non-condensible species.\nOn the other hand, methane, another non-condensible species, shows episodic spikes in mixing ratio but no particular seasonal trend with the measurements in hand.

Complementary observations of contemporary D/H from ground-based telescopes further reinforce the view of substantial liquid water on the surface of Mars in the past.\nWhereas the abovementioned isotope ratios are a good indicator of the evolutionary history of Mars in the past 4 billion years, the isotope ratios of the heavy noble gases, especially xenon, measured on Curiosity provide a better understanding of the very earliest periods when a massive loss of atmosphere took place by hydrodynamic escape or blowoff.",

            "abstract": "To determine the duration of the Shuram carbon-isotope excursion (SE), we conducted paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and carbon isotopic studies of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation at the Dongdahe-Feidatian section near Chengjiang in South China. Zhu et al. (2007)1 indicate that the SE is 97.4 ± 9.5 m thick at this locality. The SE may record the oxidation of the ocean just before the Cambrian explosion. We collected unoriented samples for rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy at 10 cm intervals for 68 m of the Dongdahe section and 101 oriented cores at 2-3 m intervals for paleomagnetism. Comparing our carbon isotope measurements, made on chips from the cores, to Zhu et al.’s previous work shows that the Dongdahe section records 70% of the excursion. The paleomagnetic samples were alternating field and thermally demagnetized, but were totally remagnetized in the present day geomagnetic field (D=358˚, I=38˚). Multi-taper method spectral analysis of the mass-normalized susceptibility of the 600 unoriented samples revealed six strong spectral peaks that rose above the 95% confidence limits of the robust red noise. The stratigraphic thickness of these cycles is 410, 89.3, 32.5, 27.6, 22.1 and 20.9 cm. A smaller peak with a wavelength of 110 cm was also observed. Based on the ratios of these wavelengths we interpret them to be astronomically-forced. If the 410 cm peak is set to long eccentricity (405 kyr), then the other peaks yield near-Milankovitch periods of short eccentricity (109 and 88 kyr), obliquity (32 and 27 kyr), and precession (22 and 21 kyr). A strong peak with a wavelength of 1710 cm was also observed, but is not interpreted to be orbitally-forced. The sediment accumulation rate for the Dongdahe section is 1 cm/kyr making the duration of the SE in South China 9.74 ± 0.95 Myr, in excellent agreement with estimates from Australia and California, thus supporting a primary origin for the SE and possibly the cause of the Cambrian explosion.\n1PPP 254 7-61",

The ozone line was observed at an altitude near 95 km and latitude of 38 degrees north using three spectrometers located at the MIT Haystack Observatory (Westford, MA), Chelmsford High School (Chelmsford, MA), and Union College (Schenectady, NY) pointed south at 8 degrees. Observations from 2009 through 2014 are used to derive the nightly-averaged seasonal variation in meridional velocity, as well as the seasonally-averaged variation with local solar time. The results indicate a seasonal trend in which the winds at 95 km come from the north at about 10 m/s in the summer of the northern hemisphere, and from the south at about 10 m/s in the winter. Nighttime data from -5 to +5 local solar time show a gradual transition of the meridional wind velocity from about -20 m/s to 20 m/s. These two trends correlate with nighttime wind measurements from the Millstone Hill High-Resolution Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) in Westford, MA. The FPI uses the 557.7 nm green line nightglow from atomic oxygen that occupies the same region of the mesosphere as the ozone centered at 95 km. The results have also been compared with average meridional winds measured with meteor radar.",

The system will provide seamless, high-resolution, continuously cycling forecasts of streamflow and other hydrologic outputs of value from both deterministic- and ensemble-type runs. WRF-Hydro will form the core of the NWC national water modeling strategy, supporting NWS hydrologic forecast operations along with emergency response and water management efforts of partner agencies. Input and output from the system will be comprehensively verified via the NWC Water Resource Evaluation Service.\nHydrologic events occur on a wide range of temporal scales, from fast acting flash floods, to long-term flow events impacting water supply. In order to capture this range of events, the initial operational WRF-Hydro configuration will feature 1) hourly analysis runs, 2) short-and medium-range deterministic forecasts out to two day and ten day horizons and 3) long-range ensemble forecasts out to 30 days. All three of these configurations are underpinned by a 1km execution of the NoahMP land surface model, with channel routing taking place on 2.67 million NHDPlusV2 catchments covering the CONUS and contributing areas. Additionally, the short- and medium-range forecasts runs will feature surface and sub-surface routing on a 250m grid, while the hourly analyses will feature this same 250m routing in addition to nudging-based assimilation of US Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow observations. A limited number of major reservoirs will be configured within the model to begin to represent the first-order impacts of streamflow regulation.",

            "abstract": "We present results of time-dependent modeling of the inner heliosphere using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). Two types of simulations are performed: one concentrates on the background solar wind specification, while the other deals with the propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). For simulations of the first type we coupled the LFM-helio code with the ADAPT-driven WSA model. We present some details of the coupling machinery and then simulate selected periods characterized by very low solar activity with no significant energetic particle events or CMEs. The results of the model are compared with MESSENGER, ACE, STEREO A and B spacecraft to probe both radial and temporal evolution of solar wind structure. The results indicate, in particular, the importance of time-dependent modeling for more accurate prediction of high-speed streams and heliospheric current sheet structure when the spacecraft skim its surface. We will comment on the formation of magnetic field reversals in pseudostreamer regions, which is an intrinsically time-dependent phenomenon, and on the current sheet corrugation caused by solar wind momentum shears. For the second type of time-dependent inner heliosphere simulations we have coupled LFM-helio with the MAS MHD model of the corona. We first present results of idealized coupled MAS/LFM-helio simulations with symmetric solar wind background and no rotation intended to test the interface for seamless propagation of transients from the corona into the inner heliosphere domain. We then simulate an event with a CME propagating through a realistic heliosphere background including corotating interaction regions. We show details of propagation of flux-rope CMEs through the boundary between MAS and LFM-helio and compare the results between the two codes in the heliospheric domain. The results indicate that the coupling works well, although some differences in the solutions are observed probably due to differences in numerical schemes and resolution.",

Primary and secondary particles for SPE and GCR are transported through the respective atmospheres of Earth or Mars, space vehicle, and astronaut’s body tissues using NASA’s HZETRN/QMSFRG computer code. Space radiation protection methods, which are derived largely from ground-based methods recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) or International Commission on Radiological Protections (ICRP), are built on the principles of risk justification, limitation, and ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable). However, because of the large uncertainties in high charge and energy (HZE) particle radiobiology and the small population of space crews, NASA develops distinct methods to implement a space radiation protection program. For the fatal cancer risks, which have been considered the dominant risk for GCR, the NASA Space Cancer Risk (NSCR) model has been developed from recommendations by NCRP; and undergone external review by the National Research Council (NRC), NCRP, and through peer-review publications. The NSCR model uses GCR environmental models, particle transport codes describing the GCR modification by atomic and nuclear interactions in atmospheric shielding coupled with spacecraft and tissue shielding, and NASA-defined quality factors for solid cancer and leukemia risk estimates for HZE particles. By implementing the NSCR model, the exposure risks from various heliospheric conditions are assessed for the radiation environments for various-class mission types to understand architectures and strategies of human exploration missions and ultimately to contribute to the optimization of radiation safety and well-being of space crewmembers participating in long-term space missions.",

Here, 2.3 μm-resolution silhouettes of crystals imaged by a Cloud Particle Imager (CPI) obtained from the Tropical Warm Pool – International Cloud and Mixed Phase Arctic Cloud Experiments are combined with wavelet analysis to characterize crystal surfaces. Wavelet analysis is a multiresolution tool that is applied to reveal underlying textural details of crystal images on several spatial scales. Images are defined as matrices in which each pixel corresponds to a gray level intensity value. Wavelet functions are used to decompose crystal images into a set of approximation and detail components by applying high and low-pass filters to the rows and columns of the image matrix. Following each level of decomposition, gray level intensity histograms are produced by calculating the frequency distribution of pixel intensities from the detailed coefficients, which contain artifacts, but also important textural information.\nFirst-order statistics are calculated from gray level histograms of the detailed coefficients to estimate variability across crystal surfaces, but lack information on the spatial distribution of pixel intensities. Thus, a second-order statistical measure, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), is also extracted from the detailed coefficients to provide a more precise measure of surface texture. GLCMs are calculated by how often pairs of pixels with specific values and in certain spatial relationships occur in an image. Several degrees of texture are defined by first and second-order statistics to investigate how the surface texture of crystals varies with environmental conditions. Estimations of surface roughness using the proposed methods may have implications for improving bulk scattering calculations used in satellite retrieval algorithms and global climate model parameterizations.",

However, several large statistical studies in the past two decades, most notably Fraser and Nguyen [2001], have provided little support for this location. In this study we present a survey of the most intense EMIC waves observed by the EMFISIS fluxgate magnetometer on the Van Allen Probes-A spacecraft (with apogee at 5.9 RE) from its launch through the end of 2014, and have compared their location with simultaneous electron density data obtained by the EFW electric field instrument and ring current ion flux data obtained by the HOPE and RBSPICE instruments. We show distributions of these waves as a function of distance inside or outside the PP as a function of local time sector, frequency band (H+, He+, or both), and timing relative to magnetic storms and substorms. Most EMIC waves in this data set occurred within 1 RE of the PP in all local time sectors, but very few were limited to ± 0.1 RE, and most of these occurred in the 06-12 MLT sector during non-storm conditions. The majority of storm main phase waves in the dusk sector occurred inside the PP. He+ band waves dominated at most local times inside the PP, and H+ band waves were never observed there. Although the presence of elevated fluxes of ring current protons was common to all events, the configuration of lower energy ion populations varied as a function of geomagnetic activity and storm phase.",

            "abstract": "Igneous petrology is undergoing a major paradigm shift. For the past century, the paradigm of the magma chamber - a single, melt-dominated magma body - has informed models of magma evolution and underpinned studies of volcanic processes. Over the past decade, however, the community has converted to a model of complex magma storage regions composed primarily of crystal-rich “mush”, with crystal-poor melt partitioned into sill-like lenses that can be tapped, either sequentially or simultaneously, to feed volcanic eruptions. Why has this conceptual shift occurred? Evidence for complex magma storage regions derives from numerous sources, including (1) geophysical evidence for sill-like melt bodies, (2) petrologic studies, which provide strong evidence that many erupted magma contain crystals that have been incorporated from different parts of the magma storage region, and over different time scales, and (3) geochemical evidence that magmatic gases may accumulate and be released independently from the melt. These observations suggest that magma storage regions are not only complex, but also dynamic, in that the solid (crystal), liquid (melt) and gas (exsolved volatiles) components may move and interact at different rates. Critically, adopting a melt-mush model requires a re-evaluation of processes responsible for melt segregation, evolution and eruption. For example, melt segregation and evolution may depend more on processes related to reactive flow of melts and fluids through porous crystal networks than sinking or floating of crystals within a (dominantly liquid) body. Additionally, patterns of eruptive behaviour may be determined as much by the stability of, and interactions between, individual melt lenses as by the evolution of a single melt body. From this perspective, studies of volcanic processes can be linked directly to processes of magma generation and evolution. Forging these links provides an exciting challenge for the future.",

            "abstract": "Large scale energy storage will be required to mitigate offsets between electric energy demand and the fluctuating electric energy production from renewable sources like wind farms, if renewables dominate energy supply. Porous formations in the subsurface could provide the large storage capacities required if chemical energy carriers such as hydrogen gas produced during phases of energy surplus are stored. This work assesses the behavior of a porous media hydrogen storage operation through numerical scenario simulation of a synthetic, heterogeneous sandstone formation formed by an anticlinal structure. The structural model is parameterized using data available for the North German Basin as well as data given for formations with similar characteristics. Based on the geological setting at the storage site a total of 15 facies distributions is generated and the hydrological parameters are assigned accordingly. Hydraulic parameters are spatially distributed according to the facies present and include permeability, porosity relative permeability and capillary pressure. The storage is designed to supply energy in times of deficiency on the order of seven days, which represents the typical time span of weather conditions with no wind. It is found that using five injection/extraction wells 21.3 mio sm³ of hydrogen gas can be stored and retrieved to supply 62,688 MWh of energy within 7 days. This requires a ratio of working to cushion gas of 0.59. The retrievable energy within this time represents the demand of about 450000 people. Furthermore it is found that for longer storage times, larger gas volumes have to be used, for higher delivery rates additionally the number of wells has to be increased. The formation investigated here thus seems to offer sufficient capacity and deliverability to be used for a large scale hydrogen gas storage operation.",

            "abstract": "Land use has generally been considered as a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Global changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, water and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Especially the forests influence climate through physical, chemical and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality.\nGlobal Warming and Climate Change are the two main fundamental problems facing Turkey as well as the World. The expedition and size of this change is becoming noticeably conspicuous now. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the global temperature has been increased of about 0.74 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change. The general scientific opinions on the climate change states that in the past 50 years, global warming has effected the human life resulting with very obvious influences. High rates of deforestation within a country are most commonly linked to population growth and poverty. In Turkey, the forests are destroyed for various reasons resulting to a change in the climate. This study examines the causes of deforestation and its consequences on the climate change in Turkey. Suggestions on preventing negative effects are also given.",

            "abstract": "The AMMA international project aims at improving our knowledge and understanding of the West African monsoon and its variability with an emphasis on daily-to-interannual timescales. AMMA is motivated by an interest in fundamental scientific issues and by the societal need for improved prediction of the WAM and its impacts on water resources, health and food security for West African nations.\nThe West African monsoon (WAM) has a distinctive annual cycle in rainfall that remains a challenge to understand and predict. The location of peak rainfall, which resides in the Northern Hemisphere throughout the year, moves from the ocean to the land in boreal spring. Around the end of June there is a rapid shift in the location of peak rainfall between the coast and around 10°N where it remains until about the end of August. In September the peak rainfall returns equatorward at a relatively steady pace and is located over the ocean again by November. The fact that the peak rainfall migrates irregularly compared to the peak solar heating is due to the interactions that occur between the land, the atmosphere and the ocean.\nTo gain a better understanding of this complex climate system, a large international research programme was launched in 2002, the biggest of its kind into environment and climate ever attempted in Africa. AMMA has involved a comprehensive field experiment bringing together ocean, land and atmospheric measurements, on timescales ranging from hourly and daily variability up to the changes in seasonal activity over a number of years.\nThis presentation will focus on the description of the field programme and its accomplishments, and address some key questions that have been recently identified to form the core of AMMA-Phase 2.",

Intensively open biomass burning episodes were identified from late September to early October by satellite fire and aerosol optical depth maps. During the biomass burning episodes, concentrations of PM2.5, OC, EC, and WSOC increased by a factor of 4-12 compared to non-biomass-burning periods. Non-sea-salt potassium is strongly correlated with PM2.5, OC, EC and WSOC, suggesting an important contribution of biomass burning emission. The enrichment in both the non-sea-salt potassium and chlorine is significantly larger than other inorganic species, indicating that biomass burning aerosols in Sanjiang Plain is mostly fresh and less aged. In addition, WSOC to OC ratio is relatively lower compared to that reported in biomass burning aerosols in tropical regions, supporting that biomass burning aerosols in Sanjiang Plain is mostly primary and secondary organic aerosols is not significant. A lower average δ13C value (-26.2‰) is found for the biomass-burning aerosols, suggesting a dominant contribution from combustion of C3 plants in the studied region.",

            "abstract": "West Africa is known for having experienced an extreme drought starting at the end of the 1960s that is recognized to be the greatest climatic signal at regional scale since the beginning of meteorological measurements. Despite a moderate recovery of the annual precipitations since the 1990s in the Central and Eastern Sahel, rainfall over the last two decades remains lower by 15% than during the period 1950-1970. Paradoxically these persisting dry conditions have been accompanied by a dramatic increase of flood fatalities especially over the recent 10 years.\nUsing a homogeneous dataset of 41 daily rainfall series covering the period 1950-2010, an integrated regional approach based on the statistical extreme value theory was then used to reduce the local sampling effects and to provide robust estimates of intense rainfall distributions to be analyzed in conjunction with the annual rainfall series. This led to identify some key rainfall regime characteristics related to the decadal scale rainfall variability over the region.\nThe main factor of the rainfall deficit during the great 1970-2000 drought was a lower occurrence of rainy days, extreme rainy days being the most affected. Over the last ten years, the Sahelian rainfall regime is characterized by a lasting deficit of the number of rainy days, while at the same time the extreme rainfall occurrence is on the rise. As a consequence the proportion of annual rainfall associated with extreme rainfall has increased from 17% in the 1970-1990 years to 19% in the 1991-2000 years and to 22% in the 2001-2010 years. This tends to support the idea that a more extreme climate has been observed over the last 10 years, with a persisting deficit of the occurrence of rainfall associated with an increase of the occurrence of extreme daily rainfall. Our results also suggest that the intensification of the precipitation regime has likely contributed to the aggravation of the hydrological risks in the Sahel.",

            "abstract": "Solar EUV irradiance is an important driver of space weather models. Large changes in EUV and x-ray irradiances create large variability in the ionosphere and thermosphere. Proxies such as the F10.7 cm radio flux, have provided reasonable estimates of the EUV flux but as the space weather models become more accurate and the demands of the customers become more stringent, proxies are no longer adequate. Furthermore, proxies are often provided only on a daily basis and shorter time scales are becoming important. Also, there is a growing need for multi-day forecasts of solar EUV irradiance to drive space weather forecast models.\nIn this presentation we will describe the needs and requirements for solar EUV irradiance information from the space weather modeler’s perspective. We will then translate these requirements into solar observational requirements such as spectral resolution and irradiance accuracy. We will also describe the activities at NOAA to provide long-term solar EUV irradiance observations and derived products that are needed for real-time space weather modeling.",

            "abstract": "Within the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Aerosol_cci (2010 - 2017) conducts intensive work to improve algorithms for the retrieval of aerosol information from European sensors. By the end of 2015 full mission time series of 2 GCOS-required aerosol parameters are completely validated and released: Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from dual view ATSR-2 / AATSR radiometers (3 algorithms, 1995 - 2012), and stratospheric extinction profiles from star occultation GOMOS spectrometer (2002 – 2012). Additionally, a 35-year multi-sensor time series of the qualitative Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) together with sensitivity information and an AAI model simulator is available. Complementary aerosol properties requested by GCOS are in a “round robin” phase, where various algorithms are inter-compared: fine mode AOD, mineral dust AOD (from the thermal IASI spectrometer), absorption information and aerosol layer height. As a quasi-reference for validation in few selected regions with sparse ground-based observations the multi-pixel GRASP algorithm for the POLDER instrument is used.\nValidation of first dataset versions (vs. AERONET, MAN) and inter-comparison to other satellite datasets (MODIS, MISR, SeaWIFS) proved the high quality of the available datasets comparable to other satellite retrievals and revealed needs for algorithm improvement (for example for higher AOD values) which were taken into account for a reprocessing. The datasets contain pixel level uncertainty estimates which are also validated. The paper will summarize and discuss the results of major reprocessing and validation conducted in 2015. The focus will be on the ATSR, GOMOS and IASI datasets. Pixel level uncertainties validation will be summarized and discussed including unknown components and their potential usefulness and limitations. Opportunities for time series extension with successor instruments of the Sentinel family will be described and the complementarity of the different satellite aerosol products (e.g. dust vs. total AOD, ensembles from different algorithms for the same sensor) will be discussed.",

It is well known that anticyclonic supercells, which can spawn anticyclonic tornadoes, form in an environment in which the vertical shear vector turns in a counterclockwise manner with height. Less rare, however, are anticyclonic tornadoes that appear in cyclonically rotating, right-moving supercells. When these anticyclonic tornadoes have been documented, they have occurred in tandem with a cyclonic tornado or intense mesocyclone. In this talk we will present Doppler radar documentation and photographs and videos of anticyclonic-cyclonic tornado pairs. We will then describe the environmental conditions under which they occur, with emphasis on any special conditions that observationally seem to favor their development.",

            "abstract": "A critical aspect of human-induced climate change is how it will affect climatological mean and extreme precipitation around the world. To leading order, the increased ability of the atmosphere to hold moisture as it warms, intensifies moisture transports, making subtropical dry regions drier and tropical and mid- to high latitude wet regions wetter. But regionally, precipitation change will also depend on how the atmospheric circulation responds to warming.\nDuring Northern Hemisphere winter, climate models predict a robust (in terms of structure) change in the stationary wave field that brings wetting southerlies to the west coast of North America and drying northerlies to interior southwest North America and the Mediterranean. Here, the underlying cause of this change is investigated. Stationary wave model experiments reaveal that the strengthening of the zonal wind in the sub-tropical upper troposphere is primarily responsible through it's influence on the character of intermediate scale stationary waves. A robust and easily understood model response to global warming is, therefore, the prime cause and it should be expected to happen to some degree.\nHowever, there is considerable model diversity in the magnitude of the stationary wave response and almost 50% of the model spread over North America can be explained through this mechanistic understanding, allowing an improved estimate of where the real world will sit within the spectrum of model behavior. It is concluded that many models are likely overestimating the magnitude of this response and as a result, the wetting of the North American west coast and drying in the interior south west will likely be weaker than predicted by the majority of models and the multi-model mean. The implications of this for future predicted hydroclimate extremes will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Surface roughness is a key property of soils that affects the various processes involved in their evolution such as solar absorption, erosion or moisture, both on Earth and other Solar System surfaces. In the 80's, B.Hapke provided an approximate analytic solution for the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of a particulate medium and, later on, included the effect of surface roughness as a correction factor for the BRDF of a smooth surface. The effect of roughness on the BRDF is modeled as a shadowing function of the so-called roughness parameter, which is the mean slope angle of the facets composing the surface integrated over all scales from the sub-millimeter to the kilometer scales.\nHapke model is widely used in planetary sciences to retrieve the roughness parameter from observed BRDFs. Yet the physical meaning of the retrieved roughness is not clear as the scale at which it happens is not defined. This work aims at understanding the relative impact of the roughness defined at each scale to the BRDF in order to test the ability of the singly retrieved roughness parameter at describing the ground truth.\nWe propose to perform a wavelet analysis on meter-sized digital elevation models (DEM) generated from various volcanic and sedimentary terrains at high-mm-scale spatial resolution. It consists in splitting the DEM in several spatial frequencies and in simulating the BRDF at each scale with a ray-tracing code. Also the global BRDF is simulated so that the relative contribution of each scale can be studied. Then the Hapke model is fitted to the global BRDF to retrieve the roughness parameter. We will expose and discuss the results of this study.\nFigure: BRDF of a’a lava DEM simulated at varying azimut (φi) and incidence angles (i), in the principal plan.

            "abstract": "The Seine river, located in the temperate climate of northern France and flowing over a large sedimentary basins that hosts multilayer aquifers, is characterized by small temporal variations of its discharge. However, the presence of a megacity (Paris) and a wide area of intensive agriculture combined with climate change puts pressure on the water resources both in terms of quality and quantity.\nPrevious research projects have estimated the impact of climate change on the water resource of the Seine basin, with the uncertainties associated to climate projections, hydrological models or downscaling methods. The water resource was projected to decrease by -14 % ± 10 % in 2050 and -28 +/-16% in 2100. This led to new studies that focus on the combined impact of climate change and adaptations. The tested adaptations are: a reduction of the groundwater abstractions, evolution of land use, development of small dams to « harvest water » or artificial recharge of aquifers.\nThe communication of the results of these projects to stakeholders have led to the development on new indicators that better express the risk on the water resource management, especially for the groundwater. For instance maps of the evolution of piezometric head are difficult to interpret. To better express the risk evolution, a new indicator was defined: the evolution of the groundwater crisis duration, ie, the period when the charge of the aquifer is below the crisis piezometric level defined by the stakeholders. Such crisis piezometric levels are used to help defining the period when the groundwater abstraction should be reduced. Such maps are more efficient to communicate with water resources managers.\nThis communication will focus on the results from the MEDDE Explore 2070 and ANR Oracle projects.",

            "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effects of geochemical interactions when CO2 is used to create the fractures necessary to produce hydrocarbons from low-permeability Middle Bakken sandstone. The primary objectives are to: (1) identify and understand the geochemical reactions related to CO2-based fracturing, and (2) assess potential changes of reservoir property. Three autoclave experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions exposing middle Bakken core fragments to supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) only and to CO2-saturated synthetic brine. Ion-milled core samples were examined before and after the reaction experiments using scanning electron microscope, which enabled us to image the reaction surface in extreme details and unambiguously identify mineral dissolution and precipitation. The most significant changes in the reacted rock samples exposed to the CO2-saturated brine is dissolution of the carbonate minerals, particularly calcite which displays severely corrosion. Dolomite grains were corroded to a lesser degree. Quartz and feldspars remained intact and some pyrite framboids underwent slight dissolution. Additionally, small amount of calcite precipitation took place as indicated by numerous small calcite crystals formed at the reaction surface and in the pores. The aqueous solution composition changes confirm these petrographic observations with increase in Ca and Mg and associated minor elements and very slight increase in Fe and sulfate. When exposed to sc-CO2 only, changes observed include etching of calcite grain surface and precipitation of salt crystals (halite and anhydrite) due to evaporation of residual pore water into the sc-CO2 phase. Dolomite and feldspars remained intact and pyrite grains were slightly altered. Mercury intrusion capillary pressure tests on reacted and unreacted samples shows an increase in porosity when an aqueous phase is present but no overall porosity change caused by sc-CO2. It also suggests an increase in permeability in the former case and possibly a minor decrease in the latter case.",

            "abstract": "Silicate post-perovskite is found at the Earth's core-mantle boundary, 2900 km below the Earth's surface. Understanding the mechanical properties of this phase is important for constraining the dynamics of this region. It is, however, a multiscale problem with post-perovskite defects driving the behavior of single-crystals, themselves parts of polycrystals, polycrystals plastically deforming due to mantle convection. Here, we wish to address one aspect of this multiscale problem by analyzing the behavior of individual grains of post-perovskite inside a polycrystalline aggregate. Post-perovskite is not stable under ambient pressures and should be studied under the pressures of the Earth's core-mantle boundary: 135 GPa, We use diamond anvil cells to generate such pressure conditions and study grains of post-perovskite using multigrain crystallography, in-situ, at pressures above 1 megabar. Experiment was performed at the ID11 beamline of the ESRF on a 80 μm diameter and 20 μm thickness post-perovskite sample to identify grains of post-perovskite and follow their behavior inside a polycrystalline aggregate. Diamond anvil cells allow experiments under extreme conditions but access to sample diffraction and sample rotation are limited. Such limitation in sample access can be a problem for multigrain crystallography. Hence, in this presentation, we will investigate the fine details of such analysis. In particular, we will focus on evaluating the proportion of grains that can be indexed successfully and how grains can be localized within the sample. Eventually, these results will allow us to follow the orientation and position of hundreds of grains inside a polycrystalline aggregate undergoing physical processes such as plastic deformation or phase transformations.",

            "abstract": "Planning for a tsunami evacuation is challenging for California communities due to the variety of earthquake sources that could generate a tsunami. A maximum tsunami inundation zone is currently the basis for all tsunami evacuations in California, although an Evacuation Playbook consisting of specific event-based evacuation phases relating to flooding severity is in development. We chose to investigate the Evacuation Playbook approach for the island community of Alameda, CA since past reports estimated a significant difference in numbers of residents in the maximum inundation zone when compared to an event-based inundation zone. In order to recognize variations in the types of residents and businesses within each phase, a population exposure analysis was conducted for each of the four Alameda evacuation phases. A pedestrian evacuation analysis using an anisotropic, path distance model was also conducted to understand the time it would take for populations to reach high ground by foot. Initial results suggest that the two islands of the City of Alameda have different situations when it comes to the four tsunami evacuation phases. Pedestrian evacuation results suggest that Bay Farm Island would have more success evacuating by vehicle due to limited nearby high ground for pedestrians to reach safety. Therefore, agent-based traffic simulation software was used to model vehicle evacuation off Bay Farm Island. Initial results show that Alameda Island could face challenges evacuating numerous boat docks and a large beach for phases 1 and 2, whereas Bay Farm Island is unaffected at these phases but might be challenged with evacuating by vehicle for phases 3 and maximum due to congestion on limited egress routes. A better understanding of the population exposure within each tsunami Evacuation Playbook phase and the time it would take to evacuate out of each phase by foot or vehicle will help emergency managers implement the evacuation phases during an actual tsunami event.",

            "abstract": "Deep borehole disposal of high-level radioactive waste is under consideration as a potential alternative to shallower mined repositories. The disposal concept consists of drilling a borehole into crystalline basement rocks to a depth of 5 km, emplacement of canisters containing solid waste in the lower 2 km, and plugging and sealing the upper 3 km of the borehole. Crystalline rocks such as granites are particularly attractive for borehole emplacement because of their low permeability and porosity at depth, and high mechanical strength to resist borehole deformation. In addition, high overburden pressures contribute to sealing of some of the fractures that provide transport pathways. We present geomechanical considerations during construction (e.g., borehole breakouts, disturbed rock zone development, and creep closure), relevant to both the smaller-diameter characterization borehole (8.5”) and the larger-diameter field test borehole (17”).\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",
